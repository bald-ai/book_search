The Greyling\nbrothers stopped in front of the door, hesitated. Pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop,\npop.\nThe elder brother, Gill, looked at his little brother, as if trying to emulate\ntheir commander’s sledge-gaze. Gavin hated it when Gill did that, but he\nquit popping his knuckles.\n“We gain nothing by waiting,” Gill said. “Put that fist to use.”\nIt was early morning. The White usually didn’t emerge from her\nchambers for at least another two hours. With her declining health, the\nBlackguard were doing all they could to make the old woman’s last months\neasy.\n“How come it’s always me who—” Gavin asked. At nineteen, Gill was\ntwo years older, but they were the same rank, and they’d been elevated to\nfull Blackguard status at the same time.\n“If you make her miss it because you’re arguing with me…” Gill let the\nthreat hang. “Fist,” he said. It was an order.\nScowling, Gavin Greyling knocked on the door. After waiting the\ncustomary five seconds, he opened the door. The brothers stepped inside.\nThe White wasn’t in her bed. She and her room slave were praying,\nprostrate on the floor despite their age, facing the rising sun through the\nopen doors to the balcony. Cold wind blew in around the two old women.\n“High Mistress,” Gill said. “Your pardon. There’s something you must\nsee.”\nShe looked at them, recognizing them immediately. Some of the nobles\nand luxlords didn’t treat the youngest of the full Blackguards seriously. It\nwas a judgment that cut because it was partly deserved. Gavin knew that\neven a year ago, he wouldn’t have been promoted to full Blackguard at\nseventeen. But the White never treated him like he was beneath anyone. He\nwould gladly die for her, even if someone told him that she’d die the next\nday of old age.\nShe broke off her prayers, and they helped her into her wheeled chair,\nbut when the old room slave waddled over to close the balcony doors on\nbad hips, Gill stopped her.\n“She needs to look from the balcony, caleen,” Gavin said.\nGavin wrapped the White in her blankets gently but efficiently.

They’d\nlearned exactly how much delicacy her pride would stand, and how much\npain her body could. He pushed her out onto the balcony. She didn’t\ncomplain that she could do it herself. She would have, not long ago.\n“In the bay,” Gill said.\nLittle Jasper Bay was resplendent below them. Today was the Feast of\nLight and Darkness, the equinox, and it was turning into one of those\nautumn days one hopes for: the air chilly, but the sky blindingly blue, the\nwaters calm instead of their normal chop. The bay itself was conspicuously\nunderpopulated. The fleet was still gone to fight the Color Prince at Ru and\nstop his advance. Gavin should have been there. Instead, he and three others\nhad been sent back by skimmer on the eve of battle to report the fleet’s\ndisposition and plans.\nSurely by now, the battle had taken place, and all that remained was to\nwait to hear whether they should rejoice in their victory or brace for a war\nthat would tear the Seven Satrapies apart. Thus the White’s prayers, Gavin\nsupposed. Can you pray about the outcome of an event after the fact? Do\nthey do anything then?\nDo they do anything, ever?\nThe White waited silently, staring at the bay. Staring at nothing, Gavin\nwas afraid. Had they interrupted her too late? But the White trusted them;\nshe asked nothing, simply waited as the minutes stretched out.\nAnd then, finally, a shape came around the bend of Big Jasper. At first, it\nwas hard to get a sense of the size of the thing. It surfaced a hundred paces\nfrom the high walls ringing the entirety of Big Jasper, which were lined\nwith people jostling one another to see. The sea demon was visible at first\nonly by the wake it left, plowing waters to the left and the right.\nAs the sea demon came closer, it sped up. Its cruciform mouth, half\nopen, swallowing the seas with its ring-shaped maw and jetting them out\nthrough its gills along the whole of its body, now opened full. With each big\ngulping pulse, its mouth opening wide now, water splashed out to the sides\nand back in great fans every fifty or so paces, then as the massive muscles\ncontracted, the water behind it hissed with churned air and water.\nThe sea demon was approaching the seawall that protected West Bay.\nOne galley was making a run for a gap in the seawall, trying to get out.\nWith how fast the sea demon moved, the captain couldn’t have known it\nwas precisely the wrong direction to go.\n“The poor fool,” Gill muttered.\n“Depends on if this is a coincidence or an attack,” the White said, eerily\ncalm. “If it gets inside the seawall, they might be the only ones to escape.”\nThe galley slaves lifted their oars out of the water as one, trying to make\nas little disturbance on the seas as possible. Sea demons were territorial, but\nnot predators.\nThe sea demon passed the galley and kept going. Gavin Greyling\nexpelled a relieved breath and heard the others do the same. But then the\nsea demon dove, disappearing in a sudden cloud of mist."

But then the\nsea demon dove, disappearing in a sudden cloud of mist.\nWhen it reappeared, it was red-hot. The waters were boiling around it. It\nveered out to sea.\nThere was nothing they could do. The sea demon went out to sea, then it\ndoubled back, accelerating. It aimed directly at the prow of the galley, as if\nit wanted the head-to-head collision with this challenger.\nSomeone swore under their breath.\nThe sea demon rammed the galley with tremendous speed. Several\nsailors flew off the deck: some into the sea, one flying until he crunched\nagainst the sea demon’s knobby, spiky head.\nFor an instant it looked like the ship would somehow hold together, and\nthen the prow crumpled. Wood exploded in shards to every side. The masts\nsnapped.\nThe entire galley—the half of it that was left—was pushed backward,\nten paces, twenty, thirty, slapping huge fans of spray into the air. The sea\ndemon’s forward progress was only briefly slowed. Then the galley was\npushed down into the waves as that great hammerhead rose even higher out\nof the water and kept pushing. Abruptly, the ship’s fire-hardened wood hull\nshattered like a clay pot thrown against a wall.\nThe sea demon dove, and attached to that great spiky head by a hundred\nlines, the wreckage was dragged down with it.\nA hundred paces away, a huge bubble of air surfaced as the last of the\ndecks gave way underwater. But the ship never rose. Flotsam was all that\nremained, and not nearly as much of that as one would expect. The ship was\nsimply gone. Perhaps half a dozen men out of a crew of hundreds were\nflailing in the waves. Most of them couldn’t swim. Gavin Greyling had\nlearned to swim as part of his Blackguard training, and that most sailors\ncouldn’t had always struck him as insanity.\n“There,” Gill said, pointing. “You can see the trail of bubbles.”\nThe sea demon hadn’t gotten trapped inside the seawall, thank Orholam.\nBut what it seemed to be heading for was worse.\n“High Mistress,” a voice broke in behind them. It was Luxlord Carver\nBlack, the man responsible for all the mundane details of running the\nChromeria that didn’t fall under the White’s purview. He was a tall balding\nman in Ilytian hose and doublet, with olive skin. What remained of his long\ndark hair was streaked liberally with white. Gavin hadn’t noticed him. A\nBlackguard, and he hadn’t noticed. “Your pardon, I knocked but got no\nresponse. The beast has been circling the Jaspers, five times now. I’ve given\norders for the guns on Cannon Island not to fire unless it attacked. They\nwant to know if they should consider this an attack.” The defense of Little\nJasper was technically in his portfolio, but Luxlord Black was a cautious\nadministrator, and he liked to avoid blame wherever possible.\nWhat could a cannonball do against such a beast?\n“Tell them to wait,” she said.\n“You heard her!” the Black bellowed, cupping a hand adorned with"

        "text": "What could a cannonball do against such a beast?\n“Tell them to wait,” she said.\n“You heard her!” the Black bellowed, cupping a hand adorned with\nmany rings to his mouth. There was a secretary on the roof, one floor above\nthe White’s balcony, holding a polished mirror a pace wide, leaning out\nover the edge to listen.\n“Yes, High Lord!” The man hurried to flash the signal, and a younger\nwoman replaced him at the edge, trying to listen without appearing to be\nlistening to the wrong things.\nThe sea demon was now hugging the coast, swimming through waters\nso shallow its back was visible. It rammed through the portmaster’s dock\nwithout even appearing to notice it. Then it reached the far northern tip of\nBig Jasper.\n“Oh shit.” The thought was everyone’s, but the voice was the White’s.\nThe White? Cursing? Gavin Greyling hadn’t thought she even knew curses.\nThe people on the Lily’s Stem had lost sight of the beast as it had come\nin close to Big Jasper, and the sea demon was bearing down on the bridge\nbefore any of them could react.\nThe bridge floated at exactly the height of the waves. Without supports,\nthe yellow and blue luxin formed a lattice that looked green. It had\nwithstood battering seas for hundreds of years, the chromaturgy required to\nmake such a thing now beyond perhaps even Gavin Guile himself. More\nthan once it had served as a wavebreak for ships trapped outside the\nseawalls during storms and had saved hundreds of lives. The sea demon’s\nfirst, incidental contact with the bridge rocked the entire structure. It threw\nhundreds of people off their feet.\nThe vast shape slid along the smooth luxin for ten, twenty paces, then\nslowed, seeming confused by the contact. Its confusion lasted only an\ninstant, though, as fresh billows of steam rose around it. The sea demon’s\nhead plunged into the waves and it sped out to sea, its vast tail slapping the\nwater beside the Lily’s Stem and sending geysers over almost the whole\nlength.\nThen, out at sea, it turned back again.\n“Tell Cannon Island to fire!” the White shouted.\nCannon Island sat in the bay on the opposite side of the Lily’s Stem. The\nlikelihood of the gunners there making the shot was remote.\nBut a slim chance at distraction was better than none.\nThe first culverin fired immediately; the men must have been waiting for\nthe order. The shot was at least a thousand paces, though. They missed by at\nleast a hundred. The island’s other five guns facing the right way each spoke\nin turn, the sound of their fire lagging behind the bright flash of it, the roar\nreaching the tower at about the same time they saw the splash. Each missed.\nThe closest splash was more than fifty paces off target. None deterred the\nsea demon.\nThe crews began reloading with the speed and efficiency that could be\nonly imparted with relentless training. But they wouldn’t get off another\nvolley in time. The sea demon was simply too fast.\nThe Lily’s Stem had become chaos. A team of horses had fallen,\npanicked, and turned sideways with their cart within the confines of the\nbridge itself, blocking all but a trickle of men and women from getting out\nonto Big Jasper. People were climbing over and under the flailing, biting\nhorses."

People were climbing over and under the flailing, biting\nhorses.\nA stampede flowed out of the other side of the bridge, people falling,\nbeing trampled. Some few would make it in time.\n“Carver,” the White said, her voice clipped. “Go now and organize care\nfor the dead and wounded. You’re faster than I, and I need to see how this\nends.”\nLuxlord Black was out the door before she was done speaking.\nFour hundred paces out. Three hundred.\nThe White reached a hand out, as if she could ward off the sea demon by\nwill alone. She was whispering prayers urgently under her breath.\nTwo hundred paces. One hundred.\nA second dark shape suddenly streaked under the bridge from the\nopposite side, and a colossal collision with the sea demon sent jets of water\na hundred feet into the air. The sea demon was launched into the air, bent\nsideways. A black shape, massive itself but dwarfed by the sea demon, had\nhit it from below. Both crashed back into the water, not twenty paces from\nthe Lily’s Stem.\nThe sea demon’s superior mass carried its body all the way into the\nbridge itself, shooting a wall of water at the tube and over it. The whole\nedifice was rocked by the force of the wave—but not shattered.\nIn a spray of water and expelled breath, flukes and a black tail surfaced.\nThat tail smashed down on the sea demon’s body, and then the whale darted\ninto Little Jasper Bay. Out, away from the bridge.\n“A whale,” the White breathed. “Was that…”\n“A sperm whale, High Mistress,” Gill said. He’d loved stories of the\nsea’s pugilists. “A black giant. At least thirty paces long, head like a\nbattering ram. I’ve never heard of one that big.”\n“There haven’t been sperm whales in the Cerulean Sea for—”\n“Four hundred years. Since the Everdark Gates closed. Though some\npersisted for another hundred or—Your pardon,” Gill said.\nShe didn’t notice. They were all too engrossed. The sea demon was\nobviously stunned. Its red-hot body had turned blue and sunk beneath the\nwaves, but even as the sea calmed from the aftershocks of the collision,\nthey could see the red glow begin again. The waters hissed.\nA swell of that big body underneath the waves, and it turned and began\nto move—chasing after the whale.\nThe White said, “That kind of whale is supposed to be quite aggress—”\nFour hundred paces out from shore, another eruption of water as the two\nleviathans collided again.\nSperm whales had been the only natural enemies of sea demons in the\nCerulean Sea. But the sea demons had killed them all, long ago.\nSupposedly.\nThey watched, and again the giants collided, this time farther out. They\nwatched, in silence, while the rescue operations below worked to clear the\nLily’s Stem.\n“I thought those whales were usually… blue?” the White asked Gill, not\nturning from the sea.\n“Dark blue or gray. There are mentions of white ones, possibly\nmythical.”\n“This one looked black, did it not? Or is that my failing eyes?”"

Or is that my failing eyes?”\nThe brothers looked at each other.\n“Black,” Gill said.\n“Definitely black,” Gavin said.\n“Bilhah,” the White said, addressing her room slave by name for the first\ntime that Gavin remembered. “What day is today?”\n“’Tis the Feast of Light and Darkness, Mistress. The day when light and\ndark war over who will own the sky.”\nThe White still didn’t turn. Quietly, she said, “And on this equinox,\nwhen we know the light must die, when there is no victory possible, we’re\nsaved—not by a white whale, but by a black one.”\nThe others nodded sagely, and Gavin felt like a significant moment was\npassing him by. He looked from one to another. “Well?” he asked. “What\ndoes it mean?”\nGill slapped the back of his head. “Well, that’s the question, ain’t it?”\nChapter 2\nGavin Guile’s palms bled a warm, thick gray around the slick oar in his\nhands. He’d thought he had respectable calluses for a man who worked\nmainly with words, but nothing prepared you for ten hours a day on the oar.\n“Strap!” Number Seven said, raising his voice for the foreman. “More\nbandages for His Holiness.”\nThat elicited a few pale grins, but the galley slaves didn’t slow. The big\ncalfskin drums were thumping out a cetaceous pulse. It was a pace the\nexperienced men could maintain all day, though with difficulty. Each bench\nheld three men, and two could keep this pace for long enough to allow their\noarmate to drink or eat or use the bucket.\nStrap came over with a roll of cloth. She motioned for Gavin to present\nhis hands. Strap was the burliest woman he had ever seen, and he’d known\nevery female Blackguard for twenty years. He pulled his bloody claws off\nthe oars. He couldn’t open or close his fingers, and it wasn’t even noon yet.\nThey would row until dark; five more hours, this time of year. She unrolled\nthe cloth. It seemed crusty.\nGavin supposed there were worse things to worry about than infection.\nBut as she wrapped his hands with efficient motions, albeit without\ngentleness, he smelled something vibrant, resin overlaid with something\nlike cloves, and heard the tiny shivering splintering of breaking superviolet\nluxin.\nFor a moment, the old Gavin was back, his mind reaching for how he\ncould take advantage of their foolishness. It was difficult to draft directly\nfrom luxin breaking down, but difficult was nothing for Gavin Guile. He\nwas the Prism; there was nothing he couldn’t—\nThere was nothing he could do. Not now. Now, he was blind to colors.\nHe couldn’t draft anything. In the threadbare light of the slowly swinging\nlanterns, the world swam in shades of gray.\nStrap finished tying the knots at the back of his hands and growled.\nGavin took that as his sign and lifted weary arms back to the oar.\n“F-f-fights infection,” said one of his oarmates, Number Eight, but some"

Gavin had no idea why. There was a loose\ncommunity here with their own slang and inside jokes, and he wasn’t part\nof it. “Down here in the belly, infection’ll kill you quick as a kick.”\nSuperviolet luxin fighting infection? The Chromeria didn’t teach that,\nbut that didn’t make it wrong. Or maybe it was simply a new discovery\nsince the war and no one had told him. But his thoughts were drawn instead\nto his brother, Dazen, who had slashed his own chest open. How had Dazen\nnot succumbed to infection down in the hell Gavin had made him?\nHad the madness that had convinced Gavin he had to kill his imprisoned\nbrother not been madness at all, but only a fever?\nToo late now. He remembered again the blood and brains blowing out of\nDazen’s skull, painting the wall of his cell after Gavin had shot him.\nGavin put his bandaged hands back on the well-worn oar, the grip\nlacquered with sweat and blood and the oil of many hands.\n“Back straight, Six,” Number Eight said. “The lumbago’ll kill ya if you\ndo it all with your back.” Now, that many words with no cursing was just a\nmiracle.\nEight had somehow adopted Gavin. Gavin knew it wasn’t pure charity\nthat led the wiry Angari to help him. Gavin was the third man on their oar.\nThe less work Gavin did, the more Seven and Eight would have to do to\nkeep time, and Captain Gunner wasn’t taking it easy on the speed. He\nwasn’t keen on staying close to the site of the fall of Ru.\nIn another week, the Chromeria would have pirate hunters out:\nprivateers given writs to hunt the slave takers who’d swept in upon the\nwrecks of the invasion fleet, saving men in order to press-gang them.\nThey’d look to ransom those who had relatives with means, but many\nwould doubtless head straight back to the great slave yards of Ilyta, where\nthey could offload their human cargo with impunity. Others would seek out\nnearer slave markets, where unscrupulous officials would forge the\ndocuments saying these slaves were taken legally in far distant ports. Many\na slave would lose his tongue so he couldn’t tell the tale.\nThis is what I led my people to, Karris. Slavery and death.\nGavin had killed a god, and still lost the battle. When the bane had risen\nfrom the depths, it had smashed the Chromeria’s fleet, their hopes thrown\noverboard like so much jetsam.\nIf I had been declared promachos, it wouldn’t have happened.\nThe truth was, Gavin shouldn’t have only killed his brother; he should\nhave killed his father, too. Even up to the end, if he’d helped Kip stab\nAndross Guile instead of trying to separate them, Andross would be dead,\nand Gavin would be in his wife’s arms right now.\n“You ever think that you weren’t hard enough?” Gavin asked Seven.\nThe man rowed three big sweeps before he finally answered. “You know\nwhat they call me?”"

Because you’re seat number\nseven?” As six was the number of man, so was seven Orholam’s number.\n“That ain’t why.”\nFriendly sort. “Why then?”\n“You don’t get answers to your questions because you don’t wait for\n’em,” Orholam said.\n“I’ve done my share of waiting, old man,” Gavin said.\nTwo more long sweeps, and Orholam said, “No. To all three. That’s\nthree times no. Some men pay attention when things come in threes.”\nNot me. Go to hell, Orholam. And the one you’re named after, too.\nGavin grimaced against the familiar agony of rowing and settled back\ninto the tempo, sweep and stretch and brace against the footboard and pull.\nThe Bitter Cob had a hundred and fifty rowers, eighty men in this deck and\nseventy above. Openings between decks allowed the sounds of drums and\nshouted orders to pass between the upper and lower galley decks.\nBut not only sound passed between the upper and lower decks. Gavin\nhad thought his sense of smell was deadened after a few days, but there\nalways seemed some new scent to assail him. The Angari fancied\nthemselves a clean people, and maybe they were—Gavin hadn’t seen any\nsigns of dysentery or sweating sickness among the galley slaves, and each\nnight, buckets made the rounds of the slaves, the first full of soapy water for\nthem to slop on themselves and the second full of clean seawater to rinse.\nWhatever slopped free, of course, dribbled down on the slaves in the lower\nhold and, dirtied further, into the bilge. The decks were always slippery, the\nhold hot and damp, the sweat constant, the portholes providing inadequate\nventilation unless the wind was high, the dribbles of liquid from the deck\nabove that dripped onto Gavin’s head and back suspiciously malodorous.\nFootsteps pattered down the stairs, the light step of a veteran sailor.\nFingers snapped near Gavin, but he didn’t even look over. He was a slave\nnow; he needed to act the part or be beaten for his insolence. But he didn’t\nneed to cower. On the other hand, he did still need to row, and that took all\nhis strength.\nStrap took Gavin’s hands off the oar, unlocked the manacles, whistled to\nNumber Two. Numbers One and Two were at the top of the fluid slave\nhierarchy, allowed to sit up front and rest, trusted to run errands without\nchains on, and only required to row when another slave got sick or fainted\nfrom exhaustion.\nAfter Strap manacled his hands behind his back, Gavin looked at\nCaptain Gunner, who was standing at the top of the stairs out of the hold.\nGunner was Ilytian, with midnight black skin, a wild curly beard, a fine\nbrocaded doublet worn open over his naked torso, loose sailor’s pants. He\nhad the handsome intensity of madmen and prophets. He talked to himself."

He admitted no equal on heaven or earth—and in the\nfiring of guns of any size, he was justified in that. Not long ago, Gunner had\nbeen jumping off a ship Gavin had lit on fire and poked full of holes. Gavin\nhad spared Gunner’s life on a whim.\nThe good you do is what kills you.\n“Come on up, little Guile,” Captain Gunner said. “I’m running out of\nreasons to keep you alive.”\nChapter 3\nKip’s palms bled vibrant crimson around the slick oar in his hands. His\npalms had blistered. The blisters had filled with colorless plasma. The\ntender skin beneath had torn. Blood had swirled into the plasma like red\nluxin. Chafed ceaselessly against the oar, the blisters broke, bled. He shifted\nhis grip. New blisters formed, colorless. Filled with crimson. Burst.\nHe didn’t see the color, though. Couldn’t see anything. He could only\nimagine the colors waiting for him as soon as he shed the blindfold Zymun\nhad put on him to keep him from drafting. Zymun, the polychrome who’d\nfollowed the Color Prince. Zymun, who’d tried to kill Kip in Rekton, and\ntried to assassinate Gavin at Garriston. Zymun, who held a pistol pointed at\nKip’s head even now. Zymun, his half brother.\nZymun, whom he would kill.\n“What are you smiling about?” Zymun asked.\nThe rowboat bobbed and lurched on the waves as it had for the last two\ndays. Without the use of his eyes, Kip couldn’t thread his way through the\nchaos of the waves, rowing at the right time, pausing when appropriate.\nFrom time to time, he’d pull on one oar and feel it slip free of the water.\nHe’d flounder until Zymun barked a direction. Two days they’d been doing\nthis. Two agonizing days.\nThe blindfold was overkill the first day: Kip’s eyes had swollen shut.\nDuring the battle he’d accidentally hit himself, and then Zymun had\npunched him in the face. He had a dozen small cuts on the left side of his\nface and down his left arm from when the merlon of the green bane had\nbeen hit by a cannonball and exploded into shrapnel. Andross Guile had\nstabbed him in the shoulder and gashed him along his ribs.\nIf it hadn’t been for his Blackguard training for the last months and the\nfact he had a gun leveled at his head, Kip wouldn’t have been able to move.\nAs it was, the unfamiliar exercise reduced his muscles to quivering\nclumsiness. His back was agony. The fronts of his legs, kept constantly\nflexed as he tried to keep his balance in the bobbing boat, were murder. His\narms and shoulders were somehow worse. And his hands!

It hurt to tighten, it hurt to loosen, it hurt to\nleave it alone.\nKip was fat and frightened and finished.\n“More to port,” Zymun said, bored. He didn’t think enough of Kip to\npursue why Kip had smiled. He was too canny to come close at a slight\nprovocation, and the waves were too heavy today for him to risk putting\nhimself off balance for a momentary pleasure.\nHe’d never offered to take a turn at the oars.\nThe only thing that kept Kip going was fear. It was exhausting to be\nafraid for two days straight, and it was starting to make Kip a bit furious.\nBut what can I do? I’m blind and reduced to such weakness I couldn’t\nwin a fight with a kitten, muscles sure to clamp or collapse at any move I\nmake. Zymun has set the field. He has the cards: six colors and a gun.\nBut as soon as Kip saw it as a game of Nine Kings, his terror eased. He\nimagined analyzing the game with the patience of a blue. Could Zymun be\nnearly as frightening an opponent as Andross Guile? No. But if you have a\nterrible hand you can still lose to a bad opponent.\nZymun could kill Kip at any moment, easily and without fear of justice\nor repercussions, because no one would ever know.\nYes, yes, we’ve established that, but so what?\nKip’s best card was Zymun’s laziness. Zymun knew they needed to row\nor they could fall prey to pirates and be enslaved. Zymun didn’t want to row\nhimself, so Kip was safe until he irritated Zymun enough to overcome his\nlaziness, or until Zymun didn’t need him any longer.\nZymun had great cards, but a great card that you never play is a\nworthless card.\nZymun had a ludicrously inflated opinion of himself—he’d already\nspoken at length about all the things he would do once he reached the\nChromeria. Kip didn’t appear in those stories, which told Kip all he needed\nto know about his own future. But Zymun’s inflated opinion of himself\nmeant he had a proportionally deflated opinion of others. Kip acted beaten,\nand Zymun believed it. Of course he was superior. Of course Kip would be\ndevastated by that fact and realize that he was helpless.\n“I really expected the sharks to get you at Garriston,” Kip said,\nthreading a grudging admiration through his tone.\nZymun wasn’t an idiot, despite his arrogance. Once the sun went down,\nhe lost his luxin advantage. Then he only had three cards: the pistol, Kip’s\ninjuries, and that his own muscles weren’t devastated from a dozen hours of\ngrueling labor. Anytime Kip had turned over last night in his sleep as he lay\nin the front of their little boat, under the bench, Zymun had woken instantly,\nthe flintlock already cocked and pointed at him.\nKip’s odds of getting accidentally shot if Zymun twitched in his sleep\nwere depressingly high."

After a silence, he said, “I\nexpected that waterfall to get you back at Rekton.”\nPeeved, Kip the Lip almost brought up their next meeting—in the rebel\ncamp, when Zymun hadn’t recognized him. But taunting a man with a\ndozen sure ways to kill you wasn’t the height of good sense.\n“Guess we’ve something else in common then,” Kip said. “Hard to kill.”\nHe shouldn’t have bothered trying to draw them together with some illusory\ncommon bonds. Zymun was pure reptile. Kip thought the boy must try to\nhide it most of the time. With Kip, he didn’t. Another sign of how Kip’s\ntime was limited.\n“We’re the blood of Guile,” Zymun said. “But you’ll forever be a\nbastard. I’ll prove myself to grandfather, and be an heir. The heir.”\nKip rowed. “You’re sure?” he asked. “About Karris being your mother?\nI never heard so much as a whisper.” He hated being blindfolded, having to\nsift Zymun’s tones of voice rather than look for the momentary grimaces or\ntwitches that might betray the truth.\n“She was betrothed to the Prism when they conceived me. That makes\nme legitimate, to most people. When he broke their betrothal, she went and\nstayed with relations.”\n“In Tyrea?” Kip asked. That was where he’d first seen Zymun, defying\nhis master, throwing fireballs at Kip, and forcing Kip to jump off the\nwaterfall.\n“Blood Forest. Little town called Apple Grove. I went to Tyrea later. It\nwas the only place to go to learn drafting that wasn’t the Chromeria.”\n“Grandfather’s idea?” Kip asked. It sounded like Andross Guile. Have\nthe boy educated, trained, and kept off the table. A perfect hidden card.\nWhile being honed into the perfect weapon, Zymun would also be kept\nfrom developing his own allies at the Chromeria. He would be perfect for\nAndross’s use against Gavin or the Spectrum, but he wouldn’t be a threat to\nAndross himself. The boy didn’t even realize how cynically Andross was\nusing him.\nGuess I’ve become a little cynical myself, to see it so clearly. Or maybe\nI’m only cynical where Andross Guile is concerned.\nRegardless, Zymun didn’t answer. Or perhaps he answered by nodding.\nIn two days, Zymun had never asked about Karris. He seemed to think\nher position on the Blackguard made her acceptable to have as a mother, but\nnot intrinsically powerful, and therefore not interesting. He saved his\nquestions to arm himself for his meeting with Andross Guile. Kip wished he\ncould be there to see that.\nThe next time Kip’s oar slipped off a wave, he coughed hard. He\nwheezed into his hand and pushed the blindfold up his nose fractionally.\nCoughing, even fake coughing, hurt like hell. He’d inhaled a lot of seawater"

        "text": "wheezed into his hand and pushed the blindfold up his nose fractionally.\nCoughing, even fake coughing, hurt like hell. He’d inhaled a lot of seawater\nafter he’d jumped into the Cerulean Sea to save Gavin Guile.\nHe’d once thought of himself as the turtle-bear, made with a special gift\nfor absorbing punishment. He was really going to have to come up with\nsome other special gift. This one was terrible.\nHe went back to rowing. Zymun had made him strip off his shirt, both so\nhe could see if Kip tried to pack luxin, and to keep himself warm. With the\ncloud cover and the autumn wind, it was chilly for much of the morning and\nevening. Rowing and sweating, Kip didn’t notice the lack so much.\nAt the end of each stroke, his head naturally tilting back, Kip took a tiny\nsip of blue under the blindfold. In the weak, gray, cloud-filtered light, the\nsea was soup, and his eyelashes and the blindfold blotted out most color,\nbut he didn’t need much. Couldn’t take much at once, or Zymun might see\nit. With only a little at a time, Kip’s skin was dark enough to camouflage the\nluxin as it traveled from his eyes, through his face hidden by the blindfold,\ndown his back, and was packed beneath the skin of his legs and butt, out of\nsight. Zymun had checked his scalp and the skin hidden by the blindfold a\nfew times, so an abundance of caution was in order.\nNow, certain that Kip wouldn’t draft, Zymun expected him to attack at\nnight, when his own powers were weakest. But as a full-spectrum\npolychrome, Kip knew weakness wasn’t measured in colors. There was no\ndifference between Zymun having a dozen sure ways to kill him and only\nhaving one, if time was limited enough. In fact, if Zymun could be more\neasily surprised because he had a dozen ways to kill Kip than if he’d had\nonly one, then those extra ways actually made him weaker.\nSome people think that you play Nine Kings against the man, not the\ncards. It sounds clever, but it’s rarely true.\nBy late afternoon, Kip had enough luxin. It took all of his concentration\nto row and push his pain aside and slowly thread the luxin up his back, up\nthe back of his neck, up into his scalp. To draft luxin, it had to be connected\nto blood. Most drafters chose to tear open the skin at their wrists or under\ntheir fingernails. After a while, scar tissue formed; the body adjusted. But\nyou didn’t have to push the luxin through a spot where you’d done it before,\nand Kip didn’t intend to. Every fraction of a second lost made death more\nlikely.\nThe sips of blue made it all seem so logical. Kip’s senses were acute,\nfiltering out the wind and his own heaving breath. He divined that Zymun\nwas seated facing him. Kip knew where the bench was, could tell that\nZymun was seated in the middle of it from how the rowboat sat even in the\nwater. He could hear Zymun shift from time to time, looking behind them\nor to shore."

He could hear Zymun shift from time to time, looking behind them\nor to shore.\nThe blue couldn’t mute sounds, though, only sift them. The irregular\nwind obliterated much of the information Kip could have used. Nor did blue\nmute all his body’s agony. Kip had husbanded his dwindling resources as\ncarefully as possible, acting slightly more exhausted than he was so that he\ncould grab a moment of rest between each oar stroke—balancing Zymun’s\nlaziness against his own life.\nIt had to be today. It had to be soon. He didn’t have much strength left.\nKip hunched, grunted in pain, and released the oars, faking a leg cramp.\nThe move was sudden enough it probably almost earned him a musket ball\nbetween the eyes. He massaged his leg with both hands, evaluating, testing,\nstretching not just his legs, but his hands and arms, too.\nThere was a sudden snort and a small cry.\nPlanting his legs wider than he had before, making them less helpful for\nrowing, but hopefully more helpful for a sudden leap, Kip settled back into\nhis place, groped blindly for the oars. He pretended he hadn’t noticed, but\nhe died a little.\nZymun must have just dozed off. Kip had woken his enemy. With blue\nsharpening his senses, if Kip had waited even a few moments…\nHe hadn’t. That was no use. Commander Ironfist had told them,\n‘Looking back doesn’t help. Dwell on your mistakes when you’re in safety.\nGet to safety first.’\n“If you think I’m going to help you, you’re insane,” Zymun said.\nKip groaned from the pain of moving his arms. He didn’t know if he\nwould have the strength even to lurch across the boat. He groped around\nblindly, missing the oars that he’d released. He said, “Longer I fumble\naround for the oars, the longer I get to rest.”\n“Right hand. Up and forward. Up more. Use the chain, stupid.”\nThe oar, held in its oar lock, bobbed and swayed with the action of the\nwaves. It smacked Kip’s fingernails. Kip grunted. He bent his wrist to reach\nthe manacle, and followed the chain to the oar. He hadn’t forgotten about it.\nBut it was better to look stupid.\nIt was better not to look like he was calculating exactly how long that\nchain was. Kip grabbed the oar. Then he repeated with his left hand, and he\nstarted rowing again.\n“More to port,” Zymun said, bored. “That’s it.”\nThere was only one way this could work. Kip had to knock Zymun into\nthe water and not fall in himself. Once Zymun fell in the water, his pistol\nwould be useless. He would only have time to throw one burst of something\nat Kip. Because all luxin had weight, that action—regardless of which color\nof luxin he chose to throw—would cause the reaction of pushing Zymun\ndeep under the waves."

Because all luxin had weight, that action—regardless of which color\nof luxin he chose to throw—would cause the reaction of pushing Zymun\ndeep under the waves.\nIf Zymun missed with that first strike, Kip had a chance. He would have\nto row like mad. When he was able to see how far from shore they were, he\ncould decide whether to risk going back and killing Zymun, or leaving him\nto his fate in the sea. After Zymun’s impossible escape through shark-filled\nwaters last time, Kip planned to kill him and be sure.\nIf Kip was too slow, though, he’d get shot. With no idea what direction\nto row, and as weak as he was, he would die. If he knocked them both into\nthe water, he would die. Zymun was the better swimmer even when Kip\nwas healthy.\nThere would be only one slim chance. Kip would be ready for it. His\neyes, shielded from the light under the blindfold, were naturally wide,\ndilated. He tried to narrow them consciously, a trick any experienced drafter\ncould do instantly. If he was dazzled by the light, he’d miss. If—\nZymun’s weight shifted. “Orholam,” he said.\nThe moment was on him so suddenly, Kip almost missed it.\n“A galley,” Zymun said. The blue luxin Kip was holding told him that\nZymun’s voice was muted by being turned to the side, looking. “I think it’s\npirates.”\nNow! Blue luxin tore through Kip’s skin at his temples. With fingers of\nblue luxin, he flipped the blindfold off his head—and leapt.\nChapter 4\n“I smell so much as a resiny fart, and I paints my deck chunky, little Guile.\nRed and gray and bony, you elucidate? I know luxinly smells,” Gunner said\nas he led him onto the deck of the Bitter Cob. “Or more like, I paint it all in\nbrown and squashy, right, right?”\nGavin walked into the light with a lead heart.\n“Right,” he said. Because he had feces for brains. Funny.\n“Luxinly? Luxic? Luxinic?” Gunner asked. The man loved language the\nway a wife beater loves his wife.\n“Luxiny, but I like your way better.”\n“Bah.”\nIt was close to noon, choppy seas tossing the light galley more than he\nexpected. These Angari ships were different. But what had been the most\nsalient fact of his whole life—the light—struck him as insignificant. It was\nan overcast day, but with lots of light for a Prism. But this light kissed his\nskin like a lingering lover leaving. The hues of gray and white and black\ngave him despair where before the scintillant spectra had given him\ninconceivable power. He’d thought he’d adjusted to the loss of his colors,\nbut it was one thing to face his loss in the darkness of a prison, another\nthing altogether to see that his prison was the whole world. And Gunner\nknew it. He had taken one look at Gavin’s eyes the night he’d captured him\nand he’d known.\nSo why is Gunner paranoid now?\nBecause he’s Gunner."

He had taken one look at Gavin’s eyes the night he’d captured him\nand he’d known.\nSo why is Gunner paranoid now?\nBecause he’s Gunner.\n“On yer knobbies,” Gunner said.\nGavin got on his knees, planting them wide on the deck so the rolling\nmotion wouldn’t knock him down. He couldn’t tell if the stretching hurt\ngood or hurt bad, but as long as he didn’t lose his head or any other limb\nmore important to him, any break from the oars was a good thing.\nGunner looked at him. “What happened to Gavin Guile, levering the\nworld on the fulcrum of his wantings?”\nOn one level, this was the clearest thing Gunner had said to him yet, but\nGavin had told Gunner he wasn’t Gavin. It was probably one of the dumber\nthings he’d done in the last year, though there were a lot of contenders for\nthat crown. “He died.” That ought to work, regardless of which Gavin\nGunner meant.\n“Tragical. How?”\nThe trick to working with the insane was never to profess surprise. Nor\nto expect it. Opacity was a dagger Gavin could wield, too. “I ran out of\nmercies until I had only the musket-ball mercy left. Clickety-clack,\nclickety-clack. Boom boom. Meatsack mercy. Yellow cell red, liver made\ndead.”\nGunner folded his arms. He looked at Gavin like he was very puzzling.\n“You rave.”\n“I crave.”\n“You knave.”\n“I slave.”\n“I save.”\n“From waves?”\n“And you gave,” Gunner said. He gestured to his big white musket,\npropped against a doorframe some paces away.\nGavin stopped to let Gunner win. He did want to get a better look at that\nodd thing, but Gunner alternately wanted to show it off and looked paranoid\nthat someone was going to steal it. Gavin couldn’t pay too much attention to\nwhat Gunner treasured. Nor too little.\nGunner laughed, sealing his win, taking Gavin’s hesitation to be a\nconcession of defeat. They’d played this game before. Years and years ago\nnow. If Gavin weren’t utterly in the man’s power, and Gunner utterly\ninsane, Gavin thought he might like him. Gunner said, “I don’t take men\nwho’ve been in Ceres’s bosom too sincere. Them watery kisses make men\ncrazy, and ain’t no Guile started out overmuch sane. Tell it straight as\nshooting. Are you Dazen Guile, back from the dead? You tell me this, and\nnot half the tale.”\nWhich didn’t mean what the words meant. Gunner’s patience was\nshorter than his fuses. So Gavin gave it in brief: “Never died. Captured my\nbrother at Sundered Rock, and took his place. His friends looked better than\nmine, so I took my brother’s clothes, and I took his place. But not a month\nback, I decided my imprisoned brother had gone frothing mad, and I killed\nhim.”\nIt was so simple to say the words. Gavin had thought it would be\nimpossible to tell the truth he’d worked so hard to hide for so long. But he\nfelt nothing. He should feel something, shouldn’t he?"

He should feel something, shouldn’t he?\n“The sea she sends me mysteries to invigorate,” Gunner said.\nGavin was sure, this time, that Gunner had used the wrong word on\npurpose. “You’re quite an invigorator. No wonder you’re Ceres’s favorite.”\nGunner spat into the water, but Gavin could tell he was pleased. “You’re\nDazen? Straight bullseye?”\n“I been shootin’ in the dark so long I ain’t sure what I am, now. I was\nDazen, though. Straight shootin’.” Gavin wasn’t sure why he did that,\ndropping into patter when he spoke with others who did so. He’d always\ndone it, though, copying accents and odd phrasing when he spent too long\nin any one place.\n“You say this because you know Gunner worked for Dazen,” Gunner\nsaid. “You’re lying. Hoping to edge with me.”\nHoping to edge?—oh, hoping to gain an edge. “Sure. And before I killed\nmy brother, he told me your birth name was Uluch Assan. You were so very\nimportant to him, those were his last words.”\nGunner’s eyes glittered dangerously. “Not impossible for a Prism to\nlearn an old name.”\n“Before you agreed to work for me—me Dazen—all those years ago,\nyou told me lies about how you killed that sea demon as we sat in the\nslaves’ quarters drinking that foul peach liquor. And when you professed to\nbelieve that there was no such thing as superviolet luxin, we played a little\ngame with a feather to quell your doubts.”\nA worried look crossed the pirate captain’s face. “Took Gunner three\nshots to hit that damned dancing feather. Was an eagle feather, though, not\nquail.”\nThere was no point correcting him, so Gavin continued, “I feared I’d\nmade you so furious that you wouldn’t work for me. I let you hit it… on the\nsixth shot, ya damned liar.”\nGunner went rigid. Shit. The man told lies to aggrandize himself so\noften, he might think that his version was the truth. Not the battle to pick,\nGavin. Gunner strode away suddenly, heading to midship.\nGavin stayed where he was, on his aching knees. It was bad stretching\nnow, he was certain of it. The two sailors who’d accompanied him looked\nconfused as to what they were expected to do.\n“Free his grabbies!” Gunner shouted. He was rummaging in a barrel.\nThe sailors unlocked the manacles, but kept Gavin on his knees.\nGunner grabbed something from a barrel and threw it at Gavin. He\nbobbled it in his bandaged, stiff hands, and it bounced on the deck. A sailor\nfetched it and gave it back to him. A big, wrinkled apple.\n“Take him to the beakhead,” Gunner said. “Watch him close as\nAborneans groats. A Guile in a corner is a sea demon in your washtub.”\nHere I didn’t think you bathed.

        "text": "Aborneans groats. A Guile in a corner is a sea demon in your washtub.”\nHere I didn’t think you bathed. Gavin didn’t say it, though. There was\nlittle to be gained by mocking his captor, his master, and much else to be\nretained. Teeth, for instance.\nThe sailors pulled him to his feet and pulled to him to the prow. They\nturned him around, forced him to his knees again. Gunner was forty paces\naway, at the farthest point astern. He held a gleaming white musket. Or a\nmusket-sword? It had a single blade with twin black whorls crisscrossing up\nthe blade, bracketing shining jewels. The blade had a small musket inset in\nmuch of the spine except for the last hand’s breadth, which was pure blade.\nGavin had a dim recollection of the thing, but it slipped away from him.\nSomething about that night, and a clash with his father and Grinwoody and\nKip. He had suffered great violence before and lost hours of time to it, and\nhe’d certainly known men in the war who’d lost memories of injuries. But\nthere was something about Gunner fishing him out of the waves, and then\nbeating him with the flat of the blade? It could only be that. Gavin was still\nrecovering from his bruises, but he didn’t have any stab wounds or he\nprobably would be dead by now.\nStill, what a terrible idea. To make a musket barrel thick enough to deal\nwith the power of exploding powder was to make a weapon far too thick\nand heavy to be an effective sword. Was this some sort of odd jest?\n“If you’re Dazen, you’ll remember our little demonstration,” Gunner\nshouted.\nIt was, of course, the part of Dazen and Gavin’s meeting that Gavin\nGuile—the real Gavin Guile—would have heard about. ‘Recalling’ the\ndemonstration would prove nothing. But apparently Gunner didn’t realize\nthat.\n“The seas were calm that day, and you were only twenty paces back,”\nGavin said.\nThat day, the cabin boy had wet himself, holding an apple in his\ntrembling outstretched hand above his head. Later, Gavin had heard the\nstory that the boy had held the apple on his head. No one explained how a\nboy would balance an apple on his head on a rocking boat. But it did make\na better story.\nTwenty paces made a good story. Forty was suicide. Gunner might be\nthe best shot in the world. It didn’t matter. Even with an identical charge of\npowder, and wadding tamped down to exactly the same pressure, and a\nperfectly round musket ball with no flaws from its casting—even with no\nwind, and no lurching deck, a musket was only accurate to within a space\nmaybe as large as Gavin’s head at forty paces. Some men liked to believe\ndifferently, but the truth was that if you hit a smaller target at that range, it\nwas purely luck. Gavin knew how good of a shot Gunner was. He didn’t\nbelieve the man’s story of killing a sea demon, but if anyone in the world\ncould have done such a thing through accuracy alone, it would have been\nGunner.\nAnd there’s the problem with arrogance wed with excellence and"

Reality’s\nintrusions were unwelcome. Gunner had spent the last twenty years\nconvincing others that he was unable to miss; now he seemed to have\nconvinced himself, too.\n“Gunner got given a gooder gun than, than, than…” The pirate devolved\ninto curses, angry at not coming up with an alliterative way to say ‘than he\nhad twenty years ago.’\nIt wasn’t full-on rage, merely frustration, but Gavin had seen Gunner\nshoot a man because he was hungry. Gunner was going to go through with\nthis.\nGavin’s stomach sank. What could he do without drafting? Maybe\nknock out each of the two sailors next to him—and what? Jump off the\nship? There was no shore in sight. They’d simply turn around and pick him\nup. And trusting his body to be strong enough to take out these two sailors\nand jump before Gunner could shoot him was optimistic at best. He might\nnot even be able to swim with how much abuse his body had taken recently.\nHe was overcome with a weariness more than physical. This? This was\nto be his end?\nGavin had been in too many battles to believe that there was some force\nthat protected the men who should live. One of the greatest swordsmen in\nthe world had been killed next to him, while out of sight of the enemy—a\nfreak ricocheting bullet had caught his kidney. A stallion worth satrapies\nhad stumbled on a body after the battle was done, and broke his leg. A\ngeneral got dysentery because he’d shared his men’s water and meat, rather\nthan eat at his high table. A thousand indignities, a thousand tales that ended\nwithout moral or meaning, merely mortality.\nWar is cause, all else is effect.\nGavin took a bite of the apple. It was sweet and tart. The best apple he’d\ntasted in his entire life.\nPride, you wanted some little piece of me? Here. Take the whole fucking\nthing. Gavin spoke in his orator’s voice: “Captain Gunner, I don’t think\nanyone in the world can make this shot. You think you’re this good? I don’t.\nI think you’re better. You make this shot, and you’ll be a legend forever.\nYou miss it, and you’re just another pirate who talks big.” Gavin put the\napple in his mouth, held it in his teeth, and turned his head to the side,\ngiving Gunner only a profile view.\nAll activity on the deck stopped.\nSo I die with an apple in my mouth. My father would have some words\nabout this, no doubt. And Karris will be rightly furious.\nBecause he’d turned, Gavin couldn’t see how Gunner responded, if he\nwas furious or amused. Gavin couldn’t see any of the other sailors’\nreactions. He only saw gray sea and gray sky. The only light granted to him\nwas ugliness. He was only beginning to regret that he’d wasted his last\nwords taunting a pirate when something wet splattered across his face."

There was that momentary delay, when\nyou’re hurt badly and you’re not sure what’s happened. Was he dead? That\nflash perhaps the spark of his cranium exploding? He didn’t hear the musket\nbark, but that happened sometimes.\nCheers erupted around the deck. The apple was gone.\nOne of the sailors picked up a few chunks from the deck. He fit them\nback together. Held them up. He shouted, “Cap’n Gunner cored it perfect!”\nGunner seemed oblivious to the cheers. He set the white gun-sword\nacross his shoulder and swaggered over to Gavin. That swagger scared\nGavin more than Gunner’s normal insanity. It meant Gunner was surprised\nhe’d made the shot, too. Orholam’s balls. “Not one man in the world could\nmake that shot,” Gunner announced. “Cap’n Gunner made that shot!”\n“Cap’n Gunner!” the crew roared.\nGunner stood over Gavin, triumphant. He twisted a bit of his ratty beard\nand chewed on it. “Manacles!” he barked to the sailors beside Gavin.\nThey slapped Gavin in chains once more, but he was barely aware of it.\nThank Orholam, if he’d gotten himself killed Karris would never have\nforgiven him. In fact, when he got free, this was going to be one story he\nwouldn’t be telling her.\nGunner laid the musket-sword across his palms. Showing it off, now, so\nGavin supposed it was safe—advisable even—to show appreciation. The\nblade was a thing of beauty, covered with some kind of white lacquer,\nGavin guessed, and adorned with gems so large they had to be semi-\nprecious stones. Gavin was no expert at swordsmithing, but it looked like a\nparade piece rather than a warrior’s tool. The gems appeared to go all the\nway through the blade—weakening the structure—and painting the blade\nwhite with black whorls? You’d have to keep an artisan on hand to repaint it\nconstantly. A single cutout in the blade gave a hand rest to steady the gun\nwhen firing, weakening the blade further. But Gavin saw no frizzen, no pan,\nno hammer, no way to balance the butt to achieve any sort of accuracy or to\nabsorb the kick. Was this a jest? It was too thin to be a credible musket\nanyway.\n“I don’t even load it,” Gunner said. He knew that Dazen had shared his\nappreciation for masterwork firearms. “It makes its own bullets, and they’re\nmore accurate than—well, you saw. Trigger pops down here when it’s\nloaded.”\n“How… how?” Gavin asked. It was an impossibility, of course. But he’d\njust had an apple shot out of his mouth at forty paces on the deck of a\nrolling ship. He found himself quite credulous at the moment.\nGunner grabbed the pommel, twisted, pulled it back.

He grinned like a first-year discipulus who’d gotten\naway with a prank.\nAnd there it was again, that hint that the crazy was at least half for show.\nGunner had spoken without a hitch. It made sense immediately, once Gavin\nthought about it. Gunner was eccentric. He’d always chosen words wrong.\nBeing thought eccentric or stupid would mean being the target of ridicule\namong the hard men he led, so instead he had to be absolutely crazy. Men\nget nervous around insanity, wonder if it’s catching, and keep their distance.\nPerfect for a new captain who not only wanted to continue being a captain,\nbut wanted to become a legend.\n“How accurate?” Gavin said.\n“Hit a scrogger at four hundred paces. Ball don’t wobble. It’s better\nmagic than all the magic you once called yours, Giggly Guile.” Gunner\nlifted the musket to his shoulder and tracked a seagull on the wing two\nhundred paces out. He fired, just as it swooped lower—and missed.\n“’Course, she still won’t do it all for you. Makes me respect her the more.\nShe demands excellence, like the sea.”\nGavin hadn’t watched the shot, though. He was studying the musket.\nThere appeared to be knobs and small dials in the space revealed by the\nextended stock, marked with tiny runes. That Gunner didn’t call attention to\nthem made Gavin believe that the pirate hadn’t yet figured out what they\ndid.\n“May I?” Gavin said.\nGunner looked at him. He laughed. “Former Prism though you be,\nGunner’s no fool enough to put magic in your hands.” He spat into the sea,\nthen took a rag and began cleaning the black powder residue off the blade.\n“Have to hold her real careful. Dangerous as Ceres, this one.” He sank into\nthought, and Gavin wondered if he’d been brought onto deck simply for\nGunner to show off.\nNot that he minded. Any rest from the oars was rest. Of course, he’d\nrather not have muskets discharged in his general direction while he was\nresting, but beggars and choosers and all that.\n“What ransom should I ask for you?” Gunner asked.\nAh, so he brought me up to talk? And couldn’t help but shoot at my\nhead, though he had a ransom in mind? Maybe the madness wasn’t all for\nshow. “My father believes me dead. Hell, Gunner, I believed me dead.” And\nlike that the memory was back, hot and sharp: Grinwoody crashing into\nthem, two blades and four men, and Gavin had seen that there was no way\nto save Kip from the tangle of hands and odd angles—except to divert the\nblade into his own chest.\nWhatever possessed me? Oh, Karris, did I do it just to do one thing that\nmight make you proud of me?\nBut thoughts of Karris were too painful.

It was one\nthing to wonder if your father cares more about gold or status than he does\nabout you. Every son of every rich and powerful man must fear that, but\nthat his father would kill him for a dagger? His own father?\n“The boy,” Gavin said. “Where is he?”\n“Threw him overboard for Ceres. As thanks. Ceres and me is square\nnow.” Gunner grinned unpleasantly. “How much, little Guile? Five hells,\nwhat do I call you? Dazen? Feels like talking to a ghost.”\n“You can call me Gavin. It’s easier. You can ask any ransom you like.\nThe more ridiculous, the better. He’ll stall you until he can get spies to\nconfirm you have me. Truth is, he’ll botch it so that you kill me and he can\nhunt you down afterward. He’ll make it look like you’re bloodthirsty and he\nhad no blame in making you kill me. He doesn’t want me, Gunner.”\nGunner grinned like he liked a challenge, and the mask was back. “So’s\nlong as he wants you as much as a pants pox, why should Gunner keep you\nresting tidy next to his own joyful jewels?”\nOops. But Gavin’s golden tongue was already moving. “If you kill me,\nhe can give up his pretense that he wants to ransom me. That means he\nwon’t load up a treasure ship in the first place. He’ll just bring the\nwarships.”\nGunner scowled. He jumped up on the gunwale, squatted, one hand\nholding on to a rigging line, thinking. “You’re being turrable helpful.”\nGunner spat in the ocean again. “Funny thing about the Angari. Feed their\ngalley slaves like they’re freemen. You seen? Treat ’em real good. The best\nslaves on the crew get taken in to port, fed real food, even taked to a bosom\nhouse. They lose a man every so often doing that, but it makes the whole\ncrew work hard. Feeding ’em good makes ’em strong. Cuts what cargo you\ncan carry since ya has to carry so much food. But this little here galley can\ngo two or three times as fast as most anything on the Cerulean Sea. A few\ngalleasses could chase me down if the wind was right, but if I have room, I\ncan cut against the wind and leave ’em behind. They shot the Everdark\nGates in this ship. She’s light as a cork and fast as a swallow. Perfect ship\nfor a pirate, if you can snatch up enough cargoes. Beautiful little ship. And\nonly the four swivel guns and one long tom. This is the best galley with the\nbest crew on the whole sea—” Gunner dropped his voice to a whisper.\n“And I hate her. One cannon! One. I should demand Pash Vecchio’s great\nship, what’s her name?”\n“The Gargantua?” Gavin asked.\n“That’s it!”\n“That might be difficult—”\n“Your father’s the Red. He’s richer than Orholam. You’re the Prism.\nThey’d revirginize old whores to get you back.”"

Before the battle at Ru Harbor.”\nIn a moment, Gunner had drawn a pistol from his belt, cocked it, stuck it\nover the hollow of Gavin’s right eye. A killing rage lit his eyes. Whatever\npart of his madness was for show, this part wasn’t that. With difficulty, he\nuncocked the pistol. “This prisoner is exuberical,” Gunner said. “Put him\nback on his oar until he works it off.”\nChapter 5\nTeia and some of the Blackguards finished their morning calisthenics on the\nWanderer’s rear castle as the sun climbed the horizon. She and Cruxer and\nfive of the other top inductees were the only ones from their Blackguard\ntrainee class on this ship. The others were on another ship with the other\nhalf of the remaining full Blackguards. Though they were constantly\nreminded that they hadn’t taken full vows and were thus not full\nBlackguards yet, that didn’t mean the Blackguards watered down the\nnunks’ exercises. Cruxer had followed their example manfully, and they had\nfollowed Cruxer’s as well as they could, muddling through complicated\nforms they’d seen but had not yet learned.\nCommander Ironfist, leading them, took no notice of the stragglers. The\nlegendary warrior had always been a cipher, but for the past week he’d been\neven more intense than usual. Teia didn’t know if the exercises (and their\nhorrible butchery of them) was another pedagogical technique, or if the\nleader of the Blackguard simply didn’t see them. Regardless, the\ncommander scrubbed his scalp with a wet cloth, cooling off. He had a\nstubble of wiry hair on his head now. He’d stopped shaving it bald and\nanointing it with oil after the Battle of Ru, more specifically, after the\nMiracle Shot—a prayer and six thousand paces and a direct hit on a\nnewborn god. He glanced at the rising sun, its disk not yet fully clear of the\nhorizon, glowered, and wrapped his ghotra around his head and headed\ndown the steep steps to midships.\nWorking the soreness out of an ankle she’d twisted when she’d stumbled\non a rope—er, line, on a ship, apparently—during an unfamiliar form, Teia\nwalked over to the gunwale where Kip and Gavin Guile had plunged into\nthe sea a week ago.\n“Hard to believe, isn’t it?” Cruxer asked, coming up beside her at the\nrailing. Little Daelos, the shade to Cruxer’s sunshine, came with him.\nCruxer could have been talking about a hundred things. Hard to believe\nthat they’d fought in a battle? That they’d lost? That they’d fought a real\ngod? Hard to believe that Gavin Guile was dead? But he wasn’t talking\nabout any of those, and Teia knew it. “Impossible,” she said flatly.\n“How are you doing with it?” he asked.\nHer elbows resting on the railing, she turned and looked at him,"

Sometimes Cruxer could be the most excellent human being\nshe’d ever met. Other times, he was a moron. “It’s a lie, Cruxer. It’s all\nlies.”\n“But the Red wouldn’t lie,” Cruxer said weakly. Maybe it wasn’t his\nfault. Cruxer had grown up with good people in authority over him, and he\nwas scrupulously moral himself, so he didn’t have the reflexive disrespect\nand suspicion toward those in power a slave girl did.\n“Go on, Teia,” Daelos said. “You know that Breaker blamed Andross\nGuile for trying to block him from joining the Blackguard. And we know\nBreaker got drunk that night. With how rash he always was, I don’t see\nwhat’s so hard—”\n“Is,” Teia interjected.\n“What?” Daelos asked.\n“How dare you give up on Kip. Go away, the both of you. I’m sick of\nyou.”\nDaelos rolled his eyes like she was being an unreasonable woman. It\nmade her want to show him what she would do if she were actually\nunreasonable. On the other hand, Cruxer simply paled. He pushed back\nfrom the railing. Teia knew he’d only come over to check up on her, like a\ngood commander does. But good intentions don’t cover everything. They\nleft without saying a word.\nYou’re being rude and unfair and you should apologize, T.\nBut she didn’t.\nAndross Guile said he’d mocked Kip that night, as he always did. He\nhad no love for the boy, he’d admitted. Perhaps he shouldn’t have said\nanything in the aftermath of a battle. But how was he to know Kip was\ndrunk? He’d never imagined Kip would attack him.\nGavin Guile and Andross’s slave had tried to intervene. Kip had stabbed\nGavin accidentally, and when Gavin Guile fell overboard, Kip had been so\ndistraught, he jumped in after him.\nAnd there the matter rested. Watch Captain Karris White Oak—or was it\nWatch Captain Guile now that she’d married Gavin?—had gone insane,\nshouting that they must be wrong, that Andross was lying. Teia thought the\nwoman was going to attack Andross physically until Commander Ironfist\nhad intervened and literally carried Karris off the deck. She’d not emerged\nsince.\nNo one else contradicted the Red. There had been more than a few tense\nconversations between Commander Ironfist and the Blackguards who had\nbeen assigned to protect Gavin that night. The Prism had ordered the men to\nbed, and who would have thought he would be in danger on the very night\nhe’d proven his heroism once again? He’d killed a god!\nNo, Teia had tried to say, Kip did that.\nIt seemed somehow small to set the record straight with the Prism lost,\nand they looked at her like she was spitting on his grave. The man had been\nadored, and everyone remaining in the fleet had proven their loyalty to him\nthat very day by fighting at his side."

The man had been\nadored, and everyone remaining in the fleet had proven their loyalty to him\nthat very day by fighting at his side.\nThat didn’t lessen the burden of guilt on the Blackguards. They’d failed.\nThey were coming home, while their charge was dead. It was a blot they\nwould never erase.\nThe murmur of voices below her chased out any further thoughts. Teia\nglanced around at the sailors. Mostly men, the sailors were careful to be\ndiscreet about their ogling of the female Blackguards—or had grown\ncareful since Essel had broken one’s nose—but they still did it. But they\ndidn’t ogle Teia. Hipless, breastless, short, and with short hair, when she\nwasn’t invisible, the most Teia could aspire to was being a mascot taken\nunder the rough men’s wings. Nine out of ten of whom she could beat to a\npulp, but they didn’t know that. Right now, though, she was thankful to be\nignored.\nThe cabin right below her was Andross Guile’s. She’d been\neavesdropping here every chance she got for the past week. She\ninterspersed her spying with clambering up the rigging and taking pointers\nfrom the sailors, learning a bit of their work. She’d also pretended to pray\nhere, sitting very still. She’d pretended to mourn, too. This was where Kip\nhad jumped or been pushed into the sea. The pretense at tears had turned to\nreal tears, once. She’d liked Kip more than she’d thought.\nAs she was sitting on deck, Commander Ironfist approached her. She\nmoved to get up, but he motioned for her to stay in place.\nHe stood with her for a long minute, and she would have appreciated his\nsilent companionship if she hadn’t been worried that he would figure out\nexactly why she’d chosen this spot.\nFinally, he said, “Kip—Breaker—asked me to make sure your\nmanumission papers go through. And I will. You know you’re one of the\nbest inductees. You know the Blackguard is hurting for good people. But\nit’s your choice. When I was your age, I took an oath because I was\nexpected to, not because I wanted to or thought it was right. I won’t do that\nto you, Teia.”\nAnd then he left.\nShe folded her legs and thought about taking her manumission—and\nwhat? Going home? Getting married to a shopkeeper? Learning a trade?\nWhat trade? It was too strange, too much of a leap after what she’d been\nexperiencing in the last months. She put it off to think about later, and\nstrained to hear Andross Guile’s voice. At first, he’d never had his window\nopen, but in the last few days it had been open every time. In the mornings\nwere her best chances to hear anything at all. Once the wind kicked up, it\nwas impossible. But so far she’d heard nothing in seven days. Mostly it had\nbeen innocuous orders to his room slave, Grinwoody, the old Parian whom\nit seemed Andross Guile trusted deeply.\nBut it was another wasted day. Teia heard little.

Andross and Grinwoody\nhad worked together so long that their speech was lacunic, full of\nunderstood ellipses.\n“Any evidence he’s not deluding himself?”\n“None. Of course, when we get evidence, it will be too late for one of\nus.”\n“And too late for us, either way. Damn,” Andross said. His voice was\nlouder. He was standing at the porthole. “It was that close, Grinwoody. Its\nhilt almost in my hands.”\n“It was my failure, my lord.”\n“No, you saved my life, again.”\n“My strength is not that which once it was, my lord. I allowed myself to\nbe surprised.”\nTeia scowled and drew her gray inductee’s cloak close about her for\nwarmth. Grinwoody allowed himself to be surprised? By Kip? So Kip had\nattacked them? Was it possible? Kip wouldn’t have done something so\nfoolish, would he?\nYes, of course he would. But attempt murder? No, not Kip. He might\nlash out to hurt, but not to cripple, not to kill, and she’d seen him furious.\n“Look on the bright side, my lord. You won’t be Freed this year.”\nGrinwoody’s tone was whimsical, but it chilled Teia. Was Andross Guile\nplanning on breaking the halo? Why would Grinwoody announce it so\nblithely?\nA hand emerged from the porthole and a homing pigeon sprang into the\nair in a rush of feathers, startling Teia, but no one appeared to pay attention\neither to her surprise or to the bird—there had been many of the latter sent\nin the last few days.\nThen the voices faded as Andross closed the porthole. Teia wanted to get\nup and leave immediately, but she was well aware that she was sitting on\nthe deck immediately above Andross’s room. Even with her slight weight,\nthe wood might groan from her weight shifting. She waited a few more\nminutes, pretending to meditate. Kip had been her training partner. He’d\ngambled something—she still didn’t know what—to win her papers from\nAndross Guile. And then he’d promptly tried to free her. He’d listened to\nher when they’d talked about strategy, made her feel like she, a slave, might\nhave something smart to contribute for the first time in her life.\nTeia realized her fist was closed over the little vial of olive oil she wore,\nsqueezing it in a death grip. She loosened her fingers from the symbol of\nher slavery. The gift had been a threat and a reminder from Aglaia Crassos:\nolive oil, ostensibly to ease her work in the slave brothels. Olive oil, to keep\nher alive through thirty to fifty men a day. Whenever Teia thought she didn’t\nhave any strength left, she touched that little reminder of slavery. Of what\ncould be. Of what Kip had promised to put behind her, forever.\nIn the short months they’d trained together, Kip had become more than\njust her partner, he’d become her best friend."

The survivors didn’t want to dwell on what could have so\neasily happened to them, too.\nIf he’d made it until dawn, he’d probably been picked up by a slaver.\nAfter how much Kip had drafted the day before, he’d be lightsick even if he\nwasn’t otherwise injured. He’d even left his spectacles case in his bunk.\nHe’d be helpless.\nIf Kip was even alive, he was probably chained to an oar, right now.\nAnd there was nothing Teia or anyone else could do for him.\nChapter 6\nZymun was standing, shading his eyes with one hand, the heavy pistol\npointed straight down at the deck. Kip launched himself forward, popping\nthe oars up through the open oarlocks. The sudden slap of an oar against the\nwater attracted Zymun’s attention first. He looked toward the sound instead\nof toward Kip.\nKip’s arms were too weak to throw in front of him with the full weight\nof the oars in them. But he didn’t care about making it pretty. His hands\ndropped and he threw his shoulder into Zymun’s side. He caught the smaller\nyoung man at elbow level, crushing his gun hand back down, and as both of\nthem were rising at the moment of impact, Kip’s big frame said, ‘Here’s all\nmy momentum, brother. A gift.’\nZymun popped up into the air. His ankles hit the gunwale and he flipped\nupside down in a most gratifying manner. As the splash resounded, some\ndistance from the boat, Kip fell. He smacked his cheek on the deck. With\nhis arms behind him, anchored by the weight of the oars, there was no\ncatching himself.\nBut he fell into the boat, and that was all that mattered.\nWith strength he didn’t know he had, Kip levered himself upright. He\nwas already drawing in blue luxin, and in the rush of pleasure at drafting\nand at seeing his tormentor splashing in the water, he almost missed it: the\nboat was ringed with luxin. Red luxin and yellow. There was a long leash to\nall that luxin attached to Zymun.\nZymun surfaced and Kip saw the mouth of the pistol in his hand loom\nlarge. It was pointed straight at Kip. The hammer snapped down on the\nfrizzen as Zymun pulled the trigger. And nothing happened. The gun was\nwaterlogged. Zymun disappeared behind a wave.\nHurriedly drafting blue blades in each hand, Kip slashed through the\ngreen luxin manacles holding his wrists onto the oars.\nZymun swept a hand in a big, splashing circle.

Instead of\ndrafting to cut himself free of the boat, why hadn’t he drafted to cut\nZymun’s leash?\nStupid, Kip, stupid.\nHe was still underwater, kicking and putting as much room as possible\nbetween himself and Zymun, when it felt like a sea demon slapped the sea.\nKip surfaced and saw a rising tower of black smoke and red-orange flames\nwhere the boat had been. He couldn’t see Zymun; the boat was between\nthem.\nZymun would be the better swimmer, even if Kip had been hale and\nwhole. There would be no vengeance for Kip today. If Zymun saw him,\nZymun would come after him. If Zymun came after him, Zymun would\ndrown him.\nKip bobbed in the water for a few more moments. He couldn’t swim.\nHis arms were lead weights, and though his legs weren’t yet dead, they\nwould be soon. His fat would make him float if he didn’t panic, but floating\nwasn’t going to get him away from Zymun, much less the pirate galley. Kip\nlooked around for it, but from the water, he couldn’t see the ship.\nAnd it wasn’t going to have any problem finding them, not with the\nbonfire Zymun had made of their boat.\nOh. Simple.\nKip drew in as much blue as he could hold and drafted reeds around his\nhands. The reeds let water stream past his fingers, then he shot luxin\nthrough the reeds, pushing the water out. Like the kick of a musket, by\npushing water back, it pushed you forward. Kip drafted the reeds to brace\nunder his armpits, took a deep gulp of air, and pointed his head for shore.\nBest of all, Zymun had never seen it.\nHe moved far more slowly than Gavin Guile had when he’d fought the\nsea demon. Kip knew he was doing something wrong, but he didn’t know\nwhat. But the speed was still three or four times faster than he would have\nbeen able to swim. And soon, he realized his relative lack of speed was a\nblessing. He wasn’t cutting a wake in the water that would mark his\nlocation for the pirates.\nAn hour later—or maybe it only felt so long—Kip staggered onto shore.\nHe had to get to the cover of the trees. If he collapsed in sight of the galley\nand fell asleep, it would all be for nothing. So he walked, shoeless feet\nmaking the sun-bright sand squeak. The Atashian coast was littered with\nbeautiful beaches like this. Palm trees swayed silently. He made his way to\nthe shade and finally turned to look back for Zymun.\nThe burning boat was gone, sunk, even the black smoke dissipating.

Not Gunner’s galley.\nThey had stopped, though, and Kip saw men throwing a line into the\nwater on the far side of the boat.\nSo Zymun was alive. Kip’s heart sank. If Kip had been captured by\npirates—or even regular sailors—he would have been worried about being\npressed into slavery. He would have thought he only had the slimmest of\nchances. For Zymun, he had no such fears or hopes. Zymun would probably\nbe captain of that galley before the week was out.\nOrholam strike him. Orholam blind him. Orholam take the light from\nhim in life and in death.\nKip was safe, though, for the moment. He needed water. Then food.\nThen a way home. But nothing would stand in his way. These were trifles.\nHis life was a trifle. But his message was not. The men and women on the\nship that night had seen Gavin Guile plunge overboard after being run\nthrough with a sword. They had to believe him dead. Kip knew better, and\nonly Kip knew that Gunner had him.\nAnd should the gods themselves stand against him, Kip was going to get\nhis father back.\nChapter 7\nThe pistol was useless. Worse, Zymun had thrown it away in a fit of pique\nin the water. He floated, watching the pirate ship bear down on him. They\nthought they’d make him a slave, no doubt. They’d try, no doubt.\nHe couldn’t help but smile. There are so few real chances in life to kill\nwithout consequences.\nHe would have liked to have access to more colors, but blue would have\nto suffice. He packed the blue luxin into his shoulders and back where it\nwould be covered by the sleeves of his tunic. He wasn’t good at packing\nluxin. It was uncomfortable, and he never fully cleared his skin; he always\nretained a pale blue hue, like he was freezing to death. He could do a\nthousand things excellently, but hiding his excellence wasn’t one of them.\nThe burning rowboat finally had enough of its hull consumed that it\ndipped the last smoldering beam in the waves with a hiss. He hoped the\npirates wouldn’t wonder how a rowboat could produce so much smoke.\nMaybe they’d think he’d been carrying tar or black powder.\nAt least it looked like Kip was dead. Zymun had never heard or seen\nhim after the boat exploded, and he didn’t think the boy had gotten clear. He\nhimself had ducked under the water to avoid the force and shrapnel from\nthe blast. Sad to have lost his boat. He should have known Kip would try\nsomething. Slippery, and quicker than you’d think a blindfolded big kid\ncould move.\nIt didn’t matter. The pirates would scoop him out of the water, and\nwould have whether he’d been in the boat or not. He had only to wait.

This captain didn’t seem terribly belligerent. He hadn’t struck\nZymun, despite chances to do so.\n“I have a better idea,” Zymun said. “How about—” He shot a spike of\nblue luxin through the face of the man nearest him. The sharp luxin went\nstraight through the man’s aquiline nose and into his brain. Zymun spun\nwith the kick of having shot so much mass, using the spin to flick out\nanother blade of blue luxin. He lopped off the other man’s hand at the wrist.\nHe shot a blunt rock of blue luxin into that man’s chest, knocking him off\nhis feet. In an instant, Zymun had another seething spike spinning slowly in\nhis left hand, pointing it at the captain.\nHis actions, so sudden and swift, and so swiftly stopped, stunned the\nslavers. They didn’t react, and Zymun didn’t move. If he did, he’d spook\nthem. If the whole ship attacked him, he might be able to kill everyone, but\nhe couldn’t command this ship. He didn’t know how it worked. He took\nadvantage of the pause to replenish his luxin.\n“How about,” Zymun repeated, “I join your crew for a time? I’m a\npolychrome, Captain. This, this was me using one color. I can use six. You\ngive me the mate’s room, and I’ll fight with you for three months, or three\nbattles, whichever is first. My magic will make all the difference.

Then, when I’ve paid you in full, you\ntake me to Big Jasper and let me debark with the share of the treasure that\nyou think I’ve earned. You’ll still be the captain, and I won’t take a thing\nfrom you. We’ll part as friends.”\n“Or?” the captain asked. His hand was twitching toward the pistol in the\nbag at his belt.\n“Or I kill you and offer the same deal to your first mate. Maybe he’ll not\nbe so fast to leap to defend you, knowing that by doing nothing, he gets rich\nhimself.”\n“Barrick was a good man,” the captain said, looking at the dead man.\nThe other, handless, had already passed out from blood loss. He could still\nbe saved.\n“So you know,” Zymun said, ignoring that, “I’ll be the most important\nman in the Seven Satrapies soon, and I could use a man of your talents in\nthe future.”\nThe captain looked from Zymun to his mate, who was stony-faced. The\ncaptain dipped his fingers into a pouch and pulled out some tobacco. He\ntucked it under his lip. He stared at the man, still bleeding on the deck.\n“Rawl, bind him up.”\nThe mate, apparently named Rawl, did as he was bid. The captain still\nsaid nothing to Zymun.\nZymun let it sit, the captain’s death still spinning slowly in his hand.\nThe captain spit brown juice onto the deck. It landed in blood. He\nscowled. “Deal,” he said finally. “I got a few grudges you might help me\nwith. If you can help me take one pirate in particular, I’ll let you go after\none battle, on my honor as son of a slattern and a sailor.” He extended his\nhand, a bit gingerly. That flash of fear comforted Zymun to no end. A man\nwho feared him this much, having barely seen what Zymun could do,\nwouldn’t attempt treachery soon. Perfect.\n“Who’s this pirate?” Zymun asked.\n“Fancies himself a bit of a cannoneer. Calls himself Cap’n Gunner.”\nChapter 8\nWhen the Wanderer came in to the pier, Teia was already waiting at her spot\non the railing. In addition to the normal crush of sailors and longshoremen\nand merchants and fishermen and scattered noblemen, the piers of Big\nJasper were crammed full of small folk desperate to find out if their loved\nones had made it home.\nAt the same time, there was a crush of Ruthgari soldiers, loading ships\nto go join the fight that Teia and her friends were just returning from.\nThe ship’s passengers crowded around midships where the plank would\nbe lowered. Teia hopped up on the railing, one hand holding a rigging line\nto keep her balance. She stepped outside the railing, grabbed the hemp\nwebbing in both hands, and rolled down. It was a brief flash of joy that she\neven remembered how.

        "text": "since she’d started practicing with the Blackguard, there had been none.\nClinging to the webbing, Teia could already see their pier was lined with\npeople desperate to hear more news. Andross Guile’s flagship was the first\nof the mangled fleet to make it home. Word of the defeat had already\nreached the Jaspers by homing pigeon, but the people were hungry for\ndetails. The ship came to rest against the pier with a bump. A sailor\nbalanced next to Teia on the webbing grinned at her and hopped off first,\nrunning to secure the lines on massive cleats. Teia hopped off a moment\nlater, not able to jump quite so far with her short stature, and plunged into\nthe surging crowd of gossips, friends, and families, and food vendors and\nwine sellers eager to find those eager to cleanse their palates of hardtack\nand stale water.\nBeing swallowed by an uncaring crowd was an odd relief. Teia was\nshort enough that she disappeared. Her acrobatics and fighting teacher back\nin Abornea had been only a little taller than Teia, and she’d encouraged her\nto explore crowds, to get to know their moods, from the angry crowd\nstreaming out of a hippodrome after a horse race where their favorite had\nlost, to the eager crowd meeting the arriving dancers and menageries of\nexotic animals for the Odess Sun Day Festivals.\nThere was an awareness you could cultivate only in the claws of such a\nbeast. A thousand or ten thousand bodies might move, but you could only\nbe aware of perhaps a dozen immediately around you, especially if you\nwere small. And you had to be most aware of your own movement. There’s\na mesh point, a fuzzy line where your movement can be assertive, even\nrude, without being taken as aggressive. There was a timing: a momentary\nsharp annoyance could be ignored if you were gone by the time the person\nyou’d jostled hard turned to find you. Teia ducked and pushed and surged\nand slithered through the bodies, her form fluid, her mind submersed fully\nin her body.\nHer trainer, Magister Lillyfield, with a body like a young woman’s and\nher face craggy as the Red Cliffs, had even wanted to take Teia and her\nmaster’s daughter to experience a crowd in riot in the Darks, the wretchedly\npoor Angari ghetto that had persisted for centuries in Odess, but Teia’s\nmaster would never let her.\nThe familiar beauty of the Chromeria’s seven towers gleaming in the sun\nbrought no joy to Teia today. Teia had nowhere to be. Commander Ironfist\nhad said only to his Blackguards, “Take the day. Tomorrow, dawn at the\nfield, as usual.”\nA restless energy filled Teia. She needed to wander. It was good practice.\nThe better she knew the city, the easier her Blackguard training would be.\nBut today there was something she needed to do. She felt herself clutching\nat that damned vial again, using up a precious hand that could help her\nmaneuver through the crowd.\nToo much thinking, T.\nShe was just making it out of the docks area when a man bumped into\nher. She’d moved enough to merely brush past him. It could only be\ndeliberate."

It could only be\ndeliberate.\nBut he was gone, and there was something in her hand.\nTeia turned and, stationary, lost her momentum, lost her rhythm. The\ncrowd spit her out into the bazaar adjacent to the docks. She hadn’t even\nseen the man. Had seen a dark cloak, maybe a grayish tunic… Damn, it was\ngone. Like she was an amateur. She moved out of the stream of people and\nlooked at what was in her hand. A note.\nShe knew immediately she wasn’t going to like what was written there.\n“Teia, look in paryl. Now.”\nTeia’s formal lessons in her special color had been brief, but Magister\nMarta Martaens had pounded into her that seeing a woman’s pupils grow\nuntil the whites of her eyes disappeared was not merely disconcerting for\nothers, it was terrifying. That manipulation of the eyes was what had to be\ndone to see paryl, which sat on the spectrum as far below sub-red as sub-red\nwas below visible red. In the past, she’d dilated then constricted her pupils\nquickly, but it was tiring. Now Teia put on the darkened spectacles\nCommander Ironfist had given her and relaxed her eyes, farther, farther.\nThe first place she saw paryl was written across the chest of a broad-\nshouldered Chromeria guard. The words, shimmery, floating, lighter than\nair and delicate, glowed: “Bribed.”\nHer chest tightened. What? Why? She was suddenly passive, standing\nlike a mark, agape, like a new arrival to the Jaspers, gawking rather than\nmoving, working, planning.\n“Help you, miss?” the guard asked, noticing her gaze.\nTeia shook her head and ducked past him. She strode into the market\nwhere a herald standing on his small box looked at her. Floating above his\nhead was one word: “Ours.” Had he stared at her?\nWho were they? What were they doing? Why were they showing her\nthis? It obviously meant they had a paryl drafter. A skilled one. More skilled\nthan Teia, to make words that persisted. Or one very nearby, who was\nplacing these beacons mere moments before she arrived.\nOn a wall down an alley, the words: “This way, Teia.”\nShe froze.\nOn another wall: “We won’t hurt you.”\nOn another wall, there was a puff of released light as a man leaned a\nhand against a wall where the ephemeral words had been placed: “Only we\ncan—” the rest was gone, and even those tore and disappeared as the man\nshifted his hand, unseeing.\nTeia’s heart pounded. Breathe, Teia. This is how people go lunar. Seeing\nthings no one else sees, imagining conspiracies.\nBut madmen are mad because what they see isn’t there.\nTeia had only seen two other paryl drafters in her life. Magister\nMartaens, who’d given her a handful of lessons at her former owner Aglaia\nCrassos’s behest, and a man who stabbed paryl into a woman’s neck and\nleft her seizing to death."

Or at least\nthat she couldn’t do it. If Teia could learn to draft solid paryl, she could\ndefend against it, right? Perhaps these people could teach her.\nParalyzed, indecisive, passive and hating herself for it, Teia looked\ndown the alley. Paryl’s greatest strength was that no one could see it except\na handful of people in the world. If someone else could see their murders,\nthose assassins lost their greatest weapon.\nWhich made Teia a threat to their power. Teia had seen an assassination.\nPerhaps they feared she’d seen the assassin, too.\nSo, Teia, do you isolate yourself with a man you know has murdered an\ninnocent before, and who is threatened by your very existence?\nPutting the matter that way made what remained of Teia’s curiosity\nshrivel from a big succulent grape to a nasty little raisin. Teia hated raisins.\nLoved grapes. They weren’t the same thing at all, no matter what people\nsaid.\nIf the man had wanted to simply murder her, he could have done it\nalready. With his paryl messages, he’d proven that he could move nearby\nwithout her noticing him. So he wanted to get her alone first. Why?\nIt couldn’t be for something good. The man was a murderer. If your\nenemy wants it, don’t let him have it.\nShe ran.\nTeia got a few startled looks as she bolted, but she didn’t care. As long\nas no one shouted ‘Thief!’ no one was going to care much about a young\ngirl running. She hit the next busy intersection and slipped through the\ncrowd there as fast as humanly possible. She slid between a yoke of oxen\nand the cart piled high with hay they were pulling before the man driving\nthe team could even squawk. She ran along the lip of the little fountain at\nthe center of the intersection and dodged through the line gathered for the\nwater. She ran toward the next street, then stopped, backtracked a few\npaces, and dodged into an alley. She ran down that alley, nearly slipping on\nthe garbage and slops, turned the opposite way down the next street, and\nturned up the next alley.\nIt started misting rain. Teia hadn’t even noticed the clouds gathering.\nShe took off the dark spectacles, dropped her pack at her feet, flipped her\ncloak around so its muted blue side was out, put the pack back on, but in the\nfront, and pulled the cloak on over that. She pulled up the hood and joined\nthe streams of people hurrying in the rain. It was harder to modify your gait\nwhen you were rushing. Throwing your hips around to mimic a curvier\nwoman was easy for her at a walk, she could merely bring her steps\ntogether as if walking a rope. Doing that while half jogging as if to get out\nof the rain? She wasn’t that good."

She wasn’t that good.\nShe began rummaging through the pack as she walked. She hadn’t\nbrought much she could use for disguises to wear, but she did have a bright\nyellow shawl and a scarf. At the next intersection, she ducked into a\nmerchant’s stall as if using it to cut a corner into another alley. She dropped\nthe hood, pulled out a red scarf—or maybe it was green, the squad liked to\nplay its little jokes on each other, and knowing her problem with colors,\nnone of them would tell her straight.\nShe bound the scarf around her hair, and threw the shawl around her\nshoulders, tying it quickly. She ducked her chin and then walked back out\nthe way she had come, holding the cloak shut and using the bulk of her\npack on her front to make it look like she was pregnant. She put a hand on\nher belly to complement the disguise.\nTeia hated slow disguises. Hated not making a speedy exit. But so did\neveryone else, and that was why this kind of disguise could be so effective\nwhen fleeing. She walked right by a tall man in a gray cloak who cut\nthrough the shop and headed into the alley. Maybe it was a coincidence.\nMaybe he was just a man hurrying home in the rain.\nAfter two agonizing blocks at a slow deliberate place with a hand on her\nswollen belly but not too much waddle, Teia ran again—but not home. She\nran to the brewery where Marta Martaens had said she’d taken a room.\nThe brewery, the Maiden’s Kiss, was housed in a squat, square building.\nIt was whitewashed like almost all the buildings on Big Jasper, with a\ndomed roof. This one was a shocking pink, the wooden doors were plain\nexcept for a stylized maiden in profile, offering a kiss. There was no text.\nTeia knocked firmly on the door.\nAn apprentice opened the door, a young girl not past ten years. “Is this\nwhere Marta Martaens takes a room?” Teia asked.\nThe girl’s big brown eyes went bigger. She hesitated. “Can you wait\nhere? Back in two shakes of a lamb’s tail?”\nOdd one. And Teia didn’t like people acting odd when her life was on\nthe line. Her throat was still tight. But she moved that tension to her body,\nreadying herself for attack. She knew being aware but loose was faster, but\nthere was no way she could find that calm right now.\nShe looked around in the rain, measuring everyone, but there were few\npeople on the streets now, and the rain was coming down harder. Teia’s last\ntalk with Magister Martaens hadn’t gone well. The older woman thought\nthat even talking about the possibility of the paryl assassination would\ninvite all paryl drafters to be hunted down. And Teia had lost the magister’s\ntutorship briefly thereafter when Andross Guile had somehow gotten Aglaia\nCrassos to sign over Teia’s slave papers, and she hadn’t seen Magister\nMartaens since then.\nThe door opened again, and a wiry woman in an apron gestured Teia in."

Where’s your\nmanners, girl?”\nLittle Bel’s face fell. She bolted.\n“Weeper, she is,” the brewer said. She sighed. She wore a headscarf not\nunlike a man’s ghotra to hold back an impressively large crown of brown\nhair while she worked. And she was obviously working: her skin shiny with\nperspiration, the veins on her thready forearms popping out. “I got wort to\nwatch, so apologies for being abrupt, but what’s your name and what do\nyou want?”\n“Teia. Adrasteia. I came to see if my old magister Marta Martaens is\nhere.” Teia had pulled her own wet scarf off her head and shook out her\ncloak, revealing the pack over her stomach.\n“Huh, thought you six months on, and I figgered she’d have told me if\nthat was so,” the brewer said, nodding to Teia’s fake belly. “Marta’s gone.\nAnd you’re not the first to come asking for her. I’ll tell you what I told him,\nbecause it’s the truth. Good tenant. A bit tetchy, but a good woman. I don’t\nknow where she went. She lost her position at the Chromeria, and that was\nthe only reason she was here, so I din’t see nothing amiss in her leaving.”\nThe brewer walked to a counter and reached underneath it. “But I’ll also tell\nyou this. She left a note that I was only to give to a girl named Teia. Just so\nyou know, the man who came asking after her offered me money if I’d\ndetain you.”\nTeia was ready to fight. She shifted her gaze from the woman’s face to\nher midsection. Motion comes from the core, let your peripheral vision see\neverything else.\n“I didn’t take it. I’m not a savage, and there was something funny about\nhim. Red hair in a fringe, balding, odd necklace. Barely saw it, but my papa\nused to pull teeth. That necklace was all human teeth. Something nasty\nabout that I’d rather not know. Read your letter quick and go. I wouldn’t put\nit past him to be watching even now. Oh, and don’t fold the note. Marta was\nparticular about that. You can use the back exit if you want.”\nTo reach the back exit would require Teia to walk through an unfamiliar\nbuilding, away from the public, isolated and vulnerable. Maybe the woman\nwas being as helpful as she seemed. After all, she didn’t have to announce\nthat the man had been here. But Teia had been a slave too long. She\nwouldn’t put herself at anyone’s mercy.\nShe took the letter carefully and opened it slowly, keeping an eye on the\nbrewer.\n“You can burn it in the fire if you like,” the brewer said. “I got wort on.\nOrholam watch ya, girl.” The brewer turned her back and went back into\nthe shop."

I’ve learned of my\nbrother falling very ill, so I’m heading back to my family farm in Maelans.\nMy apologies for leaving so abruptly, but I’m sure our mistress will take\ncare of you. Orholam’s blessings on you.” That was all, it was signed with\nher name and carefully folded. So far as Teia knew, Marta Martaens didn’t\neven have a brother. She immediately widened her eyes full to paryl.\nFraying apart now that it was exposed, there was something written in\nparyl. No wonder Marta hadn’t wanted the letter folded. It would have\ndestroyed the secret message. “It’s all true. The killings, everything. The\nOrder of the Broken Eye is real, and now they’re after you. Orholam\nforgive me for leaving you alone in this, but there’s no fighting these\npeople. Run, Teia.—Marta Martaens.”\nChapter 9\nKarris Guile, born Karris White Oak, trudged up the steps from the top floor\nof the Prism’s Tower to the roof. She had come directly from the docks, and\nhad barely so much as thrown her bags onto the floor of her new room—\nGavin’s room—when his room slave Marissia had demurely handed Karris\nthe note. It was odd that the White should summon her to the roof in the\nrain.\nPoking her head out of the door, Karris saw the White tucked in many\nblankets, seated in her wheeled chair, turned to face the wind and the\nlashing rain. She was enjoying herself. Flanking her were two large young\nmen, Gill and Gavin Greyling. They, like Karris, were Blackguards, sworn\nto protect and defend the White and the Prism. The difference was that\nthese men had fulfilled their duty. Each was holding up a waxed fabric\nparasol—an umbrella—over the White to shield her from the rain. But the\nold woman seemed to be enjoying the way the wind whipped the rain into\nher face despite the Blackguards’ best efforts.\n“Watch Captain,” the brothers said, nodding to her in place of a salute,\ngiven that their hands were occupied.\n“You may go,” the White told them. “Please wait for me at the stairs.\nInside. Karris will guard me now.”\nGill gave Karris his umbrella, and the men retreated. Karris held it with\nboth hands, protecting the White as much as possible. The old woman had a\nchildlike glee on her face, though. Every drafter’s eyes took on the color\nthey used, but the pattern by which it did so was unique to each. Karris had\nred stars on a green field. Orea Pullawr’s light gray eyes had filled in two\narcs: blue on top, and green below. In recent years, as she’d stopped\ndrafting for so long to extend her own life, those colors had become washed\nout, desaturated.

That, Karris had expected. But the green was vibrant as\nwell, telling Karris that the White had been drafting green, too. She didn’t\nhave much time left.\n“I hoped it would bring the influences back into balance again,” the\nWhite said, “as green’s wildness so often balanced the ponderous logic of\nblue for me for so many years. I found after the attack, I was content to sit\nand watch and wait. It is no longer the time to sit and watch and wait, is it,\nchild?”\n“Please don’t leave me,” Karris said. Her stomach convulsed, but she\nheld the sob down. She took a deep breath, surprised. She thought she had\nmore control than that.\n“But that is the way of this world, is it not?” the White asked. “We go\nahead alone, or we stay behind bereft. All of my dear friends from my youth\nare dead already. Only my one old foe abides. I almost don’t know what I\nwould do without him.\n“Karris, it is in carrying heavier burdens than we think we can bear that\nwe become stronger. Are you ready?”\n“You cannot give up and die,” Karris said angrily. “You’re the best there\nis. No one can replace you.”\nUnexpectedly, the White chuckled. “Words every megalomaniac longs\nto hear. But true only of the truly bad and the monumentally great. I am\nneither, Karris. I am merely competent, my failures significant and sadly\nfrequent. That I am not bad perhaps makes me better than many a White\nbefore me, but the good and the great are two disparate camps that rarely\noverlap.”\nKarris sighed, not certain she could speak of Gavin without dissolving.\nShe looked away, unable to take the compassion in the White’s eyes. “I feel\nso betrayed.”\n“By Gavin? For dying?” The Chromeria didn’t say that, not yet, not with\nwhat Gavin had meant to everyone. And they didn’t know that he was dead.\nBut the White spoke of fear and anger, and such things weren’t bound by\nevidence and the blue virtues.\n“The Third Eye. She said if Gavin made it through the battle, that he\nwould live at least until the day before Sun Day. I thought… I thought we’d\nmade it. The battle was over, wasn’t it? I went to bed believing I’d be\nwakened with kisses.” Instead it was screams, and death. Kip had tried to\nkill Andross Guile, they said; Gavin had intervened, been wounded\naccidentally, fell overboard. Then Kip had jumped in after him. The ship\nhadn’t been able to find Kip or Gavin’s body in the darkness.\n“Even if she sees the truth infallibly, which I’m not convinced of, there’s\nnothing that says the Third Eye must say truthfully what she sees,” the\nWhite said. “Perhaps by lying to you, she helped the world avoid a greater\ntragedy.”\n“I believed her,” Karris said simply. She felt so empty. She was trapped.\nShe wanted to hold on to hope because she hadn’t actually seen him die,"

She was trapped.\nShe wanted to hold on to hope because she hadn’t actually seen him die,\nand because it felt like she was betraying him if she gave up on him. But on\nthe other side, she could see resignation reflected in every face. He was\ndead, and there was work to do. There was a terrifying power vacuum, and\nparties eager to fill it, and heretics to fight, and, and, and. She couldn’t\ngrieve until she knew. But she knew she might never know.\n“I heard there were portents here, too,” Karris said. “Something about a\nsea demon fighting a whale?”\n“Two weeks ago now. The very day of the battle.” She didn’t expand on\nit. She knew when Karris was trying to change the subject.\nThe rain lashed them. It was getting chilly.\n“I should take you inside,” Karris said. Avoid it. Put it away. Face it\nlater, alone.\n“No.” The White’s one word was a leash. She spoke and expected full\nobedience. “Let me see your eyes, girl.”\nKarris locked gazes with the old woman. Where once she had been\nproud of her eyes, now she was ashamed. She’d been proud of their beauty,\nruby stars blooming on an emerald field, the colors pure and bright and\npowerful. Now the stars dominated, and her eyes showed her as a woman\nwith only a few years left. A woman who lacked the self-control to make it\nto forty.\n“You’re to stop drafting. Entirely and immediately,” the White said.\nIt was like being told to stop breathing.\n“I know what I’m asking,” the White said. Of course she did: she’d done\nit herself. But that didn’t make it any easier for Karris. “And I’m not asking.\nIt’s an order.”\n“Yes, High Mistress,” Karris said stiffly. She’d thought that the White\nmight give her some sympathy for the death of her husband. Apparently\nthere was no softness to be had here. Karris’s jaw was clamped tight shut,\nbut she kept her face as blank as she could. “If I may be excused,” she said,\nand turned her back.\n“You may not,” the White said sharply.\nKarris stopped. She was a Blackguard; she knew all about hard\nobedience. She kept her back turned, mastering herself.\n“You married Gavin Guile, the Prism,” the White said. “You’re hereby\nrelieved of all your duties as a Blackguard. You will return your\ncommission, effective immediately.”\nKarris stopped breathing. Her knees weakened. A gust of wind tore the\numbrella from her limp fingers and threw it off the roof before she could so\nmuch as blink. She stood, accepting the rain’s stinging lash. Cold outside\nand in. All she was, since she’d put away that fool girl who’d enjoyed boys\nfighting over her, all she’d made of herself, was a Blackguard. She’d barely\nbeen allowed to try to get in to the elite unit, and she’d risen to watch\ncaptain, and found that there she was content.\nFor two days, she’d had everything: the man and the work she loved, a\nhard purpose and a way to accomplish it, surrounded by those she admired"

Sisters and new brothers to replace those who’d died in the fire in\nher youth. And then she’d lost Gavin, and thought nothing could get worse.\nAnd now the White—of all people, the White!—was kicking the last leg out\nfrom the stool.\n“I’m not sure why this is a shock,” the White said calmly. “A\nBlackguard, married to a Prism? You had to know that this would be the\nmost likely outcome. Were you so wrapped up in your passions that you\ndidn’t think at all?”\n“You said… you said that my case was the exception that proved the\nrule!” Karris said.\n“That was in allowing you to pursue your love and letting you resign\nhonorably, rather than expelling you in disgrace.”\n“What’s the difference?!” Karris shouted.\nGill Greyling poked his head out the door, and he and Gavin came\noutside, but stayed where they were at the White’s gesture. They stood\nimpassively in the rain, but Karris knew that stance, like a leashed hound,\nready to attack at a word.\n“One is shame, and one is honor, and if you can’t tell the difference, you\nhave greater problems than we can address,” the White said.\n“But, but, he’s gone! Dead! It’s a moot point. I… I thought that…”\nKarris had thought that the rules didn’t apply to Gavin, and that by\nmarrying him, he would stand up for her and the rules would bypass her this\nonce, too. She’d thought perhaps she deserved this slice of happiness, that\nin the end, Orholam had taken pity on her.\n“He’s lost. It’s not the same thing. Not yet, not for my purposes. Some\non the Spectrum will want to declare him dead immediately, of course, but\nwe will have other problems in naming a new Prism. But at the least a new\nPrism-elect must be named by Sun Day. We must find him before then.”\nShe turned back to the rain, enjoying its wetness on her face, seeming to\nhave dismissed Karris already.\n“That’s it?” Karris demanded. “Now that I’ve served my purpose, I’m to\nbe cast off?”\n“In this life, we are not garments which may be washed and worn again,\nKarris. We are candles, giving light and heat until we are consumed. You\nburned more brightly than most. It has a cost. Mediocrities like me? Dim\nflames burn longer.”\n“I’m not finished,” Karris said angrily.\n“Perhaps then you are not so delicate a flower as you have believed,” the\nWhite said.\nShe said nothing more, and didn’t look at Karris. Karris thought of\nstorming off, of swearing, of crying. Instead, she stood in the rain, letting it\ncool her anger, tame her wildness as it soaked her hair, pushing strands in\nfront of her eyes. It took her two tries to speak. “For the longest time, I was\njust going to let it go, but… Why did you send me—me—to infiltrate Rask\nGaradul’s army?”\n“Back in Tyrea?”"

I had\nno idea. You sent me into a situation with no warning. I was captured.\nCould have been killed.”\nThe White’s eyes weighed Karris. “Have you ever picked up a weapon\nin the middle of battle? Perhaps after you’d lost your own?”\n“A musket once, in Garriston. When I tried to use it, it didn’t fire.”\n“Mm. It happens.” The White said no more.\n“Me? I was a weapon you picked up? Not knowing how I’d serve? That\nis… that’s horseshit. You know me! I’m hardly an unknown for you. And\nhardly a battlefield necessity. You could have sent any of the Blackguard,\nand any of a hundred other soldiers or slaves. Half of them could have done\nas well as I.”\n“My purpose wasn’t to win a fight; it was to test a weapon.”\n“What?” Karris demanded.\n“You’ve many strengths, Karris Guile, but you return to the same ones\nover and over again. You’re afraid to stretch yourself. I’d given you chances\nto accomplish other tasks that could easily have been done through a bit of\nflattery or bribery, and you always took the direct path, relying on authority\nand hierarchy. But then, when I would prepare myself to cut you loose,\nyou’d do something brilliant that showed me you were capable of thinking\nfor yourself. You simply like to have others give the orders. So I put you in\na situation where there was a vital task, but no direction on how to\naccomplish it. I knew you might die, and I’d have carried your death\nheavily for misjudging you. Instead you passed, and now I’ve gained\nsomething even better than me trusting you.”\nKarris scowled. “And that is?”\n“You trust yourself. A little more, at least.”\nKarris shook her head. “Then why take me out of my position? I\nunderstand Andross Guile wanting to take away something I love, but you?\nWhy wouldn’t you fight for me?” And there it was again, the hot tears\nthreatening. Her throat tightened.\nThe White blinked, and her face transformed in a moment with an\nintensity that breathed fresh youth into her face. “You listen to me, Karris\nGuile. I will never stop fighting for you!” She sat back, and looked abruptly\nold once more. “I grow cold in this rain. Take me inside. But before we go,\nI have a new assignment for you, Karris Guile. One befitting your new\nstatus.”\n“My new status? As a widow? As a former Blackguard?”\n“As a woman with no work and ample time on her hands.”\nIt was a slap in the face. Karris’s anger flared. “Am I to knit sweaters\nand darn socks, High Lady?”\n“I’ve lost my mobility. It makes it far too easy to track with whom I\nmeet.

        "text": "meet. You, Karris, are to manage my spies.”\nChapter 10\nTeia didn’t cross the Lily’s Stem to the Chromeria until she saw a group of\nyoung Blackguards heading back. They were from her ship. Had she really\nbeen gone so short a time that the other nunks were only reaching the\nbridge now? She checked the alleys again, and despite the rain, put on her\ndarkened spectacles again for a moment. She opened her eyes wide, wider,\nuntil her eyes were all pupil. She looked left and right and deeper into the\nintersection. She looked behind herself, deeper into the alley, searching for\nany sign of paryl, or of the assassin. Nothing.\nShe grabbed her spectacles and tucked them into a pocket and hurried\ninto the main stream of traffic ever flowing across the bridge, past the\nChromeria’s guards, standing in mirrored armor in the usually empty sentry\nboxes. The war. The war was real now, and they were prepared for an\nattack. Here. Surreal.\n“Is it true?” one of the guards asked the Blackguards. “Is the Prism\ndead?”\n“Lost,” one of them said.\n“Lost? What? Like he’s a penny? Lost at sea ain’t just lost. I heard you\ncombed the shores for days, looking for him. Ain’t you lot supposed to keep\nhim from being lost?”\nOne of the Blackguard nunks, Ferkudi, snarled and leapt at the guard.\nBut the others pulled him back and toward the tower.\n“You lot let our Prism die!” the guard shouted. “What good are you if\nyou let a Prism drown on your watch? None of you even jumped after\nhim?”\nFerkudi cursed, and Cruxer got right in the guard’s face. He said\nsomething Teia couldn’t hear, but made no move. The guard said nothing\nmore, but he had tears streaking down his face.\nThese people loved Gavin. They barely knew him, and they weep.\nNo, maybe that wasn’t right. They didn’t know him personally, but\nGavin had been everywhere visible for longer than Teia had been alive. And\nhe’d been a good Prism. The rumors had to be flying everywhere on the\nJaspers, with the official word being so pitifully incomplete—not a position\nat all, really. ‘Lost.’\n‘Lost.’ Not a word you want to toss around lightly at the beginning of a\nwar whose two battles had both been… setbacks for the Chromeria.\nGavin had been nigh unto a god to these people, and they’d lost two\nbattles despite having him fight on their side. How would they do without\nhim?\nIt had been a question the Blackguards had been asking themselves for\ndays. And their failure had not passed their notice, either.\nTeia said nothing, though, and walked past with her head down.\nDespite that the Lily’s Stem was covered in a dome of blue and yellow\nluxin, translucent and insanely strong, Teia walked for twenty or thirty\npaces before she took off her hood. The tide was rising, and the wind was\ncausing whitecaps. The Lily’s Stem crossed the waterline, so now the waves\nwere smashing against the bridge, which didn’t so much as shudder. It was\na symbol of the Chromeria itself. All the tumult and the roar of the world"

All the tumult and the roar of the world\ncrested and smashed against it, and it stood, unchanged, unmoved,\nimpervious.\nIt was always eerie, though, walking through the light-tunnel, watching\nbursts of water flare high over your head, sometimes crashing all the way\nover the tube. There had been attempts to blow the bridge before with\nbarrels of black powder. At least three attempts had been stopped. One\nwagon had made it, the Tellari separatist inside bleeding, dying from his\nwounds even as he maniacally set fire to his cargo.\nThe explosion, confined to the tube, had blasted out both sides like a\nmusket firing two directions. Dozens had died, and yet the bridge held.\nAhhana the Dextrous had been the superchromat yellow drafter who’d been\nthe lead drafter creating the bridge, more than two hundred years ago. There\nwere engineers even now who claimed succession down a line of tutors to\nthe woman, so famous had she been.\nTeia tried to remind herself of that strength when a wave smashed\nagainst the side and washed all the way over the top.\nShe avoided the others: Ferkudi and some of his friends from the earlier\nBlackguard classes. For a moment as they laughed, though, happy, not two\nminutes after grieving and being ready to fight, Teia saw them as her\ninstructors must: children, sixteen and seventeen years old, laughing about\nsomeone’s awkward attempts at kissing, and yet warriors at the same\nmoment, lethal and lazy, implacable and silly, man and child.\nToo much thinking, T.\nShe somehow made it into the lift without them noticing her among the\nothers. It was a good thing about being slight. Sometimes you wanted to be\noverlooked. She didn’t feel like talking, but she wondered if they’d think\nher unfriendly. No, they were too involved with themselves.\nStaying on the lift when the inductees got out, Teia left instead at the\nlevel of Kip’s room. The clerks had been too busy in the days immediately\nbefore the fleet left to do any normal business. That had meant Teia and Kip\ncouldn’t file her paperwork. It meant she was still, technically, a slave. With\nKip gone, she needed to file that paperwork immediately. If old Andross\nGuile remembered her, he would surely seize her as his grandson’s property,\nif only to spite Kip.\nYou idiot, Kip, why’d you attack Andross Guile? Of all people, you\nattack him?\nAnd where was Kip now? Would he ever come home?\nCome home? To where Andross Guile and a noose are waiting for him?\nKip could be alive, but Teia would still probably never see him again.\nHe’d been her partner for only a few months, but their time together had\nbeen intense. They’d been outcasts together, and fought together, both\nfiguratively and literally. Teia’s heart ached.\nShe tugged on the vial of olive oil she still wore at her neck. She would\nwear it until she got the confirmation from the secretaries that her\nmanumission papers had gone through fully, irrevocably. Then she would\nsmash it. Soon, she hoped."

Soon, she hoped.\nThe key turned easily in the lock, and Teia opened the door and stepped\ninside quickly.\n“Hello, little dove,” a man said from the darkness. “Turn around.”\nTeia froze up for a moment, then turned, keeping a hand on the latch.\n“Who are you?” she asked. “What are you doing here?”\n“Two… excellent… questions,” the man said. He had fair skin, freckles,\na fringe of orange hair brushed over in a vain attempt to conceal a knobby\nbald pate. He wore a rich trader’s garb with a thin black cloak, and held a\nvelvet-brimmed petasos in one hand, but most striking were his eyes. They\nwere amber-colored. Not from drafting yellow or orange luxin, but naturally\namber. He smiled, showing stark white teeth. “When we’re in public, you\nshall call me Master Sharp.”\nWhich prompted the obvious question, “But in pri—”\n“Murder.”\n“Excuse me?” Teia asked. Fear shot through her, and she hated it.\n“Murder. More of a title. Murder Sharp. Had a real name, once. Gave it\nup.”\nWhich prompted more obvious questions. But to hell with him. “What\nare you doing in here?” she demanded.\n“Recruiting.”\n“You fail. Now get out.” Recruiting?\nHe made no move to leave. “You made a good decision back there at the\ndocks, though it made my life more difficult. Bright girl, aren’t you? Seeing\nthe paryl but ignoring it? You saw an enemy with unknown abilities asking\nyou to meet on ground of their choosing—and you chose not to come into\nthat fight. That was… wiser than your years. It makes me want you more. I\nhave a job for you. And if you do it, I will give you your papers.”\n“What papers?” Teia asked, playing stupid.\n“Indeed?” he asked archly. “After I’ve complimented your intelligence?\nYou are a child, aren’t you? An uncut gem, though. If you perform my task\ntoday, I will give you your papers, I swear by my very soul and my hope of\nillumination. If you do not, I will give them to Andross Guile, for whom I\nhave worked in the past. A little reminder to him of who and what you are\nwill be sufficient to make your life difficult, don’t you think? Do you think\nthese manumission papers will ever see the light of day if I take them to\nHigh Luxlord Guile?”\nThe answer was obvious. “How do I know you’ll give them to me?”\n“I hold oaths holy. If, however, you attempt to circumvent my plans\nagain by going to some other authority—”\nTeia attacked him, jabbing a fist at his throat.\nAnd promptly fell, nerveless, into his arms. He lifted her easily and laid\nher on Kip’s bed as gently as a lover. She couldn’t feel anything. Her body\nwas simply gone, a blank in her senses. She smelled the odd man named\nMurder.

She hated him for that.\nHe smiled toothily with the whitest, most perfect teeth she’d ever seen,\nand arranged her limbs for her. He put two fingers against her upper lip, not\nshushing her but instead feeling her breath, and withdrew when he did,\nseeming content. “Can you speak?” he asked.\nShe opened her mouth, but there was no control of her air to scream, she\ncouldn’t even whisper. Something was very, very wrong. Confusion\nthreatened to break into panic.\n“The body is such a mystery, don’t you agree? The sheer number of\nthings that must go right from moment to moment to keep this meat\noperating.” He picked up her limp arm and dropped it. It fell, lifeless. “Let\nme tell you the most interesting thing: the more you know, the greater you\nrealize the mystery is. The wisest chirurgeons in the satrapies still believe\nblood sits static in our limbs, that it ebbs and flows like tides, perhaps even\ntied to the moon. My people, on the other hand, have known for centuries\nthat blood circles the body, that the heart is a pump. We know because we\ncan see it. And yet even to us, we who see plainly what a hundred\ngenerations of chirurgeons have not yet discovered, there are mysteries. We\nare not so much greater than they are, after all. Different in degree, but not\nin kind. I know that a pinch here or a crystal there will, if I’m lucky,\nproduce this and this. You moved so fast. So fast. Do you feel any tingling\nin your feet yet? Blink once for yes, twice for no.”\nTeia felt nothing. Nothing. She was a prisoner, trapped in her own\nunresponsive flesh. She felt tears forming. Then, tingling, one foot and then\nthe other. She blinked, almost involuntarily.\n“Good. Tingling should begin in your fingers any moment.”\nHe was right. For all his supposed ignorance, he was exactly right. That\ndidn’t make it less terrifying, just differently so.\nMurder said, “Stop thinking about your fear. Your feeling will all come\nback. I’m very good at what I do. By the time you’re able to speak, I want\nyou to guess how I did it.”\nTeia hated being easily biddable, but there was something intoxicating\nabout the man. Further, he was right. She took a deep breath, and realized\nshe could feel it in her chest when she did so. Thank Orholam.\nIt took a few more breaths and frustration before she could relax enough\nto open her eyes full to see paryl. What she saw took her breath away.\nThe entire room was filled with paryl. A gaseous, luminous cloud of the\nstuff filled every nook and cranny. More than that, the paryl appeared to\nsuffuse both her and Murder’s bodies. It went through them. Murder had\nused that property to reach inside her body and tweak something.

She knew that was something the full\nBlackguards studied. And her own experiences of battle, of watching the\ndead and the dying and the injured, were still too raw for her to take them\napart and think about what kind of wound produced what. But she had seen\nanimals slaughtered at Lady Lucigari’s estate growing up. Goats and pigs\nand cattle. The cook preferred a deep slash across the throat to bleed the\nanimal, but her husband Amos had liked to use his ax.\nHe was one of those men who’d never been to war, but liked to talk\nabout how great he would have been if he had. Butchering an animal was as\nclose as he could get. Teia had seen his wood ax fall, and an ox fell lifeless\nand limp when the ax bit through its spine. She’d seen him make a mistake\nwhile drunk, and only crush a vertebra with a clumsy stroke, seen the cow’s\nback legs drop limp while the front still stood.\n“You pinched my spine,” Teia said.\nMurder brushed her cheek tenderly. “Smart. True, as far as it goes. But I\ndon’t recommend you go around pinching spines randomly to figure it out.\nDo it wrong and you stop the heart or lungs. It took me six tries before I got\nit right. And then after I thought I’d mastered it, I paralyzed a boy\npermanently. Had to arrange it so it looked like he fell down a well. He\nlived for six months until someone forgot to give him water and he slipped\naway.”\n“How many of you are there?” Teia asked.\n“Few enough we’re always looking for more. Enough so we don’t take\nthose unfit for duty. Can you move now?”\n“Yes. May I?” Teia hated herself for asking, but Murder was like a wild\nanimal. Any sudden move might set him off.\n“Open your mouth,” he said. She did. “Good girl.”\nWith a wide finger and thumb, he pushed her lips back like she was a\nhorse. She pulled back. “Be still!” he hissed.\nShe froze.\nHe pushed her lips up and down, manipulating them to give himself a\nbetter look in her mouth. Then he stuck a long, delicate finger in her mouth,\nfeeling her teeth one by one, seeking out every imperfection, moving from\nthe front of her mouth to the back. There was odd pleasure in his eyes.\nTeia had the sudden, wild impulse to bite his finger off. She had no idea\nwhy his touching her like that felt like such a violation, but he made her feel\ndirty, his eyes wide with desire, not magic.\nAnd then he was done. He pulled his finger out of her mouth. It was wet.\nHe smelled it, then held it under her nose.\n“Parsley,” he said. “Chew parsley, and your breath won’t be so foul.”\nThen he sucked his finger. “Smell.” He put his finger back under her nose.\nShe smelled. It smelled like spit to her. Ugh. Why had she obeyed him?\n“So much better, don’t you think?” Master Sharp asked.\nTeia said nothing. Her stomach was in knots, and she didn’t trust her"

She was suddenly sure that he’d been tempting her to bite him. What\nwould he have done if she’d given him that excuse? It was like a nightmare\nshe couldn’t wake from.\nHe stood. “Smart. And young. You’ll be formidable, Adrasteia. If you\nlive. If you’re not given to an owner who decides to break that spirit in that\nmost effective way a young woman’s spirit can be broken. I know you think\nyou’re so strong nothing can break you. It’s a comforting lie, but don’t test\nit.\n“Believe me, no one is that strong. But I don’t ask you to live in fear,\nAdrasteia. I merely suggest you use that wisdom you’ve shown before.\nThink not just about the fallout for you if you tell someone. Consider what\nhappens to Commander Ironfist if he takes up your cause. Perhaps it would\ngo well if I were to give your papers to any ordinary slaveholder. But if you\npit Commander Ironfist against Andross Guile? Who do you think would\nwin in that kind of fight? Ironfist is a good man, and he’ll go to his\ndestruction for you, if you tell him.”\nTeia wanted to kill him. How dare he threaten Ironfist?\n“Or perhaps you can go to Karris? You have trained with her, after all.”\nTeia hadn’t even thought of that, though now that he said it, she was sure\nshe would have. Karris was a woman in the Blackguard, an Archer who\nknew their special burdens, and she was a good woman. But that Master\nSharp had thought of it made her heart sink. He knew everything, and he\nwas fast, faster than he had any right to be. Of course, he’d been preparing\nfor this meeting, too.\nThere was a thought that was important behind that fact, but Teia\ncouldn’t get to it past her fear. “What would happen to her?”\n“Maybe nothing. High Luxlord Guile already hates her. Of course, now\nthat she’s Gavin’s wife—or widow—they are family now. So I imagine the\nWhite will be pressing Karris to make peace with the old man. Karris might\nnot be too eager to take up another cause that puts her in direct opposition\nto one of the most notorious grudge-holders in the Seven Satrapies. How\nwell does she really like you? Or perhaps she will take up your case, and\nyou’ll not only cost her her chance at peace, but he will win. The law is on\nhis side, so he will win. And then what will he do to you to spite her?”\nTeia licked her lips. “He might want peace, too, you know. He could\ngive me up as a gesture of goodwill.”\n“Goodwill?” He chuckled, as if it were droll. “Andross Guile is full of\nwill, I grant, but little of it is good.”\nThe whims of the great crushed the lives of those who labored beneath\nthem.

She put her hand on the latch to throw it\nopen—stopped.\nSeconds drained past. Open the door, Teia. Go after him and stick this\ndagger straight into his back!\nShe locked the door.

Gavin looked over at his oarmates. He didn’t expect anything\nfrom the man next to him, Orholam. The nickname was for his number—\nSeven—but Gavin had slowly realized the Angari slaves had a darker sense\nof humor in their naming. Seven radiated kindness, but he almost never said\nanything, and when he did, it was rarely helpful. That these very qualities\nwere why he’d been named Orholam was a sentiment so profane and\ndisrespectful that the Highest Luxiat and head of Orholam’s worship on\nearth had laughed for a good ten minutes when he finally understood.\nHe’d almost recovered from his laughter when Fukkelot had cursed at\nhim, and he finally understood that name, too, sending him into fresh gales\nof laughter.\nThe foreman, Strap, had eventually used her own much more obvious\nnamesake to shut him up.\nRowing. The pain could be catalogued, but even the catalogue was\ntedious. His fellows were more interesting than the chafing, the blisters, the\ncramps, the knots.\nFukkelot was more helpful than Orholam, and more verbal.

Wind’s bad.\nTwenty minutes, if they never stop running.” She chortled. “Three, Four,\nFive, if you don’t get that oar fully stowed before the crunch this time, it’s\nfive stripes each.”\n“You gotta give us enough warning,” Three complained.\nGavin expected him to get the strap for that, but the foreman was in a\ngood mood.\n“Kind of ship is she?” Three asked.\n“Abornean galley.”\nMurmurs. Bad news. “How loaded?” someone asked.\n“Sitting high.”\nCurses. If their captain were competent, the chase would all come down\nto which slaves were in better condition—or could be motivated more. The\nmotivation came by whip, mostly. Sitting high in the water meant it would\nbe faster than usual and that it didn’t have a full cargo to plunder if they did\ncatch her. It was the worst of all worlds for a crew.\n“Little fishies, you ready to swim?” Strap shouted out.\n“Straight to hell, straight back again!” they shouted, but there was\nclearly less excitement in their tone.\n“Pull!” she shouted. At some signal, the drummers increased the tempo.\nGavin strained against his oar. At each sweep, the rowers stood up as\nthey pulled, sat on the backsweep and did it again. This Angari ship had\nadded a wrinkle that one of the men who’d been a galley slave on a\nRuthgari ship before said was unheard of on the Cerulean Sea—a footboard\nat an incline that allowed the slaves to more easily put the full strength of\ntheir legs into the sweep. Made it easier, he said. Made them faster, Gavin\nthought.\n“They’re runners!” Strap shouted gleefully. “Let’s see if they can race\nus, boys!”\nThey maintained their speed.\nTwo minutes later, she came down again. “We’re gaining on ’em. No\nway they can lose us!”\nA small cheer ran through the slaves.\n“Uh, uh, two, uh measures of, uh, strong wine for the first, uh, six\nbenches tonight!” Fukkelot said.

He cursed twelve times, loudly, as if he’d\nbeen holding back the tide simply to get a full sentence out. “Or death!” He\nlaughed.\nOnly for the first six benches—so the men farther back would have a\nreason to behave well and hope they got promoted. It was just one among\nmany Angari traditions Gunner had kept after taking the ship and its crew.\nThey had all sorts of ways to motivate their slaves. Gavin wondered if the\nAngari were more decent, more clever, or just slave-poor.\nKarris, I labor among madmen and murderers.\nNot so different from back home, then? she asked in his mind’s eye.\nHow he loved her.\nKarris, could you spell me for a bit on the oar?\nWish I could, love.\nHe saw her face twist with pity, and it cut through him. What was he\nnow? Dirty, sweaty, stinking, bearded, hair shorn short, serving slavers. He\nblinked it away. Focused on his oar.\nStrap said, “Leonus, water. Don’t need anyone passing out in the\nstretch.”\nLeonus was a twisted-back, perpetually sneering sailor with the dark\nblack skin of an Ilytian, though he had nothing of their accent. He shaved\nhis wiry hair at the sides of his head and let it grow in a knotted crown\nabove. He thought the slaves hated him for his deformity, and he took it out\non them at every opportunity, giving them plenty of real reasons to hate\nhim. He moved among them with a cup on a long handle. The task actually\ntook considerable dexterity—giving water to a man who’s constantly\nstanding, sitting, moving moving moving, with a long oar and numerous\narms intermittently in the way. Leonus took every advantage when he\nthought the foreman wasn’t looking to swing the cup into slaves’ faces,\nsmashing lips and breaking teeth from time to time. They were so desperate\nfor water, though, that they took it rather than turn away. Leonus was the\nkind of scum that enjoyed that most of all.\nBack in Gavin’s past life, one of the biggest burdens of leadership had\nbeen finding and removing such men from every command. Any short-term\nresults they got from the fear their men held them in was ultimately spoiled\nby how they ruined morale and stopped men from taking initiative.\nGavin heard the crack of a whip, and heard Leonus cry out behind him.\nStrap shouted, “Don’t fuck with them, Leonus! You keep my boys from\nrowing, and I’ll wipe your ass with hull barnacles. You hear me?”\nEven Orholam grinned at that, though when Leonus made it to their\nbench, each slave kept his face carefully composed. Strap was as wide as\nthe sea, foul as a latrine, and had more tattoos than any four other sailors\ncombined, and Leonus rightly feared her. The malformed man gave them\neach water quietly, hatefully.\nAt their increased pace, the slaves sweated freely, and the always hot,\nalways humid cabin got hotter and wetter. One slave cried out with a\nmuscle cramp in his leg and went down. His oarmates struggled to maintain"

        "text": "always humid cabin got hotter and wetter. One slave cried out with a\nmuscle cramp in his leg and went down. His oarmates struggled to maintain\nthe pace without him.\nIn an instant, Strap was on top of him, beating him mercilessly with the\nwhip. After six or eight strokes, she unlocked the slave’s manacles and\nbodily hurled the man back down the aisle. Number Two was hustled into\nplace.\nThe foreman looked pleased that they hadn’t slowed their pace. She\nwalked up and down the aisle, checking the men for signs of exhaustion,\nthen walked to the back. Gavin heard the slave’s cries and the snapping of\nleather, the thudding of fists and feet on flesh. It was insanity to beat a man\nfor what he couldn’t control—and for a few long strokes of the oars, Gavin\nwondered why the otherwise sensible woman would do it.\nAh, preventative brutality. Beat the man who can’t help his cramp so\nthat others don’t fake a cramp to get a rest.\nUnjust, but probably effective. Gavin wasn’t sure if he admired or hated\nStrap more for it.\nThe door to the main deck two flights up cracked open, letting midday\nlight down the sweat-slick stairs. The foreman went up the steps, and\nLeonus took her place at the bottom to repeat any orders she might shout.\n“One hundred paces! Ain’t turning!” the foreman shouted.\n“One hundred paces!” Leonus shouted. “Drummers, places!”\nNo one had explained what Gavin was supposed to do, or what\nhappened in what order, but another drummer joined the first, pounding a\nbig, hollow-sounding drum to add to the first. He beat at exactly the same\ntempo, though, standing in front of the slaves on the port side.\n“Uh, fuck fuck fuck fuck, listen to our drummer, not theirs,” Fukkelot\nsaid. “Last—” He dissolved into curses and grunts for a while, getting more\nand more frustrated that he couldn’t speak clearly. Finally, he managed,\n“Last second, we stow the oars. After uh, uh, uh, a sprint, though.”\n“Turning to port, seventy paces!” the foreman shouted.\nA muffled report resounded from the long tom mounted on the prow of\nthe Bitter Cob and shook the deck like a punch in the chest. Shouting\nabovedecks. Pounding feet. A musket fired above, followed by Gunner’s\nshout. He wouldn’t want anyone on deck shooting out at that range. He\nwouldn’t trust anyone but himself to hit a target that far away.\nGavin gritted his teeth, his legs quivering, arms burning, sweat dripping\ninto his eyes. The slaves were barely touching their butts to the wood\nbenches at this pace.\nA high, loud crack sounded from some musket that Gavin couldn’t\nplace, but that sounded very different than—oh, that could only be\nGunner’s musket.\nThe Bitter Cob veered to starboard. Gavin figured they must be trying to\ncut directly behind the other ship, to keep them from getting a broadside. It\nwould only work if their own ship were significantly faster.\n“Starboard side, battle speed!” Strap shouted.\n“Starboard side, battle speed!” Leonus shouted."

It made the Bitter Cob cut\nto port, while losing almost no speed.\n“Battle speed, all!” Strap shouted.\n“Battle speed, all!” Leonus shouted.\nThey sprinted across the waves, throwing their whole weight into every\nstroke. There were no chants now. The men had no breath to spare. The heat\nwas unbearable. Gavin heard the slapping of a whip, but his world was\nconstricted to the pain in his shoulders and lungs and legs and back and\ncalves and arms—\n“On my mark, stow portside oars!” the foreman shouted. Before Leonus\ncould even finish repeating the order, the foreman shouted, “Mark!”\nThe drummers pounded three great wallops, and stopped abruptly.\nThe slaves heaved their oars down, lifting the blades out of the water,\nand then pulled them into the hold, hand over hand, pulling them all the\nway inside so they wouldn’t be snapped off in a collision.\nFor one moment, as the drums fell silent, as the slaves gasped for breath,\nas the men above braced for impact, there was no sound but the peaceful\nhissing of the waves.\nThen hell broke loose.\nChapter 12\nKip walked shoeless on the beach for an hour before his feet blistered. He\nwalked on blistered feet for half an hour before the blisters cracked and\nbled. He walked on bleeding feet for less than a minute before the obvious\noccurred to him.\nHe sat heavily on the sand and sighed. How many months had he been\ndrafting now? The Chromeria taught that you weren’t supposed to think of\ndrafting first to solve your problems, but they had it exactly backwards.\nMagic was useful for everything. It just killed you. You should always\nthink of it first. Then you should decide if a little dram of death was worth\nit.\nFunctionally, perhaps, the same thing. Provided you thought of it before\nyou were bleeding to death on a beach in some distant corner of the\nsatrapies because you were so damn dumb.\nUsing the green of the jungle canopy as his source, he drafted a green,\nflexible sole to walk on, thought about it for a minute, and then drafted\nentire boots of green luxin. Because his feet were already bloody, he left an\nopen connection between his feet and the bottom-most layer of the sole so\nthat he would be able to adjust the grip of his shoes immediately. It flirted\nwith the line of using magic in ways that became part of your own body—\nincarnitive. But there were no magisters here. Kip walked, adjusting his\nboots until he was happy with them and trying to lock that design in his\nmind in case he ever needed this again.\nEvery drafter did this, he realized. They came up with useful designs and\nmemorized them to be used quickly again. It was just that simpletons\ndesigned shoes while savants designed skimmers. The number of designs\nyou could make as your colors expanded had to be an exponential curve.\nHad Gavin Guile memorized a thousand thousand designs, or did he just"

The number of designs\nyou could make as your colors expanded had to be an exponential curve.\nHad Gavin Guile memorized a thousand thousand designs, or did he just\nunderstand magic so deeply that he didn’t have to memorize designs? He\nmerely created what made sense. Like you don’t have to think how to walk\nup stairs that are slightly steeper than the stairs you’re used to. You just do.\nIt seemed the more Kip learned about magic, the more impressed he was\nwith those who used it artfully.\nThen again, he’d gone green golem once, purely on instinct.\nYou got potential, Kip.\nAnd you know what potential means? he replied.\n“Ain’t done nothing yet.”\nIt was actually kind of comforting to hear the sound of his own voice.\nHe kept walking. Whether under oar or sail, galleys could travel twelve\nto fifteen leagues a day. Most galleys only had a range of four days before\nthey needed fresh provisions. As galleys became less prevalent—being\nreplaced by ships with longer ranges—many of the coastal towns that lived\non the galley traffic were struggling. They would die in another generation\nor two, but they weren’t gone yet. So at the maximum, there had to be a\ntown within sixty leagues.\nAssuming he hadn’t been dropped precisely in between two towns, Kip\nwould obviously find one closer if he walked the right direction. But he’d\nbeen blindfolded. The nearest town could only be a league or two south,\nwhile he was heading north.\nOf course, there should be little towns in between, too, like that little\nfishing town so close to Ruic Head where the whales had gone crazy, and\nthe people, too.\nThat was, if all the towns hadn’t been abandoned by people fearful of\nthe advancing army of color wights, in which case, he could walk until he\ndied and—\nNot helping, Kip.\nHe was hungry. No, don’t think about that. Anything else.\nAt worst, if Kip could walk eight leagues a day, he should make it to a\ntown in seven days. At worst. He could do that. All he needed was water.\nHe could live on his fat for plenty long enough, theoretically, though he\nwould walk slower as he became weaker. He found himself moving\nimaginary abacus beads as he did the figures. Funny, that helped.\nThat is, it helped him with the arithmetic. A smarter person would\nprobably shut off his brain and walk. Kip had always been about as good at\nshutting off his brain as he was at shutting off his mouth.\nStraight pipe between the two, mother used to say.\nHe was assuming he could walk eight leagues a day. Here, on the clear\nbeaches, that seemed entirely plausible, but Kip knew there were other\nareas of the coastline that were rocky, where cliffs bordered the sea, or\njungles abutted the waves almost directly. Points protruded full leagues out\ninto the sea. If Kip followed the coastline exactly, he would have to travel\nmuch more than the sixty leagues a ship would travel between towns. If he\ndidn’t follow the coastline exactly, he’d risk getting lost in an unfamiliar\njungle or forest.\nFor a few minutes, he had to concentrate on breathing, his throat"

His mind clamped down on that refusal like\na bulldog’s jaw locking. He was the turtle-bear, and the turtle-bear can’t be\nstopped. What was the worst that could happen? He could fail? He’d failed\nbefore, plenty. He could die? He’d almost died plenty of times now.\nSometimes it was scary, sometimes it was terrifying, sometimes it was\nexhilarating, often it was uncontrollable no matter what you did, right or\nwrong. You don’t stop and make death a sure thing just because going on\nmight result in death. Kip was a fat miserable disappointment, but he wasn’t\na quitter.\nHe grinned suddenly. A fat miserable disappointment—who had, albeit\nwith lots of qualifiers, killed a king, saved the Prism, and killed a god. Not\nbad for a fatty. Hell, he’d even outsmarted Andross Guile once.\nOdd that he thought of outsmarting Andross Guile as more impressive\nthan killing a god.\nThe god thing felt like luck, though, or like Orholam had surveyed the\nfield for a suitable tool to keep his Prism alive, and finding none suitable,\nhad picked up Kip because he was closest.\nKip paused.\nI treat myself pretty shitty, he thought. I’d never let anyone treat a friend\nof mine this way.\nAn hour later, he found a stream. He drank, hoping the water was good.\nTruth was, he didn’t have much choice. He slowly drank more, waiting to\nmake sure it didn’t make him throw up, and then sipping more. He stood,\nwishing he had a waterskin.\nHe caught sight of his green luxin boots. Golly, if only I had some way\nto make a waterskin!\nWith a sigh, he drafted a green bag. Magic first, magic always, Kip. He\nscooped up a great volume of water, then bent the green until it fit\ncomfortably across his back. Drafted straps that fit his shoulders, drafted a\nbelt.\nMagic. So useful, it’s like… magic.\n“Talking to this madman is making me crazy!” Kip said.\nFunny. You’ll know you’re almost finished when you forget it’s\nsupposed to be ironic.\nHe decided while he was walking, he could catch up on all the practica\nhe’d missed. Unfortunately, at his level, the Blackguard training had\nconsisted almost purely of hand-to-hand combat, the idea being that such\nwas the foundation for all their future training. On the ships traveling to\nRuic Head, they’d been taught proper grips and basic handling of swords\nand how to reload muskets. The other new Blackguard inductees already\nknew it all. Some of them had been training with weapons for years. Some\nwere proficient with bows and other weapons that Kip had barely even\npicked up. He was way, way behind.\nBut I can go green golem.\nFat lot of good that does me now.\nHe felt like the coast was swooping out to a point, but looking at the sun\nalone wasn’t enough to confirm his suspicions.

His classmate Ben-hadad\nhad once said that he’d learned to draft a sextant so he would never be lost.\nOf course, you still needed a compass, too, and while you could draft a\nhousing and a medium on which to float a bit of philosophers’ stone, there\nwas no such thing as lodestone luxin. Some things still had to be done the\nhard way.\nAnd easy or hard, Kip didn’t have any of the skills that would have\nsaved him. This was what losing one game of Nine Kings had cost him—\nhis grandfather had forbidden Kip to attend practica.\nKip was trying to intuit what others had studied for generations. Well?\nAm I a genius of magic, or not?\nWait! Why am I messing about thinking about sextants and compasses\nand waterskins? I should be making a skimmer. He’d seen it done. He’d\neven helped propel one.\nBut a failure with a complicated device like the skimmer would leave\nhim in the middle of the sea, with no way to get out. Kip could float, but it\nwasn’t like he was going to drift to Big Jasper, and if he tried Gavin’s\njetting trick to swim, he’d break the halo before he got halfway there.\nI can draft all these colors. It’s as if I’ve got a toolbox full of every\nimaginable tool, and I’m too stupid to use them.\nToo ignorant, perhaps, a kinder voice answered him.\nIt was true. You wouldn’t blame a savage for the fact that he can’t read.\nBut you wouldn’t trust him with reading you letters, either.\nThe light began to fade, and Kip turned his mind to different problems.\nHe found a clean area of the beach, just at the edge, where the palm trees\ngave him shelter. He took off his water pack. Staring at the darkening sky,\nhe gathered enough blue to draft a blue luxin box with a single hole in the\ntop, and sealed it. Then, standing on the beach facing the sinking sun, he\ngathered as much red as he could, patiently, slowly. The passions of red\nflooded through him, but he ignored them and simply filled the blue box. He\nfilled the box full with the version of red luxin called pyrejelly.\nHe hadn’t been thinking clearly, and by the time the box was full there\nwasn’t enough heat coming from the sun to give Kip sub-red. He’d need to\nlight his fire manually. It took him half an hour in the fading light to find a\nrock that looked like flint.\nHe banged rocks together for another half hour. Nothing sparked. He\nwanted to scream. He hitched his pants up and sat, rubbing his face. He\ntightened his belt, and saw that he was past the last, tightest hole. Not six\nmonths ago, he’d been at the loosest hole on the belt, praying he didn’t get\nany fatter because he didn’t know where he’d get the money or the leather\nfor a new belt. All the rest of his clothing had been replaced at the\nChromeria, but it had seemed wasteful to get rid of his belt. Besides, his"

Kip scratched the buckle against\nthe flint he’d found, and wonder of wonders, it sparked. He lit the pyrejelly\nwith no problem. It burned nicely. Kip sat and pulled his water pack to\nhimself as the stars came out. Maybe some water would take the edge off\nhis hunger.\nThe green luxin pack was sealed. Kip hadn’t drafted any way to open it.\nIf it had been light out, he could have drafted more green and simply\nopened the green luxin and re-drafted it shut. Instead, he had to treat it as a\npurely physical object.\nHe wanted to cry. Or scream. Or throw a fit. Instead, eventually, Kip dug\na hole in a weak part of the water bag with the sharp flint. Holding the pack\nover his head, he was able to drink from the warm stream of water until he\nfilled himself.\nKip’s lamp guttered as the pyrejelly burned below the level of the hole.\nWith no wick to pull the jelly up to the air, the fire starved and went out.\nKip looked at it like it had personally betrayed him. He could smash the\nblue lamp holding the jelly, of course. He’d not made it very thick. But then\nthe pyrejelly would burn off in perhaps a half an hour. If Kip had his\nspectacles, he could use that firelight to—he didn’t. Those were back on the\nship.

He’d been keeping that card in his hand, to play at\nthe right time. And Kip had shouted it out to the world—Kip the Lip, saying\nexactly what he thought, speaking without thinking, endangering plans he\ncouldn’t even fathom.\nBut Gavin had also known—in that moment, Kip had seen it—as they\nscrambled, four men, fighting over two blades, that Kip didn’t have the\nleverage to stop Andross and Grinwoody from burying the knife in his\nchest.

The Prism himself, the best Prism in\ncenturies, maybe ever. What did that mean? What did that say about Kip’s\nworth?\nThe thought was too big. The emotions welling up behind it too\nfrightening.

Well made, though,\nanyone would admit. And utterly revolutionary. It hadn’t been that no one\nhad thought of melting metal ores into molten glass for their color, it was\nthat they couldn’t get the fires hot enough, couldn’t get the ores pure\nenough. Lucidonius had solved that, too, showing himself to be a mundane\ngenius as well as a magical one. He’d been infuriating that way, but those\nlenses had changed everything, for drafters everywhere. A lens grinder, their\nmighty Lucidonius. In addition to everything else. Changing our lives in a\nthousand ways. Drawing us along behind him like leaves in a gale.\nAnd leaving a terrible mess when the storm passed.\n“As Pride is the first sin, so Power is the first temptation,” I intone.\nLucidonius preached that, and became powerful, more powerful than the\npagan priests and prophets.

It had made sense to many, but perhaps especially to those like\nme, who can draw more than one color. In my land, my mastery of green\nhad always been praised, but my use of blue condemned by my brother\nqassisin. Even though it made me a better gwardjan.\nMaybe none of it made sense. Maybe Lucidonius was merely more right\nthan those who’d come before him. Maybe what I’m about to do isn’t a sin\nagainst Orholam, that odd desert god who lives in the sky and everywhere,\ninvisibly, rather than walking the earth like a proper god. Maybe it is. He’ll\nhave to forgive me, for though I am no longer an aħdar qassis gwardjan, I\ncannot stop being a gwardjan. It is who I am. Who Orholam made me, if\nLucidonius spake true.\nI draw on the light, and my green jinnīyah is there, familiar to me as my\ndead wives’ faces—my beloved wives, forced into the orgiasts’ flames to\nexpiate the shame and crime of my apostasy.\n“I’ve missed you,” Aeshma whispers along my skin, her touch caresses.\nI’ve missed her, too. Of course I have. But she knows that.\nI expect her to be angry, haughty, to punish me for turning my back on"

First she’ll get her hooks into me.\nLater, she’ll punish. Nor does she go to my libido, once so potent, now\nseemingly dead since my ’Annaiah and Siana burned. Instead, she waits.\nPerhaps she sees from my face that the only pleasure I seek is the pleasure\nof battle, of red vengeance. Perhaps even after all this time she feels me\ndirectly.\n“I would have made you the next Atirat,” she says, mournfully. She puts\nher hand on my wrist as I start to pour luxin forth from my skin there. “You\nwere to be a god.”\n“The daemon’s in your eyes,” Auria says. “Do you see her true, or do\nyou see how she wants you to see?”\nI remember when Lucidonius bent the prism toward me as my jinnīyah\nstood in front of my eyes, shouting blasphemies in my ears. The sudden\nwash of other colors had shown me what the priests of the other colors saw\nwhen they looked at her. In every other color, Aeshma was a horror. No\nwonder the other qassisin kuluri warred with us, called us daemon-\nworshippers. And then Lucidonius had flipped a mirror out, and in that full-\nspectrum light, I’d seen that even the green was a thin mask.\nAeshma was no beauty. She was all disease and ugliness.\nI’d shattered the prism, shattered the mirror, swearing Lucidonius had\nensorcelled it, that he’d tricked me, shown me lies. But I was wrong. Later,\nI’d done the same trick when I found other djinn foolish enough to manifest\nthemselves in their priests’ eyes. The prism we used was a mundane prism,\nthe mirror plain silver and glass. Eventually the Two Hundred had learned\nthat we could expose them. They came up with elaborate lies to those they\nsnared to explain why they no longer would appear at all—blamed it on the\nstain Lucidonius had brought to the world. Truth was, they didn’t want to be\nso easily unmasked.\nAeshma says nothing more. I know she was one of the foremost of the\nTwo Hundred, nearly one of the Nine. A new Atirat is not born solely of one\nman’s conquering all human contenders. His partner jinnīyah must conquer\nall of her rivals as well.\nThe armor wraps around my body. I hold open only points at each joint.\nIt’s not as efficient or flexible or reactive as how I had once done it—with\nevery pore, every sweat gland, every hair a point of contact. Back then, I’d\nlet my jinnīyah control the armor, shifting it, reacting to dangers I couldn’t\neven see, her immortal will complementing my mortal will. The two of us\nhad been one in a way I couldn’t share even with my wives.\nI draw on blue, looking above the frames of my green spectacles at the\nlightening sky. Blue is safe, for me.

She was too jealous. I’d thought it was simply her\nnature, but now I see that she needed me all to herself if she was to win her\nfights with the other djinn. An Atirat who was not a pure green? Impossible.\nAs Pride is the first sin, so Power is the first temptation.\nFunny how Lucidonius put that in the present tense, though telling a\ncreation story. Not, Pride was the first sin. It made the thing applicable to\nus, as much as to the First Light. Good trick.\n“My heart is yours, Darjan, but I cannot save you if you don’t let me\nhelp,” Aeshma says. Her voice is so like my dead ’Annaiah’s that I know\nshe’s stolen even that. Clever, clever wench.\n“You can’t listen to what she says, Darjan,” Auria says in the mundane\nworld, voice weakening. “You know she lies.”\nI know.\n“Show me I can trust you,” I say aloud. I hope Auria thinks I’m\nspeaking to her; I hope my jinnīyah thinks I’m speaking to her.\nThe light is good now. I start running toward the village. Another color\nmight sneak in, hoping to find the raiders asleep, exhausted from a long\nnight of murder and worse. That isn’t the way of green. My jinnīyah sings\nbattle rage and bloodlust, and I know that she knows me too well.\nRage is not only red’s. I draft enough blue to make sharp edges for the\nthorn swords that sprout from my hands. My legs are sheathed in luxin,\nprotecting my knees, adding springiness to each step, adding the power of\nmy will to my movement, allowing me to jump farther than any mortal, to\nland safely, to run faster than a charging grizzly. I am become a beast.\nI see the dead: a young woman, Luzia Martaenus, lying on her side with\nher head cracked like an egg, her baby-swollen belly run through half a\ndozen times. Her younger sister is dead, cut down closer to town. They’d\ntried to escape together. Ruy Garos lies facing town, his pitchfork lying in\nthe sticky pool of his blood. Perhaps he’d tried to cover Luzia’s escape.\nHe’d always loved that girl, though she’d married the town drunk instead.\nUsually, the Angari raiders treated the people of Atan’s Town like a crop.\nWeed out the men who can fight, cut off the thumb of the right hand of the\nyoung men so they can still work, still breed, and take the prettiest women\nfor slaves and concubines. Then the Angari would come back years later,\nlong enough that the people could have built up a little wealth, but not long\nenough that they could build up enough strength to give the raiders much\ntrouble. Of course, the raiders killed those who irritated them, too.\nSometimes they killed for sport. Sometimes they maimed for fun. But\nthis… this was something else. This was pure punishment, a massacre."

She is as ugly as what I\nplan to do, and my soul is a small price to pay for vengeance. It makes me\nmonstrous. I am become a beast. I am become a god. Vengeance is mine.\nChapter 14\nThe galleys collided with a tremendous shock that sent half the slaves\ntumbling backward over their benches. A slave screamed as the manacle on\nhis wrist tore his arm out of its socket. The Bitter Cob sank in the waves,\nhaving hit below the other galley’s center, then it lifted both ships and\nbegan to slide along the opposing galley’s side.\nThe other galley’s oars, fouled and crossed and yanked from their\nrowers’ hands, snapped like kindling as the Bitter Cob scraped along her\nhull. Falconets discharged from the main decks of both ships, and muskets\npunctuated screams of rage and screams of fear and screams of pain.\nHeaving himself to his feet on the overhead oar, Gavin thought his part\nin the battle was done, but the Angari did things differently.\n“Up!” Strap shouted. She had a splinter of wood thicker than Gavin’s\nthumb all the way through one shoulder. She didn’t even seem to notice.\nOrholam’s beard, she was fierce. “Man the oars! Knock those—”\nA roar and an explosion of timber cut her off. The woman disappeared in\nsudden sharp light as the enemy’s cannon blasted a hole in the deck,\nfollowed instantly by a thick billow of black smoke, choking everything\nwith sulfur and sunlight diffused with smoke. The sound deafened Gavin.\nHe was only aware of the oar moving in his hands.\nBlinking, gasping, coughing on burning fumes, he helped his oarmates,\nonly slowly figuring out what they were doing. They stabbed the oar out\nrepeatedly, Fukkelot guiding it, Orholam giving the lift, Gavin mostly\ninterfering.\nThrough the smoke, not five paces away from them across the waves, he\nsaw the bobbing forms of sailors on the other galley, trying to right their\ncannons from the collision. Loaded cannons. Aimed straight for the slaves’\nbenches. Gavin’s fellow slaves—at least those who’d fought before and\nweren’t injured—were using their oars to keep the sailors from lighting the\ncannons, to keep them from spewing death through the Bitter Cob.\nGavin helped Orholam and Fukkelot, stabbing their oar straight into an\nAbornean face that appeared in the smoke. It was a cabin boy, not twelve\nyears old. The boy went down, face smashed, a slow match spinning out of\nhis hand."

The boy went down, face smashed, a slow match spinning out of\nhis hand.\nFukkelot was trying to shout orders, but in the pressure of the situation,\nhe was seized up with cursing. Orholam had the best view, so Gavin\nstabbed and stabbed, trying to figure out what Orholam wanted from his\nactions, throwing his whole, waning strength into the effort. Every so often,\nhe felt the crunch of oar smashing against something softer than wood.\nThe wind blew the smoke clear enough that Gavin saw boarding nets\nthrown over the gap between the ships, saw men scrambling across. He\nthought he heard Gunner laughing somewhere, battle-mad.\nThe other galley was taller than the Bitter Cob, and Gavin could see the\nrowers over there huddled beneath their benches, cowering, hoping the\npirates boarding their vessel passed them by. Some did. Some slashed at the\nhelpless slaves as they passed, laying open heads, splitting shoulders,\nhacking off skinny, starvation-frail arms. Because they could. Because man\nloves to kill.\n“Fuck,” Fukkelot said.\n“Fuck,” Gavin agreed.\nAs the smoke slowly cleared, Gavin saw a girl burst from one of the\ncabins of the opposing galley. She was dressed in men’s trousers and a vest,\nbut her long dark hair bobbed and streamed as she fled. A moment later, a\npursuer appeared. It was one of Gunner’s men. He was holding his trousers\nup with one hand. She must have just escaped him.\nFighting, petite, fierce, and underestimated—the girl reminded him of\nKarris when they’d first fallen in love. It was intolerable that anyone should\n—\n“You with me?” Gavin asked his oarmates.\nHe didn’t have time to see if they were. The young woman ran past,\nrunning for a hole where the traders’ galley had been stove in. Gavin and\nFukkelot pushed on the oar. Orholam guided it. It caught the pursuing pirate\nin the jaw. He flopped down, twisting, in a spray of sweat and teeth.\nThe young woman ran past. A sailor appeared out of nowhere as she\nheaded for the gap, and the sea. She didn’t slow, didn’t dodge. Instead, she\naccelerated right into the skinny man. They collided and her momentum\ncarried them both into the water. And out of sight.\nGavin looked to Orholam. He craned his head out as far as he could, but\nthen shrugged. He couldn’t see anything.\nThe fighting continued for a few more minutes, but it seemed their part\nwas done. The fight was confined to the other galley, and the exhausted\nrowers on the Bitter Cob began collapsing to their benches. Some vomited.\nGavin looked for Strap. There was nothing but blood, and an entire bench\nof slaves blown to pieces on the port side, along with one slave across the\naisle, and a hole in the starboard side where the cannonball had exited. He\nsaw a tattooed arm that might have been Strap’s.\nThe hunched form of Leonus limped over toward the splattered remains.\n“The gods are kind,” he said.

Unless\nyou want to follow the old one?”\nChapter 15\nKip dulled the edge of sharp hours with drafting. The emotional rush of\ndrafting different colors as the sun limped to the top of heaven’s dome\ndistracted him for a while. A few hours. A day. But hunger is sharper than\nluxin.\nWill is a knife of lead. In the end, the body always wins.\nThat second day with no food, he drafted only what was necessary. He’d\nalready fixed his pack, fixed his boots, drafted a shade for his sun-scorched\nskin after deciding he couldn’t figure out how to draft luxin clothing.\nOn the third day, he had to stop following the beach as he reached a\nrocky point of crags and cliffs. He cut through the jungle. Climbing over\nmounds of roots, angling up hills, trying to compensate for compensations\nmade hours earlier, he got lost, the canopy blocking out the sun, his own\nstupidity and heat exhaustion keeping him from doing much but finding a\nstream and lying down in it.\nHe woke to the brush of something on his hand. A tiny black-and-orange\nfrog sat there. His skin burned where its stomach rested against skin, acidic\nslime scorching him. He flinched and it hopped away. Then he looked\ndown, his vision following his gaze like a slow landslide.\nHe was covered in leeches. Dozens of leeches. He was dizzy. He rolled\nto all fours and vomited water and stomach acid all over his hands. He\nstood and staggered into the jungle, gear forgotten, tearing off his trousers,\nfalling. The world was hot fog. He puked again. Lost himself, not\nunconscious, but unaware, animal, a beast.\nFound himself some time later, naked, sitting in a shifting patch of\nsunlight. He was staring at the cloudless, merciless sky. Couldn’t bear to\nlook at himself, couldn’t bear to see those wriggling fat black leeches\nattached to him, sucking his blood into their bloated bellies. Drafting his\nblood for their blood magic.\nShhhhhh, the wind blew through the branches. Shhh.\nHe sucked in blue light, the blue blood of creation. Light is life. He\nsipped blue until it filled him, until he was only thought.\nHis racing heart slowed. He closed his eyes and let the blue course\nthrough him. It filled him with awareness. Thirty-one pairs of jaws, attached\nat the front and back of the leeches’ bloated bodies to his skin. Four singles\nwho’d had one half or the other knocked free of Kip’s skin by his\nmovement. With the blue in him, Kip remembered some long-forgotten\nadvice on how to remove leeches.

Instead, a fingernail to break the seal of their mouth on your\nskin, front and back. A fingernail and patience.\nKip’s gorge rose once more, but he stared at the sky again until his mind\nwas a placid, still pond. He couldn’t bear it. Not sixty-some times. He lost\nthe blue completely and was almost a beast again, trapped, trapped in his\nskin with leeches like he was trapped in a closet full of rats—\nLike this.\nCalm. Gentle. He took in blue, and more blue. He barely had the will to\nopen himself, barely understood what the swirling color was doing almost\nof its own accord. It filled his body, found every tooth, every Y-shaped\nincision.\nGather your will.\nHe had no will. He reached toward sub-red for passion, toward green for\nwildness.\nNo, your will. Luxin is your tool; you are not its tool. Stand.\nKip still hadn’t gathered any will, but he stood, feeling persecuted. He\nknew what to do, but knowing what to do here was like knowing that all\nyou had to do to climb a mountain is to walk. Orholam give me strength.\nHe already has. Use it.\nArms and legs outstretched, Kip clenched his fists, bowed his head. The\npower didn’t course through him in a scream of rage and omnipotence, but\ninstead in drops of silent tears. It followed his blood, finding tiny mouths,\nshutting them, rejecting them, sealing the poisoned blood away from him,\nand forcing it out, too.\nOne by one, the leeches dropped off. Dropped off his arms. Dropped off\nhis legs. Dropped off his chest. Dropped off his back. Dropped off his butt.\nDear Orholam—dropped off his groin. Dropped off his face.\nKip was streaming blood from sixty-two tiny wounds. The leeches’\npoison made blood run free. Kip wondered how much blood he’d lost.\nSeveral of the leeches nuzzled his feet, looking for a new spot to feed. He\nstepped away. He had no revulsion left. There were only problems, and\nfixing them.\nOh, simple. He drafted blue caps over every cut. As soon as he took a\nstep, he dislodged a quarter of the blue caps. Of course. Blue was too stiff;\nif he moved, he would lose his bandages.\nHe leaned against a tree, sat, drafted a blue cocoon around himself,\nsealed it, sealed his wounds, and slept.\nHe woke twice to vomit, wasn’t sure if he remembered to draft his\nbandages or his cage anew.\nHe dreamt or he had visions or he did things barely aware. A quietly\nweeping woman, in the gray morning light, hair in a great kinky halo. “Why\nare you crying?” Kip heard the voice asking, only realized it was his own\nafter the words were out.\n“I weep because you suffer, and only the second sons of Am are entitled\nto feel pity without passion.

And even then, not in life.” She stood and her\naspect changed suddenly, flickering between this dignified woman and\nsomething entirely other. “Sleep,” she said, quietly radiant. “You won’t die\non my watch.”\nAll faded into fever and nightmares and sweat and shivering cold and\nthunder and cool water. He heard the sounds of birds screeching, monkeys\nhowling, something like a dog barking at him, but all of it fast, too fast,\nskipping along the surface of time as if he were in his father’s skimmer,\nlight flashing across his face and disappearing like it was happening in\nseconds, when he knew it must be days. He had some recollection of\nholding a broad leaf to his face, funneling water to his lips as a mighty\ndownpour shook heaven and earth.\nWhen he woke again, he was himself.\nHe felt clear, but weak. He dissolved his blue cocoon, and almost\nvomited again from the touch of luxin, lightsick. There were paw prints in\nthe mud around his cocoon, big ones, not wolves, though, he knew wolf\nprints from growing up in Tyrea. There were no human prints, though, not\neven his own. The woman had been a hallucination, a fever dream.\nHow much had been dream or delusion? He took a deep breath,\nchecking himself, checking his surroundings. No leeches, no frogs, no\nstorms. Not now anyway.\nKip stood on wobbly legs. He couldn’t tell how long he’d been here.\nThe only indication of passing time was his cuts, scabbed over. So the\nleeches had been real. He examined the cuts. Leech bites usually heal more\nslowly than most wounds, but with the blue luxin helping, Kip guessed he’d\nbeen in his barely conscious state for less than a week.\nThe hunger had lost its urgency. Kip felt an odd purity, the serenity of\nsaints and ascetics and the batshit insane. The clarity of a soul detaching\nitself from its flesh home, perhaps. He walked for an hour before he realized\nhe was naked. His first thought when he became aware of it wasn’t\nembarrassment; it was protection. His skin was a poor barrier for the rigors\nof jungle travel.\nHe began drafting while he walked. He tried green first. It was so\nabundant, it was the most obvious choice. But he gave it up soon. Too\nheavy, too coarse to wear against his skin. When he came across a clump of\ntrumpet-shaped dazzlingly yellow flowers, he stopped. He tried to weave\ncloth of yellow, but he always lost that perfect, fine mesh point where\nyellow would hold its solidity before he could get a sizable chunk. The\nsmaller the amount of yellow he tried to make solid, the easier it was.\nThe declining sun lit up a spiderweb, and Kip was mesmerized by the\nbeauty of it. A tiny moth flew into the web and stuck. The spider moved in\nto make its kill, but Kip was entranced by the web itself.

The anchor lines were like steel cables, but the trap lines had little dots\nof goo in which more line was spooled. Sticky there, but it also kept the line\ninitially tight, while keeping slack so that the webs didn’t snap when fought\ndirectly, they would yield and pull and entangle.\nSuperviolet. Superviolet was the answer. Not to that, but—\nIt felt like the pieces to the problem were swirling around his head, just\nout of reach. The sun sank, leaving Kip cold. He hadn’t even drafted his\nshelter. He sat in a torpor all night. When the sun rose again, he had it.\nHe wove superviolet into tiny links, like a single chain, though instead\nof pounding each link shut like armorers did, he could simply draft them\ninto perfect loops one after the other, thereby depriving the chain of any\nweak areas. Then he flooded that form with yellow luxin, his will having to\ntouch each tiny link to seal it. It took half an hour. No problem.\nThe second chain was much harder; he had to thread each loop through\ntwo other loops of the first chain. In an hour, he had two connected strands\nof yellow luxin chain-mail cloth. Two connected, impossibly short strands\nof yellow luxin. He almost gave up then. Instead, he sat, staring. Barely\neven thinking. The water of a stream rushed past on its way to the sea, and\nKip watched. Open luxin still streaming in his fingertips, he touched the\nwater like it was open luxin flowing past, the blood of the earth.\nFor a moment, he felt Orholam himself, the creator larger than this earth,\nthis creation, but acting through it, like all the universe was luxin held open\nin His hands. A flash, blindingly bright white light, the sensation of life,\nlight, as Kip was pulled through the water to the sea to every water that\ntouched the sea, flashing out to a thousand veins, river-arteries aglow with\npower. Everywhere, all at once, not just a tracery of lines on a map, but with\ndepth. Water following the sun’s call and breaking into mist, rising,\nbecoming clouds. Water, lying on the deeps, its belly scratching sunken\ncities. Whales and sea demons barely large enough to touch his\nconsciousness, giants like minnows darting everywhere, life too small for a\nhuman eye, basking in Orholam’s light, their mindless life itself singing his\npraise by being.\nKip lost consciousness.\nWhen he woke, the strand of cloth was in his lap, twenty links wide. He\nstraightened his legs, worked the cramps out of them from his cross-legged\npose. He stared at the strands as if they were mocking him. He hadn’t\ndrafted those extra strands, had he? He’d not been himself, but he thought\nhe remembered all that he had done.\nKip stared at the water, and touched it again, his will open. But now it\nwas only water. “I want to save my father,” he whispered.\nSilence.\n“I’d pay anything,” he said.\nBut light abides not a lie. He heard nothing."

He heard nothing.\nThere was a part of Kip that had felt destined for greatness from the time\nhe was young. Maybe everyone felt that way. It hadn’t mattered how he\nlooked on the outside, that his mother was mindless in addiction, that he\nwas fat and ugly. No matter how much he despised himself, some part of\nhim thought that someday, someday he would shake the pillars of the earth.\nThat something amazing inside him would be let out. That he had a destiny.\nEvery stone they’d cast at him, he’d accepted, and he’d used them to\nconstruct a little altar to himself. Andross Guile laughing, telling him about\nthe Lightbringer. ‘The old word that says he’ll be a ‘great’ man from his\nyouth could be a pun in the original Parian—another meaning of the word\n‘great’ is ‘rotund.’ Which… well.’\nHe’s supposed to kill gods and kings.\nI’ve done that.\nHe’s supposed to be a genius of magic.\nWhat if I am that?\nGavin had said, ‘Don’t ruin yourself on this foolishness, boy, there is no\nLightbringer.’\nAnd yet Kip believed. He wanted to believe. Needed to.\n‘I keep trying to draw you as the next Prism, and I can’t,’ the Mirror\nJanus Borig had told him. And then as she died, she’d said, ‘I know who the\nLightbringer is now.’\nShe meant me. She had to mean me.\nBut there was only silence.\nKip stood. He followed the stream to the shore, turned north. At sunset,\nhe found a lone farmhouse. An older woman in a simple farmer’s dress was\nstanding outside, singing a song to the setting sun in a language Kip didn’t\nrecognize. She saw him from afar, smiled, and beckoned him to come with\none hand as she continued singing. The sound was like the rivers and the\nwinds and the deeps of the sea, and the warmth and light of a fire against a\nchild’s fears of the darkness. It held the promise of the morning and the\ncomfort of a mother’s heartbeat.\nFor Kip, who hadn’t heard a word spoken in days, the euphonious rise\nand fall of foreign syllables unencumbered with translation were a perfect,\ngentle transition from the raw terrors of the jungle into the sparse, hard-\nearned comforts of this frontier farm.\n“So you’re it,” she said, voice low and calm, moving slowly as if he\nwere a wild animal, speaking softly as her song faded, settling into Kip’s\nheart. She smiled. “Was thinking I heard wrong. ‘Clad in light’?” she asked,\naddressing the sky. She laughed heartily and that perfectly human sound\nmade Kip wake as if from a dream.\nBut not all at once.\nHe realized he was still naked. He draped the cloth in front of him, but\nwithout urgency, without embarrassment. He had a thought and knew it was\nstrange at the same time: the locals have a custom, this clothing custom,\nthough here there are no thorns to snatch and tear your skin; I should go\nalong."

Took the shine right off the rose for him, I tell\nyou, and I didn’t do much better for years. The Lord of Light loves to give\nme a gentle elbow about all that from time to time. But come. Let’s take\ncare of you.”\nAnd so she did. She took Kip in, fed him from the soup she’d already\nhad on, though she only gave him the broth, then she bathed him, tended his\nwounds, and put him to bed. When he woke, two days later, she fed him\nagain. Coreen was a widow, but several of her sons and daughters lived\nwithin easy walking distance and one at least visited each day, so when Kip\ntold her he needed to go to the Chromeria, she found out that a trader was\ndue to leave in two days and would make room for Kip—for free. Kip spent\none more day abed, and then was up.\nThey developed an easy rapport, joking and teasing as if they’d known\neach other for years. She reminded him of Sanson’s mother back in Rekton.\nThe woman had always made extra cakes or sweetmeats or pastries, and\nthey’d played an informal game of Kip trying to steal one or two without\nher noticing. He almost never got away clean, and when he did, she’d ask\nhim some question that he would try to answer around a mouthful of\nwhatever.\nShe took care of me, knowing my mother wasn’t doing so, and she did it\nin a way that never made me ashamed. She made it a game, for me. Kip had\nseen the fun in it before, but he’d never seen the kindness of it until now.\nAnd she’s dead. Like all of them.\nMaybe Coreen’s jokes and laughter were a kindness, too. She’d seen that\nKip was barely sane; she’d heard him wake sweating and screaming from\nanother of the dreams, and she treated him like a mother would treat an\nincorrigible friend of her son. Kip found out that her late husband had been\na renowned veteran of the Prisms’ War, though she never said on which side\nand Kip didn’t ask, and that made more sense of it. She had some of a\nwarrior’s sense of humor: black and light, irreverent to death as death was\nirreverent to all else."

She had some of a\nwarrior’s sense of humor: black and light, irreverent to death as death was\nirreverent to all else.\nBut she had a warmth, too, that was hugely appealing, and part of Kip\nwanted to stay here forever.\nOn his last full day, dressed in the widow’s husband’s clothes, which fit\nwell due to Coreen’s labors with a needle and thread, Kip fixed what he\ncould around her cabin. He drafted a few yellow lux torches, made some\nfire rocks to help start a blaze easily, tried his hand at drafting green to\nfertilize the vegetable gardens of her two daughters, and fixed a broken axle\non a haycart by sheathing it in solid yellow luxin—something useful he’d\nactually learned during his lectures. Imagine that.\nThe morning he left, Coreen said, “I can’t let you go without saying my\npiece. Have I earned that?”\n“Of course.”\nShe took a deep breath. “Kip, the Lord doesn’t want you to think you’re\nworthless, but he may want you to think you’re worth less than you\npresently think. He wants your eyes to be whole, so you have an accurate\nview of you. It’s done in love, you understand? When you surrender what\nisn’t under your control, you’re not giving up a crown, you’re giving up a\nyoke. I told you about my prudery in my youth. I was a beautiful girl, and\nthough I never would have said it, I thought I was more virtuous than\nOrholam. My false virtue—not modesty, pride—took the joy out of my\nmarriage bed. I’d fought to maintain a virtue, and I thought that because I’d\nhad to fight so hard, it must be the highest good. Giving up my claim to\nlook down on those I didn’t approve of was like losing a limb. But do you\nknow what it’s like to try to walk with three legs?”\nIt was getting uncomfortably close, and Kip was afraid of what she\nwould say next. “You’ve seen me naked, you know I do,” he said. He\ngrinned.\nShe shook her head like she knew she’d walked into that. She leveled\nher soup ladle at Kip’s nose. “Kip, serious hat on, or I make comments\nabout your manhood that you’ll never forget.”\nKip swallowed. “Yes, ma’am. Sorry, ma’am.”\n“Taking correction was like losing a limb to me, but it was worth it. A\ngood father doesn’t let his children stay stuck. Orholam is a good father,\nKip.”\n“Right now, I’m more worried about being a good son.” Deflect, deflect,\ndon’t let her ask what I should give up.\n“Then you are wiser than your years,” she said, and he wondered if he’d\nbeen nervous for nothing or if she was letting him off easy. Then she got a\ntwinkle in her eye. “Oh, and Kip…”\n“Don’t. Please don’t. Please?”\n“That’s no limb. A good strong sapling, maybe. Now my husband…\nThat was a limb. Let’s just say maybe modesty wasn’t the only reason I\nfainted.”"

Don’t worry.\nYou’ve got more than ample to satisfy. Bigger than my own sons’, and if\nmy daughters speak true, bigger than their husbands’, too.”\n“Ah! I have to see these people!”\nChapter 16\nKarris sipped her kopi quietly in the Crossroads. The stimulant was a poor\nchoice for her anxiety. She was seated in the clerestory, facing the big,\ngorgeous stained glass windows that had once been the pride of the Tyrean\nembassy. She wondered how the owner of the Crossroads had been able to\npurchase this building, and what it had cost. In the years since the fall of\nTyrea, it had become the city’s most fashionable kopi house, restaurant,\nbrewery, smokehouse, and—downstairs, out of sight of those with tender\nsensibilities—the foremost brothel in the city.\nFor that matter, she wondered who the owner was.\nKind of thing that a spymistress should be able to learn, isn’t it?\nShe wasn’t kept waiting long. She supposed that was one of the\nperquisites of her new position. She was the White’s right hand, and no one\nwould keep the White waiting. The man who sat across from her was an\nIlytian banker, the scion of one of the great merchant banking families, the\nOnestos, twenty-five years old, and probably just now being treated as an\nadult, brought home from learning his trade in one of the satrapies and now\nentrusted with meeting the Prism’s bride—or widow. At twenty-five, he\ncould be treated as barely an adult because he still had another fifty years\nleft in his mortal span. How different the lives of munds.\nTurgal Onesto was dressed in his Sun Day best, and smelled of some\nfine perfume Karris would have been able to place if she’d been a lady\ninstead of a warrior these blighted sixteen years. He sat, gulping. It had\nbeen a long time since he’d been asked to report. The White had recruited\nhim as a boy. For her part, Karris didn’t feel much better. She hadn’t worn a\ndress since that bastard King Garadul had captured her and forced her to.\nShe’d wanted to wear her Blackguard clothes, but those had been seized\nand forbidden her. Karris still wasn’t sure whether they’d been taken on\nCommander Ironfist’s orders or the White’s. Neither would say, which told\nher that whichever had done it had done it with the approval of the other.\nSo here she was, sending a very public message by the garb she had\nchosen to wear. Because her husband was the Prism, she would wear garb\ndrawn from each of the satrapies, to show she didn’t favor any over the\nothers. Today, that meant wearing a loose-fitting white silk abaya, subtly\nembroidered with murex purple thread, but she wore the jilbab down—\nmodesty was not prized on the Jaspers as it was in the Parian inland and"

Along with the traditional white of mourning, for Parians\nbelieved that death was a procession into light, and not into darkness, Karris\nhad chosen some few hints of bright color, not pure funerary white. She\nwore a bright scarf, white and blue and red and purple and green, though\nshe had bleached her hair white.\nMy husband is lost, and for this I grieve, her clothing said, but he is not\ndead. The richness of it said that she expected to be taken seriously, that she\nwas taking her place as a woman of means and influence. She even had a\nBlackguard bodyguard. That it was her squat friend Samite made that\nmarginally better, but the woman treated her duties seriously, standing\nbeside the table, watching everyone and everything, treating Karris as if she\nwere just another ward who would doubtless be blind, deaf, and dumb to\ndanger.\n‘It’s to free you to pay attention fully to the task at hand,’ the White had\ntold her.\nKarris crossed her legs as the banker sat. It was a thobe, not a dress, she\ntold herself. Still, it made her feel naked and vulnerable. Worse, she hadn’t\neven been able to pick it out for herself. Marissia had helped her, last night,\nasking the parameters she wished to fulfill. Karris did, though she didn’t tell\nthe slave her task. The slave had accepted her silence on that and simply\ntold Karris she could go to bed; it would be taken care of.\nWhen Karris woke, this awaited. The fit was perfect. “How…?” she\nasked Marissia as the slave woman had tied the laces.\n“The tailor still had your measurements.”\nKarris looked at her. “I haven’t been to a tailor’s shop in years.”\n“And I noticed you’d lost some weight since then, so I suggested a few\nalterations,” Marissia said, her voice level.\nThe eye for detail and the memory—the sheer bloody competence—was\ninfuriating. So Gavin hadn’t kept the woman purely for warming his bed.\nPerhaps she wasn’t good at that, at least. Perhaps he’d merely—\nWhat delusions are you filling your head with, Karris? She’s beautiful,\nshe’s competent, she’s been Gavin’s room slave for years. Karris had told\nherself she wasn’t going to be jealous of what Gavin had done during the\ntime she’d no claim on him. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right… and it wasn’t\ngoing away. She should be happy that he’d only slept with his room slave,\nand not every woman who would have been happy to have him.\nBut seeing that Marissia was eminently competent roused something\nugly in Karris. She should appreciate the woman. For Orholam’s sake, was\nshe looking at a slave as a rival? Ridiculous! She could put the woman out\nat a moment’s notice. But that wasn’t fair, either, was it?

Probably in case Karris was\nas petty as… as petty as she was.\nI would ruin a woman’s livelihood and steal her purpose from her for\nwhat, exactly? For serving Gavin well?\nServing him well all night long, no doubt.\nAnd what of it? That is her life, her duty. Would I be happier with her if\nshe had served her master poorly in petty rebellion, as other slaves do? Has\nGavin said a word about Param or Naelos, whom you took to your bed\nmostly to spite him? She’d made Param make love to her in total darkness,\nso she could imagine he was Dazen. But at least both of them were gone.\nAnd what, like I didn’t know about Marissia?\nHe’s gone, Karris. He’s gone.\nThe wave of grief came out of nowhere. Karris’s throat tightened; her\neyes filled.\nShe let out a breath like a hiss, looked away, got control of herself.\nTurgal blinked, and repeated, “Are we to have a privacy shield?”\n“Yes, yes, of course.” Karris gestured to the beautiful woman who\nserved as a greeter. Turgal’s eyes were all over her. Not very discreet, for a\nbanker. For a moment, Karris felt old and overlooked. Turgal looked at the\ngreeter like that, and not at—\nShe silently cursed herself. She’d dressed modestly, specifically so she\nwould seem respectable, and now… Back on keel, Karris.\nShe gestured for the greeter to draft them a privacy shield. Karris handed\nthe woman her payment. “May I bring you more kopi, my lady? And my\nlord, would you like something?”\nKarris acquiesced to more kopi, and the banker ordered ale. The greeter\ndisappeared into the kitchens and reappeared almost immediately. She put\ndown Turgal’s ale and Karris’s kopi and saucer, drafted the invisible\nsuperviolet bubble that would block their conversation from others, and\ndrafted the fans that allowed some airflow. She gave a big, perfect smile at\nthe young banker, bowed low enough to both of them to display cleavage,\nand went back to her station.\nProbably works nights downstairs.\nAnd since when did I get so prudish? Like my Blackguard brothers were\npure as heaven’s rain?\nAfter Turgal Onesto had a bit of his ale, Karris said, “I need to assume\ncontrol of my husband’s accounts.”\n“As you doubtless know, the Onestos never comment on the status or\nexistence of accounts. Which accounts did you have in mind?” He smiled\nunconvincingly.\n“What do you mean, which accounts? All of them,” Karris said. She’d\nknown this wasn’t going to be easy. The proximate cause for this meeting\nwas, of course, to take control of Gavin’s accounts. What else would one\nmeet with a banker for? That Turgal Onesto was also one of the White’s\nspies merely made this meeting potentially doubly productive.\n“I’m afraid that we don’t keep accounts by name, only by number.

It\nkeeps hostile nobles and kings and parents and others from seizing accounts\nthat have been opened privately,” Turgal said. He smiled pleasantly. Fop he\nmight be, but this was a conversation he had clearly had before.\nMore, it was a lie. Karris was certain of it. There was no way the\nOnestos wouldn’t keep track of the account holders’ names.\n“What happens when account holders die?” Karris asked.\n“Nothing. The Onestos don’t even have knowledge of when that\nhappens. We have no way of knowing that. As I said, we don’t link names\nto accounts.”\n“What happens to the money?”\n“It remains in the account, of course.”\n“Uh-huh, for how long?”\n“If an account has had no activity for a generation—defined by old\ntradition as forty years’ time—the monies therein are made available for\nother loans.”\nWhich was doubly a lie, and a subtle pair of lies at that. The money was\nnever put aside in the first place. The moment money was deposited, it was\nloaned elsewhere. And when he said ‘made available,’ he meant that it then\nmoved into his family’s personal coffers. It wasn’t completely unfair, Karris\nsupposed. If an entire family was extinguished, as had doubtless happened\nmany times in the various wars that had wracked the Seven Satrapies since\nthe Onestos had entered the business, and if no heirs stepped forward, what\nelse should they do with the money? Give it away? It was a perquisite of\ntaking the risks of bad loans.\nOf course, if they were less than diligent in their pursuit of finding heirs,\nit would also be a quick way to pad their own accounts. Too much of that,\nthough, would hurt their reputation. A bank was only as good as its\nreputation. So the appearance of punctilious virtue had to be of the utmost\nimport. Of course, generations of the Onestos now long dead had built that\nreputation to such a height, it was quite possible Turgal and his compeers\nfelt they could coast on it to enrich themselves.\nAnd if they thought that, they probably thought right. Their children and\ngrandchildren would pay for it, of course, but Karris wouldn’t be there to\nfeel vindicated.\n“Before you came here,” Karris said, “you looked up all of my\nhusband’s accounts to see what I would be talking to you about. Did you\nbring them?”\nHe blinked. “I can’t comment on the existence or status—”\n“Which is a yes. And you brought them. You wrote them down.” It\nwould, the White had guessed, be quite a few different numbers, and Turgal\nOnesto didn’t have his ancestors’ head for numbers. The White said writing\ndown the account numbers would be a direct violation of family policy.\nThey believed in memorizing everything. What was in your head couldn’t\nbe stolen, at least not without your knowledge of the theft.\nKarris was surprised that the White would know so much about a mere\nmerchant family, but the White believed in knowing as much as possible\nabout those who had any kind of power.

In a hundred years, she said, the\nOnestos would probably be more respected and more titled than most of the\nremaining eighty-seven and a half out of a hundred noble houses in the\nSeven Satrapies.\nIt had been a joke, and Karris hadn’t caught the punch line. Twelve and\na half percent was the typical rate of interest the Onestos charged. Twelve\nand a half, out of a hundred left… Ah. Then she got it. Here she’d been\nwondering if there really were exactly one hundred noble families in the\nsatrapies. Even the jokes told Karris how much she had to learn.\nHe reached for the slender scroll case he kept slung across his back.\nBut in addition to being given a network of eyes and ears, the White had\nalso been directing Karris to some fingers as well. Some of which were very\nlight.\nTurgal Onesto reached in the scroll case and found nothing. He upended\nit. Nothing. Empty. His face lost all color, then went green.\n“Tell me you at least wrote it in code. Your family must have a dozen\nciphers.”\n“Of course. Of course. Setback, not a disaster. It’s right…” He reached\ninto the satchel he’d brought. Groped. Blanched once more.\n“You brought the key to the cipher along with the message?” Karris\nrubbed her forehead. “You’re not making some very poor jest, are you?”\nTurgal’s wide eyes told the tale.\n“Your grandfather is going to be so very displeased.”\n“Most people don’t even know it’s a cipher!” Turgal said. “It’s just a\npiece of wood, a cone. If you don’t have exactly the same…” He trailed off.\n“You! You did it.”\n“Turgal, listen to me.”\nThe veins on his neck were standing out. A temper, huh? Well, let him\ntry something, please. She’d see just how much freedom of movement she\nhad in this thobe after all. And for however embarrassing a man might find\nit to have his bung packed by an Archer, how much more embarrassing\nwould it be to be humiliated by a woman in a thobe?\nBut then again, the Blackguard clothes were an armor that kept Karris\nout of fights. Bullies didn’t want to fight and lose. New garb, new rules.\nShe realized then that his lack of cooperation in the first place might\nhave something to do with her choice of Parian garb. The Onestos were\noriginally Ilytian, and there had long been strife between them and Paria.\nEspecially among the rich, who felt unfairly taxed when they used Parian\noverland routes for trade during the winters.\nMany nobles who were raised on Big Jasper prided themselves on\nputting those petty struggles in the past, but Turgal hadn’t been raised here.\nHe looked like another young rich urban fop, but he had the biases of his\nelders.\nKarris suddenly wondered if Marissia had dressed her like this on\npurpose.

I could have\ndelayed our meeting and showed up in front of your father with all the\ncorrect numbers. I could now expose you and destroy you. Instead, this.”\nKarris fished the cone out of her bag, along with paper. She handed both\nback, and pulled out a third paper, with the cipher correctly translated and\nput on flat paper. All done in the time that he’d taken to walk to this\nmeeting. “I don’t wish to destroy you,” Karris said. “But I will have your\nrespect.”\nThe spine went right out of him. “You have it. Please, I’m on my last leg\nwith my grandfather. He’ll disown me. If he does that, I can’t be any use to\nyou, right? Right?”\n“I have no intention of destroying you, Turgal.

But if the monies are\nin a new account, even Andross Guile won’t get them out.”\nSmart of the grandfather, then. Turgal wouldn’t last two minutes with\nthe old man. “Good,” Karris said. “Now, as a gesture of goodwill: your old\nrivals, the Adini family, have been planning to move their main Abornean\nwarehouses from the Darks to Eastland. They need more storage and the\nharbor there is better. They’ve found exactly the area they need, and have\nbeen quietly buying up the deeds. There are a few holdouts, whom they’ve\nbegun harassing. If your family wishes, you can buy these properties simply\nby telling the owners, ‘The sun shines on the obedient.’ The White expects\nthat you will still allow each of them a fair profit, because they will sell to\nyou. You, in turn, can sell those properties at a huge profit to the Adini—or\nif you so desire, deny the sale in order to hurt them. Tell your grandfather\nthat he must protect the families who sell to him from Adini retribution and\nthat he ought to send his fastest ship, whatever he decides. This matter is\nthree weeks old already.”\nTurgal’s eyes lit up. “If this is true, this will make me look indispensable\nto my grandfather. This is…”\n“Very gracious of us. You’re in business with us, Turgal Onesto, and you\nwill find us good partners. It is in our interest that you rise, but only so long\nas we help each other.”\n“Yes,” he said. “That makes complete sense.”\n“Please understand me, Turgal.

Instead, every pressure point and bribe had been\nthe White’s suggestion.\nBut then, that is how masters teach apprentices, isn’t it?\nKarris gestured to the greeter that they were done, and would like the\nprivacy shield to be withdrawn. The woman came over immediately. Karris\nsaid her goodbyes to Turgal Onesto, and passed a hefty tip to the greeter.\nThe greeter discreetly palmed Karris a bundle of rice paper documents: her\nreports.\nThe entire conversation with Turgal Onesto—as well as it had all turned\nout for Karris—was a sidelight for the White; it was the development of a\nfuture possible source, and a way to secure Karris’s independence. He had\nactually held out on one of the largest accounts, which he either didn’t\nknow about or actually had memorized. It didn’t matter, leave him his\nvictory, the White had said. It would be leverage they could use later if they\nneeded to bring him to heel. The real source here was the beautiful greeter\nand superviolet drafter, Mahshid Roshan, who saw everyone, and knew\neveryone, and heard everything either directly or through the other servers\nand slaves here. She was one of the White’s best spies, and Karris needed\nher.\nKarris got up, careful not to gaze too closely at the woman who should\nbe just another servant to her, and went on her way. At the door, she\ndismissed Samite, who pursed her lips but went.\nAt least the next part of her day would use some of her old Blackguard\ntraining—she had to make sure that between meetings, she wasn’t followed.\nIt was almost a relief to her when she was.\nChapter 17\nIn spite of the fact that many of the Blackguard inductees had just returned\nfrom actual war, their training resumed immediately, and their trainers still\ntreated them like they barely knew anything. It might have been true, but it\nstill irritated Teia to no end. The weeks passed, and the trainers acted like\nnothing had happened, like nothing had changed.\n“It’s meant to give you normalcy,” Ben-hadad said to her after another\npractice had left them all breathless, and not a few of them puking. The\nothers had dispersed. For the new Blackguards, there was always\nsomewhere to be, work and studying that needed to be done yesterday. “The\norder of it. You’ve been off where things are crazy and chaotic. You come\nback, and it’s all under control. It’s supposed to be comforting. The world’s\nchanged overnight. Prism’s gone, probably dead.

You’re barely an inductee, Teia, and we’ve all already\nheard how you led the assault on Ruic Head.”\n“Led it?” she asked, incredulous. “I just took point for a while.”\n“You impersonated a Blood Robe soldier and led their patrol into an\nambush, saving an entire unit and preserving the mission that ended up\nkilling a god.

Your third color?” Teia asked. Ben-hadad had been a bichrome\nwho’d arrived in spring—too late for the school lectures, but he had gotten\ninto an earlier Blackguard class. As his dual-lensed spectacles attested,\nflipping down one lens at a time, he had always been able to draft blue and\nyellow, and had been on the verge of green. “But…” They’d been worried\nthat if he were acknowledged as a polychrome he would be forced out of\nthe Blackguard. Polychromes were too valuable to endanger.\n“War changes everything. You know how far down the Blackguard’s\nnumbers are. They’re not going to let a Blackguard go, not one who’s\nalready in training. Even if I am a polychrome. Barely.”\n“How long have you known?” Teia asked. It wasn’t unheard of for a\nperson’s abilities to expand in their teens; most bichromes and polychromes\nstarted with one color and expanded gradually, but there was something odd\nabout how Ben-hadad said it.\n“I’ve been able to draft credible green for three months now.”\n“You shit!” she said. “You didn’t tell me?”\n“You were busy with Kip. All the time, on duty and off.”\n“He’s my partner.”\n“Was.” Ben-hadad’s eyes widened, like he’d given something away.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” Teia asked.\nBen-hadad’s jaw clenched, and he scowled, then said, “War changes\neverything. I thought maybe it could change that. You know.”\n“Know what?”"

If a loyalist had picked him up, we’d\nhave heard by now. If a slaver had picked him up, they’d have asked for a\nransom. They don’t hold on to prizes like a nobleman’s son.”\n“He’s not dead.”\n“Even if you’re right, he’s dead to us. Even if he survived, he attacked\nthe Red, Teia. He can’t be a Blackguard.”\n“The Red is lying. There’s no way Kip—”\n“Because Kip never acted on a mad impulse before, right? He’s so\nlevelheaded. Orholam’s balls, Teia. It doesn’t even matter what really\nhappened. The Red is the Red. And he’s the head of his family. And he’s\nAndross Fucking Guile. If Kip comes back here, it’s suicide. He’s out of\nyour life. I just thought…” He blew out a breath, seeming to deflate. “Look,\nI’m sorry I said anything. This was not…”\n“Not what? Not what?” Teia demanded.\n“Look, I—dammit! Forget it!” He stormed off.\nAsshole! Teia turned her glower on a little slave girl who was staring at\nher.\n“Pardon me, Mistress,” the girl said. She gulped. She couldn’t have been\nmore than ten, hair in tails. There hadn’t been any wars recently enough that\nshe could have been seized in them, which meant the girl had been sold by\nher parents. Betrayed.\nTeia made her face a calm mask. No need to frighten a helpless girl with\nfury that had nothing to do with her. “Yes, caleen?”\n“A man sent me to tell you he must meet with you immediately. He’s in\nyour room.”\n“A man? What did he look like?” Teia said.\n“Tall, Mistress. Red hair? Smiled a lot?”\nTeia cursed loudly, scaring the slave girl. “I’m sorry. You may go. Thank\nyou.”\nIt was time. Master Sharp had her job. One job, and she’d be free. Right.\nTeia knew how that worked. One job, to get you in deeper. How dumb did\nhe think she was? On the other hand, what choice did she have?\nHow awful could it be?\nShe didn’t want to think about that. She went to her room—Kip’s room\n—quickly. She hesitated in front of the door, then, figuring that Master\nSharp could kill her quickly, invisibly, and without leaving a trace no matter\nwhat she did, she opened the door.\nMaster Sharp was seated on her bed, legs crossed daintily, hands folded\nin his lap. He favored her with a large, beautiful, false smile. “There’s a ship\ndocking within an hour. It’s called the Red Gull, from Green Haven. There’s\na man aboard, a mund, Dravus Weir, distinctive red and yellow and green\nhat. He’ll be carrying a bundle of papers. Maybe in a messenger case, silver\nscrollwork on the ends. But maybe not.”"

But maybe not.”\n“You know I’m red-green color-blind. And if the papers aren’t in a case,\nI won’t be able to see them regardless,” Teia said. “You know—”\n“I’m well aware of your limitations. I’m trying to figure out your\nabilities,” Master Sharp said. “You’ll be expected to… relieve him of those\npapers before he makes it to the Blood Forest ambassador’s residence.\nDravus Weir is a spy, so he’ll be on his guard. Whatever happens, you are\nnot to let him identify you. I’ll trade you those papers for your papers. You\nunderstand? Your freedom, for one little theft.”\nOf course she did. She’d been dreading this task for—“Did you say one\nhour?” she asked. It would take her that long just to get there.\nHe smiled his selachian smile.\n“Get out,” she ordered.\n“Pardon?”\n“I have to change. I’m not going in nunk’s clothes. Now. I don’t have\ntime for your nonsense.”\nHe slapped her heavily, knocking her down. “Remember who gives the\norders here, caleen. You can show respect, or you can be taught it.”\nTeia stood on shaky legs, fists clenched. Time’s wasting, Teia.\nShe shucked off her gray inductee’s trousers and tunic and stared death\nand vengeance at Master Sharp as she pulled on her discipula’s garb. It\nwould stand out less than the inductee’s clothes, but still more than she\nwould have liked. Unfortunately, she wasn’t rich enough to have more than\ntwo changes of clothes.\nMaster Sharp merely watched her passively. “What’s the vial you wear?\nOil? Perfume?”\n“It’s nothing.”\nHe let her get away with it. “I’ll be in front of the Crossroads tavern.\nTwo hours.”\nIn minutes, Adrasteia was moving quickly through the crowded\nafternoon streets of Big Jasper, blotting out fear with action. Once there was\na gang that saw her, but she managed to lose them. It took another few\nminutes from her, though. Once she thought she saw Kip, stepping out of a\ntiny shop in a cross alley, but it was just her imagination—or her guilty\nconscience.\nThis one thing, and she was free.\nIt wouldn’t be real freedom, of course. She’d be snared in something\nworse. But getting her papers would mean that ownership of her couldn’t be\npassed around. She’d be a slave still, but only informally a slave to Master\nSharp. Freeing herself from one man would be a hundred times easier than\nfreeing herself from all the laws of the satrapies.\nI’m a slave, not a fool.\nBut would she rather be tied to Master Sharp, or to Mistress Aglaia\nCrassos? Murder Sharp was brutal, but Aglaia was respectable. He hid in\nthe shadows; she hid in the light. Teia would take her chances with\nshadows. Do the job, Teia. You’ll need all your wits for this one."

She had no time to access her tools, her disguises.\nShe hadn’t studied the man she was supposed to rob. There was more going\non here. It could be that Murder Sharp simply didn’t know that he was\nasking the impossible, or it could be more.\nIt was more. Teia was sure of it. But if it was more, what could it be?\nWas he setting her up to fail? Why?\nStill thinking. Time for that later. The first thing Teia needed to do was\nmake sure she succeeded. While the drab white dress of a Chromeria\nstudent with her hair pulled back by her gold-colored scarf was less\nconspicuous than her inductee’s garb, it still wasn’t good enough.\nIt was ten blocks before she found what she was looking for: a boy,\nperhaps twelve years old—younger was important—out in front of a shop,\nsweeping the area clean, alone, hardworking, wearing an apprentice’s\nclothing and a hat with a wide brim, plain.\nShe put a little sway into her walk. He glanced up, stared at her, looked\naway shyly, then glanced again.\n“Hi, handsome,” she said, walking straight up to him.\n“Who?” he said, looking left and right. He blushed. “Me? Uh—”\nShe kissed him on the mouth, pulled his hat off, and slid her body up\nagainst him. His entire body locked up. She released him. “Thanks,” she\nsaid, putting his hat on her head.\nHis mouth hung open, but he was speechless.\nShe glanced back before she went around the corner, and blew him a\nkiss. He was holding one finger up, but he didn’t move. The broom had\nfallen to the paving stones at his feet, forgotten.\nFor the next two blocks, she jogged, just in case he came to his senses.\nThen she started scouting the laundry lines, looking for something her size.\nLaundry was supposed to only be dried in the heat of the day, so that the\nbeams of light from the Thousand Stars wouldn’t be blocked if they were\nneeded in the late afternoon or evening, but of course not everyone\nfollowed the rules. She had flexibility for what she stole, of course. She had\na belt if the trousers she ended up taking were too large, and as long as the\nshirt or tunic wasn’t enormous, it could work. But baggy clothes could be\nsloppy, and if she had to run, she didn’t want trousers that would fall down\naround her ankles.\nShe slowed as she saw what she wanted. A boy’s trousers, and a tunic,\ntogether on a line, one story up, with a cart parked right underneath them. A\ngirl perhaps six years old was holding the pony, keeping the cart while her\nfather or mother was inside.\nTeia broke into a jog and jumped up onto the back of the cart, then\nstepped up onto the edge of the bed like a cat walking a fence. She snatched\nthe trousers and tunic, dropped to plant one foot on the driver’s seat, and\nrolled as she hit the street."

She snatched\nthe trousers and tunic, dropped to plant one foot on the driver’s seat, and\nrolled as she hit the street.\nShe rolled to her feet not five paces from the little girl.\nTeia winked at her and smiled. Then she bowed. The child looked so\nshocked that Teia thought she might not say anything at all.\nThen the little girl burst into tears.\nWalking as quickly as she could, Teia hadn’t quite made the first corner\nwhen the little girl’s mother ran out to her. Mercifully, the child was so\ndistraught she couldn’t explain that a woman had fallen from the sky. Teia\nmade it away cleanly.\nShe avoided the main streets, preferring the slight possibility of crime to\ncrowds. Then she ducked into a bakery’s doorway. This late in the day, they\nwere closed, lanterns extinguished.\nTeia pulled on the trousers under her dress, glanced up and down the\nstreet, and only saw a few women who didn’t seem to be paying attention,\nand shucked off her dress. She pulled on the tunic, folded the dress quickly,\nbelted trousers and tunic, bloused everything so it was baggy. Put on the\nhat, tucked her hair up into it, then stuffed the folded dress down to her\nstomach inside the tunic. The belt held it in place, and it helped flatten out\nwhat little curves she had.\nIt was depressing how little she had to do to make herself look like a\nboy.\nShe was back at the docks ten minutes later. When you came in to port,\nall your awe was taken by the city’s domes and stars and the Chromeria’s\nseven gleaming towers. Coming to it from the city was different altogether.\nTo call the docks extensive was an understatement. Big Jasper was one of\nthe largest cities in the world, and almost all of its supplies had to be\nbrought in by ship. The system looked like chaos to the uninitiated, though\nTeia had once heard a fellow student whose father was a stevedore wax\npoetical about the symmetry and art of it all. To her, it looked like an ant\nswarm. Thousands of people crisscrossing, a snarl of ships of every size,\ncarts streaming in and out, queues of burly men going in one way, and\nwomen with abacuses ticking off beads for purposes Teia couldn’t even\nguess at.\nTeia walked straight up to a man who was answering laborers’ questions,\ndirecting them this way and that. “The Red Gull?” she asked, lowering her\nvoice an octave.\n“Pier Twelve, green side.”\nTelling him that ‘green side’ didn’t help a color-blind person would just\ndraw more attention to her, so Teia kept her mouth shut and walked.\nThe Red Gull was already docked, and before she even got onto Pier\nTwelve she saw a dandy in a wide hat of a couple different shades and\nyellow. Her man. Amazing luck.\nHe looked slightly the worse for wear from his time on the ship, relieved\nto have solid ground underfoot again. He was whistling.\nTeia drew in paryl, cupped loosely in her hand, drafted off center so it\ndecayed rapidly back into its spectrum of light, but now focused in a beam."

She had to do it quickly. There was no way she could put\non spectacles—which only the wealthy could afford—and maintain her\ndisguise, but if anyone saw her pupils, they’d likely shout.\nThe light cut through his garments, through his hair, though it wasn’t\npowerful enough from this distance to go through his heavy leather gloves\nor boots. She watched him as he went past.\nBelt buckle, sword, coins tucked in a breast pocket. All these lit up,\nwhite in her vision. But no silver scrollwork document case.\nIf he had the documents on him, they were either tucked into his boots\nor gloves or lengthwise beneath his belt—or made of thin enough paper that\nthe paryl went right through them. No matter what, she was darked.\nShe fell in behind him, following thirty or forty paces back. If he was\ndelivering papers to the Blood Forest embassy, she had about fifteen\nminutes to make the grab. She knew Big Jasper well, but she didn’t know\nhow well this spy knew it. Neighborhoods between the docks and the\nembassy district weren’t nearly as bad as those farther north.\nThe spy walked confidently, though he did check behind himself once in\na while. He never looked at a map or asked for directions. So he knew the\ncity.\nTeia couldn’t follow him and close the distance while he was being this\ncareful. Disguised as a skinny poor boy in a hat, she could blend in well,\nbut the man was a spy. Surely he’d notice her before she could catch up and\nsteal from him.\nIf he knew the city, and if he was heading directly to the embassy, there\nwere two alleys between main thoroughfares that he would cut through at\ndifferent spots.\nIt was a gamble, but it was the best Teia had.\nThe spy brushed his left glove, as if reassuring himself that something\nwas still there. That was it. Luck!\nTeia peeled off and turned left where two roads diverged. After half a\nblock, she began jogging. It drew attention, but not too much. Apprentices\noften had to run when performing chores for their masters.\nShe circled several blocks, jogging fast. The crowds thinned out, and she\nturned down the street that should intercept the spy. Too late. He was\nalready there, heading across the road, crossing in front of her. Teia cursed\nquietly, and doubled back.\nOne last chance. This time, she ran full out to make it to the last alley.\nShe was small enough that she might still have looked like a boy playing.\nShe tried not to let her panic show in her face. She’d only have one chance.\nShe turned down the cross street and made it to the alley entrance.\nHeaving a few deep breaths and trying to calm her nerves and steady her\nhands, she ducked her head low so her face would be hidden and headed\ninto the alley.

If she were quick, she could intercept him as he passed through a\nnarrow spot. Perfect.\nTeia kept her head tilted, hat down, shielding her eyes. There wouldn’t\nbe a whole lot of grace in this one. She would do a bump and grab, and if he\ndidn’t notice immediately, he probably would within a few seconds. There\nwas no crowd here, no distractions. She’d just have to hope she was fast\nenough to get away. She was already plotting escape routes—but let that be.\nPay attention. First thing’s the grab.\nShe stepped through the narrow spot just as the spy did. She pretended a\nstumble. He brought his hands up and pushed her away. She grabbed the\nnotes, but it wasn’t clean. She tugged a bit of sleeve, too, and the spy turned\nas she yanked the letters free. Shit!\nAnd then something happened too fast for her to follow. The shadow of\nthat narrow spot in the alley came alive, detached itself from the very wall it\nhad been part of, and imprisoned her arm.\nIt whiplashed her back toward the spy. Something warm splattered\nagainst her lips and neck. The spy raised his hands, panicked—his throat\nslashed open, his jugular fountaining blood all over Teia.\nTeia pushed the spy away and he fell, gasping like a fish. The shadowed\nassassin put something into her hand.

She tried to look in paryl, but she couldn’t control it. She was frozen.\nShe looked at herself—covered in blood, bloody knife in her hand, dying\nman at her feet.\nA sharp sailor’s whistle blew in the air, the three-tone call for help.\nUnmistakable for anything else. “Good luck,” the air said.

After he’d taken the Ilytian galley, they’d headed directly to\nport. The Ilytian sailors who had survived the attack had been chained to\ntheir own oars, replacing the dead slaves, given fresh oars from the supplies\non the Bitter Cob, and kept strictly away from the Cob’s crew.\nAway from Gavin.\nThe Bitter Cob had dropped anchor a fair distance from whatever the\nnearest town was. The slaves thought it was Corrath Springs, though more\nthan half the slaves were Angari and therefore strangers to the Cerulean\nSea, so Gavin figured everyone was guessing, putting a name on a place to\ntry to give themselves some illusion of control over it. The other galley,\nRage of the Seas—a grandiose title, but the Ilytians didn’t have much use\nfor modesty—had been manned by Gunner’s first mate and the third mate,\nwho hated the first mate, and Leonus, who hated everyone.\nGavin thought it was a smart move. Men who hated each other were\nmuch less likely to collude. If the officers came back with wildly different\nstories of how much they got paid for the galley and cargo, you could ask\nLeonus. Not a foolproof design, but reasonably good, especially if the next\ntime you sent different men.\nThe crew who’d stayed behind were unhappy about not getting a chance\nfor shore leave, but Gunner silenced that in short order with a few beatings.\nThe mates and Leonus came back the next morning, having sold the\nRage of the Seas and the slaves—and doubtless spent the night being\nentertained at a brothel, but that was a tax any wise captain was willing to\npay. They hoisted anchor and headed out immediately. The only supplies\nthe men had brought back were barrels of hardtack and barrels of brandy.\nThe galley slaves all got a measure, with a double for those in the first six\nrows. Leonus shorted them all, though, setting aside enough for himself that\nhe got thoroughly sick.\nIt was also thoroughly stupid. If he’d only shorted a few of them, or\nthose in the back, he could have stolen the same amount of drink. Instead,\nhe was uniting the slaves against him.\nOnce they’d been under way for a couple of hours, Gavin was chained,\nreleased from his oar, and bundled upstairs. He was taken to the poop,\nwhere Gunner was waiting.\nGavin was forced to kneel again, and his chains locked to a ring on\ndeck. He didn’t fight, didn’t grimace.\n“You’re a problem,” Gunner said. He dismissed Leonus and the other\nsailor who’d brought Gavin up. He had his curious white gun-sword hoisted\nover his shoulders, and was hanging his hands off it like it was a yoke.\n“My apologies,” Gavin said. In quick glances, he studied the blade\nagain: white and black, seven lambent gems. If he’d been able to see colors,\nit probably would have been even more impressive.\n“How long until they name your replacement?” Gunner asked.\n“Men like you and me can’t be replaced, Gunner, only followed.”"

But then, “Answer the question, Six.”\n“Prisms and Prisms-elect are traditionally only named on Sun Day. If he\nor she dies before Sun Day, most of the duties are deferred, and the\nbalancing is accomplished through manual means—that is, drafters around\nthe world being told not to draft as much of one color, but more of another.”\n“Good news at last,” Gunner said. Then he spat over the deck.\n“‘Traditionally’?”\n“During wars, four times Prisms have been named early, with the final\nceremonies put off until Sun Day.”\n“So you could already be replaced?” Gunner said. “Good thing you’re\ngood on an oar, I guess.”\nOh, Gunner was worried that if he didn’t ransom Gavin before another\nPrism was named, Gavin’s value would go down. Orholam’s sweet saggies,\nlike Gavin was property. The thought clanged, dissonant, the vibrations\nshaking sand from surfaces that had been smooth, revealing rusty nails\nbeneath the surface. It was one thing to be forced to row. Even to be beaten\nwas hard and infuriating, but nothing more than Gavin had dealt with in\ntraining. Sore muscles? He’d had those for five hundred days straight as\nhe’d designed the skimmer. He’d had men and women try to kill him, he’d\nbeen hated and feared everywhere he went. But to be a slave?\nNo, this was an unpleasant land he was visiting. It wasn’t his new home.\nGood on an oar? He would escape or be rescued, there was no question of\nit. He wasn’t a rower; he was simply rowing for a time.\nGavin owned slaves. When he saw stray looks on their faces, fear or\ndespair or disgust, he judged whether it was an assassination attempt—and\nif it wasn’t, he dismissed it. Dismissed them. Because they were beneath his\nnotice.\nThe only slave he’d treated like she was human was Marissia. He’d been\ngood to her, at least. More than good. He’d been an excellent owner to the\nslave closest to himself. That had to count for something.\n“You’re certain your father doesn’t want you back?” Gunner asked.\n“You saw where that sword was, didn’t you?” Gavin asked. He meant\nwhen Gunner had fished him out of the water. He didn’t remember it\nhimself, but he’d been told he’d been impaled on the damn thing. “My\nfather put it there.”\nThat was true, as far as it went. Gavin had taken the dagger into his own\nchest when he saw it was him or Kip. An odd touch of mad heroics. And\nnow Kip was drowned. Which showed all the good heroics do.\n“What do you want?” Gavin asked.\nGunner spread his arms, soaking up the sun. His jacket parted over his\nsinewy bare chest, and he held the ivory and ebony musket-sword easily.\n“Gunner wants a legend,” he said.\n“You’ve got two. The Sea Demon Slayer?

Bit of luck to that shot, I admit.\nWithout her bein’ able to turn, fight was over like that. No one else even\ndied.”\n“The mate blown off the wheel was Shales’s kin?” Gavin guessed.\n“Sister. He’s been following me since. Found me at a bunkhouse in\nWiwurgh. Started a fight. I busted out half his teeth. Found me at a\nwhorehouse in Smussato. Challenged me to a duel. I suggested pistols.

To let him\nthink he’ll catch me, if he just gets the wind right, or if I make one mistake.\nNot sure how he motivates his crew. Imagine they’ll mutiny someday.”\n“So you’re letting a lethal problem fester because… why? Because\nyou’re bored?” That Gunner hadn’t killed his pursuer either said Gunner"

Because\nyou’re bored?” That Gunner hadn’t killed his pursuer either said Gunner\nwas a better man than Gavin had thought, or a far, far worse one.\n“Gunner likes that word. What’s that mean?”\nWhich… oh, fester. “Get worse. Like a wound that gets gangrene or\nleaks pus.”\n“Knew it was a good one. You’re a smart man, Prism. Festure.”\n“Fester,” Gavin said before he could stop himself.\nMurder passed across Gunner’s face in half a second, then departed.\n“Fester,” he said carefully. “What would your father do if I sent him your\neyes?”\nGavin suppressed a quick stab of revulsion and fear. “That depends.”\n“Pray tell.”\n“He would doubtless make some public expression of grief. That would\nbe a mummer’s show I should be sorry to miss. He’ll come after you\nregardless, but you tell me, are my eyes still prismatic?”\nGunner’s fist came out of nowhere, crushing the side of Gavin’s face.\nUnable to defend himself in his chains, on his knees, Gavin crashed heavily\nto the deck. He heard a mechanical sound and looked up, blood filling his\nmouth, to see Gunner had the musket-sword loaded, cocked, and pointed at\nGavin’s head.\n“You mock me?” Gunner asked.\nWhat? “My eyes,” Gavin said. “Do they look like prisms? Do they\nreflect light anymore?”\n“No, plain blue,” Gunner said, staring down the barrel. “Ah, prismic.\nRight. ’Pologies.” He hoisted up the gun. “Prismic?”\n“That’s right,” Gavin said.\n“Prismic?”\n“Prismatic,” Gavin admitted.\n“Prismatic. That’s right. Your eyes did used to be all prismatic. If\nGunner popped ’em and sent ’em to Papa, he’d think that I don’t have his\nboy after all. Looks like you keeps your peepers. ’Course, I could pop one\nout. Just because.”\nKarris, could you please come and save my ass? While there’s ass left to\nsave, please? “You know, Gunner, I like you a lot. But you frighten me.”\nGunner smiled big, and the danger passed. He looked out at the sea\nagain.\nGavin thought to speak, then thought better of it. Gunner was pensive.\nLet him think.\n“A great musket and an impossible task,” he said after a long minute.\n“Hmm?”\n“That’s what I want. That’s all.” He looked at the musket-sword he’d\npulled from Gavin’s side, somehow without killing him. “I used to want to\nmake the perfect musket. This destroyed that for me. I can never make one\nthis good. I used to want to shoot the Everdark Gates. This ship has\ndestroyed that for me. It’s all been done.” He stomped on the deck. “Gunner\nwas born too late. The last impossible task in this world, he accomplished in\nhis youth.”\nHe sank into himself, the bright sun no longer penetrating his darkness."

The last impossible task in this world, he accomplished in\nhis youth.”\nHe sank into himself, the bright sun no longer penetrating his darkness.\n“I don’t think that’s true,” Gavin said. “There are a dozen challenges\nworthy—”\nThe butt of the musket flashed out, slamming into Gavin’s stomach and\nknocking his wind away.\n“Do not think to placard me, Guile. I’m no child to be twisted round\nyour twosies. Take him below!” he roared. “Now! Before Gunner blows off\nthe head of our prize!”\nChapter 19\nEven as Teia’s feet beat the paving stones, her mind locked up. She was like\nan animal. She got to a narrow intersection in the alley, and realized she had\nthe bloody knife still in her hands. She skidded to a stop, turned, and flung\nthe knife down the alley, then turned and went the other direction. The\nringing of the steel on the stones felt like another alarum bell. She scrubbed\nher face with a sleeve. It came away bloody.\nShe was covered in blood. Dear Orholam save her. Teia sprinted down\nthe block, slowed to a walk at the corner, entered the main street, and\nmoved toward the first shop. It was a wool carders’ and weavers’ store,\nbroad shutters open, some of their wares displayed on the street. Seeing an\nold, toothless woman at the counter inside, Teia squatted down between a\nrack of woven goat wool ghotras and the wall outside. If the woman came\nout, the opening door would shield Teia from her.\nThere was only long enough to wonder if she’d made a terrible decision;\nthen the whistles started. Teia heard men running, not ten paces away. The\nwatchmen, blowing their whistles, high and angry. Running toward the\nmurder, though, not away from it. Trying to figure out what had happened,\nright now, not yet trying to catch who’d done it.\nIt was agony not to be able to see anything, but Teia kept down, and in a\nfew more seconds, the door squeaked open and not just the old woman but\nanother woman as well walked out of the shop past Teia.\n“What you figure they’re on about this time?” the younger woman\nasked.\nTeia vaulted through an open window into the shop and with light, quick\nsteps, darted up the heavy stairs. The large room upstairs was packed to the\nrafters with raw wool, but the door to the roof was bolted and locked.\n“Jofez?” a man’s voice called out, apparently having heard her steps.\n“You up here?”\nOh, blackest hell!\nShe heard footsteps on the stairs and moved behind one of the stacks of\nwool. The man hadn’t brought a lantern with him, but neither had she, and\nher eyes weren’t accustomed to the darkness. She’d frozen up before and let\nfear stop her from dilating her pupils consciously. What if she always did\nthat? What if she was destined to fail when it really mattered? What if—\nTeia closed her eyes, let out one breath, and opened them again. She felt\nthe stretching as her eyes dilated open, wider, wider to good night vision\nand into sub-red."

She felt\nthe stretching as her eyes dilated open, wider, wider to good night vision\nand into sub-red.\nThe warm blob of a man standing on the landing at the top of the steps\ncame into the soft focus that was the best you could get from sub-red.\nHottest at the face, hot everywhere skin was bare, duller everywhere clothes\ncovered skin, except groin and armpits.\nShe tried to circle opposite the man, but in staring at him rather than\npaying attention to the darkness around her, she stubbed her foot against the\nwooden base beneath a stack of raw wool. It made a dull thunk.\n“Jofez?” the man repeated, stepping closer.\nSub-red wasn’t good enough here. With speed she didn’t know she had,\nTeia relaxed her eyes further and drafted a paryl torch, but the paryl light\ndidn’t cut all the way through the heavy wool. Useless.\nCome on! Her desperation lent her will, and the paryl light sharpened\nand stabbed the way through edges of the wool stacks. It illuminated them\nonly dimly, but it was enough for her to make out the figure stepping\nforward mere feet away from her. She wended her way through the stacks\ncarefully, able to make out every detail of the ground easily, not making a\nsound now.\n“Melina, if that’s your damned cat again, I’m gonna kill it. Scares the\nhell out me all the time, doesn’t even catch rats.” He continued grumbling\nand made his way down the stairs. “What the hell is going on out there?” he\nasked, finally hearing the whistles.\nThen he was gone.\nAdrasteia breathed. She was almost out of paryl, so she let the light die\nout.\nShe didn’t have much time. This was a dead end, so she had to move.\nShe navigated her way through the stacks until she found washed and\nbleached wool by smell and touch, and then grabbed some and scrubbed her\nhands. She had no mirror, and no idea of exactly where she had blood on\nher, but she’d have to do the best she could quickly. She tucked what she’d\nused deep into the pile—maybe they’d blame the cat and think it had killed\na rat here. Sorry, folks.\nThen she stripped off the boys’ clothing she’d stolen and rubbed her face\nand chest and arms with the clean back of the tunic, hoping she was\ncleaning off all the blood. She pulled on her dress in the darkness, fumbled\nwith the laces.\nHurry up, Teia. Get moving.\nShe debated leaving the bloody clothes here, but it might only be\nminutes before someone came upstairs with a lantern, and if they put things\ntogether, the guardsmen would immediately start asking if anyone unusual\nhad been seen leaving the shop. Someone in the neighborhood would say\nthey’d seen a discipula, and the search would be quickly narrowed.\nSo she was going to have to carry bloody clothes—damnation!—right\nunder their noses. She folded the clothes as tightly as she could, pulled off\nher hat, stuffed the clothes inside it, and walked downstairs, trying not to\ngive away the riot inside her chest.\nNo one was in the shop, but quite a few other shopkeepers and passersby"

Teia scanned\nherself for blood. It looked like the dress was clean—she’d worried that\nblood soaking her shift might have wicked through the dress, but as far as\nshe could tell she’d been lucky. She glanced around for a mirror. There was\nnone in the shop.\nWith her heart in her throat, she stepped back over the window frame\nand caught a glimpse of her hand—there was blood under her fingernails,\nand rimming every cuticle. Both hands.\nOh hell.\nShe stepped out into the street, slipping behind the old woman. The\nyounger man and woman had already walked into the alley and left her to\nmind her shop.\nGlancing over her shoulder, Teia almost bumped into another store\nowner who was standing in the street, looking torn between minding his\nshop and going to see for himself. “They say it’s a murder,” he told Teia.\n“Orholam bless, that’s awful,” she said. She meant it. A wave of emotion\nrose up from the depths. She swallowed hard, clenched her fists and jaw.\nNot now, Teia. Not. Now.\n“That sort of thing doesn’t happen up here,” he said. “We’re good\npeople here.”\nShe made a sound of agreement and kept moving. He barely noticed her\ngo.\nIt was terror to walk against the flow of the curious, knowing that\nlooking over her shoulder would make her look guilty. She heard someone\nrunning. “Make way! Make way! Watch coming!”\nShe kept walking. A sharp whistle blew twenty paces behind her.\nDon’t run. You look like a helpless little girl. He won’t tackle you; he’ll\ngrab your arm. Then you counterattack. If you run, he tackles you. With his\nweight against yours, you’re dead.\nThe whistle sounded again, almost right in her ear. When he grabs your\narm, turn with it, bring your elbow to his head to stun him. Then run. Two\nblocks to an underground gutter. Figure it out from there.\nThen, from the pounding footsteps, she realized there wasn’t one\nguardsman, there were two. Two? Her plan wasn’t going to work for two.\nShe froze.\nThe two guardsmen ran right by her.\n“Watch coming! Make way!” one of them bellowed. They ran on, and\nwere swallowed by the evening crowds.\nWithin another block, everything resumed as normal, the crowds\nunaware of the death so nearby. Teia made her way to a fountain in a\nmarket, where some of the vendors were already closing up. She sat on the\nedge and trailed her fingers in the water as if idly. She sat up, looked around\nfor anyone watching, and rubbed her fingernails on the folded tunic.\n“Whatcha doing?” a little boy asked her. He was irritatingly cute. One of\nthe merchants’ boys, no doubt.\n“I’m a drafter,” she said. “Begone or I’ll set you on fire.”\nThe boy’s eyes widened. She faked a lunge toward him, and he bolted."

She had to keep moving, had\nto get rid of the bloody clothes.\nA few blocks away, she found a large mud puddle. She pretended to\nstumble and pitched the folded clothes into the middle of the puddle, then\nstepped on them. Mud stains over bloodstains. She pulled the caked,\ndripping clothes out and put them back into the hat distastefully.\nIt didn’t look like anyone even noticed.\nA block later, she threw away the clothes and hat in a rubbish heap. She\ncircled a few more blocks to make sure she wasn’t being followed, stopped\nat another fountain and scrubbed her face and hands. Satisfied, she finally\nheaded back for the Chromeria.\nNo one stopped her. No one knew. She’d gotten away with it. She even\nstill had the letters. Her mind wasn’t ready to start wrestling with what had\njust happened, though.\nComing back to the Chromeria was like entering another world. A world\nwithout murder, without shadows that sprang to life. A safe world. She\ncrossed the Lily’s Stem and headed toward the entrance of the Prism’s\nTower, where her room was.\nShe was almost to the door when she saw a man who looked a lot like\nKip, leaning against the wall, flipping through playing cards as if\nmemorizing them. As if there was nothing strange about it.\nHe didn’t look up.\n“Kip?” she said. “Kip!” She ran over to him and threw her arms around\nhim. “You’re alive!”\nHe didn’t return her embrace, and for one moment she had the terrible\nthought that this wasn’t Kip after all. She let go of him, stepped back. He\ndid look different: he’d dropped probably another three sevs, his broad\nshoulders emerging more and more as his fat receded. His jawline more\npronounced, face harder without the baby fat to soften it. But it was Kip.\nSomething else was different about him, too. She’d thought she’d seen him\nin town—and she had. And suddenly fear took her by the throat.\n“I just arrived. I was so excited to see you,” he said. There was no joy in\nhis tone. “This isn’t how I pictured this.”\nA weight dropped into her stomach. It was hard to breathe. Guilt raced\nall over her face. Kip saw it.\n“Kip.” The word came out barely above a whisper. It was hard to\nbreathe. “Kip, I’m a slave. You don’t understand what that means.”\n“You’re not a slave.”\n“How long did you follow me?” she asked. He couldn’t have followed\nher for long without her noticing, could he?\nKip’s expression flickered from looking like a puppy you’d kicked and a\nhard man, hiding his wounds. “You should probably change that bloody\nshift before anyone else notices it.”\nShe panicked, and set off rapidly, but his long gait kept him with her\neasily.

Maybe he’d followed long\nenough to see her steal the clothes. Bad but not damning, and he’d seen the\nblood, worse, but still not damning.\nOn the other hand, if he had seen everything—from a clear vantage—he\nwould know she wasn’t a killer. If he’d seen almost everything, he might\nthink she was.\nAnd what was the cost of telling him? You’re a slave Teia, not a fool.\nWhat does it mean? Think!\nShe got in the lift, where there was another discipulus with them, so Teia\nwas spared having to come up with more lies.\nThe question wasn’t, what am I doing, the question is, what are they\ndoing? There wasn’t one thread here, there were two.\nAs she and Kip stepped off the lift, her breath caught. So simple.\nEverything she’d stolen for Lady Verangheti—actually for Lady Aglaia\nCrassos, though she hadn’t known that then—had been metal so she could\nsee it. But everything had also been easily identifiable. She’d thought it was\nso she would know what to steal. It wasn’t.\nThey’d been keeping everything she stole so they could blackmail her\nlater—it was all proof that she was a thief.\nKip grabbed her arm painfully and pulled her around. She was suddenly\naware of how big he’d gotten. Muscle was filling in everywhere the fat had\nbeen, but so slowly that none of them had noticed, until now, when he must\nhave been starved for weeks to lose so much weight.\n“Teia, dammit, tell me the truth!”\nIt wasn’t fair, she thought, how boys do that. How one second they’re\nbig children, and the next second they can tear your arm off.\nLooking up into her friend’s face—no, her master’s face, still, despite\neverything, still her master until those papers went through—she felt\nsomething inside break, but it was sweet; it was honey dripping from a\nbroken honeycomb. He knew. She had to tell him everything and hope for\nthe best. Even if he recoiled, even if he ran away, she wouldn’t be alone\nwith this burden anymore. The very prospect was light and hope.\nKip seemed to realize how hard he was holding her arm, and he dropped\nit. “You get in a fight or something?” he asked.\nTeia’s heart started beating again. He didn’t know. Relief rushed through\nher in waves.\nHe scowled, and she saw that he knew he’d botched it.\n“I need to change, and we need to have this conversation somewhere\nwhere we can’t be overheard,” she said. In control once more, buying time,\ngetting a little space to think.\nSurely she wasn’t the only one who would be interested to learn that Kip\nwas back. Surely spies would be reporting to everyone in power that he was\nhere. Surely at least the White and the Red and the commander of the\nBlackguard would hustle as soon as they learned Kip was here. How long\ndid it take the spies around here, anyway?\nThen again, it would be best for Teia if she made it to the lavatories\nbefore meeting any of the servants of the most powerful and interested"

Teia kept her head\ndown. “I’ll be five minutes,” she said as she ducked inside. “Maybe ten.”\nThere were no girls in the barracks. Thank Orholam for small mercies.\nMost were out studying or working or at dinner—which reminded Teia that\nshe hadn’t eaten since breakfast. She closed the door behind her, and then\nwaited, listening.\n“Kip,” Marissia said, her tone constrained. “I’m delighted to see you\nalive. You’re needed upstairs, immediately—”\n“I’m sorry, but I’m busy—”\n“—at an emergency meeting of the Spectrum. It’s not a request, Kip.\nYou can come with me and we might straighten this out, or you’ll be seized\nby the Black’s watchmen and probably beaten, and the Red will get what he\nwants. What are you doing wasting time with a slave? You should have\nreported to the White immediately. Pray Orholam your foolishness does not\ncost us lives.”\n“I just got here not ten—”\n“Now, Kip.”\nFor one stupid moment, Teia wanted to go out there and slap Marissia’s\nface. How dare she talk to her friend like that? Slave? Slave? You’re a slave\nyourself, you stupid—\nTeia leaned close to hear how Kip would respond. The opening door\nsmacked her in the cheek, stunning her, though it didn’t hit hard.\n“Don’t think you’ve escaped notice, caleen,” Marissia said quietly\nthrough the crack in the door. “Why haven’t you filed your manumission\npapers? What game are you playing? For whom?”\nThe door shut, and footsteps receded, and Teia was left alone swimming\nwith an anvil.\nOne thing at a time, she told her panic. You’re still covered with blood,\nstupid. That first. She went to her bed and opened her chest and grabbed a\nclean shift. She went to the lavatory, poured water into a basin, and looked\nat herself in one of the mirrors.\nChecking quickly to see that no one was coming, she stripped off her\ndress. Seeing the splash of blood across the front of her shift, darker where\nit had dried, but still livid up at her neck where her warmth and sweat had\nkept the gore liquid, she had the sudden urge to tear it off, to weep, to\nvomit. That man, the look in his eyes, that knowledge that he was dying and\nthere was nothing he could do—\nShe took a deep breath, steadied herself against the basin.\nCareful not to smear blood against her face, she pulled the shift off.

She couldn’t get it off.\nHer stomach convulsed, but she held back the vomit. Slowly,\nmeticulously, she dipped another clean portion of cloth into the water and\ncleaned her ear, behind her ear, her cheek. She checked her hands once\nmore. Cleaned under two fingernails. She folded the ruined shift carefully\nso that none of the bloodstained parts were visible, toweled off with the\nhand towel, and pulled on her fresh shift.\nShe tried to smile at the mirror. Weak.\nIt was the best she could do.\nNow to dispose of the shift—the last direct evidence of a murder that\ncould be tied to her. The shifts were numbered on the back so the laundry\nslaves could return them to the appropriate girls. Teia tore the shift and\nripped out the number, which was harder than she expected. Just a small\nsquare of cloth, not even as wide across as her thumb, and thin. She popped\nit in her mouth and swallowed it.\nShe stuffed the shift into the bag for menstrual rags and headed to Kip’s\nroom. She opened the door carefully, her eyes wide to paryl, certain she\nwould find that damned man inside again. There was no one, no traps, but\nthere was a folded square of paper on Kip’s dresser. Teia approached it\nslowly, certain it hadn’t been here when she left.\nIt read: “T., As promised.—M.S.”\nHad this been here when Marissia had checked the room? Teia’s throat\ntightened again. Orholam, what would she have done if Kip had been with\nher when she came in and found this? The weight of the secrets was\nsuffocating.\nOpening a letter from Murder Sharp was like handling serpents. Teia\npicked it up carefully, saw that there was only paper inside, and leaned back\nas she opened it.\nIt was her papers, the deed to her very body. Signed, everything in order.\nReady to be filed.\nTeia walked downstairs, waited in a line for a few minutes, and handed\nher papers to the clerk. He checked and double-checked everything, and\nthen talked with an older clerk, who gave him a key. The man came out\nwith several fat coin sticks. He counted them out for Teia, and had her sign\na document stating she intended to join the Blackguard, then handed the\ncoin sticks to her.\n“Congratulations,” he said. “You are hereby released from all oaths of\nloyalty to any other than the Blackguard and the Chromeria.” He smiled at\nher and patted her hand. “Perk up, why don’t you? You’re free.”\nTeia had achieved what she’d yearned for above all else, what she’d\nsought for years, and she was richer than she’d ever dreamed, but she’d\nnever felt less free in her life.\nChapter 20\nKarris took the spy following her on a merry chase through the worst"

She’d walked through the poverty a thousand\ntimes, and never felt nervous, but today was different. Without the aegis of\nher Blackguard garb, she felt oddly vulnerable. She didn’t like it. In fact,\nshe hated it. She nodded to shopkeepers she’d known for a dozen years, and\nthey barely responded. They didn’t recognize her when she was wearing a\nthobe.\nWorse, their heavy-browed sons didn’t, either. She could beat any five of\nthem, of course, depending. But the skirts of a thobe were too easy to snag,\nand her own experience with getting beaten in that alley not two months\nago was too fresh for her to be haughty. She felt a stab of that same feeling\nof helplessness she’d spent her whole life fleeing.\nSomeone whistled at her. Her fists clenched. Dammit, all her instincts\nwere wrong here. It was like the world had changed, and no one had\nbothered to tell her—all because she was wearing a thobe. Going and\npunching the whistler in the face wasn’t going to get the same cowed\nreaction that it would have when she was wearing her Blackguard garb.\nNeighborhoods that should have been dangerous for her prey were instead\ndangerous for her.\nIt felt like a failure when she put on her green spectacles to let them\nknow she was a drafter. Thank Orholam she had that at least. At a single\ndisapproving raised eyebrow above those spectacles, the men gathering\nblanched and disbursed.\nIt made her wonder. Other women dealt with this kind of thing every\nday, without bloodshed, without incident—and without a drafter’s\nspectacles. Karris literally didn’t know how they did it. She wondered if\nthat didn’t make her weaker, somehow, in her strength. Another woman\nwould have defused the situation before it became a situation. Karris only\nknew how to intimidate, to evince superior power one way or another.\nShe’d had drafting for so long, she wasn’t sure how she would deal with life\nif she didn’t have it. Humbling thought.\nAnd now, she didn’t have drafting. Not really. She could wear the\nspectacles, but if she drafted, the White would know. Even if she didn’t\nknow, if she asked, would Karris lie to her?\nNo. Not to the White.\nShe was still being followed.\nShe took off the spectacles and walked straight until she found the alley\nshe’d been waiting for—long, without any other entrances, nor other alleys\nrunning parallel to it. If she were to be followed at all, her tail would have\nto follow down this alley. She stepped into the weaver’s shop on the alley\ncorner. “Scarves?” she asked. “Silk if possible? I’m a wedding guest.” She\nsmiled blandly, and the delighted woman disappeared into the back of the\nshop, as Karris knew she would, leaving her undisturbed.

Petite as she\nwas, it didn’t matter, with all her power applied so perfectly. The man shot\nup to his tiptoes and was thrown sideways. He hit the wall of the alley, three\npaces away, with a crunch. Before he could even crumple all the way to the\nground, Karris was on top of him, fingers locked around his windpipe,\npinning him to the wall, fist drawn back.\nThe man was caught in an awkward half crouch. He groaned. He’d been\nwearing a hat, and now it lay at his feet. He was perhaps forty, greasy, had\nsun-dark skin, a messy semblance of an Atashian’s beaded beard.\nHe grunted. “Tol’ me you might hit me.

He told me to tell you, this could have\nbeen another rough lesson like the last time. This is mercy.”\n“What? Another lesson?”\n“When you got beat to hell. And I didn’t have anything to do with that,\nso don’t take it out on me. Hey, you mind letting me sit down or stand up?”\nKarris let the man go.\n“My thanks.” He looked at her, and blanched. “Nine hells. You’re the\nwhite Blackguard, aren’t you? The girl, changes her hair. That bastard.\nSending me after you. You didn’t even draft.”\n“Tell me something that convinces me not to hurt you.”\n“Fine, hell with him. Didn’t pay me that much. He told me to string you\nout, make this take as long as possible. He didn’t even set up a time for me\nto meet up with him again and tell him what I’d learned. You got\nsomewhere else you’re supposed to be?”\nKarris didn’t think so. But she didn’t let the man’s words distract her. He\ncould be talking so that his friends could take her unawares. But there was\nno one else in the alley.\n“What’s your name?” she asked.\nHe grimaced. Gave up. “Dayan Dakan.”\n“You owe me, Dayan Dakan.”\n“Ah, balls.”\nIf whoever had hired him wanted this to take as long as possible, she\nneeded to reclaim as much time as she could. She ran, arriving back at the\nChromeria sweating in a very unladylike fashion. She’d considered hiring a\nhorse, but figured it would have actually been slower. Not all streets were\nopen to riders, and with the time it would take to hire a horse in the first\nplace, running was faster, even awkward as it was in a thobe. She hopped\ninto the lift, and took it as high as she could."

One was the\nnew boy, Gill Greyling, the other was the tall eunuch Lytos.\nThey looked at each other. Neither said anything.\n“Where’s your escort?” Lytos asked.\nDismissing Samite after going to the Crossroads might not have been the\nbest idea, but she wasn’t going to talk to Lytos about that.\n“Gill, you owe me,” she said. “And this won’t even be close to setting us\neven.”\nHe sighed. He clearly would have preferred to forget letting that\nstrumpet into Gavin’s room. He cleared his throat and said, “There’s an\nemergency meeting of the Spectrum. Was supposed to start an hour ago, but\nYellow and Sub-red couldn’t make it then. They’re just getting started.”\nLytos looked at the young man.\n“What?” Gill asked. “She’s one of us.”\nLytos glowered at him.\n“What?”\n“Thank you, you’re both lovely,” Karris said. She ducked into Gavin’s\nroom—it was still too strange to think of it as her own room—and tried to\ndecide if she needed to change, or if she could just use some powder to\ncombat the sweat. She looked around for Marissia. For a room slave, the\nwoman didn’t spend much time in her room.\nNow I want Marissia to be here. Not very consistent, are we, Karris?\nShe mopped her face with a cloth and then slapped powder on quickly,\nfought with her hair for half a minute, and decided history belongs to those\nwho show up. She headed to the lift.\n“Wow, that was quick. You look f—” Gill started to say.\n“Not a word, boy. Not. A. Word.” Had she really just called a nineteen-\nyear-old a boy?\nShe approached the Spectrum’s Chamber and the Blackguards standing\noutside it, and suddenly wished she looked a little more glamorous.\n“Lady Guile,” the ranking Blackguard said. It was her old counterpart.\n“Watch Captain Blademan. Good afternoon.”\n“The Spectrum meetings are only for the Spectrum, Karris, you know\nthat,” he said, stepping in front of the door.\n“I’m my husband’s representative here.” It was weak, and they both\nknew it.\n“Karris, please, don’t make a scene.”\n“It’s Lady Guile, thank you, and a lady doesn’t make a scene.”\nWatch Captain Blademan was befuddled for a moment. And a moment\nwas all Karris needed to thread her petite figure past him and open the door.\n“Lady—” He stopped abruptly as the door swung open and Karris\nwalked inside.\nShe walked over to Gavin’s seat as insouciantly as if she herself were\nGavin Guile. She sat. She didn’t see how the rest of the Spectrum took her\nappearance, because all of her attention was on Andross Guile. He smiled\nbehind his dark spectacles. The bastard.

But if not Andross, then who?\n“Hello, daughter, so good of you to join us,” Andross said. His shadow,\nGrinwoody, was standing at his elbow as always, whispering in his ear. “I\nsuppose that more than makes a quorum. Shall we get started?”\nKarris knew they hadn’t just started, but Andross liked to deadpan his\njabs. It might not even have been aimed at her. She looked around the room\nand saw that only the Sub-red was absent. The woman was serially pregnant\nand usually nursing one of her brood, but she didn’t usually let either get in\nthe way of her duties.\n“We can continue from where we were, Andross,” the White announced.\nSo it had been a jab. Well, to hell with him. Karris was here now. It was\na victory, if a small one.\n“For reasons we discussed before all the hangers-on were allowed into\nthis hallowed chamber,” Andross said, “certain, more drastic moves must\nwait. Our representatives are scouring the seas and the beaches as we speak.\nUntil then, we have to play the hand dealt us, yes?”\nKarris had no idea what he was talking about, but she could see tight-\nlipped nods among the Colors at the table. If they’d been talking just a few\nminutes ago even more privately than this, it must be something very secret.\nHe’d said ‘hangers-on,’ plural. That meant that he wasn’t just talking about\nKarris coming into the room. The Spectrum must have been meeting\nwithout slaves in attendance, even without the Blackguard. What was so\nsecret that the Blackguard wasn’t allowed to attend?\nFrom the White’s expression, Karris could see that the woman didn’t\nlike such secrets referred to even this obliquely.\n“In the meantime, we’re at war.”\nKlytos Blue shifted in his seat, like he wanted to speak out, but daren’t,\nnot against Andross Guile.\nBut Andross Guile flared with anger. “You’d deny it, Klytos? Still? How\nmany of our ships must they sink? How many of our people must they kill?\nWe face nothing less than the old gods, and those heretics who would bring\nthem back. We will have a little respite this winter—but it is a respite that\nwill help our enemies more. Few ships can traverse the Cerulean Sea in\nwinter’s storms, and our enemies are on foot. We will have only those few\nRuthgari soldiers and the remnants of the Atashian forces, under that idiot\nGeneral Azmith.”\n“That’s my cousin!” Delara Orange said. Her face was slack, flushed,\neyes bloodshot.\n“Then you’ve one idiot in your family. Or is it two?” Andross shot back.\nShe huffed and fell silent. It was an acquiescence, though, and Karris\nthought that if Delara admitted her cousin was stupid so easily, then\nAndross might actually be understating the case.\n“You need to get word to him,” Andross said, “that he is to fight\ndelaying actions only. Under no circumstance is he to risk a large-scale"

Under no circumstance is he to risk a large-scale\nconflict.”\n“Have we not sent these orders already?” the White asked.\n“We have.” Andross didn’t elaborate, and for Karris, he didn’t need to.\nShe had seen how men intent on glory could get others killed. And Andross\ndidn’t like giving an order when he had not the means to enforce its\nobedience.\n“Delaying actions?” the White asked. “How much ground are we to\ngive?”\nAndross sighed. “We will need to marshal our forces for the spring.\nRealistically, we won’t be able to stop them from advancing into Blood\nForest.”\n“There are border towns. Ox Ford, Stony Field, Tanner’s Turn,\nMangrove Point. Are you proposing we just let them die?” the Orange\nasked quietly, horrified.\n“How do you propose we save them?” Andross asked. “Do you know of\ngood options? Please. Elucidate.”\n“I—I just can’t believe…”\n“We tell the people to get out, burn it all, starve the Color Prince’s army\nas it invades. Satrap Willow Bough won’t like it, but if they won’t… we\nhave to look at the possibility that we’ll lose Blood Forest.”\n“You want them to burn jungles? In the wet season?” the Orange asked.\n“I want them to win this war in one decisive conflict with no losses on\nour side. I want none innocent to suffer. You’re asking what I want? Don’t\nbe fools. We need to win. So we need the Blood Foresters to poison wells.\nWe need them to slaughter animals. We need them to torch their fields and\ncut down swaths of jungle and force every last one of their red drafters to\nbreak the halo if necessary to put it to flame. We need them to win so that\nnine months from now we aren’t talking about what villages we’ll have to\nabandon in Ruthgar.”\nHe let that sit, and no one said anything.\n“In the interim, we’ve lost the bulk of our fleet. We could begin to build\nand borrow a new one, but I propose that we don’t even need to do that. We\nonly need these new sea chariots that the Blackguards have developed—”\n“That Gavin invented,” Karris said.\n“Yes, of course. The Blackguards merely perfected them. Whatsoever\nyou please, dear.”\nShe sat back, stung. How did the bastard do that? Make her look so\nsmall?\nAndross continued, “With the sea chariots, we can control the seas,\nwithout the cost of an entire fleet. We know this Color Prince has been\nworking with Ilytian pirates, and this way we can keep him from being\nresupplied by sea.”\nThis Color Prince. My brother.\n“We can save specific tactical discussions for later,” the White\ninterjected.\n“Fair,” the Red said. “But this we can agree on: our last battle was a\ndisaster. We can’t direct a war from afar. We’re going to need a\npromachos.”\nDelara Orange laughed aloud. “And you did such a good job directing\nour last battle we should choose you, huh?”"

You\nallowed this to blossom from a small problem to a huge one. Your defense\nwas so heinously weak, I wonder if we aren’t in the presence of a traitor. I\nnever had functional command over those incompetents you insisted on\nbeing our generals, unlike the command a promachos would have, so check\nyour memory. Maybe it’s in the bottom of a bottle.”\n“You stopped us from defending ourselves!” Delara shouted. “You\nrefused to help! You came too late, and you knew it. You want us to make\nyou promachos?”\n“Enough,” the White said.\n“I wasn’t talking about me,” Andross said. “I’m too old. That burden is\ntoo great and—”\n“I’ve lost everyone I l—” Delara shouted.\n“Enough!” the White barked. “Delara, you have our sympathies, and\nyou still have your vote, which you will lose if you’re not present to use it.\nDo not give that up. What is it you propose, High Luxlord Guile?”\nI’m too old? The old spider was admitting that? Karris could scarcely\nbelieve it. Who would he be proposing instead?\n“You all know that I had my disagreements with my son at times, but\nnone of us can deny the unifying effect he had on the Seven Satrapies. He\nwas a figurehead, but he was a well-loved one. In losing him, we have lost\none of the most important bonds that holds these disparate satrapies\ntogether. For reasons that we should all know all too well, there will be…”\nHe paused, parsing his words carefully. “Unless Orholam relents, it appears\nthere will be no new Prism this Sun Day, but by ancient law we must name\na Prism-elect. So we must all be on the lookout for Orholam’s chosen. I’m\nsure we will all spend much time in prayer. We will have to survive as best\nwe can for a year without one. That means the old orders. Every drafter\nworking together, and offsetting those who have joined the enemy.”\nKarris looked around the table and saw drawn, gray faces everywhere.\n“You’re not giving up on Gavin,” she said. “He’s not dead. You should be\nfocusing your efforts on finding him.”\n“Of course we will,” Andross said smoothly. He smiled apologetically,\nas if dealing with a hysterical woman who couldn’t bear to acknowledge her\nhusband’s obvious death. “This is merely contingency planning.”\nKarris wanted to punch his face in.\n“Why can’t we name a new Prism?” Jia Tolver the Yellow asked.\nKarris saw that at least of couple of the newer Colors wondered the\nsame, but Andross said immediately, “This is not a matter for an open\nmeeting.”\n“You’re calling this an open meeting?”\n“Only the Colors themselves and the High Magisterium may discuss\nthese matters,” the White said, clearly not happy to concur, but doing so.\n“And not the one without the other.”"

Andross was angling for something, and she\ncouldn’t see what it was.\nAndross continued, “We have worked together before through such\ntrials, and we can do so again. We shall do so again. Regardless, our needs,\nour war, and our peoples cannot wait until even Sun Day to find unity. We\nmust face two painful truths before we lose everything: my son is dead, and\nwe need a promachos.”\n“He’s not dead,” Karris said.\n“Daughter, it speaks well of your loyalty and your love that you hope\nagainst hope as you do, but prudence demands a harsher reckoning with\ntruth. Gavin is—”\n“Alive,” a voice interrupted from the door. “He’s been taken captive by\nan Ilytian pirate named Gunner.”\nEveryone stopped talking at once. Karris caught a faint glimpse of\nMarissia as the door closed behind Kip, who had just spoken. Kip! Kip was\nalive?\nAnd Gavin? Karris’s heart surged. She felt tingles all the way down her\narms. It was hope. Real hope, not stubbornness.\nIn the weeks since the battle, Kip had changed. For one thing, he must\nhave been starved, because he now looked merely thick instead of fat. He\nlooked a Guile. Strong chin, blue eyes bright with intelligence, ringed with\ngreen from drafting, broad shoulders, broad chest, thick though still\nshapeless arms. But the biggest change was in Kip’s demeanor. There was\nnothing flippant or sarcastic or jokey about him, not in this moment. He was\nfocused, quiet, unimpressed by this collection of the most powerful people\nin the world.\n“So the bastard returns,” Andross Guile said.\n“Enough of that nonsense, grandfather,” Kip said. “My father\nestablished what I am once and for all.”\n“He—”\n“Look at me, grandfather,” Kip snapped. “I am Guile. Body, blood, and\nwill. Deny it.” If you dare, his attitude added.\nThe very air seemed to vibrate with the tension as the men locked gazes.\nNo one said a word. Even Kip’s dagger of a sentence wasn’t a boy’s\ncomplaint: he hadn’t said, ‘I’m a Guile.’ He’d said, ‘I am Guile,’ as if he\nsummed up everything that it was to be part of that family. As if he were the\nculmination of it, which was true in some ways, Karris supposed. He was\nthe only Guile heir.\nThe only heir they knew about. There was still a Guile bastard out there\nthey didn’t know existed. Must never know. Her stomach knotted up.\nThe Blackguards standing outside guarding the room looked uncertain.\nBlackguards never look uncertain.\nThe air changed. Karris couldn’t tell how she knew, but she knew that\nAndross had been convinced.

He hadn’t planned for Kip to return. He was turning cards in his\nbrain, three rounds ahead of everyone else.\nFinally, a hint of a smile touched his lips. He made a slight gesture of\nacquiescence. “Please share this news with us, grandson.”\n“What did Grinwoody tell you happened? On the ship, I mean? After all,\nyou were wearing those spectacles, and it was dark.”\nWhat was Kip doing? Why did he care what Grinwoody had said? Why\noffer the cover to Andross Guile, his enemy? Karris’s stomach sank. Kip\nwas offering an out to the old spider, offering to help him cover up. Cover\nup what?\nThere would be no cover-up necessary if Andross Guile hadn’t done\nsomething wrong. That meant he was at fault for Gavin’s disappearance.\nOrholam damn him.\n“I don’t think you telling us the truth should require any rehearsals of\nwhat others have said,” Andross Guile said. Not accepting the olive branch.\nKip shrugged. “Grinwoody and I were quarreling. I’d come along with\nmy father, whom you’d summoned to meet with you. Grinwoody didn’t\nwant me to be there. I’m sure he believed you didn’t want me to be there.\nHe—a slave—laid hands on me, so I pushed him down the steps. Uncouth\nof me, and I apologize for it, grandfather. I shouldn’t manhandle your\nproperty so. With the strains of the battle that day… regardless, he ran back\ntoward us, and…”\nKip hesitated. Grinwoody’s eyes looked dead. The slave couldn’t even\nspeak for himself. He knew that when millstones like the Guiles came\ntogether, even the most trusted slave might be sacrificed without a thought,\nground to meal in an instant if Andross thought that he might gain\nsomething by sacrificing him.\n“And he stumbled into me. I stumbled into my father, there was some\nscrambling as we all tried to save him from falling overboard. But he fell in\nthe water. I jumped after him. I know Grinwoody doesn’t swim, so though\nhe offered, it would have been pointless. It was my father’s own fault that\nhe’d dismissed his Blackguards, insisted on them going to bed. Otherwise\nhe might have been saved easily. Instead, I pulled my father out of the\nwater, and tried to light a signal. But instead of being saved by you, we\nwere pulled out by Captain Gunner. He said some prayers to the sea, and\nthrew me back in afterward.”\n“But you saw that my son was alive?” Andross was intense, seemingly\nhonestly disbelieving.\n“Yes, sir. I’m certain of it. I’m surprised you haven’t gotten ransom\ndemands. Gunner recognized the Prism, sir.”\nThe White nodded. “Gavin has mentioned this pirate before. Said he’s\nquite the character, but not quite sailing with a full crew, mentally, as it\nwere.”\n“Grinwoody,” Andross barked, turning around in his seat. “I thought you\nsaid the Prism was unconscious when he plunged into the waves.”"

Cards turning. “No,” Andross said. “The shame is mine. I\nshould never have given up on my son. In this year when I have lost so\nmuch…” He trailed off as if overwhelmed with emotion. Then he put his\nhand to his heart and made the sign of the four and the three. “Orholam be\npraised.” He actually sounded sincere. Perhaps the old man really did love\nGavin in his own way.\nThe words were echoed around the table.\nAndross continued before anyone could interject. “I should never have\ntaken a slave’s word on something so important. I’ll punish him\nappropriately later. Kip! You have saved my son twice, and brought me\nnews of his life. You warm an old man’s heart. I shall have to reward you\nproperly.”\n“He’s my father. No reward is necessary,” Kip said.\n“I insist. Come to my quarters later. Now you’re excused,” Andross\nGuile said.\nThe rest of them just watched as Kip struggled with the dismissal. He\ndidn’t want to leave, but he clearly saw no way around it. He bowed after a\nmoment, and left.\nKarris was certain she’d just seen one or the other of them bought off,\nbut she wasn’t sure whom. Maybe both. The sheer gall of them to do it in\nfront of the whole Spectrum. And the sheer brilliance, to be able to get\naway with it.\nIf it had thrown Andross Guile off, though, he didn’t show it. “Well, this\nis marvelous. There will be some real challenges in getting my son back\nbefore anyone else does, but I think we can overcome those difficulties.”\nAs Kip stepped out, Arys Sub-red came in the door, heavily pregnant\nand winded.\n“What are we talking about?” she asked, moving past Karris to her seat.\nShe didn’t have her youngest child with her this time, but she did reek of\nluxin and sex. Karris was no naïf, everyone knew that greens, reds, and sub-\nreds most of all liked to mix drafting and sex. It heightened the sensations\nand the emotions. Karris didn’t care who Arys bedded, but coming to a\nSpectrum meeting sex-flushed and stinking wasn’t something Arys would\nhave done when she was in full control of her faculties.\nThe strain of rule kills us all.\nKarris had thought that Arys had at least two years left, but now she\nwasn’t so sure. Sub-reds tended to get territorial and fiercely, passionately\nprotective of those they loved as they reached the end of their natural spans.\nAnd, of course, libidinous, but a woman in Arys’s position shouldn’t be\nshowing that.

He loved it when his superior\nintelligence found such undeniable expression.\n“How is a pirate to hide for long from us? How is he to fight us? We\ndominate the seas, even if no one knows it yet.”\n“If we can dominate the seas, why don’t we go after the Color Prince\ndirectly?” Delara asked.\n“Because he’s on land,” Andross said.\n“I’m not stupid, thank you very much. I mean, if the seas are ours, why\nnot land our men in whatever place is most advantageous? Behind enemy\nlines, perhaps, and—”\n“Have you even looked at the sea chariots? We’d burn out a thousand\ndrafters trying to move a single transport ship. We can deny the seas to\nothers; we can search the seas for my son, and with grenadoes and other\narms, we can sink the Color Prince’s pirate mercenaries, but until we\nrebuild our own fleets, our armies can only approach by land.”\n“So they don’t really change anything,” Klytos Blue said.\n“Other than assuring that we can’t be attacked unawares and that we will\nknow exactly where the Color Prince is at all times weeks before he knows\nwhere our armies are, yes, I suppose they change nothing,” Andross said,\ndripping contempt. “What matters for the moment is that Gavin will be ours\nbefore long. We can’t guarantee we get him alive, of course. But no one else\nwill get him instead.”\nAnd there was the serpent in him. That what he said was true didn’t\nmake it any more comforting. The White would have said the same, but she\nwould have spoken to the emotions of the fact first, the thought of losing\nGavin through some accident or through some pirate’s fury.\nBut then all of what she’d been hearing hit Karris. Gavin was alive.\nGavin was alive. The tears of relief blindsided her, and then blinded her.\nShe didn’t want to cry in front of Andross Guile, didn’t want to show\nweakness in front of the Spectrum, but a single sob escaped her lips.\nEveryone on the Spectrum looked at her, and Karris had to bow her head\nand clamp her eyes shut to avoid breaking down entirely.\nShe should keep her eyes open. She was a spy now. She should be\npaying attention. She should be of use.\nAlive. It was hope and light and life and mercy. It was Orholam himself,\nreaching through the gathering darkness.\nFor once, Andross Guile didn’t bludgeon Karris for her weakness.\nInstead, he said, “Let us all go and send out our scouts and our messages\nand report to our satraps about this news.

How shaken was he?\nThe man made a mock of the faith at every chance.\nThe White made the sign of the four and the three, and the rest of the\nSpectrum followed her lead. They lay their hands, palms open, on the table\nin front of them, receptive, open to the light, open to truth. “Father of\nLights, Holy One, Orholam.” She aspirated the h, giving it the old\npronunciation. “Righteous Father, Strong Tower of Kalonne, All-Merciful\nOne, Comforter of the Downtrodden, Guardian of Orphans, Good Teacher,\nDeliverer, Unfailing Defender, Savior, Warrior of Justice, Supreme\nMagistrate, Worthy of Honor, Mighty to Save, Bright Morning Star, Fire in\nthe Night, Hope of the Last Tribe, Indefatigable Healer, Restorer of the\nBroken, Father, King, and God.”\nThat last sent a shiver through Karris, even through her tears. Even as\nParian men covered their hair from respect, that their glory not compete\nwith Orholam’s, so were there ways one rarely addressed Orholam—that\nname itself was but a title, a euphemism to show supreme deference, to\nshow how high above the pagan gods he was. In speaking that small word,\nhuge in implications, the White was revealing just how dire she thought the\nsituation was.\n“God,” the White breathed.\nThe room fell utterly silent. Karris fancied she could feel the play of\nlight across her face.\n“God, you are God alone. God, please save us.”\nAfter the long introduction, Karris expected more eloquence, more\nbeseeching, more… words. The salutation had been longer than the letter.\nThen she realized that was the White’s point exactly. The eloquence, the\nfocus, should be on Orholam. His was the beauty and majesty and the\npower. He knew their need. He knew how best to help them. This heresy\nwas not only a threat to an earthly order, it was a threat to the worship of\nOrholam throughout the Seven Satrapies, it was a defiance and renunciation\nof him. The White was merely declaring her loyalty and begging the help of\ntheir lord, as loyal vassals. What else, in the end, was there to say?\nIt was a mirror to the very help that the Blood Foresters in those border\ntowns would beg, and that the Spectrum had silently agreed to deny. You\nmust die, they had agreed without so much as a vote: you must die so that\nour purposes can be accomplished.\nKarris only hoped Orholam was not so callous and practical with them.\nChapter 21\nTeia hesitated outside the door of the Prism’s training room, deep under the\nPrism’s Tower, looking at a band of blue light illuminating the floor. She\nhad never seen the room illuminated with colored light before. She hadn’t\neven known it did that.\nShe heard the unmistakable percussive action of someone punching"

She hadn’t\neven known it did that.\nShe heard the unmistakable percussive action of someone punching\ncombos against one of the dummies, and oddly, that violent sound eased her\nmind. Whoever was here was training—and thus, wasn’t an enemy. Though\nshe knew from how he moved that Murder Sharp must train often, it was\nsomehow impossible to imagine him doing it. He was only the finality of\naction, not the preparation for it.\nOpening the door with the key that Commander Ironfist had given her,\nTeia went inside. She was just in time to see Commander Ironfist burst into\naction. His fists snapped out, punching the fraying leather heavy bag full of\nsawdust: stomach, chin, kidneys, and back up and down, too fast to follow,\nthen he darted off to the side, running toward an obstacle course. He drew\ntwo practice swords while he ran.\nManeuvering with even one sword in hand or at your belt was part of\nBlackguard training that Teia’s class hadn’t even started yet—and that she’d\nnoticed immediately during her brief participation in the battle at Ruic\nHead: trying to run and fight while carrying even a scabbarded weapon was\nhard work. Corners you knew your body could slip around suddenly caught\nyour hip, threw you off your step. Carrying a blade openly was even worse,\nbecause you had to maneuver it by hand—if your blade stopped on a\ndoorframe and you kept moving into it… not good.\nSo watching Commander Ironfist move through an obstacle course with\ntwo full-length swords was an education in itself. The commander was\nshirtless, wearing only his tight black trousers and the boiled-rubber-tree-\nsap-soled boots full Blackguards were issued: sticky, and nearly silent.\nWatching him explode from a full standstill was like watching a lion pounce\n—a ripple of muscles, a flash of flesh, and he was off, near full speed in\nbarely four steps.\nHe hurdled an obstacle that came up higher than Teia’s chest, ran\nstraight at a wall that had only a circular hole a pace across on it and leapt\n—diving, swords stabbing through, shoulders barely clearing the narrow\nopening, body not even nicking the edges. He rolled to his feet smoothly,\nblades flourishing.\nHe ran at another wall, barely losing speed, and ran up it. His\nmomentum seemed to flow into the wall, all of it completely at his legs, his\nhands and swords coming into his chest, waist cocking. He leapt off the\nwall, twisting, the blades flashing out to hit a dummy on either side, each of\nthem held in a box ten feet off the ground, everything below their necks\nprotected.\nThe momentum of swinging both swords left-to-right meant Ironfist\nlanded sideways. He tumbled, taking the fall, and popped back up to his\nfeet. He looked irritated. Teia saw the problem. Without maintaining his\nspeed, Ironfist had no way of leaping the chasm that was the next obstacle,\nat least not without stopping and backing up and losing precious time.\nHe saw Teia, of course, but he saw that she had no pressing business, so\nhe said nothing. He went back to his starting spot and repeated it again."

He went back to his starting spot and repeated it again.\nThis time, as he ran up the wall, he slapped the swords against the wall,\neach wrapped in blue luxin, released them, twisted his body, grabbed them\nwith the opposite hands, and leapt straight from the wall, slashing in from\nboth sides, cutting through the dummies, and landing flat. He charged the\nchasm, not losing any speed, and jumped it, skipping off a platform that was\ntoo small to stop on and then regaining speed, leaping for a rope that hung\nover the next chasm.\nHe lost a sword on that maneuver, but he spun down to the ground and\nlaughed.\n“The Prism’s own obstacle course. Of course, he cheats outrageously\nwith luxin at every turn. He challenged me to beat his time before he left. I\nthink I may just.”\nAs he approached, Teia was suddenly aware again of the sheer size and\nphysicality of the commander. Her glance at his naked, scarred chest\nseemed to make him aware of his own half-dressed state. Oddly, he seemed\nembarrassed, the old habits of Parian modesty not totally overcome even\nafter many years in the Blackguard. He grabbed his tunic and pulled it on.\n“Here to train?” he asked Teia. “I can get you started on drills.”\nTeia stared at him, somehow unable to speak. She thought of telling him\neverything. But Murder Sharp could be standing in this very room.\n“Turned in your papers, did you?” he asked. He’d seen her coin sticks.\n“Oh. Yes.”\n“Are you going to leave?”\n“Can I really?” Teia asked. It still seemed impossible.\n“If you turn in the money to the Blackguard, you’re free. You’ll be able\nto make more money as a mercenary if you stay in and leave right before\nfinal vows, but some leave at your place. If you’ve grown up as a slave,\nsometimes the thought of real freedom is too sweet to put off for even one\nmore day. Others just talk about it. I’ve known Blackguards who talked for\nfifteen years about buying their commission back—fifteen years after final\nvows, you understand—and traveling the world. Treg was in his last year\nbefore retirement and was still talking about buying that commission back.”\nIronfist grinned, but then the grin faded. “He didn’t make it back from\nGarriston.”\n“I want to be a Blackguard more than anything in my life, but…” Teia’s\nnerve failed her.\nCommander Ironfist said nothing, just folded his beefy arms and waited.\nIt was a patient silence, though, not demanding. Here was a man so busy he\nrarely slept more than five hours a night, but when he dealt with his\nBlackguards—even the nunks—he had a way of being present, unhurried.\nTeia had never really noticed how generous he was with his precious time,\nbut now that she was experiencing it, she realized how often she’d seen it\nbefore, and she added it to the long list of things she admired about the\ncommander. But…\nI’m not a slave. Not anymore. And I won’t be made a victim. I won’t sit"

It wasn’t really my choice,\nyou understand? My master? With my paryl vision, I can see where coins\nand scroll cases and the like are hidden. Half the time, I’ve been stealing\nfrom trainers who worked for Aglaia Crassos—who I just learned was my\nreal mistress all along. But I just figured out today that they were smarter\nthan I’d given them credit for.”\n“Uh-hmm.” Commander Ironfist’s face was as placid as a lake at dawn.\nHe gave no indication of what he was thinking. She was afraid some\nmonster might burst from placidity though, so she sped up.\n“They bet I’d get into the Blackguard, and they knew that once I was\nfree, they wouldn’t have any hold on me, so everything I’ve been stealing\nhas been stuff that is recognizable. They’ve probably got it all stowed\nsomewhere in a place that they can tie to me.”\n“So that’s how you knew how to disguise yourself at Ruic Head,”\nIronfist said. “How good are you?”\n“At lifting things?” Teia asked. She hadn’t thought this would be his first\nquestion. “Better than I am at fighting.” Not that she liked the fact.\n“What would you say if I told you I work for Aglaia Crassos, too?” he\nasked.\nHer heart dropped. She looked at the door for an escape. The\ncommander calmly stepped between her and it.\n“No,” she whispered. Begged. “No, please.”\nThere was no way she could make it. No way she could fight off\nCommander Ironfist if he wanted to stop her anyway. It was madness to\neven think to oppose him.\nBut what was her other option? To just give up?\nHer only hope was paryl, and even that was a thin hope. During the\nbattle at Ruic Head, she’d done something with paryl that made everyone\nwithin sight think they were being burned to a crisp, but it had actually done\nnothing. If she could remember exactly how she’d done that, maybe it\nwould be enough.\n“Relax,” Ironfist said. “I don’t. I’m just surprised that it didn’t occur to\nyou. Usually those being blackmailed become paranoid.”\nA breath whooshed out of her. “Sir, I’m so deep in my own problems\nthat I can’t even imagine how bad my life would be if she’d gotten to you.”\n“Can you describe the items to me?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“In writing?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Do so. I’ll take care of it. If.”\n“Sir?”\n“If this is all of it. You understand?”\nAll of it? Confessing to stealing trinkets was one thing, but what about\nTeia’s own brush with murder?

What was more\nplausible: that Teia had botched a theft and panicked and stabbed a man, or\nthat she had crossed some cabal of invisible assassins?\nEven if they believed her, somehow Master Sharp would find out. She\nwould wake to find him in her room again. And he would know. The\nthought turned her knees to jelly.\n“Is this all of it?” Commander Ironfist asked.\n“Yes, sir,” Teia said.\n“Then let’s go talk to the White.”\nTalk to the White?! Oh, no. No no no. Even the best liars could have a\nbad day. Teia couldn’t afford for that to be today.\nChapter 22\nTime was measured out with such perfect regularity that time lost meaning.\nGavin’s every day had a similar rhythm. Pull. Twist. Push. Twist. Pull. Up,\ndown, life circumscribed in ovals of work and rest and transition from one\nto the other. Scrape off the inefficient edges of every moment. Breathe in,\nbreathe out, try to make the motion of the one to the other as painless as\npossible. Wake, sleep, and spend no time in between. Up before dawn,\neating gruel, more gruel at lunch, sometimes with a slice of fruit to fend off\nscurvy, beans most nights, meat when they’d been particularly good. The\nship stopped at a port only once a week, though they stopped at other times,\ntoo, for freshwater and for the sailors to have a chance to hunt. But most\ndays were a blur, the round of pumping blood, or of the whip striking,\nfalling, being raised, hesitating in the air for one instant, striking again.\nUp before dawn, eating gruel. A chance at the waste bucket. Then\nrowing. Gruel, then a chance at the wash bucket.\nThe tempo ate leagues, a perfect balance between speed and exertion. If\nsome emergency came upon them—or if they were to be an emergency that\ncame upon someone else—the slaves needed to have the push to escape\ndoom or to bring it. But that didn’t mean they rowed slowly, not with this\ncrew, not with this captain, not with this accursed overseer Leonus.\nIt was measured, and it was the same when they hit bad weather, the\nlight Angari ship bobbing like a cork on top of the waves, vomit and water\nwashing past the slaves’ hardened feet. As the weather grew so bad that\nother ships stayed in port, wintering, they never slowed. These men had\nshot the Everdark Gates. A storm was a frivolity to them; they had only\ncontempt for it.\nGavin could hear the drums in his sleep. His breath as he lay under his\nbench came in the same intervals it did when rowing. His hands healed,\nformed new calluses, ripped open, bled again, fresh agony every morning.\nLeonus was a fool, but the slaves knew their business, and not even his\nmismanagement could impede them much.\nUp before dawn, eating gruel, the other slaves rubbing liniment into\naching knees and backs and hands, staving off the day when they were no"

Leonus strangled one man whose oarmates finally\ncalled him out after a spat. He hadn’t been pulling his weight in weeks,\nmaybe months. One word, and he was murdered in front of their eyes. A\nwarning to the rest of them, Gavin supposed. Gavin gathered that the usual\nway was to whip the offender to make sure he wasn’t faking, and drop him\noff at the next stop, and sell him for a pittance to some other crew desperate\nenough to take on an old, broken slave. Other slaves became beggars, some\nfew lucky ones taken in to the luxiats’ houses of mercy.\nGavin didn’t know how long it had been since he’d been taken. He\ndidn’t know where they were. They’d seized five ships, and doubled back,\nhunting or letting Mongalt Shales catch up, any number of times. They\ncould be off the coast of Paria or Ilyta or Atash for all Gavin knew. His\nbeard had grown out. His hair, like all the other slaves’, had been shaved\nshort with a razor so it wouldn’t catch on things. A pirate haircut was no\nthing of beauty, but these Angari were at least miraculously free of lice.\nClean people. Considered themselves advanced.\nOne night, after a particularly good week when they’d seized two rich\ngalleys, Gunner was rewarding the slaves. Double measures of strongwine\nand letting slaves come up on deck at night, albeit chained, and in small\ngroups.\nGavin was chained to Orholam. They sat on deck, the strongwine\nkeeping them warm. They had it so rarely that on an empty stomach, it had\nquite a kick.\nIdly, Gavin stared at the stars, trying to figure where they were from the\nconstellations. Off the Ruthgari coast, perhaps?\n“Do you know why they call me Orholam?” the old man asked.\n“Because you’re kind and kind of useless,” Gavin said, grinning.\nBut Orholam wasn’t grinning.\n“Please, no blasphemy, young Guile. Not with me. Not tonight.” He\npaused. “I was a prophet of Elelyōn in a little village on the Parian coast\nbetween the Everdark Gates. We were isolated there, of course. No ships in\nor out, all our trade having to wend through the mountain passes, even our\nnames for Orholam odd to other Parians’ ears.\n“In my youth, my village was raided by an Angari ship that had\nsomehow made it through the east Gate. The village was burned, my mother\nkilled in front of my eyes, my father killed in disgrace that doesn’t bear\nrepeating, my young brothers and sisters either taken for slaves or killed, I\nknew not which. I escaped. I lived through the winter night inside the\ncorpse of one of our oxen they had slaughtered for fun. They didn’t even\ncarry the meat back with them. Young men, laughing. I had been serving as\na prophet under Demistocles. You’re not familiar? Then I will be brief."

Then I will be brief.\nOrholam began to speak to me even as a child. Under Demistocles’s\ntutelage, I learned to discern when it was the Most High’s voice, and when\nit was my own desires. I grew arrogant. I called down miracles, and they\nhappened. You think your chromaturgy is a wonder? It is mere science. Men\nmoving bricks. But my power? Orholam’s power, unleashed from the\nheavens themselves? Like lightning compared to candle. But—and this I\nwill grant you—the latitude you drafters are given is much wider. You do so\nmuch yourselves. But to us all, drafter and prophet alike, Orholam giveth\nand Orholam taketh away. We call him the Lord of Light, but we forget that\nhe is lord.”\nA sermon. From a man they called Orholam. Just what Gavin needed. At\nleast it was different, and a good wine kick in the head can make even\nreligion bearable.\n“One day, a year to the day after I’d lost all those I loved, the Most High\ntold me to heal an Angari widow. Leprous. In the hardness of my heart and\nthe stiffness of my neck, I turned away instead.\n“The next morning, Elelyōn told me to go prophesy to the Angari. I fled\ninstead. Not because I was afraid I would die shooting the Everdark Gates,\nbut because I knew I wouldn’t. I knew he is merciful. I was afraid that if I\ntold them to repent, they would, and I wanted nothing of mercy for them. I\nwanted them to burn. Men, women, children, eunuchs and servants and\nslaves, foreigners visiting their shores, rabble and king, soldier and\nmerchant. I wished fire for them all.” His aspect took on a fierceness Gavin\nhad seen before, though not on this man’s kind face. It was a visage etched\nby the acid thirst for vengeance.\nThen it was followed by sorrow deeper than words. “I wished the very\nname of the Angari to burn and be known no more. I ran as far as I could\nget the other way, and ended up seized by river pirates at the head of the\nGreat River. I was sold and sold again until I was marched overland and\neventually sold to the Angari. As if it could be anyone else. I have served\nfor fifteen years, and for ten of it, I lived in hatred. I have been ever a slow\nlearner, but Orholam is patient.\n“Elelyōn hasn’t spoken to me in many years, but the day we fished you\nout of the waters, he did. And again last night telling me that now you are\nready. Not to hear. Not yet. But to speak.”\n“To speak?” Gavin asked. “What an odd prophet you are, to go around\nlistening.” He looked at the canopy of stars overhead. Beauty in black and\nwhite.\nThey had to be somewhere outside Melos, if Gavin remembered the star\ncharts correctly, and of course, he did. To remember was his curse.\n“I have nothing to say.”\nVery quietly, very gently, Orholam said, “He said you would speak"

That you would need to lance the boil, and let the poison seep\nout before all else.”\n“If he already knows what I’m going to say, why don’t we just consider\nit said?” Gavin said. He thought to say it wryly, but it came out worse.\n“It’s not that he needs to hear it. It’s that you need to say it.”\nGavin turned away. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n“Liar.”\nGavin snarled, “How dare you? Don’t you know—”\nOrholam looked at the sailors, who’d glanced over at Gavin’s raised\nvoice, but the men looked in no mood to break off from their own\nconversations unless the pair got into an actual fight. He said, “Don’t I\nknow who you are? Heh. You know, that was part of what I loved about\nbeing a prophet. A prophet is a slave of the Most High. A slave, but having\nsuch an exalted master gives us the authority to speak in one voice to satrap,\nsoldier, servant, or slave. I thought that made me as important as a satrap.\nReally, it’s just that we are equally small before him, ants and flies arguing\nfor precedence under the gaze of a giant.”\n“Now that’s more the kind of talk I’d expect from a prophet.”\nA wounded silence, but then Orholam said, “It is odd to me, o man in\nruins, that you who have been the answer to so many prayers should have\nnone of your own, not even now, trapped and awaiting death. I have had\nfifteen years to grow past my rage at being. You haven’t that luxury.”\n“Rage at being? Folly. Folly as much as calling fifteen years as a slave a\nluxury. I was the Prism. How could a Prism, of all men, complain?”\n“Better an honest ingrate than a liar who is still an ingrate, after all.”\n“Call me a liar one more time, and you’ll be swallowing teeth.”\n“Let me tell you something, o slave Prism. When Orholam asks your\nsubmission, you can submit now and find the way easy; or later, and find\nthe way hard; or never, and find yourself crushed.”\n“Because he is punitive and cruel.”\n“Because he is King. And the longer you walk in the wrong direction,\nthe farther you have to run to get back to where you should have been.”\n“He is no king. He doesn’t exist. He’s a comforting tale, a candle held\nagainst the darkness of our fears. There is only nothingness. It is as little use\nto curse him as it is to pray to him. We are a man who, having tripped,\nblames the stone for grabbing his foot.”\n“Why then the fear to talk to him again?”\n“First you call me a liar, and now a coward?”\n“You need more honest men in your life. Or better ears. Orholam knows\nthat in spite of all the mirrors he gave you, you still couldn’t see yourself, so\nhe took your sight. Perhaps it will sharpen your other senses?”"

But a part of that breathless, chest-seizing fear\nrose up in him again. Exposure. How did the old man know he couldn’t\nsee?\nOh, but of course. If Gavin could draft, he wouldn’t be here. That the\nman knew about Gavin’s loss of the colors, his blindness, was no\nsupernatural insight, it was mere deduction.\nOrholam laughed. “No, better than hell waits for me. For I have finally\nbowed the knee. These, our excellent hosts, have power over my body only.\nFreedom, for me, is only a matter of time. These shackles cannot hold me. I\ncould ask Orholam to take them off, and they would drop from my wrists.”\n“Prove it,” Gavin sneered.\nA fleeting irritation passed over the prophet’s face. “It’s only fair, I\nsuppose, that you should tempt me to do what got me here in the first place.\nNo. I shall not abuse the power entrusted me. I’ve been put here for me, but\nI’ve also been put here for you, Prism.”\n“Uh-huh,” Gavin said.\n“Orholam doesn’t make mistakes, o man of guile. You became Prism by\nhis will. That wasn’t an accident. There are things only you can do.”\n“Not anymore,” Gavin said. A cloud on the horizon lit from within as\nlightning sparked in it.\nBetter that he hadn’t been born. Better that he hadn’t been born a Prism.\nIf only he hadn’t started light splitting, if only he hadn’t been a full-\nspectrum polychrome, if only he hadn’t told Gavin about his polychromacy,\nhoping to mend the rift that seemed to have sprung from nowhere when\nGavin had been taken away and named the Prism-elect, everything would\nbe well. His older brother had taken Dazen’s gift as a betrayal, as Dazen\ntaking away the one thing that made him special.\nSo the real Gavin had retaliated by betraying his younger brother’s\nelopement with Karris.\nSitting on the rocking deck of the galley, the false Gavin drained his\nstrongwine to the lees. He hadn’t realized that until this moment. He’d\nthought for years that Karris had lost her nerve. He’d blamed her maid.\nHe’d blamed his own poor planning, thinking he must have let something\nslip.\nIn truth, his older brother had found out, and in vengeance, had shared\nthe secret. The White Oaks had then intimidated Karris’s maid into\nspeaking. That explained the guilt on the woman’s face that night—it had\nbeen real guilt he’d seen there, but it wasn’t the guilt of betrayal; it was the\nguilt of being too weak to stand up to pressure. A pressure too great for\nanyone in her position to withstand.\nThat look, that partial, unjust guilt, had been why Dazen left her on the\nwrong side of a locked door to burn, to die, unknowingly condemning all\nthe rest of them as well.

Gavin’s sin, and Dazen’s\nwild vengefulness, the acid that had etched his soul. Each had visited\nvengeance upon the other in a circling spire until the satrapies burned.\n“Your father chose Gavin to be Prism, but Orholam chose you. Does that\ntell you nothing?” Orholam asked.\nFor a moment, the use of the correct name took Gavin’s breath, then he\nremembered that in his shock at being captured, in a moment of blind\nfoolishness, he’d told Gunner that he was Dazen. No prophecy. Orholam\nwas the next rower on the bench. He’d simply overheard.\nBut if he had, who else had, too?\nGavin chuckled. Kind of low on the list of things I should be worrying\nabout, isn’t it? Dammit. It took me fifteen years to get up the nerve to tell\nyou who I am really am, Karris, and I told a ship full of pirates within\nminutes.\n“My father chose him because he was older,” he said.\n“Your father, the descendant of Iron Ataea Guile? Swayed by a tradition\nof primogeniture that your family has rarely observed? Your father, who\nwas himself the younger brother?”\n“He chose him because he saw will in him.”\n“And clearly his second son didn’t have that,” Orholam mocked, but\ngently. “What your father saw in you was what made him reject you, and\nthat very thing is why Orholam chose you.”\n“And what thing is that?”\nOrholam smiled. “You’ll figure it out, eventually.”\n“You got some balls, you know that? You sit up here and drink with me,\nand you tell me what a terrible person I am, and then you insult my brother\nand my father, and you smile. You fuck.”\nOrholam shrugged sadly. “This is why there are few prophets. We end\nup dead a lot. The truth is offensive to men who love darkness.” He looked\nat the sailors, still talking drunkenly and loudly on deck, some of them\nalready passed out. “I think they’ve forgotten about us.” He extended a\nhand and took the tin cup from Gavin. He waited a moment, looking at the\npirates, then nonchalantly got to his knees and reached deep into the barrel\nto draw forth additional measures of strongwine. He handed them to Gavin,\nand flopped back to sitting.\nThat was some recompense, at least. More wine. “Here’s to the profit in\nlistening to a prophet,” Gavin said. He clinked cups with the madman and\ndrank.\n“Should I make that storm come upon us with lightning and fire?”\nOrholam asked.\n“I thought you weren’t supposed to abuse your power,” Gavin said.\n“Ah. True. I forgot.” He drank. “Looks like it’s coming this way\nanyway.”\nAt the prow, Gunner was drunkenly making bets on what shots he could\nor couldn’t make.

No one was willing to bet against him, though, so he was\nberating his men as cowards. It seemed good-natured, but he had just shot a\ntin cup out of the mouth of a drinking pirate, firing the musket with one\nhand while with his other he was waving his manhood proudly back and\nforth, urinating in great figures of eight into the sea.\n“Is everyone on the sea mad?” Gavin asked.\n“A little madness keeps you from going crazy,” Orholam said. “That\none, curses Ceres? Got married young. Girl named Ceres. They thought it\nwas a funny coincidence when they learned Ceres was an old pagan\ngoddess of the sea. His two great loves were one, they joked. She\ncommitted suicide when he was on one of his trips. Drowned herself. He\nblames himself. Wasn’t his fault, really, crazy often comes out around age\ntwenty. A cruel enemy told him that Ceres heard that Gunner was cheating\non her.”\nGavin swore quietly. “How do you know this?”\n“Orholam told me.”\nGavin looked at him.\n“Just yankin’ ya. You been on ships long as I have, all the good gossip\ncomes around. Got that bit from a man who knew him before he was even\nnamed Gunner. Can’t remember what his birth name was, though. Didn’t\nseem that interesting at the time. Say, you’re a dreamer of dreams, aren’t\nyou?”\n“I dream now and again,” Gavin said dismissively. “Everyone does.”\nBut his stomach knotted up. He preferred this prophet silent and sweetly\nsmiling.\n“Powerful dreams. Dreams that scare the hell out of you? You wake in a\npanic, your chest so tight you can’t breathe, soaked in sweat?”\nAbsolutely. Gavin shrugged a maybe.\n“You’re going to have a dream, tonight, tomorrow, I’m not sure, but\nsoon. Remember it. Pay attention.”\n“You can’t make me dream dreams,” Gavin said.\n“I can’t. It’s a game Orholam and I played, back when. I say he’ll do\nsomething that I think is in line with his will, and then he kind of has to do\nit, or he’ll look bad, not me.”\n“Great game.”\n“That’s only the half of it. Every time I do that, he throws me something\nto do that I think is impossible and that I’m too frightened or too awkward\nto do. It used to be simple things, but they were hard for me at the time.\nHe’d say, ‘Go tell that woman her husband loves her.’ And I’d feel like a\nfool, a crazy man to approach a stranger and say such a thing, but I’d\nmuster up the juice to do it—and this slip of a girl looks at me like I hit her\nwith a hammer between the eyes, and she bursts into tears.

She looks at me, and she winks.\nLater, it got harder. ‘Go tell the governor that if he puts his hands on his\nbrother’s wife one more time, he’ll be dead in a month.’ That one didn’t\nmake me terribly popular. That governor took it, though. Didn’t even say a\nword to me. The brother’s wife, on the other hand? She tried to kill me.”\nThe lightning approached, and the drunk pirates watched it come.\n“Lift anchor!” Gunner shouted drunkenly. “Wake the slaves. We ride the\nstorm!”\nA pirate saw Gavin and Orholam where they were chained to the mast\nand came to hustle them down to their bench. The last thing Gavin saw\nbefore he was pushed belowdecks was Gunner standing on the railing,\nbalancing with the rigging in one hand and waving a gunsword with the\nother. Lightning cracked, highlighting his figure.\n“Ceres!” Gunner shouted, his cheeks shining with tears—or perhaps\nonly rain. “Ceres, you bitch! Kill me if ya can! I defy you! I—” And then\nthe roar of thunder blotted out all else.\nChapter 23\n“Sir? You don’t seem surprised,” Teia said to Ironfist. “Did—did you\nknow?”\n“I look like a babe in the woods to you, nunk?”\n“Sir?”\n“The Blackguard is the best of the best. The houses try to get their hooks\ninto most of our students, one way or another. They’ve been successful\noften enough that we’ve had to grow canny ourselves.”\n“So you knew?”\n“Come with me,” he said.\nHe put his ghotra on carefully and they walked to the lift. “When I look\nat you, ask me if I want you to stay at the checkpoint,” he said. He set the\nweights and they took the lift to the top, where the Blackguards greeted him\nat the checkpoint.\n“The White in?” he asked.\n“Yes, sir,” Samite answered.\nIronfist paused, looked at Teia.\n“You want me to stay here, sir?” Teia asked. Ironfist was being this\ncareful? With Samite? He was worried about his own Blackguards\nreporting… what? That Teia was accompanying him on a meeting with the\nWhite? Such a meeting would be innocuous enough, wouldn’t it? But that\nhe was being careful meant that he was protecting even this from betrayal—\nby Blackguards he’d worked with for his whole adult life. Part of Teia\nwilted. She wanted the Blackguards at least to be pure. Something had to be\npure and good, even if she wasn’t. It also made the guileless Blackguard\ncommander seem more crafty than she’d ever considered.\n“It’ll be fast,” Ironfist said, as if weighing it and dismissing the thought\nwithout too much thinking. “Come.”\nThey walked together to the White’s room. The Blackguards there\nannounced him and Teia both—Teia was surprised that they actually knew\nher name.

        "text": "her name. One should never underestimate the Blackguard, she supposed.\nThe White dismissed her old room slave and her secretary as they came\nin. The old woman had been drafting since Teia saw her last. It made her\nlook healthier, but Teia knew it was only a veneer of health. If the White\nhad decided it was permissible to draft, it meant she was planning to join\nthe Freeing come Sun Day.\nThe White studied Teia as Teia studied the White. Teia wondered what\nthe old woman saw.\n“Aglaia,” Commander Ironfist said without preamble. “Trained her in\ntheft. Has probably been keeping the items for blackmail. Explains Teia’s\nfacility with disguises. She came to me. Unprompted.”\nThe White looked unperturbed by the revelation, or by how Ironfist had\nlaunched into it without warning. “When did you find out that there was no\nLady Verangheti?” she asked Teia.\n“Just before we left—wait, you know about that, too?” Teia said. Lady\nAglaia Crassos had said that concealing her own ownership of slaves under\nthe pseudonym Lady Lucretia Verangheti had allowed her to place spies in\nall sorts of places.\n“If one is to go to the trouble of having spies, it behooves a lady to have\nthe best,” the White said. She gave a small smile. “How did you figure out\nthat she was going to blackmail you? Surely after Andross Guile forced her\nto sell you to him, you must have thought that you were free—free of her at\nleast.”\n“I did,” Teia said. The truth was more complicated. She’d thought she\nwould be free until today.\nHer first thought had been that Aglaia had sent Master Sharp to pull her\nback into her web. But why frame her for murder?\nIt wasn’t how Lady Crassos usually played things. As Lady Verangheti,\nshe had been disciplined, making Teia steal harder and harder things,\nmaking her enmesh herself more and more in the web so that she would be\nfully caught before she thought to struggle. Lady Verangheti would have\ntaken the steps one at a time: give Teia harder jobs until she balked, then\nreveal that Teia had been damning herself all along, then make her continue\ndoing worse things until Teia would do anything at all. Such a spy—\nespecially if she made it onto the Blackguard itself—would be an excellent\nweapon. And Lady Crassos seemed clever enough not to do anything that\nmight break Teia out of her web early.\nLike the shock of witnessing a murder.\nSeeing a murder, Teia might logically go straight to Commander Ironfist\nand tell him everything. Lady Crassos wouldn’t risk that.\nSo why would she frame Teia for murder?\nNo reason. Literally. Lady Crassos hadn’t done it.\nBefore the Battle of Ru, her handler had been uninterested in the\nassassination Teia had seen in the marketplace. There was no reason for her\nto pretend that if assassination was what she wanted Teia to do. It would\nhave been a great motivator: ‘If you disobey, Adrasteia, I can have you\nkilled like that. No one can stop me.’"

        "text": "have been a great motivator: ‘If you disobey, Adrasteia, I can have you\nkilled like that. No one can stop me.’\nIn fact, it was still a good motivator. A good motivator to not tell the\nWhite, or Commander Ironfist, or Kip, or anyone else, about Murder Sharp.\nTeia realized her silence was getting suspiciously long. “I couldn’t really\nbelieve I was free, and I had this terrible feeling, and the more I thought\nabout it, the more plausible it seemed that she would keep something of\nwhat I’d done to use against me. She’s… frightening.” Which was\nunderstating. “But how’d you know about this? Did you both know?”\nTeia looked over at Ironfist. He stared back at her, silent. He said,\n“Adrasteia, in this game, one must either be as wise as serpents, or trust\nimplicitly someone who is. I’ve always opted for the latter.” He inclined his\nhead to the White. Odd how only moments ago he’d seemed jaded, and now\nhe seemed the old Ironfist, too straightforward to be political. Teia\nwondered if it had something to do with his highly public loss of faith—and\nhighly public regaining of it.\n“Come here, child,” the White said. When Teia approached, the old\nwoman examined her closely, studying her eyes with a sharp gaze.\n“Commander, is there a slight violet tinge to her eyes, or am I fooling\nmyself?”\nThe commander stared at Teia’s eyes. “Could be. I wouldn’t see it if I\nweren’t looking for it, though.”\n“Spectral bleed, then. Affects even the paryl drafters, apparently.” The\nWhite heaved a sigh. “Oh, child, if only you could be two separate girls. I\nshould love to study both of you. But studying precludes using, and there is\nbut one of you. Orholam knows best, one supposes. Still.” She cast her eyes\nskyward, though there was only ceiling there, as if gently castigating the\ncreator of the universe. “Tell me, daughter, about your family.”\n“That’s none of your—” Teia bit off her words, realizing who she was\ntalking to. She swallowed. It was a perfectly neutral question, even friendly,\nbut Teia had hoarded up the knowledge and the shame of her family for so\nlong that any inquiry felt hostile.\n“High Lady, perhaps this isn’t the time,” Commander Ironfist said. “We\nhave only minutes—”\nThe White didn’t take her eyes off Teia, but her tone sharpened. “I’m\nknown to have a keen interest in young people. Age is allowed her\neccentricities. When you leave, Commander, you’ll shrug and say, ‘You\nknow how she is with young people.’ Then smile and go about your\nbusiness, and the spies will, too. Family, child.”\n“Father’s a trader. Was. Day laborer now. Two sisters, younger. My\nmother isn’t worth speaking of.”\n“Your shame says different.”\nTeia clenched her jaw. She stared at the window. This was the White\nasking. That Teia was even thinking of not answering was practically\nirreligious; it was certainly insubordinate."

That Teia was even thinking of not answering was practically\nirreligious; it was certainly insubordinate.\nShe answered, but her voice came out flat. “My mother lost her sense for\na while during one of my father’s journeys. Brought home any man who\nwould come bed her. Finally found one who liked her enough to stay for a\nwhile. She held parties we couldn’t afford, hired dancers and musicians like\nthe rich do. We weren’t rich. She ruined us. And when my father came\nback, I think she thought he’d kill her. I think she hoped he would. She’d\nsold all of us into slavery to pay back the debts she ran up.\n“My father sold everything he had left—his ship, mainly—and bought\nback my sisters. I’d shown my talent by then, and I was too valuable. He\ndidn’t have the money to redeem me and he couldn’t borrow that much.”\n“And what did he do to your mother?” the White asked.\n“Nothing.” There was no hiding the bitterness. Father, why didn’t you\nfight for me? Why did you choose the one who betrayed you?\n“And how do you feel about that?”\n“I despise him for his weakness.”\n“Rather than admire him for his goodness. Interesting.”\n“Is it goodness to do nothing when wronged?” Teia asked sharply.\n“You have no idea what he did or didn’t do. Parents often shield their\nchildren from the truth of their fights, and you were living elsewhere by\nthen, a slave already. You judge too soon, and too sharply. Something you\nwould do well to grow out of. Only a fool judges with the heart alone.”\nTeia took the rebuke, unjust as it was. Her father had passively accepted\nthat crazy whore, said something about love and forgiveness. “Are we\nfinished?” she asked.\n“Do you know,” the White said, “that I had two daughters? I remember\ntheir teenage years. It was hell.”\nTeia smirked despite herself. I’m sure you deserved a bit of that. “Where\ndo they live now? They aren’t on Big Jasper, are they?”\n“They’re dead. One during the Blood Wars, and one immediately\nafterward, killed by men who refused to accept that the Blood Wars were\nended. They thought their side hadn’t meted out sufficient vengeance yet.\nMy daughters’ children were killed or whisked away into illegal slavery\nsomewhere. Perhaps out there still, suffering. Their grandmother is the\nWhite, one of the most powerful people in all the satrapies, and they are\nslaves, all my wealth and my thousand spies worth nothing, for who sees a\nslave?” Her eyes seemed lit with fire. “Slavery is an evil without which our\nworld cannot function, but it is an evil nonetheless.” She grimaced. “Which\nis why I will not have those bound to me bound by that, at least insofar as I\nam able. Ironfist.”\nThe man picked up a note from the White’s desk and handed it to Teia. It\nhad copies of receipts that she couldn’t even read, at least not in a glance,\nand then a letter in an old familiar hand that she knew immediately. Her\nfather’s:\n“My debts have all been paid in your name, Adrasteia. I’ve already got"

I’ve already got\ninvestors lined up to buy one of the new caravels come spring. Putting\ntogether a crew now. I failed you, but you never failed me. As soon as I can,\nI’ll come to Big Jasper or wherever you’re posted. Sisters are well. Kallea\nmarried a butcher and is expecting her first in spring. Husband’s good for\nnaught, but at least she’s close. Marae now hoping to marry an officer.\nGood man. Any news?” He must have been limited on the amount of paper\nhe had to use, because the last sentences were cramped, even briefer than\nusual.\nHer sister was expecting her first child? Kallea was fifteen years old.\nMany poor girls married that young, of course. But Teia wasn’t putting it\ntogether. It was facts, notes about another life, not hers. This kind of thing\ndidn’t happen to Teia.\n“Why?” Teia asked. There had to be some trap, some trick, some way it\nwould be whisked away. It was too good. “Why?”\n“Because sometimes I can do good,” the White said. “No strings, Teia.\nThe tragedies that befell me have left me with some gifts. Money, for one.\nWhat use has a dying old woman for money? I can bless you as freely as\nOrholam has blessed me. Light, life, and freedom, my child.”\nIt rolled over Teia like a rushing quake-wave. She had to fight it, push\nback. “How did you…? Now?”\n“We began work on it as soon as you tested into the Blackguard. We\nwant all our people to choose us freely. It cannot always be so, but we\nalways make the attempt. This was delivered while you were away at Ru.\nI’ve been meaning to send for you since. It’s been a busy time.”\n“You were going to… all along?”\n“In the scheme of things, Teia, it was a small thing for us, and we knew\nhow big it might be for you.”\nIt took Teia’s breath. She would cry later, but in this moment, she could\nbarely breathe, barely believe this dying woman’s goodness, her father’s\nsteadfastness, her sisters’ lives veering so far to one side that Teia couldn’t\neven see them anymore from where she stood. Good done for people she\nwould like as not never see again. In this moment of compassion, somehow,\nthough, she felt more alone than she had in all her years training and\nthieving in shame, hiding who she was in more than just the disguises they\ntaught her.\n“She wasn’t the only one blackmailing me,” Teia blurted out. “There’s\nanother. Worse.”\nAnd she told them about Master Sharp. And about the spy, and the\nmurder, and the flight, and Kip seeing her, and the theft of her papers, and\ntheir return. And when she was done speaking, then, finally, she felt free.\nShe could take a full breath.\nOddly, the White looked, if anything, younger and more alive than ever.\nHer eyes lit with a readiness to fight. “Teia,” she said, “how brave are you?”"

This Murder Sharp.”\nShe didn’t admit it. “Kindness can break chains that cunning cannot.”\n“Is that what you are? Kindness and cunning coiled?” he asked.\n“Was not the caduceus once the White’s symbol?” she asked. Then her\nwhimsy disappeared. “The Order of the Broken Eye, Harrdun.

She’ll be a warhorse, if.”\n“If I don’t kill her first,” the White said grimly. “I know. One loses men\nand horses both to training. Is that reason not to train?”\n“This isn’t training.”\nShe moved as if to quarrel further, then sat back in her wheeled chair.\nShe took a chain from around her neck, produced a key she’d kept hidden\nbeneath her neckline.\n“The master key to all the restricted libraries. This is what you came for,\nisn’t it? You were scheduled to see me before the girl came back from Big\nJasper. What is it you’re hunting?”\n“A fantasy. A suspicion. Foolishness.”\n“But I’ll know first, if you find something?”\nHe took the key from her and tucked it away. It was acquiescence.\n“Be ware, Harrdun.

Having the sister of two men he’d betrayed lay\nhands on his naked body had not been an experience he was eager to repeat,\nfor they’d anointed his entire body, and when choosing, who would you\nprefer to have oil your rod and stones: an old man, or an old woman who\nhad reason to hate you, though she might not know it?\nA Prism was not his own; a Prism belonged to the satrapies entire, and to\nOrholam, and to his family, and to peace, and whatever scraps he could\ncollect after all had taken their bites, he might enjoy for himself.\nHis copper-colored hair was bound back and the High Luxiats placed a\ncrown on his forehead with a single diamond the size of a robin’s egg. He\nwore a ceremonial shirt of red silk and cloth-of-gold open down the front,\nwith sleeves so short as to be vestigial. His trousers were red silk so tight he\nthought they’d tear if he moved too quickly. But he was Orholam’s hand on\nearth; it behooved him to look potent, virile, even sexual. Orholam was,\nafter all, a creative force, a generative being. How much the creative and\nthe reproductive overlapped swung back and forth between which High\nLuxiats held sway at any particular time. Creation was meant to reflect\ncreator, they argued. As above, so below.\nThat the worship guided by the Prism often turned into worship of the\nPrism seemed to bother no one. Or no one in power. To Gavin’s\nunderstanding of theology, that seemed a problem, but he was an impostor,\nand to protest too loudly might expose him. He did what he was told.\nFelia Guile dismissed Shala and a young glowering Blackguard named\nIronfist. When they were gone, she said quietly, “My son, if you can make it\nthrough this, you will be Prism for a thousand years. You’ve done\nmagnificently all day, better than you did when… you were younger.” She\nmeant he’d done better than the real Gavin had done.\n“I’ve killed more than four hundred men before. It won’t be a problem.”\nThe dreaming Gavin suddenly separated from the remembered boy. Had he\nreally thought that, or had he been trying to impress his mother? He had\nwanted so desperately not to fail her. She had been magnificent, and he had\nknown some of what she must have risked to keep him alive. “These ones\nwon’t even be fighting back,” he said with a lopsided grin.\nFelia didn’t smile. “Take off your shirt, I need to anoint you.”\n“I’ve been anointed.”\n“Not with this.” She produced a small jar with a yellowish-orange paste\nor lotion in it. She began to rub in into his skin carefully, only touching the\nareas that wouldn’t be covered by clothing, as if the paste were terribly\nprecious.\n“What is it?” he demanded.\nShe didn’t answer the question, saying instead, “Gavin, I know so far"

This night is the one bloody pillar on\nwhich all your power rests. It matters not that only you and the sworn one\nare in each room. When a Prism takes his duties lightly, or enjoys them, or\ngets blind drunk to brace himself for this burden—word always gets out.\nThose Prisms never last more than their seven, and many don’t last that\nlong. Sun Day is the death of an entire community, of a whole convocation\nof peers. This is where our communal worship meets one intense and final\npersonal experience of faith.”\n“I wasn’t intending to take it lightly, mother. Merely trying to break the\ntension.”\nShe ignored him. “You’ll have only two minutes with each. We prefer to\ngive each five minutes with you, but the sheer number of drafters who’ve\nburned themselves out in the war precludes that.”\n“We could have begun sooner.”\n“The High Magisterium and the Spectrum agreed that drawing out this\nFreeing for days would only draw more attention to the war and all its\nwounds. They want us to move on. All the drafters understand. Most have\nalready been shrived by the lesser luxiats. Some, however, fear that the\nluxiats keep lists of their sins to use against their families in the future—”\n“That’s strictly forbidden!”\nHad he been that young? That naïve?\n“Strictly. But it happens. We root such out as quietly as we can, but with\nso many luxiats coming from noble families, the temptation is often too\ngreat for them; they can’t help but pass along some helpful tidbit. As I was\nsaying, some of the shrived will keep their most serious sins to themselves\nto be revealed to the Prism alone. You will find yourself in possession of\nmany dark secrets. With your memory, it will be a potent tool. That is as it\nshould be. But don’t share those secrets with anyone. Not your father. Not\nme. He will pressure you to do so. The Prism sharing such things with his\nown powerful family would undermine your power at a thousand times the\nrate a mere luxiat leaking such things would.”\n“Of course,” Gavin said. He’d had a sudden insight: the kind that now\nhe would not expect such a young man to have. “Some die with sin on their\nsouls, just to keep the Prism from knowing, don’t they?” He’d been young,\nbut not stupid.\n“Doubtless. Prism Spreading Oak was worthless, but Prism Eirene\nMalargos before him had a way of showing mercy to such. She would, after\nshriving one who had been an enemy, ask if they had any silent sins for\nwhich they could together beseech Orholam’s forgiveness. It’s outside of\northodoxy, you understand, for to speak sins is to let them be exposed to the\nlight, and is theologically necessary, but it was also very merciful. Such\nthings get out, you know. She was well loved.”"

The respect of tens of thousands of\nothers was reinforced rather than hollowed, as only a mother could do.\nHe certainly didn’t get any respect from his father.\nShe closed the jar. “The lotion I’ve applied to you will be preserved until\ndawn by the other oils you were anointed with. It’s a mix of tiny particles of\nimperfect yellow luxin dust and superviolet. You can use a little superviolet\nto make your entire body glow, even in a darkened room. It makes quite a\nsight. Use it sparingly, and don’t get too close to the torches or it will break\ndown. It is incredibly difficult for the yellows to make, and it’s a closely\nguarded secret. If you like, all the gold in your clothing can be lit as well.\nThese are the last and holiest moments of a drafter’s life. Make them\nspecial, Gavin.”\nNo pressure. “Trinkets and magic tricks?”\nHis mother took a deep breath. “I seem to remember Dazen awarding his\narmy’s highest honor to a commander after the Battle of Blood Ridge who\nrouted the enemy with illusions that, were those enemies thinking\nrationally, wouldn’t have deceived them for two heartbeats.”\nShe waited. But he refused to give her the satisfaction of admitting she\nwas right.\n“But at certain moments, two heartbeats is an eternity,” she said, quoting\nhim. “I might suggest that at the moment you slide the knife home, you\nbegin to glow, and shine brighter as the drafter dies, to give her a symbol of\nher eternal reward. But… you are the Prism, Father.”\nShe could be astonishingly cynical, his dear mother.\n“I’m a fraud,” he whispered.\nShe slapped his face, fury breaking through a veneer so cool he hadn’t\neven guessed it was there.\nThen, instantly, it was gone again. She rubbed the lotion back into place\non his slap-stung cheek. Her voice was quiet, but each word was\nconsidered, knife-edged: “We are all of us frauds. We are all of us frauds,\nand we are all of us doing the best we can to hold up a tower of illusions"

Do not fail us, my beloved son.”\nThe dream skipped forward then, through the long walk to the yard,\nthrough the cheers and praises and the prayers of another of the High\nLuxiats, blessing him and his work. Choice foods and rare wines were laid\nout. In some cases, whole communities had made the pilgrimage to Little\nJasper to say goodbye to a beloved drafter who had served particularly well.\nWhich this year meant drafters who’d been particularly heroic in the war.\nThough it was a feast, Blackguards wandered the crowds, keeping their\neyes on all the drafters who were nearly wights. Every few years, there was\nan incident, and in the aftermath of bitter war, they were wise to be on edge.\nAnd then Gavin was ushered into a room, a long, thin dagger pressed\ninto his hand. The closing of the heavy door shut out the cheers of the\ncrowd utterly. He would move from room to room. The rooms were\narranged in a circle at the base of his tower. Each room was tiny, with only\na few simple decorations, a pitcher of wine and a smaller one of poppy\nliquor for the fearful, and a cushioned kneeler. Some drafters liked to pass\nthe night in prayer vigils. Others relaxed and talked with family and friends\nin larger rooms or outside until the luxiats summoned them. As Orholam’s\nfavored, all the female drafters were seen first.\nThe first one was a haggard drafter of perhaps forty-five. She knelt\npatiently on the kneeler at the front of the room. Her back was to the small\ndoor where the luxiats would take her body, her face to Gavin as he entered.\n“Greetings, my daughter, may all the blessings of the light be on you,”\nGavin said.\nThe woman made no reply, merely stared at Gavin.\nGavin moved forward, taking the seat in front of the kneeling woman.\n“I’ve come to shrive you.”\nNo reply. Usually the luxiat who spoke to Gavin between rooms was\nsupposed to tell him if there were any special circumstances—a mute, or a\ndrafter who might be violent, whatever. The luxiats had said nothing other\nthan the woman’s name.\n“Do you have a confession, Vell Parsham?” Gavin asked uncomfortably.\n“This,” the woman said. “This is wrong. This is not what Orholam wills.\nThis is a travesty. This screams to me of men and women holding on to\npower by their fingertips, by making someone else pay.”\n“It’s normal to be afraid,” Gavin said.\n“I’m not afraid for my life. I fear for your soul, High Lord Prism.\nOrholam forgive you, for what you do this night is murder.” She pulled the\nlow collar of her blouse aside to give Gavin a straight shot at her heart.\n“End me now, Lord Prism, but someday, may you end it all or be ended.\nKnow that Orholam is just, and tremble.”\nGavin stood and wet his lips. So dry. He blinked, approaching in a daze.\n“Bless you, my daughter.”"

He blinked, approaching in a daze.\n“Bless you, my daughter.”\nHe looked the woman in the eye as he stabbed her in the heart. Held\nthose un-angry eyes until the light went out of them. Then he pulled the bell\nstring incorporated into the kneeler. Two luxiats entered and caught the\nkneeling body before it could fall. The side door opened.\n“Perfect time, High Lord Prism. There will be water and figs after the\nnext room. Name’s Delilah Tae, a sub-red.”\nAnd then he was in the next room.\nThe woman at the kneeler couldn’t have been more than twenty-five\nyears old. She’d been weeping.\n“My daughter, may the blessings of the light be upon you.”\nShe dissolved.\nGavin took his seat. “I’ve come to shrive you, daughter, that you may\nwalk clean and pure and unashamed in the light.”\n“I have a daughter, High Lord Prism. She’s three. Please tell me I’m not\ndoing wrong by leaving her. I can’t control the sub-red much longer,\nthough. I know it. I—I shouldn’t have used so much during the war. I\nshould have been smarter.”\n“What’s your daughter’s name?”\n“Essel.”\n“Essel will be taken care of, Delilah Tae. I’ll see to it personally.”\n“We don’t have any family, not since the war. I grew up next to one of\nthe homes for orphans. Some of the luxiats have good intentions, but… tell\nme she’ll not go there, High Lord, please. I don’t deserve to ask anything of\nyou, but—”\n“I’ll take care of her. I promise.”\nThe bell rang to let Gavin know he’d spent too long.\nShe gulped nervously. “I’ve got more to say. I’m so sorry, I know you’ve\ngot others waiting.”\n“I’m here. I’m with you. Tell me what you have to say,” Gavin said.\n“It was my idea. Garriston. My husband was a red. He and I used to do a\ntrick where he’d shoot a stream into the air and I’d ignite it. We showed our\ncommander, and he took the idea up like it was his… but it was mine.\nPollos told me not to tell them about it, that it would be used for ill, but I\ndid it. All those people. The whole city burning. They said eighty thousand\ndied in that city alone.”\nShe dissolved then, incapable of speech. That wasn’t your fault, Gavin\nwanted to say. It was mine. My brother’s. We commanded such things. We\nknew. We knew, and we left the burden on people like you.\nThe bell rang again, more insistently.\nIn silent fury, Gavin reached out with blue luxin and ripped the bell off\nthe wall.\nHe knelt across from Delilah and took her hands in his. “Lord of Light,\nOrholam, God, see your humble servant. We pray you search us and know\nus. We pray your healing light would purify us of sins of commission and\nomission. In the fire of war, we have done unspeakable things. The luxiats"

The luxiats\nmay say our commanders bear the weight of those crimes, but Orholam,\nFather, we feel that weight on our souls. We repent of our rage and our\nrecklessness, of duties undone. Forgive your daughter, Orholam, take her\nguilt and shame, and let her walk with you, forever.”\nGavin made his countenance glow softly as he spoke, superviolet and\nwill and yellow triggering the cream’s broken crystals, so it appeared he\nglowed with Orholam’s light. Delilah looked up at him with big, wet eyes\nfull of wonder, but also full of peace. He smiled at her until she shared his\nsmile. He stabbed her heart.\nAnd his own went icy cold.\nHe had kept his word to her, though. Gavin’s mother helped him find a\nfamily to raise the child. Essel was a Blackguard now.\nHigh Luxiat Jorvis opened the door. “Lord Prism. We’re running behind.\nWe’ll have to put off your refreshment until—”\n“No.”\n“Very well. Your next penitent is waiting. Her name is—”\n“No!”\nAnd as soon as his voice was raised, Commander Anamar of the\nBlackguards was standing there, threatening, his attention and menace\nturned toward Gavin. Gavin would ruin him for that.\n“It’s not enough time,” Gavin said.\n“There’s no choice. The ceremony must be finished by dawn. We agreed\n—”\nFurious, Gavin walked down the hallway, toward the revelers outside.\nCommander Anamar stepped in front of him, blocking the door.\n“If you want to have the use of your knees ever again,” Gavin said,\n“you’ll get on them now, and get the hell out of my way.”\nThe man looked to High Luxiat Jorvis, then stepped aside. He didn’t get\non his knees.\nGavin went out past him and took the steps up the podium two at a time.\nHe sent two jets of fire into the afternoon air to get everyone’s attention.\nHe couldn’t remember what words he’d summoned. Oratory had\nbecome second nature to him. Something about a momentous year, and a\nheartbreaking one. Something about Orholam’s heaven becoming richer at\nthe price of those who would miss these drafters. Something about special\ncircumstances requiring special action. Some false humility and\nmisdirection.\n“I, who serve as your Prism, I covet the time I get with each penitent in\nOrholam’s presence. These are the holiest moments I know, and for my\nsake, I have asked Orholam that he not be too harsh a master with me. And\nOrholam is merciful! He has given me a special dispensation! I will meet\nwith and shrive each penitent to be Freed for as long as necessary, even if it\ntakes three days! The parties here will continue, at my own personal\nexpense, until we have honored our dear drafters appropriately!”\nA roar went up at that. Two minutes, to be shrived?

By claiming this special dispensation was for him and his\nown weakness, Gavin had come across as humble. Everyone knew, or\nwould figure out in the next two days, that meeting for longer with each\nmeant he’d just doubled his own burden, if not more.\nBut if one is going to be a fraud, one ought to do it well.\nHe jumped off the stage and headed back inside, past agape managers\nand slave overseers and luxiats who had just seen the labors required of\nthem also double, the logistical nightmare, the long hours they would have\nto put in so that Gavin would look good. “Make it so,” Gavin said. “I don’t\ncare how. Do it.”\nInside, he walked past Commander Anamar and toward the next room.\nHe paused at the door and turned back to the frowning Blackguard. “Oh,\nCommander, I almost forgot.” Gavin had draped invisible superviolet in\nnets around the commander’s legs as he’d walked down the hall, and now\nhe shot green luxin up and along those nets. The green luxin wrapped\naround the commander’s knees before he could react. Gavin clenched a fist\nand the green luxin crushed both of the commander’s knees.\nThe commander dropped to the floor, admirably without crying out.\nDear Orholam, Gavin had been brash, but it had worked. Now he would\nhave thought through what friends the commander had, who would be\noffended, whether they would take vengeance—and in the time he would\nhave taken the window for such an action would have closed. Gavin had\ngotten away with a lot on brute charisma.\n“Have your replacement report to me by the time I finish,” he said.\nBut the dream didn’t end there.\nHe walked into the little room and shrived an Atashian green, Prayan\nNavayed, who confessed to cheating her employer, and to sloth in service,\nand to frequent defiance, and to beating the other slaves unnecessarily\nharshly.\nThen came Jaleh Rodrez. She was a red. Lust, pride, wrath.\nTahlia Blue. Wrath, envy, sabotaging her sister’s marriage.\nKhordad Cruzan. A blue/green. Pride. Hatred of most of her family,\nhatred of her employer, hatred of even Orholam.\nEstefania Kamael. A red. Bitterness and hatred.\nNairi Patel. A green. So close to wight she couldn’t articulate anything.\nBelit Beraens. A blue. Pride.\nBilit Beraens. Her twin. A blue. Pride. Even proud she’d outlasted her\nolder twin, if only by a few minutes. Gavin didn’t point out that since Belit\nhad been born a few minutes earlier, her dying a bit earlier meant they were\nreally about equal.\nAlondra Patel. A superviolet. So close to wight she had to be held down.\nAda Khan. Envy. Fear. She was a mess of tears. Couldn’t find her\nbravery no matter how Gavin tried to inspire her. The luxiats had to hold\nher down.\nMahnaz. A red. Already confessed."

Claimed she had no sins. But did have a\nlitany of destroyed relationships. Couldn’t see, even with gentle prodding,\nthat she was the common element in all of them.\nLi-Lit Ohwarea. A red/orange/yellow. Had secretly tried to go wight.\nAdmitted she couldn’t figure out the problems.\nMylitta Ali. A red. A warrior who had been captured, her tongue ripped\nout by a squad of the Blue-Eyed Demons who had served Dazen. She was\nilliterate, so Gavin had to use sign language and yes-and-no questions to\nshrive her. She seemed relieved.

She thought it a real sin. She had to\nencourage Gavin to kill her.\nNukimmut Rose. A blue. Said nothing. Eyes full of hatred, watched\nGavin all the way. He expected her to attack, but she never did.\nZenana Zenamus. A red. Proudly filled every second of her time with\nhim recounting her sins. There was cruelty, shocking things with animals,\ntorture, cannibalism, numerous murders, blasphemies, defamation of altars\nwith luxiats she’d seduced, anything to sow chaos and horror. “And now,”\nshe said, “since I go to my death shrived, I’ll join Orholam in paradise.”\nShe laughed.\nTahirith. A yellow. Had merely killed her husband who habitually beat\nher. It was a relief, after Zenana.\nKyriaka Kyraeus. A blue from a noble family.

Always lying and\nmanipulating. Long ago, she’d confessed to a luxiat for cheating on her\nhusband, but still felt guilt for that, too.\nEdna. A blue.

Nor would he be deprived of the\nservices of his favorite slave, Grinwoody. That meant whatever story he’d\ninvented blamed Kip.\nKnowing he would have to answer for the crime he had tried to prevent,\nKip had prepared as well as he could, charting a course whereby he might\nfind some rapprochement with the man who’d probably accused him of\nmurder and treason.\nWhen he got off the boat, he’d asked the first person he’d seen what had\nhappened to Gavin.\nRegardless, going into that meeting should have been the prelude to\nimprisonment and execution. Kip still wasn’t sure why it hadn’t been. Part\nof what he’d been betting on was that Andross was a wight. And he wasn’t.\nNot anymore.\nAndross still wore his hood. Still wore his dark spectacles, but Kip had\nknown, instantly. There was something different about his voice, and he\nhadn’t been wearing gloves.\nKip’s best card had suddenly disappeared. He’d planned to threaten to\nreveal that. If nothing else, before they took him away to prison, he could\nyank back Andross Guile’s hood to show the man for what he was.\nIn the chamber, Kip hadn’t had a moment to think about the further\nimplications: a man had gone wight, and was now a wight no longer?\nImpossible.\nKip had merely spoken, weaving lies with a facility he didn’t know he\nhad, so befuddled and intrigued by the puzzle that he’d forgotten to be\nbefuddled and overwhelmed by addressing the entire Spectrum.\nAnd it had worked. Somehow."

Somehow.\nThere had been a little spark of joy dancing at the corner of Andross\nGuile’s mouth. Surprise, but then pleasure. Like he enjoyed playing against\na worthy opponent. Maybe that was why he’d let Kip off the hook, simply\nso they could keep playing.\nKip felt suddenly ill. He was alive because of Andross Guile’s mercy?\nNo, not that. He was alive because Andross longed for entertainment.\nThere. That was more in line with the old horror. That made sense.\nBut now, suddenly, the people he should most want to see—his\nBlackguard compatriots—he couldn’t bear to see, and he couldn’t have\neven said why. He took the lift down, and down. He got off at the level\nwhere the Prism had his private training room. Kip had lost the key\nCommander Ironfist gave him long ago, but the door had a superviolet\npanel next to it. Kip had never really noticed them before—they were flat\nblack, and only a few thumbs wide. He’d dismissed them, not realizing\nwhat they were, but he realized they were made of the same stuff as the\nPrism’s room controls.\nAfter gathering some superviolet, Kip extended it into the panel. Ah,\nthere was another lock inside, so that the door could be locked against\nsuperviolets as well, but it wasn’t locked now. Kip pressed superviolet in,\nand the mundane lock popped open. He went inside.\nThe silence was a balm. He wrapped his hands in long strips of cloth the\nway Ironfist had taught him. The old widow Coreen had given him clothes,\nand while they weren’t exactly good for exercise, Kip knew that they would\nbe replaced soon with Blackguard garb and a Chromeria discipulus’s\nclothes, so he set to work on the heavy bag.\nHe started slow. Seven to ten minutes, Ironfist said, to warm up your\nfists and joints to the shock of hitting. Kip bent his wrist on an errant punch.\nHe grumbled. He’d done the wrappings wrong. But instead of untying the\nwhole mess and trying again, he drafted a green luxin brace around his\nwrist. Then he went ahead and made a full glove out of it. He matched it on\nthe other hand.\nMuch better. He punched the bag lightly for the seven minutes, his fists\nwarming, the pain somehow welcome, the loss of thinking, thinking,\nthinking a relief.\nHe moved over to the stretch bag, a smaller target that when hit snapped\nback toward you, building reflexes. After he got used to its movement, he\nlooked beyond it, using the periphery of his vision to react. Then he went to\nthe chin-up bar, and found he could do three now. Three! It seemed both an\nimpossible achievement and pathetic at the same time. Three. Then back to\nthe heavy bag.\nBy some accident, he turned on the lights on the bag. It lit up sections to\ntell him his next target: right kidney, gut, left jaw. With each punch, the bag\nreacted to how hard Kip hit it by blossoming in color from his punches."

Kip’s hardest kicks reached up to orange.\nIt wasn’t long before he was wheezing at the effort of trying to get the\nbag to turn red.\nHe braced his gloved hands on his knees. He was hitting the damned\nthing as hard as he could.\nNo, he was hitting as hard as he could muscularly. Magically, he should\nbe able to hit it harder.\nBut he didn’t want to shoot his little green bouncy balls of doom across\nthe room. If he could add his will to his muscles with magical stuff he\nthrew, why couldn’t he add his will to his muscles?\nHe remembered the wights in Garriston, leapfrogging from roof to roof,\nshooting luxin downward as they jumped, using the back kick to extend\ntheir jumps. It was the same concept that worked for Gavin’s skimmers and\nthe sea chariots. But both of those interacted more externally. They didn’t\nhave to, did they?\nKip drafted a shinguard, then kicked off his shoes. This next part was\ngoing to hurt. It always did. He began kicking the heavy bag to warm up for\nit. He’d been shown how to put power into kicks a dozen times, but it\nhadn’t settled into body knowledge until today somehow. Maybe losing\nsome weight had helped. He swung both arms in a guard to the left, letting\nhis body stretch, his left foot turning until it pointed backward, hips\nopening, then jerked his arms back in, the torsion providing power as his\nright leg came up and pounded the side of the bag and set it swinging. That\nbag weighed two sevens. Not bad. He repeated it, not quite as successfully,\nfrom the left.\nEnough warm-up. He filled himself with green luxin, then stabbed a bit\nof it through the skin at the back of his right heel. He winced, cut it wider.\nHere goes nothing. He stood with his right foot back, twisted, snapped,\nand as his right foot came up, he shot green luxin out of it.\nThe sudden transfer of weight from his body into the air, but this time\nnot opposing his body but aiding it, threw Kip’s foot forward at tremendous\nspeed. He kicked the bag so hard that he lost traction on his left foot and fell\nheavily on his side.\nLaughter burst out from the door.\nKip popped to his feet in an instant, mortified. It was half a dozen\nmembers of his Blackguard class, led by Cruxer, who was grinning big. If it\nwas possible, it seemed like the young inductees had changed in the weeks\nKip hadn’t seen them. Cruxer was bulking up, his tall, lean frame looking\nmore muscular by the day. His eyes, though, looked five years older, either\nfrom the death of the girl he’d loved, Lucia, or from being in the Battle of\nRu. Affable Big Leo’s arms of banded iron looked even bigger.

These didn’t look thrown together with string and\nglue; they looked a masterwork, a perfect complement to the burning bright\nintelligence in his eyes. Only Ferkudi looked the same, the craggy-nosed\ndope. Actually, that was deeply reassuring.\n“Good thing Breaker fights better than he… uh, kicks,” Ferkudi said.\n“Kicking is part of fighting, though, isn’t it? Ah, that’s a real flesh\nprotuberance.”\nThe kids laughed.\n“Shut up, you nunks,” Cruxer said good-naturedly. He led as naturally as\nthe first-place Blackguard in the class should. He bowed his head to Kip.\n“Godslayer.” He delivered it flat, so it could have been teasing or not. Or\nknowing Cruxer, he meant those who wished to take it as teasing to be able\nto do so, but he really meant it.\nSon of a… Kip thought that nickname had died when he nearly had on\nthe ship. “Crux. Wh—what are you doing here?”\n“In the Prism’s practice room, you mean? They got so many recruits for\nthe war training out in the yards, we Blackguards have been pushed into\nstorage rooms and side rooms everywhere half the time. Teia somehow got\nus permission to use this one when the yards are full. I was going to cut her\nfrom the squad before that. She’s not so good, but after she got us this place\n—”\n“Hey,” Teia said. Somehow she’d lifted a blue luxin dagger from\nFerkudi and was now pressing the point to Cruxer’s kidney, smiling\nsweetly.\nCruxer grinned. “The insubordination around here.”\n“I thought you’d—I thought you’d think I was a traitor,” Kip said. That\nwas it, that was why he hadn’t been able to bear going out to them. These\nwere the only people in his life who had made him feel like he belonged,\nand he thought they would have looked at him as an outsider, a traitor.\n“Breaker, you’re impulsive, but you aren’t stupid. We didn’t believe for\na heartbeat that you’d try to kill the Red. It’s ridiculous! You’re trying to\nbecome a Blackguard! Protecting Colors is part of what we do. You\nwouldn’t throw all that away. But if your father fell overboard, you jumping\nin after him without a thought? That’s you. Completely.”\nOuch. “How’d you… how’d you hear so fast?”\n“Teia. Big gossip.”\n“Hey,” Teia said. For some reason, she’d been glowering at Daelos, but\nshe said nothing more.\nCruxer grinned again. “Commander Ironfist thought you’d be here. Said\nsometimes those who’ve been in battle are a little reticent when they first\ncome back.”\n“You weren’t supposed to share that last part, you oaf,” Teia said. “What\nwere you doing there, Kip?

Well she might, he supposed.\nShe and Kip were going to talk about her being all bloody in town. But not\nnow.\n“You’re bleeding,” Cruxer said.\n“Just an experiment,” Kip said.\nThey gathered around him. “Go on,” Ben-hadad said. He’d seemed\nuncharacteristically nervous until now, when his eyes lit up at the\npossibility of a new discovery.\nSo Kip explained, and then he kicked the bag again, showing them.\nWhen you used luxin from one site repeatedly, the body eventually adjusted\nand there was little blood. But the first few times, it acted like any mundane\ncut. A cloud of unsealed luxin and blood both shot out of his heel like\nsmoke out of a gun barrel, and this time he didn’t lose his footing. He did\nnearly wrench his knee, though. The power was incredible.\nBut the bag lit up. Red.\nEveryone stopped and looked at Kip.\n“You could, uh, use this lots of ways,” Kip said. “You’d have to, um,\nfigure out your own center of weight and everything, but if you shot some\nfrom your shoulders when you ran, you’d run faster. Or when you jumped,\nyou could shoot some—”\n“From your ass! You’d be the fart flyer!” Ferkudi shouted. He reminded\nKip of an excitable puppy.\nThey laughed, but only briefly. They were all captivated by the thought\nof it.\n“I was going to say from your hips,” Kip said. “I mean, if you did it\nfrom your feet, you’d probably flip over and fall on your head.”\n“But you could do it from your ass if you want to, Ferkudi,” Teia said.\n“Might as well have a wide platform.”\nThey laughed again, then quieted.\nBig Leo turned to Cruxer. “I’ve never even heard of anything like this. Is\nit forbidden?”\nCruxer shook his head. “It isn’t incarnitive, so I don’t see why it would\nbe. On the other hand, if you were doing it all the time, you might burn\nthrough your life in no time.”\n“But that’s true of any drafting,” Teia said. “Used judiciously, think of it.\nWe’d be faster, stronger, jump farther.”\n“This can’t be the first time anyone’s thought of this,” Kip said,\nsuddenly embarrassed.\n“Every brilliant discovery is obvious after someone’s made it,” Ben-\nhadad said.\n“Did you really just come up with this?” Cruxer asked. “No one\nsuggested it to you?”\nKip shrugged.\n“He shall be a genius of magic,” Ben-hadad said quietly, as if quoting\nsomething. The rest of them stopped, looked at him, looked at each other.\nKip could tell they’d talked about it among themselves before.\n“Does this mean we’re going to have to fill ourselves full of holes?”\nFerkudi asked.\nChapter 26\nAliviana Danavis stood high on the Great Pyramid of Ru, wrapping up\nteaching the women who would replace her.

        "text": "Ferkudi asked.\nChapter 26\nAliviana Danavis stood high on the Great Pyramid of Ru, wrapping up\nteaching the women who would replace her. The four superviolet drafters\nwho had been learning from Liv for the last four months were joined by\nLiv’s personal guards. That guard had been formed around the core of men\nwho’d helped her seize this very structure during the liberation of Ru.\nPhyros was Liv’s rock. Over six feet tall, wide as the sea. When they’d\ninfiltrated the city, he hadn’t worn his lucky cape because it was too\ndistinctive, but usually he didn’t go anywhere without it. It was the skin of a\nlion, the roaring mouth forming a cap for his head, the mane bunching\naround his shoulders. Over an alligator-leather vest with many straps, he\nwore a jade-and-turquoise belt that hooked with great, curving giant\njavelina tusks. The sheath for his belt knife was a hollowed-out sabre-cat’s\nfang. He claimed to have killed each of the beasts himself, armed only with\nthat knife. He despised muskets and pistols, but otherwise didn’t have a\nfavorite among weapons. He had two axes that looked like halberds with\ntheir hafts cut short in special slings on his back. Someday, he would craft a\nweapon from sea demon tooth, he said.\nFrom anyone else, Liv would have thought it empty boasting, but Phyros\nshe believed. She’d seen him without a tunic on, and he bore scars from\nclaws and fangs like a man who had done everything he claimed.\nThe rest of her guard were less conspicuous, but perhaps no less\ndangerous. Tychos was an orange drafter, one of the best hex casters in the\nBlood Robes. He was a small man, violent, and strangely direct for an\norange. Magic is no match for man, as an old saying went. There were\ncrafty sub-reds and reckless blues. But here, it was probably one of the\nmain reasons why he wasn’t in contention to become the prince’s candidate\nfor Molokh. With one of Tychos’s hexes woven into her cloak, Liv could\ninspire awe in everyone who looked at it. Or dread. Simply being aware of\nthe hex was usually enough to end the effect—it was an imposition of will\nand could be broken, but most people hadn’t fought hexes in hundreds of\nyears. Tychos was a khat chewer, his teeth stained red from his constant use\nof the stimulant. With red teeth and orange eyes, the man would have\nlooked a demon to Liv a few months ago.\nBut she’d come a long way since she’d left the Chromeria.\nShe finished up teaching the superviolet drafters how to manipulate the\ngreat mirror atop the pyramid, answering their questions, guiding their\nrough efforts to reach their drafting into the controls and shift the mirror to\nshoot light into any corner of the city, immediately empowering the drafters\nthere, even late in the day when the shadows were long. Ru would never be\nas light as Big Jasper, with its Thousand Stars, but this mirror was a wonder.\nThe light from it was as thick and potent as anything Liv had ever seen. It\nhad helped birth a god—a god immediately slain by Gavin Guile, but still.\nUnfortunately, turning the mirror this way and that to illuminate the city"

It\nhad helped birth a god—a god immediately slain by Gavin Guile, but still.\nUnfortunately, turning the mirror this way and that to illuminate the city\nmeant surveying the city itself. Unlike Garriston, Ru hadn’t accepted its\nliberation joyfully.\nThe Color Prince had bet it would. Ru had as many reasons to hate the\nGuiles as anyone: They mercilessly quashed rebellions that had been\nsponsored by the old royal family. The massacre of the Atashian nobility\nduring the False Prism’s War. Even two short-lived and small uprisings\nsince then. The streets of Ru had run with blood, blood the Chromeria had\nspilled. Freed of their satrap, they should have been natural allies.\nInstead, its subjects had fought fiercely. The prince had been furious.\nHe’d issued an ultimatum for several of the leaders of the resistance to be\nsurrendered to him for immediate execution. When they hadn’t been, he’d\ngone insane with fury. He’d given his army leave to do whatever they\nwanted for three days to punish the city.\nLiv’s guards had urged her not to go out in the city—even as they had\ntaken turns going out themselves. The advice was simultaneously wise and\npatronizing. She hadn’t intended to go. But she wouldn’t be stopped from\ngoing out by any man. The Chromeria liked to cloak unpleasantness in soft\nritual. Liv would have her truths served in hard light, thank you.\nPhyros had tried to object one last time, as all of them shifted uneasily\nand armed themselves: “Eikona”—it was the term for the preeminent\ndrafter of her color. The Blood Robes would have new titles. “Eikona, I\nunderstand you want to look. It’s natural. But you’re what? Seventeen years\nold? Pretty, and a woman.” He scowled. Like she hadn’t noticed her gender.\n“Eighteen,” she said, even though she wouldn’t be eighteen for another\nten days. “Thank you for your concern, and fuck you.”\nStill, when they went, they’d prominently displayed their Blood Robes.\nIt had been a nightmare tour. The sights were etched on her eyes. It\ndidn’t bear thinking about now, even though some of the many fires burning\nin the city below her now were funeral pyres. Huge pyramids of flame. And\nstill it wasn’t finished. There were places the patrols couldn’t go to collect\nthe bodies for burning. It was still too dangerous. So disease spread.\nShe couldn’t leave too soon. She fingered the black jewel in her pocket.\nBlack luxin, the prince claimed. She didn’t really believe it. It was likely\nobsidian only, though threads of darkness seemed to swim in the jewel. She\ndidn’t know how the Color Prince had gotten it. Regardless, he believed\nthat it was a means of control. She’d first thought that perhaps he spied\nthrough it, but simply seeing wouldn’t be enough to stop a god, would it?\nSurely it was something more dangerous.\nShe didn’t like to think about it. Didn’t like to look at it. Didn’t like the\nfeel of it on her skin. But he’d forbidden her to go anywhere without it.\n“You have my things?” she asked Phyros."

It was, for some reason, incredibly comforting. She’d heard him\nbellow in rage with that voice, and having it on her side soothed all sorts of\nfears. Not that she’d ever let him know it.\nThe Color Prince didn’t have nearly the number of ships he needed, so\nLiv and her guard would be traveling in a cheap, poorly constructed galley.\nOf course, there were villages for the supply of galleys around the entire\nrim of the sea. Traveling by ship wouldn’t be fast, especially not when they\nwould have to find ports to wait out every winter storm, but it would be\nfaster than walking or riding, and much less dangerous. Any pirates who\nwaylaid them would be in for several unpleasant surprises—though usually,\nmerely announcing the presence of a drafter was enough to convince pirates\nnot to attack. A little blast of luxin into the sky would be enough to turn\nback all but the most foolhardy.\nMost of the class left, including one middle-aged woman who hadn’t\neven discovered she could draft superviolet until after the death of her\nhusband. One of the Blood Robe drafters had stayed at her boarding house\nand had administered the test to her on a whim. Middle-aged drafters. It was\nodd to Liv, but the Color Prince’s vision was for a day when drafting wasn’t\na death sentence. Perhaps that day would even come soon enough to make a\ndifference for Liv.\nShe stepped up to the great mirror one last time. It was easy now.\nWhoever had built this had meant it to be used. Some long-dead master\ncraftsman. She stopped musing and turned the mirror toward the horizon.\nNavigators and natural philosophers had known about the curvature of the\nearth for at least a millennium, but it was the first time Liv had ever had to\nworry about it. It was also, so far as she could guess, why each of the great\nmirrors had been constructed on the top of a tall building.\nThat curvature was why when you watched a departing ship, its hull\ndisappeared first, and it appeared to sink as it got farther away. The natural\nphilosophers had figured out that the rate of that drop was two feet per\nleague. If ‘drop’ made any sense, on a surface that appeared to be flat.\nYou’d think that the calculation of how tall a structure would have to be\nwould be simple—just subtract the total curvature of the earth per league\nfrom the height of the structure. Easy. Given that the Great Pyramid was\ntwo hundred eighty cubits tall, or four hundred and eighty feet, you should\nbe able to cast light from the beam to a distance of two hundred and forty\nleagues. If the receiving tower was equally tall, you should be able to\ndouble that, right?\nWrong, she’d found out. She’d struggled with her calculations, talking\nthrough them aloud with her guards. She’d had to explain to Phyros about\nthe curvature of the earth twice, but then he’d been the one who grasped her\nmodel better than she did. She’d drawn on a parchment, then bent it,"

He’d pointed out that she was treating the\nmirror towers as if they were standing straight up in relation to each other.\nThey stood straight in relation to the ground, but the ground was bent. It\nwas like measuring the height of a man when he was standing straight up\nversus when he was leaning against a doorframe. The man might still be six\nfeet tall, but the top of his head wasn’t going to be six feet from the ground.\nShe’d done more calculations, and finally figured it all out—and was\nstill wrong. She had no idea why.\nIn the end, the Color Prince had sent Samila Sayeh to her. The blue\ndrafter had fought in the Prisms’ War and made herself a legend. She’d\nfought against the Color Prince at Garriston, but had broken the halo, was\ncaptured, imprisoned, and, by his mercy, forgiven. She now fought with\nthem. If the Color Prince’s armies could find the blue bane, the woman was\none of the leading candidates to become the next Mot.\nSamila Sayeh had begun the transition to full wight differently than any\nblue Liv knew. She was starting with her left hand only. She said if she\ncould figure how to make hard, crystalline blue luxin work on a part of her\nbody that required such dexterity and flexion first, the rest of her body\nwould be simple. Given the woman’s status and fierce intellect, Liv\nshouldn’t have felt threatened by her. But something rankled. And Samila\ndidn’t care, if she even noticed.\nSamila had looked at Liv’s problem, figured out the correct equations to\nuse, demanding whole lists of relevant and seemingly irrelevant numbers,\nand done the calculations in her head, only her hand twitching as if moving\ninvisible abacus beads. She gave Liv the answers, not explaining what she’d\ndone. And then she translated some ancient scratching below the mirror in\nsome language Liv didn’t even recognize. There were instructions for\nexactly how to set the mirrors for dozens of major points around the world.\nThen she left without a word. Not even the bare minimum of a nodded\nhead and the “Eikona” that Liv’s status demanded.\nThe Chromeria’s lapdog luxiats preached that the sin of superviolet was\npride. Maybe in this one thing they were on to something, because Liv\ncould barely contain her fury at being made to look a fool.\nEven with that help, it had taken Liv an embarrassing half hour to figure\nout what that meant for her. Finally, she’d been able to aim the mirror out to\nsweep the sea to search for the resonance points the Color Prince had\ndirected her to. His intelligence had been good. There was one near the\nEverdark Gates—and hopefully not beyond them. That point was Liv’s\ngoal. The superviolet bane was there, somewhere, on land or in the sea.\nIt was still there today. Liv was sure of it. Her mission was simple: she\nand her guards were to find either what the Color Prince called a seed\ncrystal or the bane that would form around it, and take it for him.\nBending her knee to him alone, Liv was to become goddess.

Dressed in her immaculate yellow silk\ndress, the trim dyed with murex purple, she handed her jacket to Phyros\nbefore she began her descent down the pyramid. He put it in the bulging\npack that carried everything she might need.\nA goddess-to-be had people for such things.\nChapter 27\nLiv had barely reached the docks with her entourage when a young woman\nwith nose rings attached by chains to her earrings came forward. She wore a\nbeautiful flowing dress in sea foam green, edged with crimson. Wealthy.\n“Lady, Lady Aliviana!” the woman said. “Your Eminence. Uh, Eikona.”\nShe lay prostrate on the road, heedless of the dust.\nIt was foolishness. Putting such garments in the dirt, for what? To show\nrespect? To Liv? It was insane… and pleasing.\n“A moment of your time, Lady Aliviana, please,” the woman said.\nPhyros looked to Liv. In his bearskins and bulging muscles, he looked\nlike a frowning barbarian colossus. “Eikona?” In Liv’s case, earning that\ntitle had been almost embarrassingly easy. There were hundreds of green\ndrafters, hundreds of blues, hundreds of reds. And ten superviolets. She\nknew she wasn’t as elite as the eikonos of green or blue or red, but the\nColor Prince treated them all the same, and made everyone else do likewise.\nShe owed him for that.\nLiv nodded. Phyros walked to the woman and picked her up by her\nneck. He was so big, he was somehow able to do it without strangling her,\nhis big hand—one hand—wrapping completely around her throat. He lifted\nher to her feet and, ignoring all propriety, searched her for weapons quickly.\nThe woman looked horrified, but she said nothing. Last, he clamped his big\nhand around her jaw and angled her face up. She instinctively tried to pull\naway, but he waited until she met his eyes, and gazed carefully at each eye\nin turn.\nSatisfied she wasn’t a drafter or bearing any weapons, he still didn’t let\nher come directly to Liv. Phyros believed in picking your own battlefield,\nregardless of how inconvenient. He marched the woman up into the\nbeached galley. Liv followed to her quarters.\nPhyros drew back the skin hanging over the door and held it open for\nLiv. The woman followed her in, looking vexed. She pulled the skin to shut\nit behind her. Phyros held it firm, impassive. He looked at Liv. She nodded.\n“Shout if,” Phyros said. Odd habit he had, not finishing common\nstatements, accepting it for granted that you both knew how they ended, so\nthere was no need to go through the effort of saying the whole thing.\nThe woman closed the skin tight, turned, and took a deep breath.\n“Eikona, thank you for meeting with me.

She’d wanted to believe that\nMistress Helel trying to assassinate Kip was an aberration, a woman ill in\nthe head, delusional. She’d wanted to believe, as Gavin and Ironfist had\nsaid, that the Order was a loose collection of thugs taking on an old\nlegendary name in order to raise their prices. But this woman seemed calm,\nprofessional, not a braggart. And the use of Mistress Helel as an assassin\nwas nothing short of brilliant. Who would suspect a heavy, middle-aged\nwoman of being an assassin?\nSo it was possible the Order was real. It was no wonder this woman was\nbeing so careful to show she posed no threat.\nSeeing that Liv wasn’t going to speak, the woman hurried on. “The\nprince gave you a necklace; on it, there is a chunk of living black luxin.\nThat jewel is a death sentence. It is the way he believes he can control you.”\n“What? How does it work?”\nShe paused, painfully. “We don’t know, except that he believes he’s\nmastered it, and that it will compel obedience. He believes it enough that\nhe’s willing to make gods.”\n“You speak dangerous words.”\n“Does he seem a man content with others having greater power than he\ndoes? He wishes to be a god of gods.”\n“What do you wish of me?” Liv demanded. “You think to test my\nloyalty so easily?”\n“The prince espouses freedom, does he not? How is a leash freedom?”\n“Freedom doesn’t mean a lack of responsibilities. It means a choice\nbetween them. He is to make me a god.”\n“Forgive me, Eikona, but you will make yourself a god, or fail. On your\nown. And black luxin is not so easily tamed as the prince believes.”\nA shout from outside drifted in. “Casting off in two! Rowers to your\nplaces!”\n“Black luxin,” Liv scoffed. “It’s merely obsidian.”\n“How can you say so? You who have seen it?”\nLiv turned away. The swirling jewel was in her pocket, ever in her\npocket. And the prince’s instructions were clear: she must put it on before\nshe claimed the bane. “It is… merely cunningly cut. Tricks of the light.”\n“The stones are related, lady. The old stories aren’t lies, but they’ve been\ncorrupted. Obsidian is black luxin, dead black luxin. It is said that all the\nobsidian in the world is the last remnant of a great war, thousands of years\nbefore Lucidonius. A holocaust that devoured light and life for millennia,\nfrom which we are still recovering. The living stuff… Eikona, it has will. It\nis insanity given form. It is a hole of nothingness that can never be filled. If"

If\nyou put it to your neck to feed and the prince’s control slips, it will kill you.\nIt has will; it may have intellect, too. If it devours a goddess, who is to say\nwhat it would do next?”\nSo Liv had been right to be leery of having the thing next to her skin. If\nthis girl was telling the truth. “What does the Order want?”\n“Most of our knowledge has been lost to time and bloody purges. We are\na weak, wan thing. A shadow of a shadow. And I the least of our folk, in\ncase I was captured and tortured. We’re not your enemies, Eikona. Become\nFerrilux. Serve the Color Prince. Do all that you wish, but do not put black\nluxin in the nexus of your power. Do not put it in the center of the bane.\nOne slip, whether the prince’s or yours, and who is to say but that it would\neat all the magic in the world?”\nChapter 28\nThey needed to have this out. Teia was in some sort of trouble, and Kip was\ngoing to make her tell him what it was. During a rest at practice, he’d told\nthe squad a little about his adventure and almost the whole truth about what\nhad happened to Gavin.\n“There was a fight, over a dagger. Grinwoody tried to grab it and I\ntangled with him. Andross joined in and Gavin intervened. Everyone\ntangled up. My father diverted the blade into himself so I wouldn’t get\nstabbed.”\nMore than a few puzzled glances at that. Why was it harder to tell a\npartial truth than a complete lie? Kip rushed on. “But that wasn’t the\namazing thing. I jumped in after him. I lit some red to make a beacon, and\nwhen we got pulled out by this pirate, the dagger was a dagger no longer. It\nwas a full-length sword with seven jewels of each of the seven primes in the\nblade. And when they pulled it out, Gavin… Gavin was alive. He didn’t\neven bleed.”\nThey asked him questions then, most of which he couldn’t answer, and\nCruxer swore them all to secrecy; then, because their break had already\nextended for half an hour, he called it a day.\nTeia had slipped out of practice before he’d noticed, and he hadn’t seen\nher at dinner, so now he was waiting up for her in their room.\nHe’d been waiting half an hour, getting more and more cross, when he\nhad a thought. He went to the tiny desk and found no papers. He hadn’t\nnoticed before because they simply weren’t there. His ownership papers of\nTeia, that he’d already signed over. She’d taken them from his room,\nthinking him dead, and turned them in.\nOf course she had. He couldn’t blame her for worrying that with him\ngone, anyone might take his signed transfer of title. That was why she\nwasn’t here. No longer his slave, she’d moved into the barracks. Good for\nher.\nShe owed him nothing, and the bond of master to slave—unwelcome\nthough it had been—was gone. But maybe that had been the only bond"

But maybe that had been the only bond\nthey’d shared, and it felt like she’d given up on him.\nHe’d wanted her to be free, but he’d still wanted her to owe him, to be\neternally grateful, to be somehow therefore subordinate. He’d wanted her to\nbe free, but he wanted to decide for her how she should use her freedom.\nKip swore aloud, and went to bed.\nThe next morning, he went to breakfast, then checked the lists. He\nwasn’t on any work details. He supposed that meant he should go to class.\nClass. Ugh. He stood in front of the lift with all the other students and\nwithdrew into himself, carrying his black little storm cloud around with\nhim.\nOf course, there were a thousand things Kip still needed to learn. He had\nsome experiential knowledge, but almost no other kind. It would hamper\nhim eventually, he knew. Hell, it already had. The extent of his knowledge\nwas the bouncy green balls of doom. Well, practically. It wasn’t going to be\nenough to keep him alive in the coming war.\nPlus he’d managed to lose the knife that he was now more and more\nafraid was Important. Andross Guile had called it the Blinder’s Knife. It\nwas only because he’d been vague with the squad about where it came from\nthat they hadn’t asked him more about it. He’d let them think that it was\nGavin’s.\nAnd how did my mother come by that, anyway?\nKip walked in to Magister Kadah’s classroom. It was hard to believe that\nhe’d first walked in here only a few months ago. He felt like he was ten\nyears older. He sat at the back of the room. Even in a discipulus’s clothing\nagain, he didn’t think he’d be able to escape notice, but there was no reason\nto stick his thumb in Magister Kadah’s eye.\nMore than he had to, anyway.\nA voice whispered in his ear: “I hear you’ve connived your way into\nbeing declared legitimate, little bastard. Don’t think it changes anything. I\nknow what you are.”\nKip turned. “So nice to see you, Magister.” He said it like he meant it.\nShe gave him a nasty grin. Kip’s training and fighting had changed him\nso much that perhaps he should have taken some solace in the fact that\nMagister Kadah looked exactly the same: shrunken like an old woman\ndespite only being in her early thirties, disheveled with hair that hadn’t seen\na pick since the last time Kip had been in class, green spectacles on a gold\nchain around her neck. “Should I get my switch ready?”\n“I don’t know,” Kip said. “I’m just the ignoramus son of a whore.” He\nwinced. Kip the Lip wasn’t so far in the past, apparently.\n“Any more language like that, Kip Guile, and it’ll be knuckles. You\nremember, I believe?” Magister Kadah said.\nKip put his hands on the desk before him. The fingers of his left hand\nstill bowed upward, stiff and stubborn, though he was working on them."

The fingers of his left hand\nstill bowed upward, stiff and stubborn, though he was working on them.\nThe pain of getting that hand smashed with a switch would be excruciating.\nThe whole hand still felt like one exposed nerve.\nHe looked up at the magister, puzzled. What? He was supposed to be\nafraid of getting his knuckles rapped?\nTeia and Ben-hadad came in right before class was supposed to start.\nThey saw Kip, and mirrored each other’s surprise at seeing him there,\nlooked at each other, and then sat next to him.\nThe magister went to the front of the class, cleared her throat, and\nwaited the moment it took for the class to fall silent. “Discipulae.”\n“Magister,” the class answered. Kip joined them. A new start, Kip.\n“Discipulae, today we’re going to be discussing orange. Any orange\ndrafters here today?”\nA few discipulae raised their hands. Kip debated raising his, and raised a\ncouple fingers.\n“Orange is singularly useless,” Magister Kadah said. She grinned\nnastily. “You’ll spend your lives making lubrication for machines and for\nstoring away metals so they don’t rust. It is, however, a relatively easy life.\nYour patron may have you draft barrels of the stuff each day, which may\ntake you from sunrise to noon, and then to keep you from dying early,\nyou’ll be done by noon every day. Some will, happily, have other duties for\nyou to perform. Usually non-magical ones: cleaning stables, dusting\nfurniture, mopping barracks. Yes, Ben-hadad?”\n“Orange can be used for more than that,” Ben-hadad said. “And with a\nwar looming that could destroy all of us, I think we should start training\noranges to live up to their full potential.”\n“Their full potential?” Magister Kadah asked. Her tone was meant to be\na warning, but Ben-hadad seemed to think it was a real question.\n“Oranges can craft hexes. It’s said that in Ru, orange spies infiltrating\nthe city crafted fear hexes invisible to the naked eye but so potent that\npeople avoided whole neighborhoods—allowing the heretics to tunnel\nunder the walls unopposed. Oranges can spike food and drink. Fear-casting,\ntromoturgy. Pathomancy. Will-blunting.”\n“Forbidden!” Magister Kadah snapped. “And at your level, forbidden to\neven discuss!”\n“We’re at war!” Ben-hadad said. “I just heard that the last fort below\nRuic Neck fell. From there, there’s nothing to stop the Color Prince until\nthey reach the Ao River. Even if you won’t teach the oranges to craft hexes,\nyou should be teaching us all how to resist them, and certainly how to\nrecognize them.”\n“This Color Prince will doubtless be put down in weeks if he hasn’t\nalready been. None of you will have to face orange heretics.”\n“There are people who have already faced the Blood Robes in this very\nroom,” Ben-hadad said.\nThanks, Ben.\n“I see. So you are friends now, is that it?” Magister Kadah asked Ben-"

The ignoramus and the boy who can’t even\nread? How’d you learn all this?”\n“I can read,” Ben-hadad hissed.\n“The words just get scrambled for him is all, Magister,” Teia said. “He\ncan read if he goes slow.”\n“Slow is a nice way of saying stupid,” Magister Kadah said.\nKip sighed. He’d had the best intentions.\n“Ben-hadad, you think being friends with this lordling will help you?”\nMagister Kadah asked. The whole class was silent, expectant.\n“I’m not his friend because he can do something for me,” Ben-hadad\nsaid. “And I resent your implication. You dishonor me and you dishonor\nyourself by speaking such petty vileness.”\nA wave of shock passed through the young teens. They looked like they\ndidn’t want to look away for a heartbeat, in case they missed Magister\nKadah’s head exploding.\nMagister Kadah’s eyes widened, fists balled. “You think he can protect\nyou?” she demanded. “Report yourself immediately, Ben-hadad… for\nexpulsion.”\nThere was a collective gasp.\n“Expulsion?” Ben-hadad asked, disbelieving.\n“For gross insubordination. I’ve not used my power to expel a discipulus\nin three years. Perhaps it is time. You’re worthless as a drafter; you’ll be\nuseful as an example.”\nThe old Kip would have jumped out of his seat and started shouting\nfuriously. He would have tapped into the well of hatred at injustice that he’d\ncarried since growing up with his addled mother. Growing up, it had never\nfelt safe to be furious with her on his own behalf, but when he’d seen others\nsuffering injustice, it had been there, hot and ready, a powerful insanity he\ncould put on and only take off when he was exhausted. Kip had been going\ngreen golem since long before he could draft. Even Ram had feared him\nwhen he’d been like that.\nKip stood slowly. Teia tried to grab him, tried to keep him in his seat.\n“What do you think you’re doing, Kip ‘Guile’? You think I can’t expel\nyou, too?”\nOf course she couldn’t. “You can’t even expel Ben-hadad,” Kip said. He\nspoke evenly, respectfully, even mournfully. He didn’t raise his voice, but\nhe spoke loudly enough for all to hear. “He’s a Blackguard inductee, and if\nyou think Commander Ironfist is going to let you thin his already strained\nranks in a time of war, I wish you luck in the conflagration that will be your\nown career.”\nA profound silence fell over the room. The whispering teenagers weren’t\neven whispering, and Kip’s tone somehow defanged Magister Kadah.\nRespectfully, regretfully, Kip continued. “Magister, you weren’t always"

You don’t like children, I understand that. It’s a failing, but all\nOrholam’s sons and daughters have failings. You’ve been assigned by an\nangry superior or perhaps through cruel chance to do work that has never fit\nyou. You’ve served quietly in a difficult posting because you love Orholam\nand you love the Chromeria and you love the Seven Satrapies. But you hate\nyour work, and I bet that you hate what you’ve become. You’re better than\nthis. You’ve been punished for something, or perhaps for nothing, and\nyou’ve done a lot of damage in turn. Not least of all to yourself. I will do\nwhat I can to help you.”\nKip stepped into the aisle, and without waiting to see how the magister\nwould react, walked out of the classroom. He walked directly to the lift and\nheaded to the top floor. He got off and checked in with the Blackguards. He\nrecognized them: Baya Niel, who had helped kill the green god with Kip,\nand a curvy woman who he thought was named Essel. Teia had liked her a\nlot. “I’d like to speak with the White, if she has any time today,” Kip said.\n“Please.”\nBaya Niel said, “We can ask her between her other meetings to squeeze\nyou in. It may be a few hours, though. If you’re late to Blackguard training\nthis afternoon, you’ll bear the consequences.”\nKip shrugged. Consequences.\nHe waited an hour before Baya Niel gestured to him, letting him\nthrough. Kip headed to the White’s room, past the Blackguards at the\ncheckpoint and more outside her door. There had been an assassination\nattempt while Kip had been gone, foiled by the Prism himself, they said.\nThat meant more guards, and more attentive ones. Kip was frisked twice.\nWhen he got into the White’s office, he was surprised by how healthy\nshe looked. She bade him come to stand in front of her desk, and for a long\nmoment she studied him. She had secretaries and messenger slaves\nattending her while she saw to her daily business overseeing the Chromeria.\nKip stood silent; he knew not to speak until spoken to.\n“Do you know, I expected you to look more like Gavin. You look more\nlike your grandfather and great-grandfather. Do you know you are exactly\nwhat so many of the great families were hoping for, treating their sons and\ndaughters like stallions and mares to be bred for this trait or that? The Blood\nWars made people who should have known better act like animals\nthemselves, I’m afraid.”\n“High Mistress?”\n“Your eyes blue to gather light efficiently, your skin dark to hide when\nyou draft, a muscular frame for war, and of course, above all, always and\nforever, your ability to draft seven colors. It’s not so simple, of course, to\nbreed humans. And while some traits can be guessed with a fair degree of\naccuracy, we know not nearly the complexity of ourselves.

It almost got her mother killed by the father, jealous fool,\nwho still suspected her patrimony until the girl was old enough he could see\nshe had his nose and eyes both. The world is more marvelous than we\nknow, Kip. But you’re here for a reason. What would you have of me?”\n“A favor,” Kip said. “Actually, two.”\n“I gathered. It’s rare that people come simply for my excellent\ncompany.”\n“I’m sorry, have I done something to offend? I don’t know the protocol\nhere,” Kip said. He still had a weight on his soul.\nShe shook her head. “Please, go on.”\n“There’s a magister named Kadah. I think she’s requested transfers to\nother duties. Probably multiple times. Maybe long ago, and she has since\ngiven up. I think her transfers were blocked by some enemy of hers. Would\nyou grant her application?”\nThe White looked pensive. She lifted a hand and gave some rapid set of\nsignals that a secretary understood. A slave quietly hurried out the door.\n“An odd way to get rid of a magister you don’t like,” the White said.\n“It’s not for me. It’s for her. She’s miserable, and she’s bad at her work\nbecause of it.”\n“I’ll know the truth of it in an hour. I’ll decide then. And the second\nthing?” the White asked.\nI want you to tell me about the Lightbringer, Kip wanted to say. I want\nyou to tell me about the Blinder’s Knife.\n“I need a tutor,” he said instead. “I don’t mean to sound arrogant, but I\nhave so much to learn. I’m a full-spectrum polychrome, and I can’t sit in a\nclass where I’m only hearing things that I already know. Much less waste\nmy time butting heads with a jealous magister.”\n“You think I can find you a magister who isn’t jealous of a full-spectrum\npolychrome son of a Prism who’s being given preferential treatment?”\n“I was hoping you would do it,” Kip said.\nShe laughed, truly surprised. “Oh, Kip. I’d forgotten how audacious the\nyoung can be.”\n“I’m… important,” Kip said.\nShe liked that less. Her smile faded, died.\n“In a very narrow sense, is all I mean,” he continued. He struggled to\nfind words. “My importance isn’t—I shouldn’t be given preference because\nof who I am. I’m important in that I have a vital function to perform.”\n“And that is?” she asked, wary, perturbed.\nI am to save my father, he wanted to say. It was a good purpose. Maybe\nit was even the purpose to which Orholam had called him. But if he said\nthat, he would be lying. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “But the task is what’s\nimportant.

My audacity is to serve Orholam without fear,\nbelieving he will walk with me through fire.” He wanted to be that certain,\nthought that he should be that certain, so he didn’t realize it was a lie until it\nwas already out of his mouth.\n“Kip, we are all people of will here. Every man and every woman who\nwrestles light has tasted godhood. We are all important, or Orholam\nwouldn’t have given us these tools, wouldn’t have trusted us with these\npowers.”\n“Like he trusted the Color Prince.” The words were out of Kip’s mouth\nbefore he could stop them. “I am so sorry, High Lady.” He bowed his head.\n“Don’t you see, Kip, the Color Prince’s insanity and grasping for\ngodhood is no counter to what I said. Power is the ultimate test of a man.\nThe more you’re given, the more opportunities for corruption. That many\nfail the test doesn’t mean Orholam is wrong; it means that men are free.\nAnd great souls succeed or fail spectacularly.”\n“Like my father,” Kip said.\n“Your father most of all.” She hesitated, then waved her secretaries\nback. They immediately got up and went to stand by the door. One pulled a\ncurtain between them and Kip and the White. Only a Blackguard remained,\nwatching.\nAnd my grandfather, he should have said. It was a perfect segue to\naddress what he had seen. But what did he have to tell her? Andross was a\nwight, and then he wasn’t? Oh, and I lied to you and the entire Spectrum\nabout what happened on the ship. Kip was pushing his luck as it was. He\nwas like a novice Nine Kings player. On the boat, he’d prepared one move\nahead, and the lies he had prepared had worked spectacularly with the\nSpectrum. But now he was simply playing whatever card came into his\nhand. The lies made a lattice, the old moves constrained the new ones.\nHow does Andross do it? Does he remember what lies he’s told every\nplayer?\nOf course he does. That’s what the Guile memory is for, for him. Here\nKip didn’t even know who all the players were. The White liked him, but he\ndidn’t think she would find the lies of a sixteen-year-old amusing or\nmasterful. She was old, and old people want to see young people as\nrefreshingly direct, simple, sweet, and innocent.\nHe might be holding exactly the card she needed to play against Andross\n—for theirs was a game going on decades—but Kip couldn’t give it to her.\nPerhaps, in this great game, there is no giving of cards. Only trades.\nThe White rummaged in her desk. She pulled out a small framed picture.\n“When I die, Kip, I want you to have this. And after you’ve used it, if he\nstill lives, I want you to give it to Gavin.” She turned it around, and Kip saw\nthat it was one of the new Nine Kings cards. “This is the work of a dear old\nfriend of mine—”\n“Janus Borig,” Kip said.

He took the\nframed card from the White. It was called the Unbreakable. It was beautiful.\nJanus Borig had clearly lavished attention and time on this work. Where\nsome of the cards were the product of haste and compulsion—though all\nshowed her total mastery of her art—this card was as intricately painted as\nany Kip had seen. A young woman with fiery hair stood on a hill dominated\nby an oak, the smoking ruins of an estate to her left. To her right was an\nabyss. Tiny flecks of blue and green touched her gray eyes. Tears stood on\neach cheek, but her jaw was set, eyes fixed on some point in the distance.\n“I’d just buried my youngest daughter,” the White said. “Calling me the\nUnbreakable has felt sometimes like a cruel joke, and other times a\npromise. I chose to live, to fight, even when fighting meant to fight despair\nand the taunts of meaninglessness that is the abyss. This card is not all\npleasantness, but I should like to be understood, someday.”\n“Damn, you were beautiful. And fierce! And—and I can’t believe I just\nsaid that out loud,” Kip said. He’d slipped up in recognizing the art. If he\npretended to slip up in another direction, he might be able to distract her\nbefore she demanded to know how he knew Janus Borig’s work.\nThe White laughed. “Well, thank you. I think perhaps Janus was being\nkind.”\n“Janus isn’t kind. She’s honest,” Kip said. “That’s what a Mirror…”\ndoes. Shit. Can’t hold a thought in your head for six seconds, can you, Kip?\n“Don’t feel bad,” the White said. “I know an artful dodge when I hear\none. And I’ve dealt with your father and grandfather for far too long to\nunderestimate you, Kip, even if you are young.”\n“You send satraps out of here crying, don’t you?”\n“It’s happened,” she said drily. “Janus,” she said.\nSo Kip told her about his meetings with Janus Borig. He told her that the\nwoman had been working on his card. He told her about the assassins with\nthe shimmercloaks. He told her about Janus Borig dying in his arms.\nHe could see it was a blow to the White.\n“Kip, this is vital. Did she save anything from the fire?”\nKip had been bracing himself for that question for the entire\nconversation. “She wanted me to grab something, but the fire was so\nintense, and there were piles of gunpowder everywhere. I was only able to\ngrab the shimmercloaks.”\nThe White studied his face. “You’re a good liar, Kip, but I’ve dealt with\nthe best. The shimmercloaks are good for killing people, but the cards are\ngood for a thousand purposes. Janus wouldn’t have let you dawdle grabbing\nweapons while letting the truth burn. It was her whole life’s work.”\n“She wasn’t conscious,” Kip said, not willing to let a good lie die."

Broken hearts have\nfresh places to bond with new faces.”\nKip wasn’t sure how to take that, wasn’t sure he could believe it. He\nsaid, “You had other daughters? I mean, other than the one… Er, sorry.”\n“Had, yes. Grandchildren, too. Had.” She stared at him for a while,\ninscrutably. She put away the framed card. For a moment, Kip wondered if\nshe’d forgotten what he’d come here asking. Then he saw a twitch of\namusement in her eyes. She could tell he was wondering if she was old and\nsenile, and she was letting him wonder. It was a game to her.\nAnd this woman was preparing for her death of old age? She was\nbrighter than the rest of the Spectrum combined!\nKip waited.\n“I’m too busy to teach you myself, though you intrigue me, little Guile. I\ndo hope you make it to full flower. You are a boy with such potential.” She\nclosed her eyes for a moment, upbraiding herself. “Your pardon, a young\nman. I’m afraid that all men under forty are boys to me now. No, I can’t\nteach you. I will look into the matter of this magister, though. And… you do\nneed a tutor; this much is plain. You will continue with those classes she\ncannot teach, but in all she can, Lady Guile will be your tutor.”\n“Lady Guile?” Hadn’t Felia Guile joined the Freeing in Garriston? Kip\nwondered about that sometimes. She’d been in Garriston at the same time\nhe had, and she’d never even asked to see him, her only grandson. Maybe a\nbastard was too shameful. “Oh! You mean Karris?!”\n“Mmm,” the White said, with a little smirk.\n“That’s great!” Kip said. Even if he was a little scared of her. She clearly\nknew everything, and she had his total respect."

She may need some convincing.” The White’s smirk faded. “Kip,\nOrholam walks men through fires every day. I believe that. But before you\nwalk through fire, make certain it’s one he’s asked you to walk through.”\nChapter 29\nAfter three days, the storm abated. Gunner had the Bitter Cob drop anchor\nin the lee of some little island while he waited for the skies to clear so they\ncould find their bearings. The pirates were good enough to feed the slaves\nbefore they slept. Gunner was fastidious in keeping his goods performing at\ntheir highest potential.\nGavin slept like a stone, woke, and slept again. He dreamed again, and\nknew he was dreaming. He was a child, and everyone was gone. Mother\nand father were at the Chromeria: father for some ceremonies, and mother\nto be near him. Gavin got to go with them because he was older. Dazen and\nSevastian had to stay home with the servants and house slaves. Dazen woke\nalone in his bed, and thought of calling for his nurse. He was eleven years\nold, almost. Too old to be afraid of the dark. He wasn’t sure what he’d\nheard, but he lay in bed, listening, almost too scared to breathe.\nHe was eleven. Too old to be such a scaredy.\nThrowing off the covers, he reached from his bed to where his child-\nsized sword had fallen, trying to pick it up without stepping out of bed. It\nwas too far away. He took his blanket and threw it over the sword, holding\non to one edge. He pulled it toward himself, and it dragged the sword a\nlittle. In three more tries, he had it.\nSwallowing, he drew the sword out of the scabbard. He heard glass\nbreak. It sounded like it came from outside, but he knew that was a trick of\nhow the Guile home was laid out. The doors were huge, thick. Breaking\nglass could only mean that one of the other windows had been smashed\ndown the hall. Sevastian’s room!\nDazen forgot his fear and jumped out of bed.\nHe threw his door open and ran. The hallway stretched longer and\nlonger. He reached a full sprint, but the walls deformed. He was getting\nshorter and shorter, fading, fading.\nWhen he reached Sevastian’s door, his hand passed through the latch. He\ncouldn’t touch anything. Couldn’t change anything. His hand passed\nthrough the wood, too.\nHe threw himself at the door—through the door.\nThe blue wight snarled, standing over Sevastian’s bed, all blue skin and\nred blood. It jumped up to the window and disappeared into the night.\nDazen only saw his little brother’s bloodied, broken body. He screamed.\nThe smell of blood washed over him as he picked up Sevastian.\nHe was dead. The little boy had been pierced, a sword stroke or a spear\nthrust right in the middle of his chest.

Little Dazen, wailing inconsolably,\nhad no space for any other thought, but the dreamer saw more than he\nremembered. That sword or spear thrust had hit Sevastian high in the chest\nand come out the middle of his back. Sevastian had stood to confront the\nintruder, and been slain where he stood. A single, sure stroke. Good-hearted\nlittle Sevastian hadn’t even had time to dodge or fight, hadn’t believed\nsomeone would come to murder him in the night.\nHis own hands smearing blood on Sevastian’s perfect, angelic face,\nDazen wailed. Lying there, eyes closed, Sevastian could have been\nsleeping. Dazen shook him.\n“Wake up! Wake up!”\nGavin woke to Orholam shaking him.\nIt took Gavin long moments for rocking of the ship and the hardness of\nthe wood under his back to sink in. One nightmare to another.\n“These are the dreams you send me, Orholam?” he demanded. “Go to\nhell!”\nChapter 30\n“Sailing galley. Ilytian canvas,” Leonus said.\nGavin thought it was horrible news, but the slaves murmured like it was\na good thing. “What’s that mean?” he asked.\n“Ilytian canvas, uh, uh, means Ilytian ship, uh, most like. Fuck. Fuck,”\nFukkelot said.\n“Don’t the Ilytians have the best cannons?” Gavin asked.\n“Don’t matter,” Bugs said, across the aisle from Gavin. The man had\nsome sort of condition, made his eyes bulge. It was hard to look at him,\neven in shades of gray. “Treat their slaves worse than they treat their dogs.\nStarve ’em, beat ’em so bad they can’t barely row. Ilytian galley can’t run\nas fast, can’t turn as fast as we can. Not by a long sight.”\nIt made sense, Gavin supposed. Ilytians captured more slaves than\nanyone, refused to be bound by the laws on the taking of slaves that the\nChromeria imposed on the other six satrapies. If slaves were cheap, there\nwas no need to take special care of them. The dead could be easily replaced.\nIlytians were real bastards.\nGunner was Ilytian.\nGavin had found the man amusing, before he was under his power.\nThought it was funny to play with Gunner’s mind by stoppering the man’s\nmusket rather than killing him back when he sank his ship near Garriston. If\nhe’d killed him, he wouldn’t be here now.\nFunny how the mind can wander, even when rowing. Gavin’s frequently\nbloodied hands were wrapped now in cotton. He had a new empathy for\nKip, who’d burned his left hand falling into a fire before the Battle of\nGarriston. His hands were agony every day. He’d thought he had a man’s\nhands before, rough and callused. He’d given himself too much credit.\n“Win or die,” Leonus shouted.\nThe slaves didn’t shout the response. They hated Leonus."

Boy!” he shouted to the young man who had taken his old job\nas foreman’s second. “Whip that line. Now!”\nThe boy hesitated.\n“Now!”\nThe boy lashed the whip across the bare backs of one of the lower rows.\nThey cried out in pain. More than necessary, Gavin thought, but the boy\nhadn’t hit them as hard as Leonus liked.\n“Win or die!” Leonus shouted.\n“Row to hell!” the slaves replied.\n“Never slack!”\n“Row to hell!”\n“Scratch the back of Shadow Jack!” Leonus shouted.\n“Row to hell!”\n“Row right back!” he shouted.\nThe drums began pounding out their tempo, and Leonus disappeared to\nthe next slave deck.\n“Don’t think I’m going to make it through this one,” Nine said.\n“You never think you’re going to make it through, Itchy.”\n“This time’s different. I can feel it.”\nAs before, with scores of men sweating in the tight confines of the\nrowing deck, it got hot fast. It was a bright, calm day outside, which meant\nthis would be a clean, simple race to the death.\nThe drums pounded their steady tempo, and Gavin rowed. And rowed.\nAnd rowed. Twenty minutes. The boy went around and gave them water. At\nleast he didn’t smash their lips with the long-handled cup. Not on purpose,\nanyway. Thirty minutes.\nFinally, Leonus poked his ugly head belowdecks. “Drums, corso!”\nThe drums picked up, and Gavin settled into the new tempo happily.\nHappily. How strange was that? There was something oddly freeing about\nhaving no decisions to make. Go when they say go. Stop when they say\nstop. Eat when they say eat. Avoid the lash.

Will you still love me when you find out I’m not what I was?\nHe could imagine the looks in people’s eyes, the pity. He had been\nrespected, loved, and feared in every corner of the Seven Satrapies, but the\nfoundation of his power had always been his drafting. He’d been so much\nbetter than everyone else—so effortlessly good—that he’d become nothing\nelse. He wasn’t a man; he was a drafter. You couldn’t think about Gavin\nwithout knowing he was the Prism, that he was drafting. That he was the\nbest. The best now, probably the best in hundreds of years. Without that, he\nwas… what?\nAn arrogant figurehead who ritually murdered scores of drafters every\nyear. A hothead who threw young women off his balcony when they\ndispleased him. And got away with it.\nOther drafters made the transition from magical power to political power\nwith no problem. The White had done it gracefully, his father less so. But\nGavin? It wasn’t in him.

By this Sun Day, it would be over, for\ngood or ill.

I wanted us to have\nchildren, to see you holding new life in your hands, to be whole with you.\nGavin suddenly wanted to vomit, and it wasn’t from the exertion.\nThe drummer sped the tempo again, and Gavin didn’t care. And again,\nthe last sprint, but his mind was still, impenetrable, the actions all at a long\nremove.\nThen, a shouted order, and the slaves stowed their oars with unhurried\nprecision.\nWith the crash, Gavin was thrown out of his reverie. Wood screaming on\nwood. Oars snapping like kindling. Men shouting in pain and fear and rage.\nMuskets rattling. A cannon booming. The stench of black powder and fear.\nMen thrown off their benches. Gavin found himself staring at a gap-toothed\nsailor in the other ship. The man was standing up, having been thrown\ndown by the collision.

He\ndropped, but someone else grabbed the slowmatch.\nThe ships continued their slide past each other, and the cannon boomed.\nWood exploded, tearing the steps off and filling the slaves’ deck with\nburning hot blinding smoke. The Bitter Cob’s cabin boy staggered past\nGavin’s bench in the smoke, twisted metal protruding from his back.\nAnother cannon boomed, tearing a hole upward, letting dazzling\nsunlight in, illuminating the roiling black smoke.

All the slaves were coughing, lying down, abandoning their task of\nstabbing their counterparts with the oars.\nGavin heard the clatter of the grappling hooks at the end of the boarding\nnets as they were thrown across the now widening gap between the ships.\nPirates were shouting, and the distinctive crack of Captain Gunner’s musket\nsounded with a frequency that shouldn’t have been possible. Shouted\norders, and the clatter of feet across the decks over their heads, and the\npirates boarded the other ship.\nThen, abruptly, the Bitter Cob was quiet.

The slaves began sitting up, assessing the damage, even as screams\nfor mercy and shouts of rage sounded from the other ship just paces away.\nThe cabin boy was dead, or unconscious and on his way to dead, lying\nin the center aisle. A young kid, and not possessed of good looks or virtue,\nbut not deserving this, regardless.\nThe stairs up to the second deck were half torn off. Half a row of slaves\nhad been pulverized. Blood slicked the deck in the back rows.\nBefore Gavin could even complete an inventory, someone swung down\nfrom the boarding nets and dropped in through the hole the cannon had\nblasted. He clambered for a bit, almost losing his balance. Any of the slaves\nnearby could have knocked him into the sea, but they were all frozen with\nsurprise. The man was light-skinned, blond, dressed richly. Gavin didn’t\nrecognize him immediately as one of the crew. Worse, it didn’t look like\nany of the other slaves did, either. He wasn’t one of the Bitter Cob’s sailors,\nand he had a sword.\n“I’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “If you’ll row for me, I’ll free\nyou.” He let that sink in for a second, then said, “I’ll free you now if you’ll\nhelp me throw off the boarding nets. But quick!”\nWith his voice, Gavin placed him immediately. The young man could\nonly be Antonius Malargos, a cousin of Tisis Malargos, who had become\nthe Green briefly, before Gavin had deposed her, and a nephew of Dervani\nMalargos, who had become a god briefly, before Gavin had killed him.\n“Who’s with me?” Antonius asked.\nA slave raised his manacled hand, and Antonius’s pale skin lit with red\nluxin. He filled the lock with red luxin and then set it alight, burning it out.\nIt burned the slave’s wrist, too, but he was free.\n“Quickly! We have only moments,” Antonius said. “Most of the pirates\nare on the other ship. We kill the few men still here, cut the boarding nets,\nand push off. I’ll free you all, I swear it on Orholam’s name.”\nIt was a decent plan, if a desperate one. The other galley didn’t have any\noars on one side. If Antonius could seize the Bitter Cob and throw off the\nboarding nets, he’d have a good chance. If he made it ten paces, he’d\nprobably make it back to port.\nAnd as a Malargos, he had no reason to make sure Gavin made it home\nalive. In his place, Gavin didn’t think he’d bring Antonius home. His\nfamily’s mortal enemy, delivered into his hand. Gavin’s heart despaired.\nHe saw Leonus had fallen between two slaves’ benches. The man had\nstruggled to his hands and knees. He was bleeding a stream from his scalp.\nLooked worse than it was: scalp wounds bleed heavily. But he did look\nwoozy. Should Gavin warn Antonius?\nA slave behind Gavin raised manacled hands.

He began walking back toward\nhim. His eyes fell on Gavin, then moved on. No recognition. The Prism was\ndead. This bearded creature in rags and filth was nothing.\nGavin felt sudden hope that he might live, and a sense of the most\nprofound divorce from himself he’d ever known. Antonius had seen Gavin\nin person before, and seen his face reproduced in a thousand paintings,\netchings, and mosaics. And he didn’t see him. He saw a slave. Gavin had\nthought himself inseparable from his power, from his title, from his\nposition. He wasn’t even inseparable from his own face.\nAntonius stopped. Looked at Gavin again quizzically. His eyes widened.\nGavin missed whatever happened on the boy’s face next because he was\nlooking at the boy’s raised sword. So much revenge for the Malargos\nfamily, that close.\nGavin knew death, and he watched it coming, unblinking.\nAntonius dropped to his knees. “Your Holiness? You live!”\nGavin’s eyes snapped back to the boy’s. Far from thirsty for vengeance,\nif anything, Antonius looked on the verge of tears. Tears of worship,\nadoration, hope.\nA child, not bound by what his parents hated. An innocent, putting his\nfaith in a man he’d never met.\n“Your Holiness, let’s get these chains off you!”\nHow long had it been since Gavin had seen such goodness? How long\nsince he’d felt it himself? Too long, and now it was too—\nToo late, Gavin saw the movement. Leonus lurched to his feet behind\nAntonius. Gavin’s hand shot out to stop him—and was jerked short as he\nreached the end of his chain, the manacle biting into his wrist, bloodying it.\nWorse, stopping it. But all Gavin saw was Leonus, crashing into Antonius’s\nback, blade first. He tackled the young man into Gavin, stabbing repeatedly.\nGavin was carried off the back of his bench by their momentum, the bench\ncutting his knees out from under him. The oar overhead and his manacles\nkept him from falling all the way to the ground, as his oarmates first were\ncaught unprepared, and then tried to help drag Gavin out of harm’s way.\nGavin couldn’t move fast enough. He pulled the bandages from his\nhands, unraveling them as fast as possible, and lashed out with a knee. He\nmissed because he was held too far away, then he kicked out with one bare\nfoot at Leonus. Somehow, he hit the man in the throat.\nLeonus rolled back on his heels, gasping. It gave Gavin a split second,\nand he used it to drape his bandages down around Leonus’s neck. Once,\ntwice, Gavin wrapped them, and then he yanked. It pulled the man off\nbalance toward him.\nInstantly abandoning his plan to strangle the man, Gavin hugged\nLeonus’s head against his chest. With his twisted spine, Leonus’s neck had\ngrown thick as a bull’s with muscle. Gavin whipped his torso left and right,\nleft and right. He couldn’t hear any crack of the neck breaking, didn’t feel"

Where\nare they? I can’t burn open your manacles without them!”\nThe slaves began looking around furiously. Suddenly, freedom was this\nclose—and with Leonus dead, it suddenly seemed real.\n“Ah!” someone cried out. He lifted a mangled frame, the red lenses\nshattered to dust and tiny bits nowhere near big enough to draft through.\nThere was blood on the deck—could it be enough? No, there wasn’t enough\nlight.

She drew\na silk robe around her heavily pregnant belly. Child number thirteen didn’t\nseem to want to leave her womb yet. Stubborn, like his mother. Her own\nmother had taught her that lovemaking would help convince a child to come\nto the light, and Arys had no baseline to say her mother was wrong—she’d\ntried it with every pregnancy. With her third, Jalen, her climax agonies had\nmelded directly to labor pains, and Jalen was the sweetest of her children by\nfar.\nBut this boy, number thirteen—the number of Orholam added to the\nnumber of man—he was going to be special, she knew it. Just as she knew\nit was going to be a boy. She moved to her desk and began reading her\ncorrespondence. The correspondence never ended for Arys Sub-red. Letters\nfrom her satrap, of course, but also letters from family begging favors, from\nfamily friends begging favors, from friends of family friends begging\nfavors. There were people asking favors for things she couldn’t control in a\nhundred years.

Her sources didn’t\nthink much of the man, or of the plan.\nAtash had fallen as fast as a bard’s pants, barely slowing the Color\nPrince’s advance. If this wild gamble at Ox Ford didn’t work, her own\npeople were next. Arys would do anything she had to do to save her people.\nShe looked at one of her personal letters. It was from her sister, Ela. Ela\nwas at least as passionate as Arys, and not half as wise. Ela claimed that\nGavin Guile had seduced and murdered her daughter, Ana. She begged,\ndemanded, ordered, and begged again that Arys do everything in her power\nto avenge her niece.\nNot that Arys had been sitting still. As soon as she’d heard Ana had died,\nshe’d begun investigating. Of one thing she was certain: Gavin hadn’t\nseduced Ana; Ana had been trying to seduce Gavin. According to her\nroommate, Ana had tried half a dozen times despite increasingly firm\nrebuffs. The roommate had also said that Ana had been under intense\npressure from her mother Ela to seduce Gavin, though that had taken some\nprodding to get out of the frightened girl. Whatever had happened in that\nroom, Ana, the damned fool girl, had gone there of her own accord, and she\nshouldn’t have been there. The Blackguards on duty had sworn, at least\nthree times, that Gavin had screamed in fury at the girl and she’d jumped\noff the balcony in terror.\nAna had been a pretty girl, and love her though she did, Arys had\nthought she was spoiled horribly. When people had less than half a dozen\nchildren, they always spoiled them. Ana had probably never had a man\nscream at her in her life. And yet, jumping off a balcony?\nWas Ana that stupid? Arys didn’t think so, but there was no way to\nprove it, was there? There were three witnesses, and they all said the same\nthing. Arys had hired the most beautiful courtesan she could find, and paid\nthe woman a ruinous sum to seduce one of the young Blackguards who’d\nbeen there, a Gill Greyling. The courtesan had seduced him, got him drunk,\nand asked him about the event. His story hadn’t changed. The courtesan\nsaid she thought he was lying, but if a man wouldn’t let go of a lie when\ndrunk and blinded by lust, there was no shaking it from him. It was a dead\nend, a sadly literal one.\nDamn you, sister. What was the worst that could be true of Gavin Guile\nhere? That he got furious at the daughter that you’d sent to seduce him\nrepeatedly, and when she’d succeeded in getting into his bed and nearly\nruining his relationship with Karris White Oak, whom everyone knew he’d\nloved for fifteen years, Gavin threw her off the balcony? If that was what\nhad happened, Ela was as responsible for it as anyone.\nNot that Arys wouldn’t make Gavin pay for it, too, if she ever found out"

She caught\na glimpse of her lover stirring in her mirror.\nThe work did have its perquisites, though, she supposed.\nWith her unfashionable red-red straight hair and freckles, many other\nwomen of thirty-five years would find it difficult to procure lovers. She did\nwhat she could to darken her skin and hide the freckles and the worry-lines,\nand few would guess that she’d had twelve children (though, honestly, most\nwould guess she’d had one or two), but even dressed well, Arys’s beauty\nwas not the type of beauty that was celebrated at the Chromeria. Her blue\neyes were her best feature—everyone loved blue eyes. But she’d had a\nlover—in her younger days, before she figured out how to pick men who\nknew the proper use for their tongues—who, immediately after they’d made\nlove, had told her that her freckles were a tragedy. That otherwise she\nwould be a beauty men would praise to the stars.\nShe’d been young, and not so good with her impulses as now. She’d\ngrabbed his stones and tried to rip them off. She’d broken all of her nails,"

She’d broken all of her nails,\nbut his scrotum had torn in her hand. And then he’d beaten her fiercely.\nIt was easy to forget when you had so much power that sometimes the\nonly power that mattered was the power of muscles.\nIt had taken her a minute to even remember she could draft while being\nbattered and thrown against the wall by that screaming, terrified, furious\nman, holding his torn scrotum in one hand and making a fist with the other.\nAnd then, drafting at long last, she’d burnt him to a husk. She’d lost the\nbaby she was pregnant with at the time, and had never known if it was from\nthe beating or from the huge amounts of heat that she’d drafted. Either\nwould have been sufficient, she supposed.\nShe was at peace with her relative good looks now. Power made up for\nit. Pretty men and boys sought her out. Mostly, though, she preferred those\nwho were not too pretty, but were instead strong enough to bring good\nblood to the Greenveil family, either drafters, or intelligent, or charismatic\n—they had to have some excellence, when she was looking for a father. Her\ncurrent lover was probably a short-termer, though. Elijah was terribly\ninteresting with his amber eyes, and wonderfully willful, a skilled lover,\nintelligent, and there was something oddly dangerous about him. But she\nwasn’t sure she wanted him to be the father of child fourteen. She doubted\nshe would keep him for another six months. But in the meantime, she\nplanned to enjoy herself.\nDrafting a little sub-red, she inhaled deeply. The sub-red blew on the\ncoals of her lust.\n“Elijah?” she said.\nHe sat up on the bed. He was exactly what she liked at this point in her\nlife. Lean and muscular, with some interesting scars on his arms and chest,\nhe kept his orangey-red hair cut close to his skull, his freckles were faded\non his face and arms, his skin was ruddy, and he had beautifully white teeth.\nHe looked at her—pregnant as she was—with undisguised desire. Having a\nman who would worship your body when you were hugely pregnant and\nawkward was perhaps the greatest luxury a woman could have.\nBut as she stood to go to him, she felt the familiar tightening in her\nbelly. She hesitated. She’d been having practice labor pains for months, and\nshe wanted to be sure.\nElijah stood and walked over to her, naked. “Is it time?” he asked. He\nheld her from behind, kissing her neck and cupping her swollen breasts in\nhis hands.\nShe couldn’t breathe for a moment. Her stomach felt as tight as a drum.\n“Yes,” she said finally, pushing his hands away. “I have to prepare\nmyself. If there’s time between cramps, I may need you again. Get\ndressed.”\n“Do you need me to summon your slaves?” Elijah asked.\nShe hesitated. The pain passed. “Not yet. It may be hours yet. Maybe\nyou can put on that cloak of yours and nothing underneath,” she said. Truth\nwas, she couldn’t imagine making love now that she’d actually started"

        "text": "you can put on that cloak of yours and nothing underneath,” she said. Truth\nwas, she couldn’t imagine making love now that she’d actually started\nlabor. But if it was false labor, she wanted him here. She could fuck out her\nfrustration.\nIf she were honest with herself, she wanted him here regardless. If there\nwas one thing she regretted about not having married just one man, it was in\na few times like this, where she wanted someone to love her and worry\nabout her and try to protect her foolishly from things he couldn’t protect her\nfrom. She wanted to tell Elijah she needed him for that, but she couldn’t.\nShe sat at her mirror, drew out her kohls, powders, paints in grease to\nwithstand the sweat that would be her lot for the next hours. The Greenveils\nwere from the deep forest, and they kept the old ways in this. New lands\nand new titles were well and good, but he who loses the center of his circle\nis lost. Like the pygmies from whom they were long ago descended, the\nGreenveil women prepared for childbirth as for battle. Arys was a good\nhand with the paints. Before she’d risen so high that it was unseemly for her\nto help other women with their makeup, she’d done it often. She missed it.\nFor her first few children, she’d planned elaborately what her paint\nwould look like, believing it would be an omen for how the child’s spirit\nwould turn out. She’d given up on that, and drew as the whim took her\nwhen she sat. She bound her long red hair back in simple braids, and\napplied the nine black dots across her forehead symmetrically around what\nwould become a drawing of a fire crystal, then she connected the dots with\nyellow paints, making wings sweeping out toward her temples. An inverted\ntriangle under one eye, a tear under the other. She had barely touched the\nrouge to her lips when the next cramp hit her, taking her breath, sending\nlightning through her belly to her back.\nShe paused, eyes closed, for a full minute. Then, though the pain hadn’t\npassed, she continued with her rouge. Lips full and red, exaggerated. Lines\nof gold paint to emphasize her cheekbones. The contraction eased and she\nworked more quickly. Thorns.\nHow could one forget this pain? How could anyone want to go through\nthis more than once?\nArys drew black thorns on the back of each hand, down the fronts of her\nthighs, in the center of her chest, bracketing her breasts, bracketing her\nswollen belly.\nIt wasn’t good enough for the perfectionist in her, but as the next\ncontraction hit, Arys decided it was good enough. She reached for her bell.\nAnd Elijah trapped her be-thorned hand.\n“What are you doing?” she asked.\n“I could ask the same,” he said. “Nine points on your forehead? For nine\ngods you never knew?”\nThere was something odd in his amber eyes. His smile was a little too\nbig, and so white. “Elijah, this is not the time,” she said.\n“Oh, Arys, but this is exactly the time.

I need you to listen closely to me\nfor a very few minutes, and then make the most important decision of your\nlife.” He lifted her hand from the bell. “Would you like me to help you with\nyour paint? I’ve got quite a delicate hand for this sort of thing.”\n“No!” she said. “Take your hands off me or I’ll scream.”\n“If you scream, you and your baby both will die.”\nHe said the words in such a pleasantly neutral voice that she couldn’t\nbelieve she’d heard him correctly. She froze.\n“I seduced you so that I could be here at this very moment, Arys\nGreenveil. My name isn’t Elijah, it’s Murder Sharp, of the Order of the\nBroken Eye. But I do some sidework, too. And when I can satisfy two\nfactions at once…” He smiled. “I’m a very special kind of drafter. I can kill\nyou without leaving a trace. And I can get away with it. Childbirth is so\nvery dangerous, isn’t it? Especially for an older woman like you. And\nbefore you try anything, please know that I can kill you very, very quickly\nand silently. If you say anything, you’ll die. Your death would please one of\nmy employers more than the other, but it would upset me greatly.\nNonetheless, all are free in the light. Light cannot be chained, nor can the\nwill of any drafter.”\nThe contraction eased enough for her to take another breath, and she felt\nutter dread. He’d betrayed her! Made her look a fool. Her fury gathered,\nand the sub-red that had become part of her, body and mind, blew on those\nflames.\nElijah slapped her. Not hard enough to leave a mark for long, but hard\nenough to stun her. “Think of your child, you fool,” he said. “I haven’t even\ntold you the deal yet. Listen.”\nA sudden contraction seemed to tear her in half. She couldn’t have\nspoken if she wanted to.\n“I need your vote, and your silence. When the Spectrum next meets,\nthey will take up the matter of voting to make Andross Guile the\npromachos. You will vote for him. In return, when it is time, Andross will\nhelp make one of your sons or daughters a Color, and he will send help\nimmediately for your family and your country against the Color Prince. It’s\na generous offer. There will be no counter. He also buys your silence about\nthis visit. If you ever break this silence, I will personally kill all of your\nchildren, your sisters, and your brother. I will be a plague that sweeps\nthrough your house. In fact, that will be the excuse we use for so many\ndeaths in one family—a plague.”\nBy the time the pain passed, Arys had recovered her wits. “Why would\nyou do this? Are you not working with the heretics?”\n“The Order of the Broken Eye is… practical. You should admire that. If\nworking for Andross Guile helps us for now, why should we not? But\nkilling a Color is something the Order loves.”\n“Help me stand,” she said. “I need to walk to the birthing stall.” She\nreached up. Suddenly, one of her arms dropped, swinging dead to her side\nand slamming into her chair."

Suddenly, one of her arms dropped, swinging dead to her side\nand slamming into her chair.\n“You don’t need to go there yet. I’m not so ignorant. Nor should you be\nignorant of my power. That is the smallest fraction of it,” Murder said. He\nmade a flicking gesture, and her arm began tingling, feeling slowly\nsuffusing the flesh once more. “By the way, it’s a boy. Do you want me to\nstop his heart? Is that what you need to be convinced?”\n“You monster.”\n“War makes monsters of us all, and Lucidonius started this war, not us.”\n“Go to hell.”\n“That’s your answer? That’s your vote?” Murder asked.\n“You wouldn’t kill the baby. I’ve looked into your eyes as we made\nlove. I’ve seen your soul, Elijah.” She couldn’t have been so wrong about\nhim, could she? She’d looked to him for his body, his flattery, his\nwillfulness, and his quick tongue. And she’d barely looked at him at all,\npast that. He’d been a diversion. She began to ease open the drawer with\nher knee.\n“Elijah was my name, once,” he said. He sounded wistful. “I gave it up\nwhen I took the blinkers off my eyes to see the glories of a world\nunchained. I liked it when you said my name. I still do. Arys,” he said, his\ntone sharp suddenly, “I know you’ve got a pistol in that drawer. I unloaded\nit.”\nShe stopped moving.\n“I enjoyed my time with you far more than I thought I would, High Lady\nGreenveil. You’re beautiful and intelligent and wilder than any woman I’ve\nhad in years. You can say no to Andross Guile, because to hell with him,\nright? I understand. I’ve wanted to say it a time or three myself. If you say\nno but keep your silence about me, I’ll let the baby live. And I’ll make your\npassing as painless as possible.”\n“I could lie.”\n“There are six of your children on Big Jasper. Do you think you can get\nthem off the island without Andross knowing what ship they’re on?\nBecause if you lie, they die first. Then I go to Green Haven and work\nthrough your circle. It will not disappear altogether; my reach is not so\ngreat, nor my time infinite. But a plague can undo an entire life’s work in\ndays.”\n“You’re that kind of butcher?”\n“I am a holy warrior. I do not always enjoy my orders, but I always obey\nthem.” His voice was low, but filled with conviction.\n“I should have seen it,” she said. When she’d been young, she’d looked\ninto each of the many who tried to woo her with a paranoid focus. In recent\nyears, she hadn’t paid as much attention. Too much sub-red, too long with\nfading looks.\nHe didn’t answer, didn’t tell her that he was very good at what he did.\nOf course he was. They would have only sent the best.\n“Lunna Green?” she asked suddenly. The Color had died inexplicably a\nfew months ago.\nHe nodded, acknowledging it was his work."

The Color had died inexplicably a\nfew months ago.\nHe nodded, acknowledging it was his work.\n“Who was that for? Guile or your order or both?”\nHe shook his head. “You don’t need to know.”\n“Help me to the birthing stall,” she said. She would die squatting, as\nmany a woman in her line had done before her.\n“You need not my help nor any man’s,” Elijah said.\nIt was true. Her last gasp of hope—using some martial art against him—\nwas ridiculous in her pregnant state anyway. Better not to lose her dignity.\nDignity. I think about dignity, on my way to the birthing stalls? I am\ngetting old. She looked at Elijah as he donned his gray cloak. He pulled a\ngolden choker attached to chains within the cloak out of a pocket along the\nneck and fastened it tight against his skin.\n“That your idea of freedom?” she asked.\n“I serve in chains that others may live without them,” Elijah said. But he\nwasn’t her Elijah anymore.\n“One day, in your perfect world?” she asked.\n“One day,” he agreed.\nShe stood, on her own. “You’ll wait until after the babe is born?”\n“I will.” He paused, suddenly awkward for the first time. “I’m afraid I’ll\nalso need one of your teeth. I’ll wait until after, though. I just thought you,\nyou should know. Your third molar on the left is quite beautiful.”\n“I suppose I shan’t be needing it,” she said, genuinely puzzled.\nHe seemed relieved that she didn’t panic or insult him.\n“How do you intend to stay hid—Oh,” she said as he closed his cloak\nand, after a shimmery wave passed through his cloak, disappeared, every\npart of him becoming identical to the wall behind him except for his bright\nbright amber eyes, which appeared to hang in space. She opened her eyes to\nsub-red, and there he stood. Clever, some mist walker’s cloak out of story.\nSo that was how he intended to be in the room where no men were allowed.\nThat was how he intended to know if she complied.\nSome small part of her was outraged that her murderer should watch her\nin such intimate moments, moments meant only to be shared among\nwomen. But that part of her was small, and tired. She hurt, and it was\nenough that the hurting would end. Not just the hurting of pregnancy, but\nthe hurt of healing again, of cracked nipples and sleepless nights—the\nGreenveils kept the old ways, and took care of their own, no nursemaids, no\nsurrendering the pleasures and pains of parenting to another. Family roots\nmust be nourished first if they are to bear much fruit later. She hurt from the\ndrafting, and the wanting to draft. Every pregnancy, she had more trouble\nstopping, and she felt sub-red’s grip redouble on her when she went back to\nit. She didn’t know how much longer she’d make. She’d told herself two\nyears.

She would war with her flesh to push one more child to the\nlight, and then she would lay down her burdens and trust the circle she’d\ngrown to take care of its own.\nShe reached for the bell to summon her slaves. “May my curse live on\nyou, Murder Sharp.”\n“And my blessing on you, Arys.

Meetings and spying and listening and posturing?\nThe backstabbings that Karris had once had to worry about as a Blackguard\nhad been literal ones. Here, you never saw the blood.\nThough to be fair, a metaphorical backstabbing here could lead to the\nactual death of thousands, not just one. Hmm. That thought put a little extra\nurgency to the verbal fencing, didn’t it? Especially when Karris looked\naround the Spectrum’s chamber and wasn’t terribly impressed by what she\nsaw.\nColors were supposed to be chosen by their satrap for their excellence\nand their piety. In truth, as with all positions of great power, it was far more\ncomplicated. Family loyalties, outright bribes, and even mistakes by the\ncontending families could have led to a Klytos Blue being selected. And\ndepending on the strength of the satrap or satrapah who appointed the\nColor, the Color might be a puppet, a representative, a delegate, or a loose\ncannon.\nIt hadn’t always been thus. The satraps had once been veritable kings,\nwith the Spectrum having to wait weeks or months to vote on the simplest\nmeasures as the Colors waited for their satraps’ commands. Successive\nWhites and Prisms and Colors had worked together—united in this—to\nconcentrate power here, at the Chromeria, and here, in this very room.\nAnd still it bored Karris. Boredom was dangerous. A Blackguard knew\nthat. Boredom made you sloppy, careless, and dead. You couldn’t get sloppy\naround Andross Guile. They were waiting for the arrival of a few of the\nColors still. Andross had called the meeting. Karris studied the figure across\nthe table.\nThere was something different about him. Something that had changed\nover the course of the last weeks. In her time as a Blackguard, Karris’s\nidentification of potential threats had always been intuitive. Her training had\ntaught her to translate those gut feelings—not just seeing a holistic threat,\nbut realizing that the man was sweating, twitchy, not paying attention to\nwhat others around him were. Since the Battle of Ru, Karris had felt more\nand more that Andross Guile was a threat.\nShe’d dismissed it as hypervigilance, paranoia, hatred. Now that she had\nmarried his wayward son, which he had opposed for almost two decades, he\nhad more reason to hate her than ever. There were a thousand reasons to see\nAndross as a threat.

But why did she now see him as the kind of threat that\nmade her Blackguard intuitions tingle?\nAndross had always been a threat, always had power close at hand. But\nthat power hadn’t been physical in years. Now… something was different.\nHe wasn’t slouching anymore. In fact, he’d stopped slouching\nimmediately after Ru, hadn’t he? He seemed stronger, had regained that\nGuile broadness of shoulders, perhaps simply from holding himself well\nagain, but perhaps it was new musculature—or worse. And he walked\nfaster. Why? He was older. He’d lost his last son. If anything, a normal man\nwould be weakened by such things, would be hastened toward the grave.\nBut not Andross Guile.\nOrholam have mercy, he’d gone red wight. Right under their noses.\nHe’d been aggressive and willful for so long that no one had noticed his\ntransition. Red to red wight.\nKarris felt short of breath. She knew wights. Had hunted them with\nGavin. Some could maintain the mask of sanity for months. They were a\nwalking blasphemy, but they could speak of Orholam. They could hide\nalmost anything—but they couldn’t hide their eyes.\nAnd Andross Guile had been hiding his eyes for years. Blocking the\nlight, blocking temptation, he said. What if, instead, he was blocking\neveryone else from discovering what he was?\nKarris reached to her hip unconsciously, but there was no ataghan there,\nno bich’hwa on the other side. Her own breath was harsh in her ears as her\npulse picked up, as the battle juice began to flow. He would see her, he\nwould take one look at her face, and he would know.\nIndeed, these spectacles were different from the black lenses he’d worn\nbefore Ru. These were merely dark. He was no longer blind. No longer\nneeded to be, because he wasn’t afraid of the temptations to draft—he’d\nalready given in to them.\nAnd now her rational mind picked up those details she should have seen\nbefore—Andross looking straight at people, noticing visual details that he\nshouldn’t have seen if he’d been blinded by blackened lenses. Mistakes,\nsloppy mistakes for a man keeping a secret. Perhaps understandable\nmistakes for a red wight, though. They were not known for their discretion.\nPart of Karris was terrified—but part of her rejoiced. If he was a wight,\nhe could be unmasked. Unmasked, he would be Freed immediately, Color\nor no Color. And then he would be gone. Dear Orholam, she could finally\nbe rid of him.\nShe knew that a better woman would mourn losing her father-in-law to a\nviolent death, would mourn even more that he had embraced madness and\nblasphemy rather than taking a dignified exit—but Karris wasn’t that\nwoman. She wanted Andross Guile dead, dead, dead. And if he were\nshamed and denounced in the process, so much the better.\nAs Delara Orange came in, reeking of brandy, Karris started scheming\nhow she would unveil Andross, and how she would get a weapon\nbeforehand.

Wights who were unmasked were often devastatingly fast in\ntheir response, and people facing a wight who’d thought the person was\ntheir loved one were often tragically slow. Even Blackguards.\nAnd it was the Blackguards who had the only weapons in this room.\nPerhaps, then, magic was the way. She would have to watch Andross’s\nskin—but the wily old goat was covered from head to toe, even wearing\ngloves.\nProof, then.\nKarris had sworn not to draft, but she wasn’t going to take that\nobedience—intended to keep her alive for longer—to be an order to die.\nShe wondered if she could fill herself with green luxin without any of these\ndrafters or Blackguards noticing. Out of all the people in the world, these\npeople would be the hardest to hide such a thing from.\nAnd yet there was no other way.\nKarris leaned over, putting her elbows on the tabletop, scooting her chair\nback, in a most unladylike but thoughtful pose. She looked from person to\nperson at the table, but it was all a show. She wasn’t thinking; she was\nhoping.\nThe White was wheeled in slowly, and she appeared drawn and\ndefeated. Karris sat up, and as if realizing that her chair was blocking the\nWhite’s wheeled chair’s path, she stood, bumping the young Blackguard\nGavin Greyling. She scooted her chair in with an apology and moved out of\nthe way, then sat, dropping the dagger she’d lifted into a pocket.\nA dagger, against a red wight. Not the odds she’d want, but it was good\nto have a backup if she weren’t able to draft before he attacked.\n“Before we bring this meeting to order,” the White said, “I’m afraid I\nbear sad tidings. Our friend and colleague Arys Greenveil has passed away\nin childbirth this afternoon.”\n“Orholam have mercy,” Orange said. She put her hand to her mouth.\n“No, no, no,” Jia Tolver said. The Sub-red was her cousin.\n“What happened?” Andross Guile asked.\nThe White shook her head. “Her chirurgeons said that she seemed\nunusually tense, that she knew something was wrong, but she wouldn’t say\nwhat. She only cared about her babe, Ben-Oni, she named him, Son of my\nAgony. After she heard his first cries, she hugged him, looked into the\ndistance, and lost consciousness. She never woke.”\n“Damn her,” Delara Orange said with real grief, “I told her she couldn’t\nkeep having children forever.”\n“We each serve as best we know,” Andross said quietly. It was meant to\nbe comforting, and for a moment, Karris believed him. She’d forgotten that\nbefore he’d become the spider, he’d been a man of charisma almost as great\nas his son’s.\nShe looked at him now, wondering. Could a red wight maintain such a\nfaçade?

Dead during\nchildbirth. She remembered her own childbirth. The pain. She’d thought she\nwas dying herself. She had wanted to die, for a time. And then she’d\nrealized she didn’t hate herself, she hated her weakness. She’d come back,\nremade herself, joined the Blackguard, become brave.\nAnd yet she’d run from that child. Was still running. Still felt sick at the\nvery thought of it. She hadn’t told Gavin about it, when he’d exposed all of\nhis shameful secrets to her. He’d bared his throat to her, and she’d held him\nand listened, as if she were pure.\nHer child—her son, for they’d told her the gender of her child by\naccident, though she’d begged them not to—was out there now, deep in the\nwoods of Blood Forest, right in the path of an army of wights. It turned her\nstomach.\nYou can’t run forever, Karris.\n“I’m sorry to intrude on our grief,” Andross Guile said, finally, when the\nprayers were finished. “But as we all know, these present crises give us little\nrespite, no matter how much we need it.”\n“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Andross,” Delara said. “Bring your business.”\nKarris grabbed for the dagger in her pocket. A red wight, rudely\ncontradicted? Powder, meet sparks. But…\nAndross Guile smiled sadly. “Delara, I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve been\nrude to you. Unfeeling. You’ve endured much in these last months, and I’ve\nadded to your burdens, not eased them. I beg your forgiveness.” At first,\nKarris thought he must be mocking her, a snide, stone-cold deadpan\nsarcasm. But his gestures were placating, his tone sincere.\nSomeone leaned back in her chair, and when it creaked, the whole room\ncould hear it, loud as a musket shot.\nAndross Guile looked down at his lap, as if ashamed. “These last years\nhave been hard for me. I have seen my own power shrink. I stopped\ndrafting to retain my sanity, and it was like shutting off the tap to Orholam’s\nmajesty for me. I have lived in darkness. The physical darkness made me\nsick, and became moral darkness as well. I have only thought of myself.

Slipped away because she\nfeared—rightly—that I wouldn’t give her my permission. When I lost my\nlast son—” He stopped, a hitch in his voice.\nHe raised his head and turned his bespectacled eyes toward the White.\n“You and I have jousted for years,” he said sadly. “And for years, I have\nresisted your wisdom.

I\ntook to wearing gloves, and black spectacles, not just to shield myself from\nlight, but to shield myself from your sight. So you wouldn’t know how\nclose to that fire I stood.” He heaved a sigh, and Karris gripped her dagger\ntightly, wondering if he would shoot out of his chair and start killing.\n“It is time,” Andross said, “for truth.”\nKarris widened her stance, putting her feet on either side of her chair so\nshe could jump.\nAndross began tugging off his long gloves. “At our last meeting, I am\nashamed to confess it, but I was at the break point, and when we prayed for\na miracle, I had only a mustard seed of faith that Orholam could do\nanything for us. For me.” He looked up, intensity writ in every line of his\nface. “But I am here to tell you today that Orholam is mighty. And he is\ngood. I fell asleep at prayer, believing nothing could save me, ready to\nsuicide when I woke. I slept. I dreamed. In my dream, Orholam told me that\nold and frail as I am, he is greater than my frailties. He is magnified in my\nweakness. He is mighty to save. We are earthen vessels, but we can serve\nfor his honor, and he will empower us to serve as he wills.” Andross took\noff his gloves and tossed them on the table. He threw back his hood. “I\nprayed, I slept, I dreamed, I heard, and I am remade.” He opened his cloak\nand dropped it in his chair, and took off his darkened spectacles and\ndropped them on the table.\nKarris had known that Andross Guile was in his mid-sixties—knowing\nthey would die young, drafters usually married early, usually bore children\nas soon as possible—but in her mind she’d believed he must be ninety years\nold at least. He was old, he was decrepit, he had one foot in the grave.\nBut this Andross Guile wasn’t the one she had known. She dropped her\nstolen dagger from nerveless fingers.\nAndross Guile was bedecked in a luxin-red tunic with gold brocade that\nemphasized the broadness of his shoulders, the power of his straight back.\nHis once-lank hair had been cut short, washed, combed. His skin seemed\nyoung, taut where it had been loose and flabby. But none of those were the\nreal wonder. He laid his hands on the table, then turned them over.\nNeither back nor palm was stained with red luxin. And as he turned his\neyes on each Color in turn, finally coming to Karris, she saw the real\nmiracle: Andross Guile’s halos weren’t even halfway through his irises. He\nlooked like a man with ten more years of drafting in his eyes.\nIt was impossible. It had to be a hex, a phantasm of orange magic.\n“Touch me,” he said. “Look and see. Delara, is this a hex?”\n“N-no,” she said. She didn’t appear to be able to say anything else.\nJia Tolver did touch Andross. She touched his hand, his arm, in open"

The others needed no such proof.\n“Orholam be praised,” Klytos said, and if nothing Andross had done or\nsaid for the last few minutes had seemed calculated, Klytos’s invocation of\nOrholam certainly did. It snapped Karris back to reality. Andross Guile,\nwhatever had happened to him, was still Andross Guile. She shouldn’t lay\ndown her wits simply because the impossible had happened. He was a\nGuile; the impossible always happened with that damned family.\nOf course, I’m a Guile now, too. Dammit.\nAndross let the silence stretch until it seemed someone else was about to\nfill it, and then he said, “Orholam has charged me with a task, and has\nequipped me for it, and today, I ask the Spectrum to concur with his will. I\nam to put down this heresy, this blasphemous Color Prince, and to do so, I\nmust be made promachos.”\nIt was a little rushed, but perhaps Andross Guile didn’t see any benefit in\nwaiting.\n“I nominate Andross Guile to be promachos,” Klytos Blue said.\n“I second my nomination,” Andross said.\n“Point of order!” Delara said. “Do we even have a quorum? Green is\ngone with no replacement yet named, the Prism is missing, and Arys has not\nyet been placed at rest.”\n“The election of a promachos requires a majority of the currently\nserving Colors,” Andross said.\nCarver Black nodded, confirming the truth of that. Everyone around the\ntable quickly calculated what that meant. Black had no vote. White voted\nonly in ties. With Sub-red dead and no replacement yet named for her, and\nGavin missing along with the vote he carried as the representative for the\nexiled Tyreans who’d moved to Seers Island, a majority meant he only\nneeded three of five.\nHe continued, “It’s a high hurdle, to be sure, but Orholam has given us a\nway to move forward despite that. You all have known me for many years,\nand you’ve known Orholam and how he works. You all know the crisis\nbefore us. I see no need for further deliberations. I call the question.”\nKlytos voted yes, of course. Andross voted yes, saying that abstaining\nwould be a false modesty. That left Jia Tolver Yellow and Delara Orange.\nHe only needed one of them. If he lost both of them, the White would vote.\n“I vote nay,” Delara Orange said, folding her arms. “You have played\nme the fool for the last—”\n“This is not the time for speeches,” Andross snapped. “It’s time for\nvotes. Jia?”\nJia scowled, her unibrow squirming as her face went through a dozen\nexpressions. “I cannot stand in the way of Orholam.

Her tone and face both were\ninscrutable. “We will administer the oaths of office tomorrow in the great\nhall. Acceptable, promachos-elect?” she asked.\n“More than acceptable, High Lady.” Andross Guile smiled. He didn’t\neven try to hide his triumph.\nThey were adjourned. Karris stood and walked out into the hall. She\nhanded the dagger back to a confused Gavin Greyling as the young\nBlackguard stepped into the hall, but her chastising quip caught in her\nthroat as she saw a familiar figure waddling down the hall.\n“Caelia?” she asked. The little woman was not only a keen mind, she\nwas also a drafter. Caelia had been the Third Eye’s right hand, and had\nbecome indispensable to General Danavis—now Satrap Danavis—in ruling\nSeers Island, which Gavin had made a new satrapy. “What are you doing—\nOh no.”\n“That’s Caelia Green to you, appointed by Satrap Corvan Danavis of\nTyrea,” the woman said with a grin. “Boat just landed a few hours ago.\nWould have been here sooner, but there was some mix-up at the docks. I\nmiss anything important?”\nSo that’s why Andross had seemed rushed. He’d found out a dissenting\nvote was arriving. One vote would have been enough to ruin his plans. A\nmix-up at the docks? Andross’s people had been stalling Caelia while the\nSpectrum met.\nAnd on a difference of three minutes, all of history changes.\nChapter 33\nGoing back to the library after all that had happened to him since he’d been\nhere last was eerie. Everything was exactly as it had been when Kip left. He\nwalked past study tables with holes cut in the desktops for inkwells to rest,\nprotecting them from being spilled. He passed down aisle after aisle of\nbooks, specially laid out to deal with the circular nature of this library, the\nbookcases themselves each slightly curved. This was only one of many\nlibraries on Little Jasper, but it was the one that even first-year discipulae\nhad access to, so it had been where he’d spent the bulk of his time.\nA pang of nostalgia struck him, and he made his way to one of the desks.\nA stoop-shouldered nearsighted young scholar sat there. “Excuse me,” Kip\nsaid. “I’m looking for Rea Siluz.” The kind librarian had helped his studies\nof the cards and everything else. She’d also been the one who’d directed\nhim to Janus Borig, the Mirror.\n“Uh-huh,” the young man said. He turned back to his work. He had his\nown stacks of books and notes that he seemed deep in the middle of.\n“Hey, I was—”\n“There aren’t any books on Rea Siluz. If you have a problem with that,\nlodge it with the Office of Doctrine.”\n“Huh?” Kip asked. “I’m not looking for a book on her, I’m looking for\nher. This tall, skinny, narrow face, dark hair? Usually works the late shifts?”"

Usually works the late shifts?”\n“Tell Timaeus very funny, and I hope his treatise rots in review.”\n“I don’t know anyone named T—”\n“Shh!” The librarian turned back to his own work.\nKip gave up. Maybe someone in one of the later shifts would know her.\nWeird, though. “I need access to the upstairs library,” Kip said.\n“What year are you?” the librarian asked, peeved.\n“I’m a Blackguard inductee.”\n“Prove it,” the librarian said.\n“Step out here for a bit,” Kip said. He cradled a fist in his other hand.\nThe man didn’t look intimidated in the least. “Accosting a librarian will\nget you banned from all libraries for a year.”\nThe cards spread in Kip’s hand:\nRam, the bully. “A year? Doesn’t sound so bad.” A little looming, a little\nviolence threatened. A little bit of taking a young man’s physical weakness\nand rubbing his nose in it like dogshit. Smart Ram. “A year?” Kip said.\n“During war? And me a Blackguard, who might need this knowledge to\nfight? I don’t think so.” Lord Ram: “I’m a Guile. You think anyone’s going\nto punish a Guile for breaking your face? I could throw you off a balcony,\nand no one would say a word.”\nAnd he actually considered playing each, or all. He stopped, disgusted.\nCome a long way since Rekton, haven’t I? From powerless weakling to\nslaveholding bully. He had long known he was changing, but to this? Was\nthis what he wanted to be?\n“I’m sorry,” Kip said. “It was a jest, and a poor one, unworthy of me and\nunfair to you. I beg your pardon.”\nThe librarian looked at him as if a Blackguard apologizing was the\noddest sight he’d ever seen. “Given,” he said. He shrugged. “Name?” he\nasked, fishing through his piles for a list.\n“Kip Guile.”\nThe librarian coughed. “The Godsl—Ahem!” He shuffled his papers.\nStopped. “Uh, you can go straight up, Master Guile,” he said.\nBut Kip had no joy in it. Godslayer. It was another burden, another\nexpectation, like he’d done it once, so surely he’d do it again.\n“Uh, question,” Kip said. He turned on a chagrined, charming smile.\n“Could I have just gone up without asking?”\n“Of course. But if anyone is discovered in those libraries who is not\nallowed there, the penalties are severe. But we don’t guard the door or\nanything. I mean, it’s books.”\nGood old Kip, ready to bash down doors—that were unlocked.\nThe first person Kip saw in the restricted library was Commander\nIronfist. What?\n“Commander! It’s great to see you!” Kip said. “I was kind of intimidated\nby the whole ‘restricted library’—”\nThe commander looked up sharply. “I’m working, Breaker.”\n“What are you working on?” Kip asked eagerly."

Move on.”\nKip craned his head to see the title, and read aloud, “Mothers of Kings:\nAn Unconventional Inquiry into Abornean Bloodlines? What’s that about?\nAnd all these others?”\n“How far do you think you can run in twenty-four hours?” Ironfist asked\nflatly.\nA dim light bloomed in Kip’s tiny, tiny brain: Warning, stupid! “Yes,\nsir!” he said, and retreated before he could hear any more words, which\ncould only spell pain.\nKip moved to a desk where another luxiat five or six years older than\nhim was studying. “Pardon me, can you tell me where the genealogies are\nkept?”\nThe young luxiat looked up. His eye twitched guiltily, like he was\nreading something he shouldn’t be. It was in some language Kip didn’t\nknow, though, so he had no idea what it was. The young luxiat scowled and\nsaid, “You walked past it. Where that huge Blackguard is.”\nHuge Blackguard? Commander Ironfist was legitimately famous. People\non Big Jasper stopped and stared when they saw him, and not just because\nhe was huge and handsome.\nBut the Chromeria was an enormous community, and to some, the\nfamous people here were scholars or luxiats—people Kip had barely even\nseen. This young man would probably be as stunned that Kip couldn’t\nidentify the six High Luxiats as Kip was that this luxiat didn’t know\nIronfist. It was a little dose of humility.\nUsually I need those more directly.\nAnyway, much as Kip wanted to see the genealogies and family\nhistories—how much time and blood had he spent getting access to those?\nIt had been his original purpose in joining the Blackguard—he couldn’t go\nand sit down by Ironfist, not now. “Black cards,” he found himself saying. It\njust slipped out.\nThe young luxiat just looked at him. He looked somehow familiar, but it\nwas probably just that everyone looked the same in those goofy robes.\n“The heresy decks,” Kip said. Digging deeper, Kip.\n“You young ones. You get access earlier than everyone else, and you still\npush it.” The young luxiat shook his head. “Those books are in the\nrestricted library.”\n“This is the restricted library,” Kip said. “Isn’t it?”\n“You think there’s only one?”\n“I did until just now.”\n“Smarter than you look.”\n“Huh?”\n“But not by much, apparently.” The luxiat closed his book. He still\nlooked tense. “Sorry. Look, you’re a Blackguard inductee, I can see that.\nThat doesn’t give you access to everything. Heretical materials and\nforbidden magics are off-limits to everyone except the Colors and those\nthey’ve given special permission. The black cards are black because they’re\nheretical, ergo…”\n“Ergo, books about them are in the heresy section.”\n“In the restricted libraries, but close enough.”\nKip saw that this wasn’t going anywhere.

He’d just\nbeen talking to the White. He could have asked her. She would understand\nhis interest in the black cards, at least, but that was no guarantee that she\nwould think he should have access to them. And what was he doing here\nanyway? Trying to find scandals to destroy Klytos Blue? Who knew if his\nfather even needed that done anymore? Too late, Kip. Again.\nGavin was being held on a pirate ship. Doubtless the pirates would be\ntreating him well—he was the Prism, after all—though Kip figured they’d\nhave to be keeping him blindfolded or something to keep him from ripping\nthem all to pieces with his power. Still, who knew when he would be back?\n“What’s your name?” Kip asked.\n“Quentin. Sorry. Quentin Naheed.” Nervous type, Quentin was. Seemed\nto have a hard time looking Kip in the eye. Oh well, scholars.\n“Nice to meet you, Quentin. How do I show that I have permission?”\nKip asked.\n“You’re just going to go get permission?” Quentin asked, smiling as if\nhe thought it was kind of cute that Kip thought it would be so easy.\nKip didn’t answer. Didn’t much like grinning condescension.\nQuentin shook his head, giving up. “I’ll be right back.” He walked to\none of the librarians’ desks and rummaged through a drawer, making small\ntalk with the woman there. He came back and handed Kip a small square of\nred parchment.\nKip quickly filled in the relevant blanks, and as Quentin watched him,\nperplexed, he walked over to Commander Ironfist. “Can you sign this for\nme, sir?” He handed him the quill, already dipped in ink.\n“Breaker, do you know how many ways I could disable you with this\nquill?”\n“No, sir.”\n“Do you want to find out?”\n“Only if that knowledge is academic rather than experiential, sir.”\nThe corner of Ironfist’s mouth twitched, but it might have been Kip’s\nimagination.\n“This will make you go away,” Ironfist said. It wasn’t a question.\n“Instantly, sir.”\nIronfist signed it, barely glancing at it. “Breaker, fortune favors the\nbold… but don’t be bold with me again.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nKip went back to grab his things and ask for directions to the forbidden\nlibraries. Quentin answered, seeming stunned that it had been so easy for\nhim. “Hey, uhm, Quentin, thanks. You’ve been a big help.”\n“My, uh, my—I can’t believe you just—”\n“I know, it’s not fair. Try not to hate me. My family is kind of a bunch\nof… Well, we’ve got it better than we deserve. Hey, what do you study?\nCan I grab a book for you while I’m in there that might help you?

I, I\nstudy all sorts of things. I’m, I’m a polymath.” He blushed. His eyes flicked\nup to Kip’s, then away, and he spoke in a rush. “Sorry, I’ve been working\non getting over false humility, but it’s really—anyway, I’ve studied first-\ncentury saints; I’ve memorized everything on Alban and Strang, and their\ncommentaries. Transitional rituals from the time of Karris Shadowblinder.\nA little on alternate histories. Your eyes are glazing. The memorization of\nall those commentaries usually gets some res—it’s five volumes—no?\nDoesn’t matter.”\nHe’d studied all sorts of things? That sounded potentially useful.\n“Anything modern? Or is that too danger-fantastic?” Kip smirked, though,\nto show he was teasing.\n“By modern you mean contemporary?” It was a real question, though,\nand Quentin seemed to forget his awkwardness as their conversation moved\nto his territory.\n“I didn’t realize there was a—”\n“Sorry, pedantic. Structures of persistent tribal hierarchies in Abornea?\nUm, modern martyrs? Kind of thought my own path might take a missional\nturn for a while there, not to mention martyrical. Temple construction\ntechniques?”\n“I don’t suppose you know anything on modern genealogies? Noble\nfamilies from now and during the False Prism’s War?”\n“No.”\n“Mm.” It had been too much to hope, Kip figured. Like Orholam would\nsimply send him exactly the one scholar who knew everything he wanted to\nknow. He was more surprised how easily he’d called it the False Prism’s\nWar. Growing up in Tyrea, they’d called it the Prisms’ War. Kip hadn’t\nchosen to call it the False Prism’s War to fit in; it hadn’t even been a choice.\nThis place was changing him. “You seem familiar. Have we met?” he asked.\nQuentin shook his head, blinked, froze, suddenly shy again. What a\nstrange boy. “I don’t know. It’s possible. Please don’t take offense, but I\ndon’t really pay attention to Blackguards.”\nThat was fair. Kip didn’t think he’d really looked a luxiat in the face in\nall the time he’d been at the Chromeria. He had a thought. Quentin had said\nthat he’d memorized impressive amounts, and he’d clearly been given\npermission to study whatever he pleased. That had to be unusual, so he\nmust be highly favored. Perhaps not so unlike Kip—though Quentin had\nearned what privilege he had. “Tell me, Quentin, you’re probably famous in\nyour circles, right?”\n“I wouldn’t call it famous—blight and rot! There it is again. False\nhumility.” He sighed. “In my limited circles, yes.” He flushed again. “And\nsorry for swearing.”\n“How long did it take for them to try to sweep you up into their\npolitics?”\n“What? Who? Sorry, I don’t understand.”\n“The luxiats. Whoever’s over you.” Kip could tell Quentin knew exactly\nwhat he was talking about, though."

Whoever’s over you.” Kip could tell Quentin knew exactly\nwhat he was talking about, though.\n“The magisterium is Orholam’s hand on earth. It’s not politicized like\nother institutions,” Quentin said. Nervous. Defensive.\nFor a moment, there was a choice. To Kip the Lip, or not. And then Kip\nsaid, “A liar. Huh. That’s too bad. You seemed like you could have been a\nfriend. Good life to you, Brother Naheed.”\nChapter 34\nKip didn’t have time to go to the restricted library immediately, and Karris\nstill hadn’t contacted him, so he headed to his next lecture. The magister\nwas Tawenza Goldeneyes. She was ancient for a drafter, perhaps sixty, and\nwith a ferocious reputation. They said she only took three discipulae a year\n—yellow superchromats, all. Kip, of course, would be joining the class after\nit had been meeting for months.\nHe headed for the yellow tower, crossing through the elevated walk with\nonly a single gulp at the heights, and arrived minutes later at the door of a\nsmall lecture hall. He paused at the closed door. There was a sign on it. “No\nMen Allowed.” He stopped. Scowled.\nKip Guile, kills gods and kings, afraid to knock on a door.\nTotally different things. This is like walking into a women’s privy.\nHe looked down at his burn-scarred left hand that was so quick to curl\ninto a fist. C’mon, fist.\nHe knocked, a firm but gentle triple tap.\nThe door opened before he rapped for the third time.\n“What are you doing?” an older woman with golden eyes and luminous\nskin asked him. It wasn’t much of a guess who she was.\n“Greetings, Magister Goldeneyes, I saw the sign—”\n“But didn’t read it? Can’t read? Begone.” She swung the door closed.\nKip stuck his foot in without thinking. The door hit his shoe and\nrebounded open. Magister Goldeneyes already had her back turned, and she\nstiffened at the sound.\nThe two young women beyond her in the room, seated, necks craned to\nsee Kip, looked suddenly aghast.\n“Your pardon,” Kip said. “I’m your new discipulus, Kip. I figured the\nsign was a mistake. Surely it means ‘superchromats only.’”\n“And?” she asked, turning. She looked at him like he was an insect.\nKip paused, not sure what she was doing. He said, “I’m a\nsuperchromat.”\n“A superchromat boy is like a dog that can bark ‘I love you.’ It’s a\nnovelty, not a precedent.” She slammed the door.\nKip took it. Just when he’d been feeling like he was Little Lord Guile\nGets His Way. In the scheme of things, he probably was way past deserving\nit. Besides, it let him go to a forbidden library before Andross Guile could\nfigure out some way to screw him out of it.\nHe realized he was blocking the door and a homely Abornean discipula\nof about twenty with faint yellow halos was trying to get past.

There was a librarian sitting in a\nchair in front of the door, reading. He looked excited to actually see\nsomeone. “Oh, greetings!” he said. He pulled a key out of a pocket and\nextended his hand.\nKip handed the man his red parchment.\n“Kip Guile?” the librarian asked. He could obviously read, so Kip\nwasn’t sure how to parse the deeper question in the voice.\n“That’s right.”\n“You were there.” The librarian licked his lips. “Is he alive? Truly? They\nsay he is, but that’s what they would say, isn’t it? To make us keep hope\nuntil Sun Day, wouldn’t they? Is the Prism really alive?”\n“I swear it,” Kip said. “I helped pull him out of the water. He was\nbreathing. It’d take more than a few pirates to put an end to Gavin Guile.”\nThe librarian nodded, heartened, his whole mien getting lighter. “That’s\nright, that’s right. After all he’s done.” The librarian scowled down at the\nred parchment and said, “Thank you, and I wish I could let you in for giving\nme that news alone. But I’m sorry, sir. New rules. Your grandfather has\ndecreed that only those with his personally written permission will be\nallowed access to this special section.”\n“What?” Did he even have the authority to do that?\nThe librarian said, “Just came down this morning, not two hours ago.”\nTwo hours ago. Before Kip had even come up with his brilliant plan to\nget Ironfist’s signature. Kip didn’t know whether to feel better because this\nmeant that his grandfather’s spies weren’t that good, or to feel worse\nbecause his grandfather had foiled Kip’s plan before Kip had even come up\nwith it.\nLittle Lord Gets His Way, huh?\nIt took the wind from his sails. He only ended up going to one lecture. It\nwas engineering, and the lecture covered angles of incidence: mirror armor\nquality and the refraction of luxin. The class easily had the best\ndemonstrations, with armorers and war drafters standing up and talking\nabout why this quality of mirror armor would perform against a missile of\nblue luxin at this angle, but not that one, and how keeping the armor clean\nwas one of the biggest problems, dirt making them less reflective.\nSome Mirrormen—usually either the elite infantry of any satrapy or\nsimply the richest—took to wearing very thin cotton coverings over their\narmor so that they would constantly be buffing their armor to a high shine,\neither shedding it as they went into battle or keeping it on throughout. It\nwas less impressive, one armorer said, but there was no reason not to let the\nluxin weapons attacking you do the work of cutting the covering.

He certainly wasn’t\ngoing to go to the basic class with Magister Kadah, but that was the only\nclass he technically had permission to skip. But there was too much else to\ndo with war looming to waste on histories and hagiographies not directly\nrelated to the war.\n‘Uses of Luxin in Art’? Now? Who were they joking?\nOther than the engineers, it didn’t seem anyone else had broken out of\ntheir denial that the war was real—and that they might lose.\nAfter that lecture, Kip went to lunch. None of the Blackguard inductees\nwere there. Most were on a staggered schedule to allow them to make it to\nlectures and still go to practice. Kip saw the reject table where he’d sat just\na few months ago. The group was gutted now. Teia and Ben-hadad had left,\nsubsumed into the greater culture of the Blackguard. Kip had barely\nbelonged at all, and the girl with the birthmark, Tiziri, had been sent home\nbecause of Kip’s failure, stakes in a game of Nine Kings with Andross\nGuile. That left only Aras.\nThe boy was sitting alone. Kip hesitated, and then went toward him.\nAras looked up before Kip could sit. “What are you doing?” he\ndemanded.\n“I was… going to eat,” Kip said. “Can I join—”\n“I don’t need your pity.”\n“Only people who need pity say that,” Kip said, the words crossing his\nlips before he could call them back.\n“Never speak to me again.”\nKip gave up. He went and sat alone and ate his food in silence.\nNot knowing what else to do with himself, Kip went downstairs. He’d\nstill have Blackguard training later today, but he couldn’t bear to sit and do\nnothing. Hurry up and start training me, Karris.\nHe found his father’s training room almost exactly as he had left it,\nexcept the obstacle course had been rearranged. But Kip was drawn to the\npull-up bar.\nBefore the Battle of Ru, that damned bar had been his daily humiliation.\nHe’d come here alone so the others wouldn’t see how pathetic he was.\nHe jumped up and did a pull-up easily. Well, that had been a bit of a\ncheat. He’d had some momentum from jumping. He did another. And four\nmore. Six?\nSix!\nHe dropped to the ground, and for the first time, the burning in his\nmuscles felt like proof of progress, rather than punishment for failure.

He\nwrapped his hands and moved over to the old punching bag, activating the\nlights with some superviolet. For a half an hour, perhaps an hour, he sank\ninto the simplicity of hitting. Condemnations and memories of mockery\nrose to the surface like dross in the heat of the exercises, and he hammered\nthem away one by one. Mother’s sneering quips, Ram’s teasing, General\nDanavis’s disappointment, Aras’s bitterness, punch by punch. He went from\nhitting the bag with sloppy fury to punching with passionless precision.\nThe body mechanics were beginning to sink in, too. He was hitting\nfaster, more precisely, and harder, lines of force tracing up from his planted\nfeet, through his hips, his tight abdomen, to uncurl like a whipcrack as he\ndrove his fist into the bag. It felt… glorious.\nThere was a slight tear in the leather seam high on the bag, and Kip\nfantasized about punching the bag so hard he tore it open. It didn’t happen,\nof course, but the fantasy kept him working.\nHe was just finishing up, unwrapping his hands, when the door cracked\nopen. It was Teia.\n“Thought I might find you here,” she said shyly. “You big dope, you’re\ngoing to be useless at practice. We’ll probably both have to run.” She\ngrimaced. “Sorry, that came out all wrong.”\nKip grinned. “It’s good to see you, Teia.”\n“You, too.” She hesitated. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there. Up on deck, I mean.\nYou’re my partner, and I wasn’t there when you needed me. I’ve been\nfeeling pretty awful about it. And then you came back, and it—it wasn’t\nreally the reunion I’d been hoping for.”\n“About that…”\n“Kip, I, I need to keep some secrets. Even from you. Can you trust me?”\nWhen Kip thought of Teia, he thought of the petite girl whom he’d\nmistaken for a boy, months ago. A young slave, uncertain, in over her head.\nBut also a girl who could accurately rank each of the Blackguard hopefuls\nand estimate that she was the fourth best of them, but somehow didn’t\nrealize quite how excellent that made her against everyone else, or how\nsmart she was to estimate so accurately.\nThis Teia wasn’t that Teia. Kip realized that while he was growing and\nchanging through all the fights and all the old messages he’d told himself\nthat he was realizing were lies, he had somehow thought that everyone else\nwould stay the same. And it was a fool’s thought.\nTeia was little, but that didn’t make her a child. She was being more\nmature than Kip had probably ever been in his life.\n“I heard you saved the raid on Ruic Head,” Kip said.\nTeia shrugged.\n“Watch Captain Tempus said Commander Ironfist wanted to give you a\nmedal.”\n“What?”\n“It got overruled by someone higher up, apparently.”\n“In something regarding the Blackguards? Who could overrule—oh,\ndon’t tell me.”"

Who could overrule—oh,\ndon’t tell me.”\n“That’s right,” Kip said. “So as long as you’re not working for that old\ncancer, sure, Teia, I trust you. You’re still on our side, right?”\nShe laughed, but there was something uncertain in it.\n“Teia, you’re not… you’re not working for my grandfather, are you?”\n“Kip—Breaker, I can’t tell you anything. But I will never betray you.\nYou’re my best friend.”\n“I am?”\nShe looked away awkwardly. Kip could have hit himself. Not the right\nresponse.\n“I mean, I just thought that being my slave—”\n“What?!” Her face flashed to angry.\n“Wait wait wait!” He took a breath. “I wanted to be your friend, Teia. I\nwas always afraid that when I—when I won your papers that it meant we\ncouldn’t be friends. And I didn’t know how much of that stuck around.\nEven afterward, you know. I didn’t know if I’d always remind you of that.\nYou’re my best friend, too.”\nShe looked mollified but still upset. “I’m more than my slavery, Kip.”\n“And I’m more than a Guile, but it’s still there, like it or not.”\nShe pursed her lips, then nodded. She reached up and put a hand to a\nnecklace she had, and Kip wanted to ask about it, but he could tell it was\npersonal. A present from an old master, perhaps? Her face brightened,\nthough her mouth twisted with chagrin. “I didn’t mean to put you on the\nspot. You know, calling you my best friend, like saying—like saying…”\nShe grimaced.\n“I didn’t take it wrong,” Kip said, rescuing her.\n“You didn’t say it back because I—never mind. Can we go hit\nsomething?” She was blushing.\nHe had the sudden desire to grab her hand, but he didn’t. Why did he\nfeel so awkward and young all of the sudden?\nTeia said, “And you have to keep this from the squad.”\n“No one will hear we’re friends from me,” Kip said gravely.\n“Breaker!”\nHe grinned, sketched a quick sign of the three and the four, promising.\nShe grinned back.\nShe moved to speak again, to explain more about not explaining about\ncoming back to the Chromeria bloody, to defend herself somehow, but she\nlet it go, and he credited it to her as maturity. The immature Teia would\nhave checked and double-checked. Or should he think, ‘the slave Teia\nwould have checked and double-checked’? Maybe this is who she always\nwas, only held back by her slavery?\nWell, I did one thing right, in my whole life.\n“I missed you, Kip.” She grinned, and threw a towel to him.\nHe caught it, and his smile felt like it was going to break his cheeks.\n“You ready to head up?” she asked.\nHe mopped his face.

Kip’s\nsmile dropped.\n“Good afternoon, young master… Guile,” the old slave said. As always,\nhe was dressed carefully, looked wrinkled as an old apple, and had a\ndemeanor as pleasant as a night of diarrhea.\n“Grinwoody, you’re looking well!” Kip said with false cheer,\ndeliberately invoking the familiarity of using the slave’s name. How long\nhad Grinwoody been there? Dear Orholam.\n“Your grandfather requires you.”\n“For Nine Kings?” Kip asked.\n“I believe so.”\n“I’ve got Blackguard training,” Kip said. “I don’t want to play him\nnow.”\n“Your desires are irrelevant. The promachos has summoned you. You\nwill come with me. Immediately.” The old man seemed to enjoy making\nKip furious.\nThe promachos? Dear Orholam, no. So that’s how he had the authority\nto shut down access to the libraries. Dammit!\n“Or what?” Kip said. He just couldn’t help himself, could he?\nThe Parian slave turned to Teia. “Or your friend here will be expelled.”\n“Excuse me?” Teia said.\n“You’ve not been addressed, slave. Be silent,” the old slave told her.\nAsshole.\n“I’m not a slave,” Teia snapped.\n“My mistake,” Grinwoody said. It clearly hadn’t been a mistake.\nWell, that answered one question. Teia wasn’t working for Andross. He\nwouldn’t threaten one of his own, would he? Or would he, so secure in his\nbelief that Kip wouldn’t let harm come to her?\nWas Andross so good that he was comfortable playing against his own\ncards, knowing someone else would save them?\nKip felt ill, and he felt afraid. He was trying to match wits against this?\nAndross Guile was godlike in his intellect, and in his ruthlessness. Kip had\ncalled Magister Kadah’s bluff, saying she could never expel someone who\nwas nearly a Blackguard. But Andross could expel anyone he wanted. He\nwas now the promachos. It was a calamity.\n“I’m not ready,” Kip said.\n“He doesn’t require your readiness, he requires your presence.”\nKip cursed under his breath. “I really hate you, Grinwoody,” he said.\nGrinwoody gave a thin-lipped grin. “The heart breaks, sir.”\nChapter 35\nA few of the galley slaves whooped at the discovery of the key. The others\nwere more wary, more frightened, maybe more cynical. Orholam took the\nkey and ran around the galley, unshackling slaves.\n“Grab ten of us to free so we can cut the boarding nets,” Gavin said.\n“We need the rest of them still on the oars.”\n“Free us all!” a slave near the front shouted.\n“In time!” Gavin said.\n“You’re lying to us!

They had no time for this. “Some of us are going to risk death\ncutting the ship free. If we don’t get separation from that ship as fast as\npossible, they’ll just come right back across the nets, or they’ll load the\ncannons over there and kill us all. If you don’t like it, don’t row. Go ahead,\nkill us all.”\nWith that, Gavin dashed toward the stairs. They’d been ripped halfway\noff in a cannon blast. He grabbed a length of wood that had been torn away,\nand leapt up to the remaining stairs. Antonius Malargos followed him\nunquestioningly. The stairs led past the puzzled slaves on the next deck and\nto a cramped landing.\nThe hatch was concealed around two half-turns of the stairs, and closed.\nGavin, Antonius, and half a dozen slaves stacked up at the door. It was\nlocked.\nGavin threw his shoulder into the hatch. It was an awkward maneuver to\nattempt, given that it was almost directly above him.\n“Orholam have mercy, what do we do now?” Antonius asked.\nOne of the slaves reached over Antonius’s shoulder and found a latch\nhidden in the darkness. He slid it open, grinning, nothing but his teeth\nshowing in the darkness. Gavin had hoped that perhaps his monotone vision\nwould help him see better in the dark. So far as he could tell, it didn’t. It\nwas purely handicap. Unlike the wild stories he’d heard about blind men\nhaving preternaturally acute hearing or sense of smell, he had no\ncounterbalancing ability.\nIt was, perhaps, just. When he’d been Prism, he’d had no handicaps.\nHe’d moved from strength to strength. Now he had no strength at all.\n“We need blades,” he said. “Anyone have a knife? A sword? Anyone\nknow how the boarding nets are attached? Is it grapnels, or are they tied on\nthis side?”\nGavin prided himself on his memory, but he’d been unconscious when\nhe was brought aboard. “Doesn’t matter,” he said, thinking aloud. “We\nwon’t be able to untie them if they’re under tension. We’ll need to cut them\nregardless.”\nSomeone handed up one knife. One.\nGavin handed it back. He had training, and a piece of wood. “Boarding\nnets first,” he said. “Our only advantage is our numbers. We gain nothing if\nthey get reinforcements. Nets off, get some separation. Kill men to get their\nblades, and cut those nets. Ready?”\nHe didn’t wait for an answer. He threw the hatch open and jumped onto\nthe deck.\nThe sudden, harsh light nearly blinded him, and being free of the\nconfines of the ship let a flood of sound wash over him. A musket cracked\nfifteen paces away, but the pirate was shooting at a marksman in the rigging\nof the other galley. Gavin ran at him.\nThe pirate didn’t even see Gavin coming.

Gavin’s makeshift club swept into\nthe pirate’s head like an oar cutting the sea. The man went flying in a spray\nof blood, and Gavin was on him in a second, ripping a knife from his belt.\nThen he was up again, running. Speed and surprise were the slaves’ only\nadvantages. One pirate with a sword would be able to cut through half a\ndozen of the unarmed slaves and end their escape before it began.\nThere was one more pirate stationed at the nets at the stern of the ship,\nand this one saw Gavin coming. Through stupidity or shock, the man didn’t\nshout an alarm, but he did ready his saber.\nGavin barely slowed. He lifted the knife and whipped it forward as if he\nwere throwing it. The man flinched, bringing the point of his saber in as his\nmuscles tightened. Gavin brought the knife down to parry the saber and\nthrew his torso to one side as he closed the distance. Knife and saber slid\nagainst each other, the cheap metal throwing sparks. Gavin’s club, wielded\nleft-handed, only struck a glancing blow to the pirate’s forehead.\nBut it was enough to stun him. Gavin followed the first with a full\nbackhand swing. Teeth sprayed, and the man dropped. Gavin knelt on the\nman’s back and jabbed his knife through the base of the pirate’s skull. He\nrose with the saber, and threw the knife handle-first to whoever had\nfollowed him. It was Antonius, and for a second he looked like he thought\nhe was being attacked himself, a victim of friendly attack.\nAntonius dodged out of the way of the knife, and it clattered to the deck.\nHe bent over to pick it up, and a musket ball whistled right over his head,\nscoring the deck ten feet behind him.\nThe other galley was taller than the Bitter Cob, and that could be good\nor bad news, depending on how enraged and careless the pirates were. If\nthey wanted to get across the gap fast, they could sheathe their swords and\nsimply roll down the boarding nets and be across in seconds. No man in his\nright mind who felt threatened would do that, though, and climbing down a\ndeclined rope net wasn’t easy.\nOf course, betting that pirates who followed Gunner were in their right\nminds might be a poor gamble.\nReaching the gunwale, Gavin found that the boarding nets weren’t\nsimply held grapnel to wood, which would have allowed him to pull the\ngrapnel off and let the net drop. Instead, the grapnels were looped around\nthe railing and tied back to themselves, then anchored to the wood railing.\nBad news. But that loop held the hemp rope tight against the gunwale.\nGavin slashed the rope, and it yielded on the second stroke. He looked\ndown the length of the ship. There were four more grapnels. Four widths of\nhemp between him and freedom.\nFour galley slaves had tackled a pirate at midships and were pummeling\nhim to death with fists and feet.

Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Gavin saw a pirate with a musket taking aim at him as\nhe ran, so he did a running slide, dropping to one hip to skim along the deck\nand then popping up with the sword wielder between him and the musket\nman.\nEven as Gavin engaged with the swordsman, he saw other pirates\njumping onto the nets, coming back to the Bitter Cob. He was running out\nof time. His saber and the pirate’s thinner forward-curving ataghan clanged\ntogether, and Gavin was aware how long it had been since he’d practiced\nfencing. How long it had been since he needed it. But a pirate was really\nmerely a sailor willing to kill. That wasn’t the same as a trained warrior.\nGavin saw two wide opportunities for deadly thrusts go by—and he was too\nslow to take advantage, too cautious to press an advantage.\nBut a third came. Riposte and kill, the saber slipping into his opponent’s\nchest only deep enough to open his heart, and then pulling back. Gavin\nstepped back to avoid the possible counterstroke—just because a man was\ngoing to die within seconds didn’t mean he couldn’t kill you in the\nmeantime.\nHe realized that by stepping back, he was clearing the shot for the\nmusket man, and he slapped the swordsman’s blade aside once more and\ngrabbed the man under the armpits even as he heard the musket fire. The\nman jerked, taking the ball in the shoulder right between Gavin’s fingers. At\nleast, he hoped it was between his fingers. All he could tell for the moment\nwas that his index finger of his right hand felt hot.\nHe dropped the still-twitching body, found his finger bleeding, but still\nthere, and slashed the rope where it crossed the gunwale.\nA pirate was coming down the boarding rope more nimbly than Gavin\nwould have believed, walking upright, stepping from rope to rope with the\nagility of a dancer—and fast. But the rope parted on the first cut, and the\nboarding net sagged suddenly. The man jumped, hands stretching to reach\nthe gunwale and—just making it. The shock of colliding with the hull didn’t\nshake the man loose, either.\nGavin slapped his blade down on the gunwale and eight fingers popped\nup in response.\nA short scream and a satisfying splash signaled success.\n“Row!” Gavin shouted as he crossed over the gap that had been blown\nin the deck by the cannon fire. But they were already on it, oars rattling out,\nfirst pushing off the ship, stretching the boarding net.\nThere were two grapnels left—and with a snap, the slaves aft freed one.\nIt left only one at midships. Gavin ran for it.\nWood shrapnel exploded around him from musket balls. A pirate leapt\noff the boarding net, and Gavin slashed his groin open, not even slowing.\nHe saw a pirate finish loading a swivel gun on the deck of the other ship\nand turn it toward him. He dove as it spewed death onto the lower ship.\nGavin rolled to his feet, groped to find the saber he’d lost in his dive."

From that distance, Gunner couldn’t miss.\nThe oars dipped into the waves, but the inertia of the loaded Bitter Cob\nmeant it would be seconds before they moved with any speed.\nThe saber was in Gavin’s hand. If Gunner shot him in the head, he\nwouldn’t be able to complete the stroke. He would die for nothing. But if\nGunner shot him in the chest—the safer shot—Gavin could trade his life for\nthe slaves’ freedom.\nWhat was the value of a few slaves compared to a Prism? What was the\nvalue of a thousand slaves compared to a Prism? What would the world\ngain if Gavin chose to make this sacrifice?\nNothing.\n“You do what you have to,” Gavin said, to himself as much as to\nGunner.\nHe slashed the rope, expecting a musket ball to tear through his body. It\ndidn’t. He’d braced so much for the impact that he didn’t cut the rope on the\nfirst stroke. He slashed again, and it parted. The boarding net dropped into\nthe water, scattering pirates.\nGavin looked at Gunner. The man still had his musket leveled, as if\nunsure himself why he hadn’t fired. Gunner looked to the horizon. Gavin\nfollowed his eyes.\nThe ship that had been pursuing Gunner for years was there. In the fight,\nthe Bitter Cob had sheared off all the oars on one full side of the galley\nGunner was now on.\nGunner wouldn’t be able to flee from the vengeful captain hunting him.\nAnd with his pirates decimated and probably out of ammunition, there was\nno way his crew could win the fight.\nNot killing Gavin meant Gunner would die himself. What the hell? The\nman was bordering on insane, but all his insanity went toward serving\nhimself, didn’t it?\nWith an oath Gavin couldn’t hear, Gunner lowered his musket. His head\nbobbed as he swore a dozen expletives in succession. His eyes were darting\nback and forth, but Gavin couldn’t guess what he was doing. Then\nsomething arced out over the water—a spear? Gavin jumped backward as\nthe musket-sword fell from the sky in a streak and clattered to the deck not\nfar from him.\nWhat?\nThe Bitter Cob’s slaves dipped their oars again, and the boat began\nmoving at a decent rate, opening the gap between the boats, leaving pirates\nwithout any more powder at the gunwales of the other ship, cursing and\nlooking baffled.\nA wave tilted the galley and the musket-sword started sliding toward a\ngap where the gunwale had been shot off.\nGavin dove and grabbed the musket before it could fall into the sea.

As the boats separated, the waves shifted them so they sat nearly stern\nto prow, and Gunner ran straight toward the prow of the crippled ship,\nlaunched off the gunwale and leapt into the air, shouting something that\nmay have been, “Fuck you, Ceres!”\nFor an instant, Gavin thought the crazy pirate was actually going to clear\nthe gap. He soared through the air, arms and legs wheeling—and plunged\ninto the sea with a splash.\nGavin ran to the stern. The galley slaves didn’t pause in their long\nsweeps, and the gap widened, and widened. When Gavin got to the stern, he\nsaw several pirates in the water, but none of them was Gunner. Then he\nlooked down.\nPulled along in the water by a rope trailing from the Bitter Cob’s deck,\nGunner was climbing hand over hand. He reached a loading ladder at the\nback and climbed up deftly. Gavin waited at the top, musket-sword nearly\nforgotten.\nGunner reached the top of the ladder, shook his head to clear his beard\nand eyes of seawater, and extended a hand to Gavin. “What are you waiting\nfor?” he asked. “Help Gunner up.

Whenever Kip had tangled with the old man,\nit seemed he’d gotten the worst of the bargain.\nGrinwoody took them past where the entry hall to the Guiles’ apartments\nused to be. Now that hallway was walled over. Andross Guile had\nincorporated his wife’s apartments into his own, making one, much larger\nset of rooms. For some reason, Kip had thought that Andross would keep\nFelia’s rooms as a shrine to her, untouched.\nApparently he’d given the old spider too much credit.\nThey walked past Blackguards keeping watch outside the outer doors—\nand looking none too pleased to be kept so far away—and went inside.\nFelia Guile’s main room had been converted into an antechamber for\nsupplicants to wait for the promachos to see them.\nThere were eight noble drafters seated around the room, some chatting,\nothers eyeing the rest with open hostility. Kip recognized them as some of\nthe foremost drafters of each color, though he could only put names to a\nfew. The oldest was gray-haired Lord Spreading Oak, who was calmly\nreading a scroll of prayers—or, knowing the Chromeria, pretending to read\nprayers while concealing notes from spies. The rest were in their thirties.\nThere was a dwarf woman whom he’d heard was the new Color for Tyrea.\nHe recognized a Crassos—sister or cousin to the disgraced and executed\ngovernor of Garriston—and Akensis Azmith and Jason Jorvis, whose sister\nhad leapt to her death from Gavin’s balcony in scandalous circumstances\nthe night Gavin had married Karris.

Not\nhis favorite person. Kip had rejoiced none too quietly when he’d heard his\nfather had fooled her into voting herself off the Spectrum.\nOnce when Kip had come out of Andross Guile’s presence nearly\nthrowing up, Ironfist had told him that he’d seen satraps coming out of that\nroom looking worse.\nNo matter how bad Kip’s interactions with Andross Guile, at least Tisis\nwas going to have to interact with him, too.

But as soon as he thought that, he knew he was wrong. He\nremembered this room, albeit dimly. Literally dimly. That chair, that table,\nthat painting over the mantel, they’d all looked different in the harsh,\nsuperfine light of the superviolet torches Kip had drafted, but they were the\nsame ones. That lush carpet, that was where Kip had fallen when the old\nman slapped the hell out of him in the darkness.\nAndross Guile was propped on the edge of his desk, half sitting on it,\nhalf standing. It was the pose of a much younger man, but it seemed to fit\nAndross now. Kip stood, dumbstruck.\nAndross looked like he’d lost a decade or two. He looked like, perhaps,\na tough old farmer or carpenter. He still had a bit of the paunch Kip had\nnoted long ago, but it looked like it was shrinking fast. He looked powerful,\nhis broad Guile shoulders and strong Guile chin no longer hidden under\nlayer upon layer of clothing. He smiled pleasantly, but though that face was\nGavin’s face, just older, the smile wasn’t the same. There was some warmth\nlacking there. Gavin would grin recklessly, knowing he was getting away\nwith things because he was handsome and powerful, but you always got the\nsense that he was amused by it all.

You got the sense that underneath it,\nGavin really liked people. Andross Guile saw through you, to his objective.\n“When they told me you were back,” Andross said, “they didn’t tell me\nhow little of you had returned.” He smirked. Of course he’d seen Kip at the\nmeeting of the Spectrum. He must have meant his spies had told him Kip\nwas back before that.\n“I see I’m not the only one who’s lost something,” Kip said.\n“I meant that as a compliment.”\n“Me, too. You were a wight.”\n“Kip, a man only gets so many chances to start over in a life, or in a\nconversation. Don’t miss an important one.”\nBeast or not, it was good advice. Kip held his tongue.\nHey! Second time in my life!\n“Nine Kings?” Andross asked.\n“I’d be glad to, but I don’t have my decks.” Wait, had Andross just asked\nthat as a question? As if Kip could say no?\n“I’m short a couple myself,” Andross said. “But I’ve got plenty. You can\nborrow whichever you like.”\n“What are the stakes this time?” Kip asked. He was a little rusty on the\ngame, but if he had enough time to look through decks, he could at least\nstill tell a strong deck from a weak one.\n“So you didn’t steal it,” Andross said.\n“Huh?”\n“Someone broke into my apartments and stole a few valuables. They\nalso grabbed one of my favorite decks. It seemed like the kind of thing you\nmight do.”\nAnd he’d learned from Kip’s expression alone that Kip wasn’t the\nculprit.\nThey sat, and Andross put forward two pairs of decks. “I thought we\nmight try one of the old duels: the Twins, or Gods and Beasts.” They were\nclassic pairings. In such games, the decks had equal relative strengths,\nthough very different strategies. Each player was expected to have\nmemorized all the cards in each deck. Luck still played a part, but a player\nwith a sharp head for numbers could judge the probabilities that their\nopponent would draw a card to counter any particular strategy. It was the\nkind of game where Kip would get slaughtered, even though he knew most\nof the cards in each.\n“Gods and Beasts,” Kip said.\n“Interesting choice,” Andross said. And Kip saw that Andross thought\nKip was making a comment even in this. Of course, they had just faced\nboth gods and beasts.\nKip had chosen it because he thought it was more fun.\nNow I’m being overestimated.\nHe wasn’t sure if that was better, or worse.\n“Which deck do you want, grandson?” Andross asked.\nNow that Kip knew his grandfather thought Kip was making a point by\nwhich one he chose, he thought about it differently. “Odd that they’re on\nopposite sides, isn’t it? In my experience, the gods and beasts have fought\ntogether.”\n“Not odd at all,” Andross said. “What can oppose a god but a beast?”"

In my experience, the gods and beasts have fought\ntogether.”\n“Not odd at all,” Andross said. “What can oppose a god but a beast?”\n“Is that how you justify it?” Kip asked. No filter.\n“When soft men sit in peace and criticize my choices ages hence, that\nthey live to do so will be all the proof necessary that I did right,” Andross\nsaid. He picked up a deck. “A man who hesitates could never become a god,\nso you’ll be beasts.” He shuffled each deck as Kip watched, then dealt the\ncards. “No timers. I wish to have a leisurely match, and we’ve seen what\nmistakes you make under pressure.”\nKip didn’t touch his cards, didn’t turn around. “Tell Grinwoody not to\nstand behind me.”\nAndross laughed. “You make me wonder, Kip, if I posed such dilemmas\nfor my father Draccos. So smart sometimes, so clever, so adult, and then the\nnext minute an utter belligerent child, striking out and destroying things\nmore good for him than for anyone else, simply because he’s been vexed.”\nHe waved to Grinwoody, who moved away from his cheater’s perch over\nKip’s shoulder.\n“Who starts?” Kip asked. He picked up his hand.\n“I will. Privilege of age.”\nKip threw down his hand. “You dealt me eight.” It was one card too\nmany.\n“Did I? Age dulls us all, I suppose.” He grinned, and this time there was\nreal playfulness in it. So said the man who, just a few months ago, had\nlooked twenty years older than he did now.\nKip couldn’t help but grin. A little.\n“Wasn’t a good hand anyway, huh?” Andross asked. He picked up Kip’s\nhand and shuffled again quickly, then dealt him out seven.\n“Lousy,” Kip said.\nAndross laughed, and Kip remembered how the man had said that he\nliked Kip—a little. He realized then that Andross had been testing him,\nseeing if he’d cheat. Or perhaps Andross wouldn’t have thought of it as\ncheating. Maybe he would have thought of it as taking advantage of an\nopponent’s error. But it had been a bad hand, which was why Kip had\nthrown the whole hand down for a re-deal rather than extend the deck and\nhave Andross take out one card to bring him down to seven.\nThe promachos set the sun counter to predawn, and played his first card.\n“So, grandson,” Andross said. “The Chromeria finds itself about to enter a\nfight for its life, and most of them still don’t realize the fact. What do you\nsee that needs fixing?”\nKip cocked his head to the side. “Are you serious? You really want my\nideas?”\n“Is it so surprising?”\n“Yes, it is.”\n“There are many things you can learn from slaves and spies, and I have\nlearned them all. But some things can only be seen with one’s own eyes.\nMy eyes have been—”\n“Broken?” Kip couldn’t help but get in the little jab about Andross\nhiring that assassin from the Order, Mistress Helel.

        "text": "My eyes have been—”\n“Broken?” Kip couldn’t help but get in the little jab about Andross\nhiring that assassin from the Order, Mistress Helel. Kip saw Grinwoody\ntense, but Andross didn’t miss a beat.\n“Unavailable. I may have missed things.” But he was examining Kip\nsharply. “Boy, I am ferocious when crossed, I don’t deny it. I find being led\nby fools intolerable. But I am magnanimous in victory. I do what needs to\nbe done to win and without putting on a false display of sorrow or\nreluctance; you think that makes me hideous? Others pay homage to\ncommon pieties with their lips but betray them by their actions. I am simply\nmore forthright. Orholam needs even honest men, does he not?”\nHis eyes twinkled. That inversion, so typical of this family. Gavin would\nhint at irreligiosity and flirt with the line. Andross would breeze right past it,\nbut if his approach saved them all regardless, who was to say that Orholam\nwasn’t using him? Their ends were the same.\nHe was the promachos. Surely, if only to preserve his own power, he\nwould fight the Color Prince.\nSo Kip told him about the classes, how the magisters were lecturing on\ntopics that had nothing to do with the conflict at hand, that only the\nengineers seemed to grasp the problems. He also thought that they should\nhave a whole contingent of battle drafters, not only the Blackguard and a\nfew isolated drafters who learned the arts of war for their sponsors. He\nthought that they should open all the books of forbidden magics, and start\nteaching them—or at the least how to defend against them.\n“And who’s to teach all these new battle drafters?” Andross asked.\n“The Blackguard,” Kip said. “At least, those not directly involved with\nrecovering my father. If they’re not busy protecting the Prism and the\nColors, might as well put them to use until spring. They’ll complain, but\ntraining others is sometimes even better than being trained. And speaking of\nthe Blackguard, there’s a slave who scrubbed out. You should put him in\nwith my initiate cohort.”\n“What’s his story?”\n“Winsen was one of the best scrubs, but his master was a horror. He was\nalso deeply in debt, and he needed to sell Winsen into the Blackguard to\navoid being ruined. Winsen failed on purpose.”\n“And you wish to reward treachery?”\n“I think what made him a bad slave will make him a great Blackguard.\nAnd we need Blackguards.”\nThe game proceeded to noon on the sun counter—the time when the\nmost powerful cards could be easily played. Kip got a sea demon. As long\nas there were other cards on the table, the sea demon had to attack, but if\nonly you had another card on the table, the sea demon would attack your\nown card. Like all the best daggers, it was double-edged.\n“They say Gunner killed a sea demon,” Andross said.\n“I’ve heard that,” Kip said. “Do you think it’s true?”\n“I think it’s possible. Carcasses have floated to shore before, so the\nbeasts are not immortal.”\n“How was Gunner supposed to have done it?” Kip asked."

        "text": "“I think it’s possible. Carcasses have floated to shore before, so the\nbeasts are not immortal.”\n“How was Gunner supposed to have done it?” Kip asked.\n“They say he filled a raft full of the ship’s whole store of powder and\nfloated it behind the Aved Barayah five hundred paces. Something about\nthat little raft irritated the sea demon, I’ve never heard exactly what—\napparently this Gunner has a penchant for irritating those more powerful\nthan he. He waited until the sea demon surfaced and shot the raft with a\ncannonball just as the sea demon swallowed it. In heavy seas, if the tales be\nbelieved.”\nKip made a moue of appreciation.\nAndross said, “I’d wager it was more like two hundred paces.\nRegardless, impressive. Another version says he rode on the raft himself,\nsinging sea shanties and howling curses at some whore he’d loved, and lit\nthe fuse himself, jumping out of the way at the last moment. But sailors and\na straight-told tale have but passing acquaintance.”\n“I’d believe five hundred paces,” Kip said. “I’ve seen the man shoot.”\nAndross had a veritable army of wights on his side of the table. Plenty of\nfodder for Kip’s sea demon, so Kip played his heavy galleon to be able to\nsail past Andross’s defenses and attack him directly on the next round.\n“I want something of you, Kip,” Andross said.\n“Other than learning if I stole from you and crushing me in a few\ngames?”\n“Hard as it may be to believe, I want more than even your excellent\ncompany.” He said it flat, like he might have been mocking, or might have\nmeant the compliment.\nKip found himself grinning despite himself. This was the man who’d\ntried to have him killed, who’d tried to kill him, who had lost Gavin for all\nof them. And yet Kip grinned.\nAnd Andross grinned back. God or beast, the man appreciated when\nsomeone appreciated his sense of humor.\n“Well…” Kip prompted. He couldn’t take the suspense.\nAndross looked up from the cards. “I want to know where my other\ngrandson is.”\nA kick in the groin. “Other?” Kip asked. Had he hesitated too long?\nHis face must have blanched, because Andross grinned wolfishly. “I love\nsurprising people. It was really one of the greatest losses of my seclusion.\nSo much more satisfying when I can see your face.”\n“Let’s talk about that seclusion,” Kip said, suddenly ready to do combat.\nTo hell with this old man and his tricks. “Grinwoody, get away.” He didn’t\nturn to look at the slave. “Grinwoody, we both know I could have had you\nput out with forty lashes or worse when I spoke to the Spectrum, if I’d\nwanted to. I spared you. Get the hell out of here. Your betters are speaking.”\nA moment passed. Kip saw Andross nod his head.\nGrinwoody left, and Kip felt a little stab of pleasure.\nSo it begins. The opiate of power. Command and obedience, in a dance\nuntil you climb the greased pole high enough that all must obey you, and\nyou must obey none."

Command and obedience, in a dance\nuntil you climb the greased pole high enough that all must obey you, and\nyou must obey none.\n“Thinking deep thoughts?” Andross asked.\n“Am I so easy to read?” Kip asked.\n“In your unguarded moments. You are young yet, trapped in that twilight\nof having adult thoughts and insights quite beyond what others think you\nshould have, and being utterly, wildly out of control of your self. At your\nage, the emotions have a power greater than the intellect can tame. Slowly,\nslowly, they will become yours. Yours to master or at least to hide. If you\nsurvive so long.”\nKip looked at the cards, but he didn’t see them. “At moments, you sound\nso like my father that I despair.”\n“At moments, you sound so like him that I rejoice,” Andross said. “I\nhave hope for you, Kip. But there are hard lessons between where you now\nsit and feel, and where you shall stand and act. You must become master to\nthat within you, not its puppet. In the meantime, your mouth is a loose\ncannon, Kip the Lip.”\n“I know. I’m trying to—”\n“Shut up and listen. You react exactly the wrong way. You say startling\nthings, often rude things, but sometimes with stunning insight. Someday,\nyou will control that tongue. In the meantime, when you say something that\nshocks your interlocutor, instead of being embarrassed and turning your\neyes inward, pay attention! When you drop an explosive truth, don’t look at\nyourself. Package away your feeble blushes and your horror for later; in the\nmoment, watch what others do.”\nInstantly, Kip was embarrassed of his own feebleness and foolishness.\nExactly what Andross was speaking about. So he blurted, “Why are you\nacting like my friend?”\n“Not your friend,” Andross answered instantly. “Your grandfather, for all\nit costs us both.”\n“You fear me,” Kip said.\nThe astonishment on Andross’s face was priceless. Then he laughed. “I\nsee. You were trying it. No Kip. And yes. Not fear of you. Fear that you\nmay put this family in danger, though for the nonce, if you do something\nhorrific, everyone knows that you don’t act for me. As you grow older and\nmore refined, that perceived gap will close. So in order for you to be of use\nto me, you must grow faster than the conventional wisdom believes\npossible.”\nOh, no pressure then.\nBut Kip realized this was exactly what his father had been trying to\nprotect him from when he’d suggested Kip enter the Chromeria under an\nassumed name. And Kip had blindly wanted to be thrust directly into the\nmiddle of all of it. Had demanded it, long before he was ready.\n“What are your plans for me?” Kip asked.\n“You asked that before.”\n“You were a wight then.”\nAndross Guile paused. Looked at the cards. “Do you think, grandson,\nthat all my rage was born of red luxin?” He affixed Kip with his many-\ncolored eyes: a background of shocking natural blue making a canvas for\nsub-red, red, orange, and yellow entwined like serpents."

He swallowed. “We trade.\nLike adults.”\n“Playing an adult while playing an adult while playing an adult, fair\nenough,” Andross said. He played a Flawless Mirror.\nIt didn’t make any sense. His deck had no Prisms, for one, and if he\nwanted to play a burning ray, it would take two turns. He’d be dead by then,\nkilled by Kip’s heavy galleon.\nWas he deliberately giving Kip a victory in the game so Kip would feel\ngood about something after this talk?\nKip said, “I’ll tell you about your other grandson… if you give me\nwritten permission to all the libraries in the Chromeria. All of them.”\nAndross raised his eyebrows. “There are things in some of those\nlibraries that could put the whole Chromeria at risk.”\n“All the more reason that those who defend her should know them.”\n“A full accounting of your half brother,” Andross said. “All you know.”\n“Done,” Kip said.\n“Not done. That’s your opening bid. Here’s my counter. I told you how I\nlike surprises. I want to buy one from you.”\n“What’s that?” Kip asked. This didn’t sound good.\n“Don’t tell Karris about Zymun.”\nWhat, as if Kip wanted to tell Karris about Zymun? ‘Hi, stepmother, I\nmet your real son. The one you’ve apparently been trying to hide? The\nbastard? Oh, and he’s the worst person I’ve ever met. He tried to kill me.\nOh, he also tried to murder your husband, his father.’\n“Done,” Kip said quickly. “If.”\nAndross didn’t ask, ‘If what?’ Instead, he said, “Of course, if you tell\nsomeone else who may tell her, that’s an abrogation of our agreement.”\nI’m a turtle-bear, not a weasel. “Of course,” Kip said irritably.\n“And the if?” Andross asked.\n“You’re going to send out Blackguard on skimmers, looking for my\nfather.”\n“Sea chariots,” Andross corrected. “Yes, of course.”\nSomething about his tone told Kip it was half a lie. Andross hadn’t been\nplanning on sending the Blackguards out—or if he had, he’d been planning\nto send them to look for something else. But now, called on it, he would\nsend them. So that was a victory, Kip guessed. “I get to go with them.”\n“You’ve too much to learn here. It’s what your father would have\ndemanded for you.”\n“I won’t be moved on this. If I have to, I’ll make my own skimmer and\nsearch for him by myself.”\nAndross pursed his lips. Kip was testing his patience. “You may go\nonce. On the time of my choosing.”\n“And you swear they’ll be looking for him?”\nPique flashed through Andross Guile’s eyes. Kip had caught him. He’d\nalready said he would do it, so holding back would expose the lie.\n“Done. I so swear,” Andross Guile said."

I so swear,” Andross Guile said.\n“And done,” Kip said.\n“Now, tell me what you know, and let me see how good of a deal I’ve\nmade blind.”\n“Zymun was alive, last I saw him,” Kip said. “He captured me, after the\nBattle of Ru, after Gunner threw me back into the sea. Zymun found me on\nthe beach and took me prisoner. He was fighting for the Color Prince, you\nknow.”\n“I do. I’ll claim I sent him to spy, if it suits me.”\nKip already felt like he’d got the worse end of things. What if he didn’t\nfind anything in the libraries?\nHe told his grandfather the whole story of his capture and his time on\nthe boat with Zymun. “And he’s a serpent. There is no human kindness in\nhim. He mimics feelings as if he had them, but he is nothing inside. He is\nthinner than parchment, and more evil than—”\n“Than?” Andross asked.\n“Than an old spider bloated with poison,” Kip said flatly, as if it might\nor might not apply to Andross himself.\nAndross gave him, surprisingly, no reaction to that at all. Turning to the\ngame, he set his cards attacking—all of them, abandoning any hope of\ndefense. Kip moved his hand to his counters, hesitated.\n“No,” Andross said. “They attack each other.” And so, instead of\nattacking Kip to bring his life down to one counter, Andross’s six wights\ntore each other to shreds.\n“Oh hell,” Kip said.\n“Your turn.”\nKip’s sea demon attacked first, and lacking any opponents, had to attack\nKip’s heavy galleon. It sank it easily. Kip looked at his cards. He had\nnothing. But that didn’t mean it was over. The card that Andross needed\nwas Burning Focus to equip to the Flawless Mirror. That card was in the\ndeck, and Andross was playing like he had it, but that didn’t mean he did.\n“Do you want to resign?” Andross said.\n“Never.” Kip had just drawn Amun-Tep, but with the sun waning, it\nwould take him two turns to draw the power needed to play the character.\nDamn! He played a hulking duelist in mirror armor instead: Grath Hrozak.\nFrom his studies, Kip knew the real man had murdered hundreds personally,\nnot counting the deaths he’d ordered. He’d served the Tyrean Empire, long\nbefore Lucidonius. He’d been yanked in and out of command because he\nwas so brutal. He’d never taken a city but that he’d killed most everyone in\nit through crucifixion or flaying or both.\nIt was Andross’s turn. He looked at the cards and sighed. “Take this\nlesson to heart, grandson.” He played Burning Focus, equipped it to the\nFlawless Mirror. With the sun counters still just off noon, it gave him\nenough damage to go through Grath Hrozak, absorb what little damage was\nreflected by the mirror armor, and kill Kip."

That sometimes even a beast like Grath Hrozak\ncan’t save you? That I should never play the mighty Andross Guile in Nine\nKings?”\n“I’ll bring your brother here, as soon as I can recover him.

He remembered Janus Borig saying, ‘I keep trying to\ndraw you as the next Prism, and I can’t. You won’t be the Prism, Kip.’ He\nlifted his chin, sneered. “So, that’s what this is? You expect me to curry\nyour favor now? You think adding a lump of sugar to the whip is going to\nchange everything? You’ve tried to kill me before.”\n“Yes, yes, we’ve talked about that little misunderstanding—”\n“—and failed. Don’t forget that, old man.”\nAndross Guile’s lips were a tight white line. A dangerous silence\nfollowed. “This warning was a courtesy. I gave it in part because of that\nmisunderstanding. I’m not looking for a puppet or a sniveling lackey, Kip.\nFor the most part, I was deeply satisfied with your father’s leadership. A\nweak man a poor Prism makes. To proffer me your respect is no sign of\nservility, grandson, it’s a sign of wisdom.” Andross Guile walked to his\ndesk, scribbled a note, and handed it to Kip. “Make yourself strong, Kip.\nYou have little time. You’re dismissed. Give that to Grinwoody on your\nway out.”\n“How do I convince you that I should be the next Prism?” Kip asked.\nNot that he cared. Not that he was afraid.\n“I’ll give you a task after you return my stolen cards—”\n“I thought you believed me that I didn’t—” Kip stopped as he saw the\nugly look that passed across Andross Guile’s face at being interrupted.\n“Sorry.”\n“I believe you didn’t steal them. Probably the thief was my dear son.\nUnless you’re a better liar than I think. Regardless, I want them back—and\nI want the new cards. Make it your mission. You have until Sun Day.\nNaming a Prism-elect will wait no longer. If you don’t give me the cards—\nall of them—it won’t be you.”\n“You really have given up on my father.”\n“A great strategist once said every military disaster could be summed up\nin two words: ‘Too late.’ When a plan fails, you don’t wring your hands,\nyou move to the next one.”\nMy father was merely a plan that failed?"

Instead, he thought: That’s your\nson. That’s your son, and that’s all you can say? Was it so simple and cold\nfor his grandfather, or was there a heart, somewhere deep inside him,\nhidden, broken?\nInstead of speaking it now, he asked, “What was the lesson? From the\ngame, I mean.”\n“Was there a lesson, or were there many?” Andross asked, as if to\nhimself. “Here’s one: you back a man into a corner and show him no way\nout? When a man is utterly in your power but not yet dead? That’s when\nyou watch him closest.” Andross tugged several cards out of his sleeves and\ntossed them onto the table.\nThey were all the best cards in his deck. “Now get out…” He turned his\nback before he finished the sentence. “… grandson. Send in that Malargos\ngirl. Tisis? I’m going to see just how badly she wants to be the next White.\nIf I don’t miss my guess she’ll be dressed to please.”\nChapter 37\nKip wasted little time going to the restricted library. His only stop on his\nway was to get his bag and blank papers, and to grab those of the squad\nwho were in the barracks. The nunks had enforced study times, two hours a\nday. Each squad was generally required to be in the same place, though\nCruxer could sign off for them if they had some excuse, which it seemed\nTeia often did.\nBut the rules never specified where the squad had to study, and if Kip\nwas going to steal any hours from the day, those were about the only ones\npossible, unless he wanted to give up a meal.\nUnthinkable.\nBesides, the note was broadly worded: “Kip is about my business in the\nlibraries. Don’t impede him.—Promachos Guile.” Kip was just sorry that it\nhad mentioned ‘in the libraries.’ If it hadn’t, it would have been a writ to do\nwhatever he wanted.\nHe gathered up the squad, though Teia was gone again. They were all\neager for the prospect of seeing an area that was forbidden. Nor were they\ndisappointed when they sailed past the librarian guarding the door. The man\ntook one look at the note, paled, and let Kip and the squad in without a\nword.\nThis forbidden library took up almost half a floor of the blue tower. It\nwas all gleaming hardwoods and burnished copper and arm chairs.\nLuxurious desks with comfortable chairs, and slaves to attend to every need\n—each had a copper necklace with two black stones pendent, carved with a\nParian rune Kip didn’t recognize. He asked about them.\n“They’re all illiterate and mute,” Ben-hahad said under his voice. “So\nthey can’t spy on what you’re reading.”\n“Oh, I’ve heard about that,” Ferkudi said loudly, excited. “Some slaves\nhave their tongues cut out specifically so they can serve. Now that must be\na real flesh protuberance.”\n“They’re not deaf, Ferk,” Ben-hadad muttered."

Now that must be\na real flesh protuberance.”\n“They’re not deaf, Ferk,” Ben-hadad muttered.\n“Oh, sorry,” Ferkudi said, lowering his voice. “Wait, why am I\napologizing to slaves?”\nHe glowered at a slave, and when the others weren’t looking, Kip saw\nthe slave waggle a stub of a tongue at Ferkudi, who flinched. The next\nmoment, when the others turned to see why Ferkudi had shrunk back, the\nslave was standing placidly, as if he’d never moved.\nFerkudi was cursing under his breath, but he made no move at\nretaliation.\nBen-hadad went over to a stack of books and looked at the titles. It took\nhim a while, but no one intervened. Ben-hadad would accept help when he\nneeded to absorb a lot of text, but could get angry otherwise. He said, “This\nplace looks like the High Luxiats have used it as their own private lounge.\nThese books aren’t forbidden. I think the venerable magisters simply don’t\nlike sitting on the same hard benches the rest of us do.”\n“Does that slave have wine?” Daelos asked. “You think I could…”\n“No,” Ben-hahad, Kip, Cruxer, and Big Leo said.\nOther than four slaves and the luxiat who was watching the door, this\nrestricted library was empty. The squad drew together a couple of the desks,\nmoving furniture with the impunity of the young, or of Blackguards, or of\nthe friends of a young lord with a special writ from his grandfather. It felt\ngreat, but Kip clutched the writ close, certain someone was going to yell at\nthem at any moment.\nThey’d settled down to study quickly, though. Cruxer wouldn’t stand for\nless. Only Kip was released to browse the shelves. He grabbed books\nblindly, bound leather inscribed with faded runes and filled with delicate\nscript that at first he didn’t realize was in a language he could read. An\naccount of some village he’d never heard of, filled with vocabulary that had\nto be of foreign origin. Another scroll that seemed to be about farming\nmethods. Another entirely in Old Parian. Another in some language Kip had\nnever laid eyes on. Another in runes.\nAn account of the pygmies—not of Blood Forest, nor of the archaic\nBlood Plains, but of Tyrea. Tyrea? Sounded fascinating, though the dates\nlisted were some abbreviation that Kip hadn’t seen, so he had no idea how\nlong ago this had been written—and it was written about a time several\nhundred years before it?\nHe had no idea how this part of the library was organized, and picking\nup scrolls randomly was never going to help him find something useful. Kip\nheaded to the front to find the guardian librarian standing out in the hall. As\nhe got close, he heard urgent whispers. “No!” someone said. Using the\nshelves to hide his approach, Kip crept closer until he saw the original\nlibrarian, speaking to some younger luxiats, “—and report to the High\nLuxiat that he can’t send any more… I can let him know when these spies\nare gone, but—”"

Can’t the slaves—”\nKip stepped forward and saw four young luxiats-to-be flinch guiltily.\nEach was carrying a stack of scrolls or books. “What’s going on here?” Kip\nasked.\nThey all looked at the older luxiat, and Kip knew he was going to hear\nlies. “Simply routine work, scrolls in need of mending being returned.” He\nturned to the young luxiats-in-training. “Thank you, you may deposit those\nand go.”\n“But before you go,” Kip said. “You’re to tell me your names.”\nThey looked again at the librarian.\nKip sighed, putting on a pretty good pretense of exasperation. “Who is\nthe Highest Luxiat?” he asked. He didn’t wait for the man to say, the Prism.\n“That’s my father. And who is in charge of all the Chromeria during his\nabsence? The promachos. That’s my grandfather. Who has told you to aid\nme as I go about his work. Do you think he sees not what you do?”\nThe librarian blanched. “Tell him your names,” he said.\nThey did, and Kip said, “Good, now I want each of you to go looking\nfor a luxiat named Quentin Naheed. You are to demand that he attend me\nhere, immediately. It’s an order from the promachos’s own hand.\nUnderstood?”\nThey scattered. It left Kip with a very uncomfortable librarian. Kip just\nstared at the man, trying to put some Andross Guile into his expression. The\nlibrarian looked away, and Kip broke out into a big grin. It worked!\nHe tried to recapture the fierceness, but even as the minutes passed, he\ncould only get as close as dour.\n“Hey, Kip! You feeling well? You look constipated,” Quentin Naheed\nsaid, coming into the library.\nKip winced.\n“How’d you find—Oh, greetings, Brother Anir.”\nThe librarian scowled and moved to speak. “Brother Anir,” Kip said,\n“you’re dismissed back to your post.”\nThe man went, and Quentin looked at Kip, surprised that he had power\nover a luxiat.\n“I need your help,” Kip said. “Not just today.” Kip showed him the writ.\n“I would have helped without that,” Quentin said. “I was thinking about\nbefore, and… you’re right, I did lie to you, and that’s beneath a luxiat of\nOrholam. It shall not happen again, not ever. This I swear in the light and by\nmy hope of eternity. You will have the truth of me, no matter the cost.”\nKip raised an eyebrow. What a strange young man. But Quentin was\ndeadly serious. Kip supposed that those who became luxiats had to be a bit\npeculiar by definition, though.\n“Very well,” Kip said, feeling like he should react with some sort of\nsufficiently sober pronouncement, but he had nothing. “These texts here.\nWhat are they?”"

Is that what\nyou’re looking for?” Quentin asked, puzzled.\n“No, no. Some younger luxiats-to-be were tasked with bringing those\nbooks here, and I want to know why. Brother Anir said they’d been\nrepaired? Is that true?”\nQuentin went through the books and scrolls and scowled. “I am loath to\naccuse anyone of falsehood, but… the condition of these books is not\nconsistent with books coming up from the binderies. Mistress Takama\nwould never let this work pass. Some of these haven’t been repaired in\ndecades. Nor do all of the books need repair, so this is not consistent with\neither going to or coming from the binderies.”\n“Then what are they?” Kip asked.\n“I don’t know.”\nBut there was something in how he stressed that. “Are you going to be\nhonest, or only technically honest?” Kip asked.\nQuentin hesitated. “You’re right. I… I’ll have to pray about how\nreflexively I cover the truth where my peers are concerned. I should have\nsaid, ‘I don’t know, but I can speculate.’ And as I’m sure you’ll next ask\nwhat said speculation would be…” He blew out a breath. “These are books\nfrom the other restricted libraries.”\n“So?” Kip asked.\nThe rest of the squad had come over. Kip introduced them, and Quentin\nseemed to get more and more shy, but after introductions, Kip pressed him\nagain. “So?”\n“So there are different permissions needed for the various libraries: you\nmay get access to some libraries but not to others. This library is restricted\nat the highest level. I’ve actually never been here.”\n“Oh, sneaky,” Ben-hadad said, shaking his head, understanding.\n“What?” Ferkudi asked.\n“I hate to say it, but I’m with Ferkudi on this,” Cruxer said.\n“Promachos Guile opened almost all the restricted libraries so that the\nforbidden magics could be studied—for defensive purposes only,” Ben-\nhadad said.\n“The Magisterium was not pleased,” Quentin said.\n“So the luxiats have been moving books out of the newly opened\nlibraries into the libraries that are still closed,” Ben-hadad said.\n“It’s not technically disobedience,” Quentin said. “I mean, the\npromachos’s order was that the libraries be opened, not that all the books in\nthose libraries should be open for study.”\n“That’s basically bullshit,” Kip said.\n“Yes,” Quentin admitted. “You have to understand, though, it’s been a\nhard season for the luxiats. Half a dozen of the most respected scholars\namong us were made laughingstocks when it was discovered that the bane\nactually exist. Having the privilege of being the only ones allowed to study\nthese forbidden materials stripped from us has been hard—and made harder\nwhen sometimes common drafters and Blackguards with no training have\nmade discoveries we missed for many years. It’s been a gushing well of\nhumiliation.”"

He grinned a big friendly grin and threw a meaty arm around\nQuentin’s slim shoulders.\nQuentin smiled uncertainly.\nChapter 38\nFor a city where light never dies, Big Jasper had a lot of dark places. And\nthe Order seemed to know them all.\nCity and sky seemed to have conspired to bring darkness. Teia hunched\nher shoulders, determined not to be frightened. The moon had been\nstrangled by dark clouds whose fingers thickened as they flexed and that\ncelestial mirror expired. Fog billowed in off the water, hit the walls like an\narmy in a suicide charge, and rolled right over them. For a few moments,\nTeia could see the fog massed above the walls, and then it came crashing\ndown into the streets.\nAs it swamped her, blotting out sight, she heard a scream in a nearby\nstreet. No, not a scream. Just a cat, yowling in fury. Then it stopped.\nThe cobbles of the street were slickened with the damp. Teia saw a star\nbobbing along above her, and it took her imagination moments to calm and\nrealize it was nothing more than a watchman’s lantern. He passed directly\nabove her on the wall, and he never even saw her. Teia brushed one hand\nalong the wall, telling herself it wasn’t for reassurance.\nYou’re going to your death, the lantern seemed to whisper as it floated\naway into the distance. Find light!\nI’m a slave, not a—\nShe stopped the thought. She wasn’t a slave. She could leave at any\ntime. She had money in her pocket. She had money in the barracks. She\ncould buy a commission and go home. She could go and… what?\nBut she could figure it out. She’d have time. She’d have her family.\nShe’d—\nFear makes you stupid. Look at what I’ve got here. Look at what I’ve\ndone. Who back home would believe that I’d even spoken to the White,\nmuch less been given an assignment vital to all of the Seven Satrapies by\nher? Who would believe that I trained with Commander Ironfist, much less\nled him in an assault on the fortress of Ruic Head? Hell, with my color, who\nwill even believe I’m a drafter?\nOut in the wide world, what use is paryl? I can kill people secretly? Oh,\nlovely. Get lots of chances to use that in polite society. I can see through\nclothing? Oh, perfect, please tell me how well endowed Lord Fuddykins is!\nHa.\nYou’re not a slave anymore, Teia. So who are you going to be?\nThe Order isn’t going to kill me. If they’d wanted to do that, they would\nhave already done it. Right? But what if they changed their minds? If they\nwanted to kill her in the future, it wouldn’t be that hard for them to find her,"

Or her family.\nTeia had to lean against the wall for a moment as her throat constricted.\nThe darkness and fog were oppressive, heavy, clinging to her, making it\nhard to breathe, diving into her throat, invading her body. Her eyes widened\nand widened and she felt the tingle of paryl entering her.\nDrafted it when I was scared. That’s progress, right?\nA lantern of the stuff bloomed on her fist and pierced the darkness in\nevery direction. It cut through the haze as if it weren’t even there and lent\nan odd metallic quality to the stones and the cobbles. She thought she heard\nsomething, and she looked behind her. Nothing.\nWhen she turned around again, a hooded, cloaked man stood in front of\nher. Murder Sharp. He looked pleased with himself, or perhaps pleased to\nsee her. “Good color there. Tight spectrum, almost no bleed. You’ve got a\nknack. With paryls, we have to take what we get. Walk with me.”\n“You look different,” Teia said. The last time she’d seen him, he’d had a\nfringe of orange hair around a bald scalp. Apparently it had been a ruse,\nbecause he wasn’t bald. Now his hair had grown out, though it was still\ncropped short. It made him look quite a bit younger. He was growing out a\nbeard, the scruff nicely delineated.\n“I have the curse of being readily identifiable. I have to work harder for\nmy disguises. I envy your bland prettiness.”\n“Thanks?”\n“It was a compliment. Do you have any idea how valuable it is to have a\ndescription of you be ‘slender, medium to dark skin, medium height, maybe\na little on the short side, dark hair, fairly pretty’? Any distinguishing marks\npeople will remember can be removable ones, like a beauty mark, or a wig\n—and with your skin tone, you can as easily seem to be a natural when\nwearing a wig of wavy dark blonde hair or black Parian curls. Being\nremembered or being forgotten is life and death in my work, so yes, I envy\nyou. Here we are.”\nHe knocked an odd, syncopated beat on the door.\nGreat, I’m going to have to become a drummer on top of everything\nelse.\nThe door opened, and with the light pouring out into the street, Teia\nconstricted her eyes and let the paryl go.\nWhoever had opened the door retreated back through another room\nbeyond the entry. Murder Sharp handed her a white robe to put over her\nclothes. “Don’t identify yourself in any way. The others will be put in\ndanger the more they know. Hearing your voice will be bad enough.” He\ngave her dark spectacles, too, and a white cloth veil. He dressed himself\nsimilarly, except he donned a mask with real white fur and yellow teeth,\nsome snarling creature that looked like a cross between a weasel and a bear.\nThen he led her into the next room.\nThe building was a smithy. Lanterns provided cheery light and invaded\nthe darkness outside. There were a dozen figures inside, chatting quietly."

There were a dozen figures inside, chatting quietly.\nBut all were cloaked and veiled. Only a few wore the weasel-bear masks.\nThe veils were simple flaps of white cloth, hanging from each person’s hat,\nleaving only their eyes revealed. Some of the veiled figures wore dark\nspectacles. Those must be drafters, making sure that no one would be able\nto recognize them by the luxin patterns in their eyes.\nOf course, the disguises meant nothing to a paryl drafter. If Teia tried,\nshe could see through their clothes, through their masks, through their\nsilliness. She went from terrified to on the verge of derisive laughter in a\nsecond.\nFine, so maybe it was hysterical laughter she was on the verge of. Easy\nthere, Teia. She followed Master Sharp into the smithy and looked from one\nfigure to another in the red light of the forge fire.\n“Order,” a man with a gruff voice said.\nOrder, as in come to order? or like, Hey, you all from the Order, come to\norder? Teia almost laughed again. Whoa, hold it together, T.\nShe tried to clear her throat, failed, and didn’t dare try clear it again for\nfear of disturbing the newborn silence.\nThough he was short, the others clearly deferred to the gruff one—and\nhe was the only one who had two veils on. The one he wore under the white\ncloth veil appeared to be made of some kind of finely woven metal mail.\n“If the Chromeria or its people find you here, or hear of it henceforth,\nyou will be taken by the Office of Doctrine. You will be tortured. Your lands\nand titles will be seized. Your families will be punished. Your animals and\nhouses will be burned, as if heresy could be purged with fire.” He paused.\n“If you have not the courage to die in silence, go now, and be part of this\ncompany no more. The door stands there.”\nThe idea of being tortured by the very people she was serving was ice in\nTeia’s stomach. Would the White claim her, if she were captured?\nOnly if it served her ends. And in such a war, claiming Teia might not be\nthe White’s best move. Every threat Teia heard was real. And that was if she\nwere found by her friends. How much worse would it be if she were\ndiscovered by the Order? She looked at the door, and wondered if they\nmeant it. Could she leave now?\n“We’ve no cowards among us,” the man said. “Good.”\nTeia wanted to shout, Wait! I think I might be a coward! Can I think on\nit a bit longer?\nBut it was too late.\nThe members made a circle around the room, broken only on the side\nwhere the forge burned hot. Odd, at night. In the center stood a simple table.\nTeia felt a chill as she recognized the items piled there. They were all the\nthings she had stolen for Aglaia Crassos—perfect blackmail materials to\nexpose and ruin her, had she not already confessed all of it to the White.\n“Hear the sermon of the first circle.”"

But\nout of the conflagration, out of the hundreds of thousands dead, some good\ncame. Those of us who sided with Dazen Guile saw our hopes die when\nGavin Guile came stumbling out of the smoke at Sundered Rock. The wiser\nof us ran. Most hid. But some were pursued by the vengeful, by murderers\nseeking to use the cover of war to hide their crimes, by assassins sent to\nsilence us for what we knew.”\nHe stopped, and said nothing for a long time, as if reliving a memory.\nNone of the others interjected, so Teia didn’t move either.\n“In our flight, many were lost. Good men, women who’d committed no\ncrime but to lose. Others were dragged off into slavery, sold to the Ilytians\nin a trade the Chromeria condemned but did nothing to stop.”\n“Hear, ye deceived.”\n“But.” He raised a finger. “In every darkness, there is hope for light. For\nlight cannot be chained.”\n“Light cannot be chained,” they intoned with him.\n“A small group of us fled into the Atashian desert, across the Cracked\nLands, pursued for more than a month into the wastes, until our pursuers\ngave up and we found ourselves without enough water to make the trip back\nhome. So we pressed on. We found the Great Rift the day after we’d drank\nthe last of our water. We climbed down it, losing two more brothers in the\nhike. And at the bottom, we found an ancient, abandoned city, carved into\nthe faces of the cliffs themselves. We found great cisterns of water, renewed\nby a small stream, and we found wild goats to eat, and we found luxin the\nlikes of which we couldn’t believe, but most precious of all, we found\ntruth.”\n“Hear, ye deceived.”\n“We were not the first wanderers to find this place. This was Braxos. A\ncity thousands of years old. The pygmies of the darkest Blood Forest claim\na common ancestry with the Braxians.

They stayed two years, tried to go home back to the\nChromeria, and gave up and returned, certain the Cracked Lands were\nimpassable. They stayed for the rest of their lives, had children. The\ncommunity lasted three generations before it succumbed to the inbreeding\nthat left them too feeble to survive those harsh lands.\n“But what they did in those generations!

For the first\ntime, we heard about the time before Lucidonius.” He looked at Teia, as if\nsearching her soul. “It is time for you to hear the truth, and to decide.”\n“Hear the truth, ye deceived.”\n“The Braxians always lived a tenuous existence there, though the lands\nthen were not yet the Cracked Lands. It was, still, a desert, and life was\nhard. In those times, it was believed that each color was a god or goddess,\nand men clung to one or another. Drafters could never serve two colors\nbecause each was at war with each, or at best antipathic. Drafters flowed to\nthose parts of the world where their color could be found, and in so doing,\nmade the differences more profound. The fertile plains of Ruthgar gave\nplentiful green, so the world’s greens left their own peoples and moved\nthere, and the greens built their temple there, and fertilized the plains year\nafter year, making them greener still. The Red Cliffs of Atash, likewise; the\nvolcanoes of deep Tyrea, likewise. And so on.\n“The Braxians had a different belief. To them, magic wasn’t primarily\nabout light; light was a trigger, the conduit for allowing your will to flow\ninto the world, and into your community. Nor did they believe—as the\nChromeria later would—that Will is finite. They didn’t think they were\nusing up their souls to make golems. They believed that Will is a muscle,\nand it is strengthened with every use, not depleted like sands from an\nhourglass.\n“As gods rose and fell, all the nine kingdoms groaned under the weight\nof their struggles. When the reds gathered under Dagnu the Thirteenth’s\nbanner and went to war and wiped out the blues to the last child, they threw\noff the balance. For a generation, with no blues drafting, red ran amok,\ndeserts spread, the lands cracked, the seas choked. Droughts spread\neverywhere, and the Braxians among them all were most vulnerable. Their\nbrother tribes in the desert perished. It was no better when the blues had\ntheir revenge, two generations later: the waters rose and flooded the floors\nof the canyons. So much water it flushed the good soil away. The Braxians\ndecided they must come up with some power that would give them a say in\nevents in a world that ignored them, and crushed them in their wars, all\nunknowing. For our part, may—”\n“—we listen and believe,” the figures joined in with him.\nTeia got the sense that the exact words of the stories varied, but there\nwere trigger phrases for their responses. It made the flesh on her neck crawl.\n“This was the birth of the Order. First, there was only one: Ora’lem, the\nHidden, the first Shadow. He wore a cloak which had been infused with the\nentire will of a polychromatic lightsplitter, a woman who had the talent that\nthe Chromeria deceitfully swears is only known to Prisms.

After his death, his cloak was recovered only with great\ndifficulty, and the Order decided that Shadows should always work in a\nteam of man and woman, for there are places shut to men and places shut to\nwomen, and the strengths of each should cover the weaknesses of the other.\nOver the generations, the Order amassed fourteen cloaks, some finer than\nothers. Two, now lost, which had been owned by the mist walkers of old,\nworked in all spectra.\n“Those fourteen warriors, the first Shadows, moved unseen among all\npeoples of the world. Fourteen righteous blades that brought justice.\nFourteen mist walkers protected the people of Braxos, and the vulnerable\neverywhere.

The very word\nthat the Braxians wished the reds to calm their use of magic meant the reds\ndid, controlling their own priests, without need for death. There was peace,\nand magic flourished. When others couldn’t help and wights were\nterrorizing an area, it was the Shimmercloaks who intervened.

Pitchblende and lead for red, theion and calcium for\nyellow, cadmium and brimstone for orange, orpiment and iron for green,\ncobalt and theion for blue. These were to be our secrets, and our new power.\nNo longer would we have only to rely on the seven teams, on trying to find\nnew polychromatic light-splitters to make new shimmercloaks when the old\nones were stolen or destroyed. Then came a young man. Diakoptês, his\nname was.”\n“Diakoptês, the Betrayer!”\n“Diakoptês the Shadow had killed for us in every one of the nine\nkingdoms.

There is in them no mercy for those born to low circumstances,\nto only bad choices, as if the daughter of nobility and the daughter of\nignominy have the same chances at a life of virtue. The Braxians were\nkinder, more humane. We know that…”\nThey intoned, “In death is the cleansing of sins. In rebirth is the hope for\nsalvation.”\n“He called himself the Second Eye of Orholam. And so it was that the\nOrder to Break the Eye was born. So it was we slew our favorite son\nDiakoptês. Not in hatred, but in hope. Hope for his rebirth. Hope for\nsalvation.”\nTogether, they said, “We wait with hope and expectation. Breakers\nunbroken, our Long Vigil continues.”\n“Thus ends the sermon of the first circle. May we all be worthy to learn\nmore.”\nThey chanted something in a language that Teia didn’t understand. Nor,\nit was clear, did some of them, from how they lagged behind the others with\nthe unfamiliar syllables. Then, it seemed, they chanted a loose translation,\nnot quite so rhythmic: “True in darkness. True in light. True in daytime.\nTrue at night. Honest, fierce, loyal, strong, but hidden till we right the\nwrong.”\nThe gruff leader came close, and lowered his voice enough that the\nothers would likely only hear pieces of it over the whoosh of the bellows\none of them was working. “You know what these are.” He picked up a\nsilver bracelet, set it down."

The highest you can rise is to be a Blackguard. It\nis a good position, for a former slave. Usually. Less good in wartime.\nEveryone knows that the Blackguards’ standards have slipped in order to\nreplenish the ranks. You will be thrown at problems that the peacetime\nBlackguard would never accept. You will die for the White, perhaps, though\nthis one is almost dead. She won’t last two more years. And who will\nreplace her? Someone you can love and respect? Will you be happy to give\nyour life for the Red? Is that the life you want? A slave exalted, but a slave\nstill. Is that the best you can do?”\nHe nodded to two of the masked figures and backed away.\nLouder now, he said, “We want you, initiate, but we won’t blackmail\nyou into service. The Order isn’t looking for slaves. You can be a soldier to\nbe used as cannon fodder for them, or for us you can be more. We’re\nlooking for Shadows. We’re looking to give you a chance to make a\ndifference. To change the course of all history. To pick up the pittance this\nworld has given you and demand more, and in turn give more. There will be\nno work as hard as what we offer, but together we can remake the world.”\nThe figures stepped forward and set the silver items in a pitted bowl at\nthe end of a paddle. They lifted it into the fire, and Teia watched as the\nsilver wobbled, lost form, and melted, ready to be remade.\nChapter 39\n“I want you to stab me,” Gavin said. He and the Malargos boy Antonius\nwere standing on deck in the early morning light.\n“Your pardon?”\n“I’ve been stabbed by it before. Maybe twice.”\n“Where?” Antonius asked.\n“Off Garriston and off Ru. See? It’s even been on boats both times.”\n“I meant on your body.”\n“Oh, in the back, here, and straight through my chest, here.” They were\nstill short on clothing, so like the rest of the former slaves, Gavin went\nshirtless. It had scandalized the young lord, who had offered his own\ngarments, but Gavin couldn’t accept them, for reasons he couldn’t have\nsaid. Regardless, it meant that when he gestured to where he’d been\nattacked, he was gesturing to skin.\nAntonius leaned close. “No scars. No scars?”\n“I think that’s part of the magic. Well, it has to be.”\nAntonius hefted the sword and stabbed it down on the deck. Its point\nsank deeply into the polished, fire-hardened wood. He looked at Gavin\nskeptically.\n“I think it’s different, for me,” Gavin said.\nHe’d been doing a lot of thinking in the last day of freedom.

        "text": "He’d been doing a lot of thinking in the last day of freedom. First he’d\nthought of Karris, Karris, who had been so painful to think about when he\nwas in the hell belowdecks. He could see her smile, the arch of her neck,\nher hair—blonde, now—and her tears of joy as they embraced once more.\nHe could feel her fingers touching his face while he slept, assuring herself\nhe was real. He could imagine nipping her fingers to startle her, and\nlaughing together. He imagined her slim legs around his hips, her warm\nembraces—but then that, too, still hurt. His body had been hollowed out\nlike a bowl for sorrows, and imagining pleasure filling it again was torture.\nHe tried to imagine what she would say when she saw his eyes, instead. She\nhad married a Prism. She had accepted the costs of being married to the\nmost powerful man in the world, but she’d accepted the rewards, too.\nHe was that man no more. What he had promised was not what he was\ngoing to give her. What would she say to this withered husk?\nI am not now that which once I was. What work of noble note might yet\nbe done, by me? By this cripple?\nThat, too, was too cruel to countenance. So he’d thought about the\nmusket-sword. It was the black in it that captivated him. It looked like\nobsidian. But no one could work obsidian into such delicate spirals; the\nstuff wasn’t malleable. Obsidian fractured with hard, sharp edges. During\nthe war, those who could afford obsidian had edged their arrowheads with\nthe stuff, as it cut through luxin better than steel did. But few could afford\nit. That it interfered with drafting was known, though. Hellstone, drafters\ncalled it, thinking it darkness personified, a negation of light, and thereby a\ntool of the enemy.\nGavin had his—the real Gavin’s—men collect all the weapons lined\nwith hellstone and any gems or decorative pieces, put them in a few crates,\nand had them ‘lost’ when they got back to Big Jasper. It was war, albeit the\nend of the war, and things go missing. He’d used that treasure to line the\ntunnels of Gavin’s prison beneath the Chromeria. He was very familiar with\nobsidian.\nAnd this didn’t make sense.\n“Can we try a little bit at a time, rather than just run you through and\nhope for the best?” Antonius asked.\n“When you put it like that,” Gavin said, “that sort of makes sense.”\nAntonius grimaced. He lofted the sword and extended it toward Gavin’s\nchest. “How about I hold the sword in place, and you can move forward as\nmuch as you want, and maybe the crew won’t keelhaul me for killing you?”\n“Fair.” Gavin held the tip of the white-and-black sword to his chest. He\nleaned in—\n—and jumped back, cursing, blood dribbling down his chest.\nAntonius jumped back, too, eyes wide. There was a moment of silence,\nwhile Gavin rubbed at the wound. “So… that wasn’t how it worked\nbefore?” Antonius asked.\nGavin cursed louder, swore at the heavens. There was no way he’d been"

        "text": "while Gavin rubbed at the wound. “So… that wasn’t how it worked\nbefore?” Antonius asked.\nGavin cursed louder, swore at the heavens. There was no way he’d been\nimagining it. At least not the second time. The dagger had been a dagger\nwhen he’d fought his father and Grinwoody and Kip for it, and a sword\nthereafter. Gunner had admitted that he’d pulled it out of Gavin’s chest—\nthat Gavin had been fully impaled.\nMaybe it only worked once. It took all your magic, and then it was done.\nBut obsidian didn’t do that. It could drain luxin from your blood, sure, but it\ndidn’t stop you from ever drafting again. Not even all obsidian did that.\n“Can I try it on you?” Gavin asked.\n“You said it took away your ability to draft,” Antonius said.\nIt wasn’t as if Gavin had wanted to tell him, but there hadn’t been any\nway to avoid it, either. The boy had asked him to draft some repair to the\ngalley, and Gavin had no lie ready for why he wouldn’t. “That’s right,”\nGavin said. “It’s a guess, of course, but the events correlate.”\n“So you want me to give up my ability to do magic to satisfy your\ncuriosity?” Antonius asked. “Don’t get me wrong, I want to help, but…\nMaybe we could wait and try some other way?”\nGavin sighed. He couldn’t exactly blame the boy. “It’s almost first\nwatch. Time’s up. We need to decide.”\nYesterday, in their initial exuberance and fear, they’d simply rowed until\ndark to get away. None of the slaves had thought to use sextant and\ncompass to find their position, and it had been overcast. Antonius Malargos\nsaid they were between Rath and the Jaspers, two days out from Rath.\nThe crew gathered on deck. Many of them had slept on deck, not\ntrusting that someone wouldn’t come and lock them to an oar once again. In\nthe growing light of the rosy-fingered dawn, they took their places.\nAntonius spoke first. “This day, we must decide our destination. We’ve\nfood and water for what? Five days? I’ve heard tales of your rowing\nprowess, and I’m sure you could reach half the coast of Blood Forest and\nhalf the coast again of Ruthgar. But there are only two viable options: go to\nBig Jasper, or go to Rath.”\n“Why would we go to Rath?” someone asked.\n“You left out the third option,” someone else said. “We can keep\npirating. Sun Day’s coming, all sort of fat fish in the water for us to take.”\n“Listen to me!” Antonius said. He was too fearful, too young. He\nthought he was losing the sailors’ attention. He wasn’t. They simply wanted\nto taste their freedom a bit. What could make a man feel more like a free\nman than interrupting his betters without consequence? For men who’d\nlived under the lash, it was fine wine.\n“I’m offering you freedom, and more,” Antonius said. “My cousin, Lady\nEirene Malargos, is fair and rich and connected.

If you land in the wrong\ncity, you’ll be seen as fugitive slaves, game for anyone to recapture. You\nland somewhere worse, and you’re mutineers. You could be hanged or\n’hauled. My cousin will give you papers, filed in every capital. Freedom.\nNever having to run again. It goes without saying that we split the cargo.\nEven shares for everyone. No share for me, though I rescued you. All that,\nand fifty danars each.”\n“We want to keep the ship, too!” someone shouted out.\n“The Bitter Cob will be sold and the profit divided up with the rest of the\nshares,” Antonius said. “That’s the only way everyone gets an even split. If\nsome of you want to go in together and buy it, that’s your business.”\nGavin stood up. “Lord Antonius,” he said, inclining his head. “I want\nyou to know how much we all appreciate you and your actions. We’ll make\nsure you’re amply rewarded. However. I’m not really sure why you’re even\ntrying. We’re going to Big Jasper, because whatever you offer, I’ll double.”\nThe men cheered.\nBut Antonius held up his hand silent, waiting. Someone shouted, “Shut\nyer yaps, ya rabble, let the lord drive the price up!” The men laughed, but\neventually quieted.\n“Two things,” Antonius said. “One that you know, and one that you\ncan’t. First, you all know Eirene Malargos’s reputation. She is a tough\ntrader, but she always keeps her word, no matter what. Second, in normal\ntimes, Gavin Guile could indeed double whatever she and I could offer you.\nIn normal times, I know Gavin Guile would honor his promise to us, though\nwe all know that the Guiles have earned their surname anew a thousand\ntimes each generation.”\nThat was a bit too complicated a construction for the sailors. These were\nsimple men. But Gavin didn’t interrupt. Let the boy play his gambit. Gavin\nwas ascendant once more. This was his game. He wasn’t going to have a\ncrew he’d served with for months be taken out from under him. He\nwouldn’t allow it. He saw Orholam staring at him, his prophet eyes intent.\n“But these are not normal times. As I heard from you all last night,\nLuxlord Andross Guile stabbed his own son and threw him overboard.” He\npaused. “I tell you now that the luxlord has not been idle since his son has\nbeen gone.”\nMen were looking at Gavin, and he felt dread rising in him.\n“Andross Guile has been named promachos,” Antonius said. “And he\nhas consolidated power in a way that even Gavin Guile couldn’t do during\nthe False Prism’s War. He doesn’t want the enemy son he thought he\nmurdered to come back. For your own sakes and for Gavin’s, the last place\nyou want to go is Big Jasper.”\nIt took Gavin’s breath. In that moment, he knew it was true.\nAnd, too late, he realized that they had only Antonius’s word on this."

In that moment, he knew it was true.\nAnd, too late, he realized that they had only Antonius’s word on this.\nBut these sailors, not schooled in oratory, many of them unable even to\nread, were able to read a face. Gavin’s undisguised dread was a\nconfirmation of everything Antonius said.\n“But Gavin is the Prism. That’s gotta count for—”\n“Is he?” Antonius said. “I know you believe he is. I believe he is, too.\nBut if he came into Big Jasper and his father’s men seized him, and he\nshouted, ‘I am the Prism!’ would they not say, ‘Then draft, Prism, save\nyourself, prove yourself!’? He can’t draft. He can’t prove who he is. Gavin\nis our friend, and our Prism—aye, I believe it! But now, in wanting to go\nhome, he is like a drunk friend who wants to swim across the sea. It is not a\ngood friend who encourages that drunk to swim. Prove your friendship to\nGavin, and your devotion to your Prism—by not letting him throw his life\naway.”\nGavin had no answer, no counter. His golden tongue was too heavy to\nmake words. He hadn’t thought it through, had been too busy thinking\nabout the wrong things. He’d been outmaneuvered by a boy. He was\nslipping. He was lost.\n“Tell me,” Antonius said, “what happens to the simple sailor who comes\nbetween two warring giants? I tell you what doesn’t happen. A simple sailor\ndoesn’t get paid double. He doesn’t get rewarded. He gets killed outright.\nSo tell me, who wants to head to Rath?”\nChapter 40\nKip didn’t know why he was surprised. He’d thought once he got into the\nrestricted libraries his problems would be solved. As if merely because\nyou’d had to fight for something that meant it was good. The truth was\nharder to find. The books were filled with accounts the luxiats didn’t want\nread, but finding exactly what Kip needed—when he didn’t know what that\nwas—was far harder.\nThe forbidden library had become the squad’s second home. When Kip\nwasn’t training with Karris or attending lectures or training with the\nBlackguards, he was here. If Andross Guile had been initially irritated that\nKip had used his writ to get all of his friends access to the library as well,\nhe’d been placated when Kip reported how the luxiats had been secretly\ndefying the promachos.\nKip was sure there were some very unpleasant discussions between\nAndross and the High Luxiats after that, but of course he didn’t get to see\nany of that. He was also glad to see that Andross had blocked any direct\nvengeance the luxiats might have wanted to take on Quentin. Not that the\nyoung scholar took much hope of that. “Light never forgets,” he said.\n“Huh?” Kip asked.\n“It’s how we say luxiats have long memories,” Quentin said, not even\nlooking up from some boring tome of archaic theology.

Quentin mostly\nfilled his time doing his own research, exploiting the access Kip had given\nhim to restricted materials for a treatise he was writing, but he’d also\nbecome a vital resource and good friend to the squad.\n“Orholam have mercy,” Cruxer said. He’d finished his own studies for\nthe day and had been helping Kip search for books on the black cards. He\nsat back from the scroll he had unrolled in front of him.\n“What?” Ferkudi asked.\nAll of them were seated around a table. Ferkudi and Daelos—who had\nonly learned to read in the last year and still read slowly—were agonizing\nover their own studies nearly as much as Ben-hadad, who’d known how to\nread for years, but still had trouble with the words swimming around the\npage.\nAll paused from their work. It had turned out there was a lot of boring\nmaterial that the Magisterium had banned, but every once in a while they\nfound a gem.\nBig Leo said, “You can’t not tell us. I’ve been reading about flowering\nplants for two hours. Flowering plants, Cruxer. Flowering. Plants.” Kip\nliked Big Leo a lot. His mother had been an acrobat and his father a\nstrongman for a traveling circus. They’d been killed in the False Prism’s\nWar; Ferkudi had said it was because Leo’s father didn’t know how to fight,\ndespite his enormous strength. Big Leo had vowed to become the best\nfighter he could, to never be vulnerable. But other than the intensity that\nsometimes came out when he was drafting red or sub-red, he was good-\nhumored and wry.\nCruxer said, “I sort of had this picture of the greens worship—” He\nlooked around at them, suddenly embarrassed. “Sorry, Teia.”\n“Shut up,” she said. “Go on.” The squad treated her like one of the boys\nmost of the time, but neither the squad nor Teia was terribly consistent\nabout when she wanted to not be treated like one of the boys.\nHe shook his head. “It sounds like fun, right? Orgies and wild\ndrunkenness and dancing and, uh, temple girls—”\n“It wasn’t only temple girls,” Teia said.\nThey looked at her.\n“Don’t even,” she said.\nCruxer cleared his throat. “Uh, anyway. I just came across instructions\nfor the planting ritual. It’s, uh, it’s instructions on how to prepare the infants\nfor human sacrifice. It’s not just how to remove the heart from such a small\nspace, but also how to have musical instruments play loudly at the point\nwhen the infant starts wailing as they’re cut open so that the worshippers\ndon’t… don’t lose faith.”\nThe whole squad went silent for a moment. “Orholam curse them,” Big\nLeo said.\n“I could handle that. I mean, I’d heard they passed babies through the\nflames, and I…” Cruxer shrugged. “It was just a story. But this… the worst\npart is it details how to choose the babies by lot, ‘due to the usual problem\nof there being many more infants offered by parents than the dozen\nneeded.’ This wasn’t some evil priest ripping a babe out of the arms of some"

They did it willingly. Our ancestors. Our people. How could\nthey?”\nQuentin said, “If I may? There was a warrior-priest once named Darjan\nwho they say saw and participated in all the worst of war: massacres and\nmurders and torture and worse, and excelled at all of it. He was a leading\npagan priest, but he became one of Lucidonius’s personal converts, and\nafter a lifetime of war around seven of the nine kingdoms, he put out one of\nhis eyes, moved to Tyrea and lived out his days as an ascetic, climbing daily\nto the top of—well, a statue or what is now Sundered Rock or—there are\narguments, and—not important. He spent the last thirty years of his life\npraying dawn to dusk, and—more not important stuff. He once said, ‘For\nmost of our lives, that Orholam is just should fill us with fear, but there are\nmoments when that truth is the only thing that can fill us with peace.’”\nKip said, “Are you telling me this is what I’ve been missing out on by\nskipping the ‘Lives of the Saints’ lectures? Murderous warrior-priests who\ncamped out back in Rekton? I climbed on that statue!”\n“Way to miss the point, Breaker,” Teia said.\n“You have to sit through a lot of lectures to get the good ones,” Quentin\nadmitted. They all laughed a little, and they all knew it was only to cover\nover what they’d heard. But they were all ready to let it go.\n“It’s sort of a ‘Look inward first, but look outward, too’?” Teia asked\nQuentin. It was an old saying.\n“Pretty much—the real quote was Ambrosius Abraxes, ‘Look ye first to\nthy innermost parts. Search and know them as does Orholam himself, and\nthen may ye turn thy gaze to the deeds of those who persecute thee.’ Some\nof the saints had a real way with words, others…” He grinned.\nStill serious, Cruxer said, “This is who we’re fighting. This wasn’t an\nindividual’s guilt—one bad priest oppressing a community that feared him.\nIt was the entire community, eager to participate in what they knew was\nevil.”\n“There’s no evidence that the Color Prince’s people have done any of\nthis,” Ben-hadad said uncomfortably.\n“This is what they want us to go back to!”\n“They probably don’t even know about this,” Ben-hadad said. “It’s here,\nin this library. How would—”\n“Are you on their side?” Cruxer asked. “You read it, you tell me if such\nthings don’t go a long way to explaining why the Chromeria sent luxors out\ninto the world.”\nThe table fell silent. Of all them, Quentin looked worst. “That was a…\ndark chapter in the Magisterium’s history. We don’t even like to speak of\nit.”\nTeia said, “I’ve heard rumors that some of the High Luxiats themselves\nhave been agitating to give the Office of Doctrine some of their old powers"

We can\ntrust them.”\n“I’m sure people thought that the first time the luxors were established,”\nBen-hadad said.\n“Quentin’s right, though,” Teia said. “They’re right to be scared. Every\ntime we hear about the war, it’s about a loss like at Ruic Neck. Even the\nvictories don’t make sense. A victory at Sitara’s Wells? And then two weeks\nlater a victory at Amitton? Our armies marched backward as fast as they\ncould to reach the next ‘victory’? I think we’re losing everywhere, and\nthey’re lying about it.”\n“Enough about the war,” Cruxer said. “I don’t think we should be\nlooking at these books anymore. These volumes were restricted for good\nreason. I think this knowledge deserves to be lost.”\n“You can’t be serious,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Look at what I just read,” Cruxer said. “I can’t unlearn that! I didn’t\neven read you all of it. It’s worse. And I didn’t even finish. What’s wrong\nwith saying that in some cases, other people know best?”\n“I wouldn’t trust anyone to know what’s best for me,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Then maybe you don’t belong in the Blackguard,” Cruxer snapped,\n“because that’s what you agree to every time you take an order.”\n“Enough!” Kip said. “Cruxer, I’m sorry you had to read that. If you need\nto stop, stop. But I need to do this.”\n“Do you? You don’t even know what you’re looking for.”\nIt was a sore spot. They’d looked through a mind-numbing number of\ngenealogies: Klytos Blue was, like most nobles, related to nearly everyone,\nand though they’d found hints of dozens of scandals, none involved Klytos\ndirectly. It was getting harder not to conclude that they’d been wasting their\ntime. Kip shot back, “If you can’t handle the horror of what man can do to\nman, maybe you’re the one who shouldn’t be in the Blackguard.”\nThe table fell silent.\nCruxer’s ever-warm eyes chilled. “Breaker, we’re going to be part of\nthis war, like it or not. It’s going to kill some of us at this table. And it’s\ngoing to change all of us. It doesn’t mean we should be eager for those\nchanges. Most of them aren’t good.”\n“These books could give us the edge we need to win,” Kip said.\n“The best thing these books can do is to teach us forbidden magic.”\n“For defense!” Teia said. “How can we defend against what we don’t\neven know?”\n“Knowledge is a musket. You can use it only as a club, but will you?"

The young luxiat looked on the\nverge of fainting. Delicate sensibilities about damnation, Kip figured.\n“There isn’t only the danger to our souls,” Cruxer said. “If we use\nthese… the Color Prince’s drafters will, too.”\n“If they can figure it out.

Around the table, smirks were being suppressed.\n“Oh, right, we weren’t going to talk about the Li…, the li… littlest\nsquad member?” Ferkudi said.\nThere were groans around the table. Big Leo buried his face in his\nhands.\n“This again?” Kip said. He knew they’d speculated. Everyone wants to\nlive at a pivotal time in history, right? And if you weren’t arrogant enough\nto delude yourself into thinking you were the Lightbringer, surely the\nsecond best thing would be thinking you knew him. “Not all of you,\nthough?”\n“Sooo,” Teia said, redirecting. “Yes, Captain, we all agree.”\nCruxer blew out a breath. He looked from face to face. “I can’t lead\nwhere you won’t follow, so I’m in. But I want you all to remember this. We\nhad a choice here.”\nKip wanted to follow up about the Lightbringer silliness, but after the\nominous gravity of that, it was too awkward.\nThey fell back to their studies.

A word.”\nKip hung back.\n“Ben, this squad is like a body. We’ve all got our different parts to play,\nbut we need to work together. I need to know—”\n“This is about me saying I don’t trust anyone to know best for me?”\nBen-hadad asked.\n“That’s right.”\n“Crux,” Ben-hadad said. “I don’t trust you to know what’s best for me.\nBut I trust you to know what’s best for the squad. For the Blackguard. And\nthey matter more than I do. That’s why I take your orders. And why I will.\nTo the death.”\nCruxer’s whole demeanor eased, and he was suddenly less worried\nleader and more happy young man, glad to have a friend back.\n“Besides,” Ben-hadad said. “Every body needs an asshole.”\nCruxer groaned.\n“Did you hear that?” Kip said. “He just volunteered to take all the\nsquad’s shit.”\n“I didn’t mean I was the asshole!” Ben-hadad said.\n“It always comes back to poop jokes, doesn’t it?” Cruxer said.\n“In sailing, the poop by definition is at the—” Teia started.\n“Don’t.”\n“Ah, just one crappy—”\n“No.”\nChapter 41\nIt seemed that every time that Kip thought he’d seen all of the Chromeria,\nhe found out that there was much, much more to it. Today, he was meeting\nKarris in the workshops beneath the blue tower. There were smelters and\nglass furnaces here, racks of tools lining every wall, and at least a hundred\nmen and women swarming, drafters and non-drafters each at their appointed\ntask.\nDespite the furnaces burning along one wall, there was no smoke, and\nthe temperature was only slightly elevated. Vents were everywhere—for air,\nbut also for light. The purest lenses Kip had ever seen cast spotlights in\nperfect colors for drafting onto tables. This was where the work of light-\ncrafting and research into practical applications for luxin was conducted.\nEverywhere, he saw people looking at papers or slates holding calculations\nthey’d done in the study rooms above, checking them against what they\nwere seeing in practice.\nKip saw his tutor standing next to a plain, fair-skinned woman with her\nblonde hair pulled in a severe ponytail, sleeves rolled up, skin stained\nfaintly green and yellow, though she couldn’t have been much more than\nthirty years old.

Kip\nhad asked her about it once, and she said that with her short, lean figure,\npeople constantly took her for younger than she was and questioned her—\nchallenged her, in her eyes—far too often. By looking as rich as a Guile,\nKarris forestalled hassles. Kip knew she would have preferred to wear her\nblacks instead, but she only wore those when she and Kip trained together,\nand even then, despite the cost of clothing, her “blacks” were red or green\nrather than black. That part of her life was dead, she said. And the even way\nshe said it, never looking Kip in the eye, told him how much it grieved her.\n“This is Lady Phoebe Kalligenaea,” Karris said. Her hair recently was a\nchestnut brown with lighter highlights, rich-looking and boring. She was\nalso growing it out longer than she ever would have worn it as a\nBlackguard.\n“She’s got the finest control of any yellow superchromat known.\nIncluding Gavin. Lady Kalligenaea, this is my husband’s son, Kip.”\n“Mistress Phoebe will do,” the woman said. “I’m a master crafter, and\ndown here, that means more than a silly title passed down through accidents\nof birth.”\n“Isn’t being a yellow superchromat an accident of birth, too?” Kip\nasked.\nKip the Lip. But this time he didn’t squint his eyes and sink into his\nembarrassment. He watched her instead.\n“Aha! Maybe so, but I work to make the most of this accident. The other\nI avoid as much as possible.” She grinned, and revealed a big gap between\nher front teeth.\n“So you’re better than the Prism?” Kip asked.\nShe looked like she’d bit a lemon. “At small things. I could never make\nBrightwater Wall, that’s for sure.”\n“What are you better at?”\nMistress Phoebe looked over at Karris. “Direct, isn’t he?”\n“It’s refreshing,” Karris said. “At times.” She gave Kip the look. He\nunderstood.\n“I’ve worked with the Prism, taught him,” Mistress Kalligenaea said.\n“Luxin makes sense to him. Karris tells me you’re the same. His signature\nis magic that is beautiful and breathtaking in its sheer audacity—a whole\nwall of yellow luxin, who would dare such a thing? Much less dare it while\nan army was closing in? But… it lacks a certain elegance. Made of yellow,\nyou could have a wall that still meets the requirements for strength—that is,\ncapable of taking sustained cannon blasts—at maybe a third the thickness\nGavin chose. When he isn’t sure, he opts for more, always more, rather than\nto sit with paper and abacus.\n“It’s not a sharp criticism, mind you. If you have unlimited drafting\npotential, using more because it’s quicker is a logical choice. The rest of us\nwould burn out that way in days. We must opt for elegance over force. The\nother thing Gavin does well is that he remembers everything. It’s sort of\nnauseating, to be quite frank. Once he gets a design right, I’ll see him"

Once he gets a design right, I’ll see him\nstaring at it, turning it over in his hands, and then it’s in his head. Ten years\ngo by, and you ask him to reproduce the same cooling rack for bread, and\nhe does it. It’s a marvel. But! We aren’t here to talk about Gavin Guile,\nwe’re here to teach you. They tell me you’re a superchromat.”\nThe words of his testers echoed in his ears: freak. “Some would say a\nsuperchromat boy is like a dog that can bark, ‘I love you’—”\n“‘A novelty, not a precedent’?” Her nose crinkled. “Tawenza\nGoldeneyes is a gifted tutor, better than I. She’s also a bitch. Karris told me\nshe refused to tutor you. Even after Karris came down on her. Flat refused.”\n“Called me a strumpet,” Karris said. She did not seem to find it\nhumorous.\n“Sorry?” Kip said.\n“No matter. If she hadn’t, Lady—Mistress Phoebe wouldn’t have taken\nyou on,” Karris said.\n“You understand, if I take you on, and you ever get a chance to show up\nGoldeneye’s discipulae, I want you to do it. Which means you have to be\nbetter than they are.”\nKip grinned. “With pleasure. I’m at least that much like my father.”\n“Can you draft a stable solid yellow?”\n“On a good day,” Kip said.\n“By the time I’m done with you, you’ll have memorized how to make a\nyellow sword, from memory, within… eh, eight seconds.”\n“Three,” Karris said. “At most. By Sun Day.”\nFor a moment, Kip remembered scrabbling around on the old battlefield\nat Sundered Rock, looking for the telltale gleam of yellow luxin in the\nrising sunlight. Solid yellow luxin was the most valuable for resale. Picking\nthrough the mud, spitting on rocks and rubbing them clear with an already\ngrubby sleeve, hoping against hope he could pay for dinner tonight instead\nof relying on charity again and hating himself, and hating his mother, and\nfeeling guilty for it.\nIt was all different now. He wasn’t sure why, with all the radical changes\nhe’d been through, that somehow this little one struck him.\nIf I ever lose it all, I could still make a better living than I ever could\nhave imagined back in Rekton, just by drafting bits of yellow luxin to sell.\nAll the inherited wealth and position were somehow external. But this\ntiny little thing was somehow his. He would never go back to who he’d\nbeen. Couldn’t.\n“Four months?” Mistress Phoebe was saying. “Hmm. You have your\nfather’s memory? You as smart as he is?”\n“No, and not even close,” Kip said, coming back to the moment,\npushing all that self-indulgent nonsense away.\n“More modest, at least, not that that’s hard,” Mistress Phoebe said.\n“Good. It’ll make you work more than he ever did. Us mere mortals work\nfor our bread and board. One hour a day, young Guile.”"

One hour a day, young Guile.”\n“Every other day,” Karris said. “He’s got six other colors to practice, and\nBlackguard training.”\nKip groaned. Quietly. Karris would let him get away with that much.\n“Sad,” Mistress Phoebe said. “I had all sorts of onerous chores I was\nlooking forward to him performing. Looks like it’ll be study only instead.”\nAnd so it had gone, with every color. Kip didn’t know how Karris\nbullied, blackmailed, or begged, but she got him tutors in every color. She\nkept him in some of his classes—engineering and a basic history course—\nbut had him skip others. The time for hagiographies would have to be later,\nshe said, if he lived. Without exception, his tutors were excellent. Some of\nthem were the best in their field, like Mistress Phoebe. Others were simply\ngreat teachers.\nKarris taught him fighting herself, incorporating drafting with the purely\nmundane fighting that the Blackguard inductees mostly did. She said that\nonce the rest of the nunks did start to incorporate drafting, Kip would either\nget much better than average or much worse: the others had only one or two\ntypes of luxin to figure out how to use in fighting. Kip had seven.\nThere was too much to learn in a man’s lifetime, she said, and a woman\nwould be weak in body by the time she learned it all. But she’d teach him as\nmuch as she could.\nAnd she was a good teacher, despite the handicap of having to teach him\ndrafting while being forbidden to draft herself. She had an uncanny instinct\nfor knowing when he tried to ease up, but she wasn’t cruel.\nHe could tell that she was figuring out her own new roles, too. When she\nwalked with him from the blue tower workshops into the big practice field\nwhere the Blackguards met, he saw a flash of grief in her eyes.\nTrainer Fisk saluted her, hand to heart. She moved to salute back, then\nstopped herself and nodded to him instead, a lady, not a Blackguard.\nKip had a thought before he jogged over to get in line, and blurted it out:\n“He’s coming back. I swear.”\nShe didn’t try to deny she’d been thinking about it. “The world isn’t\nalways so merciful, Kip.” She turned and left abruptly, head held high.\nSomething in the rigidity of it told Kip that it was that or collapse.\nSo unlike his own mother, for whom the least harsh word was an excuse\nto smoke more haze or drown in a bottle. He wished his mother had been\nhalf the woman Karris was.\nAnd that thought led him to Zymun. Orholam’s shit. Kip’s oath, offered\nso readily, buying what he needed with the coin he didn’t want to keep, was\nseeming more expensive by the day.\nFrom Andross, who still played him regularly, Kip learned that Karris\nhad disappeared after the war, only coming back to the Chromeria more\nthan a year later.\nThat hadn’t been uncommon.

Families had been destroyed in any of a\ndozen ways by the war, and many of the old guard hadn’t come back at all\nafter Sundered Rock. Others had been gone for long periods simply trying\nto repair the damage done to their estates in their respective satrapies,\nhaving to hire and train new people to take over from those killed or exiled\nin the war. The old indolence so many families had been able to afford\nbefore the war was simply gone. An absence of a year for the scion of a\nonce-great family had been unremarkable.\nAndross said it had taken him a long time to find out what had\nhappened. Karris had stayed with some distant relations in Blood Forest and\nleft the child with them.\nShe still thought it a secret. But even if Kip were willing to risk\nAndross’s wrath by breaking his word to him, how do you pull someone’s\nsecret shame out into the light, and then make it worse?\n‘That son you thought was secret? Andross knows all about it, and he’s\nbringing him here. And your son may be more loyal to Andross than\nanyone. Oh, and he lacks all human decency and emotion except ambition.’\nAny way Kip played the conversation, it went downhill fast. And that was\nbefore Andross avenged himself.\nI’m Kip the Lip, and in this, I’m not able to blurt out the truth.\nAndross had looked at him during one of their games and paused. Kip\nhad been plying him for news of the war. The last he’d heard, the\nChromeria had lost at Ruic Neck but had won—despite Teia’s scoffing—at\nSitara’s Wells and a small town called Amitton. Andross naturally had all\nthe most accurate and timely information available. Andross said, “This is\nnot for sharing, you understand?”\n“Of course.”\n“We’re losing. We’ll continue to lose for months. The winter storms\ncould sink any ships with reinforcements or matériel we’d send. We’re\ngathering what we can, and fighting delaying actions, slowing them. It will\nbe after Sun Day before we can bring our full might to bear. We will lose all\nof Atash, and perhaps a third of Blood Forest, depending.”\n“It’s that bad?” Kip asked. Some people were still talking like they\nexpected a quick victory now that the satrapies were united against the\nthreat.\n“Worse.” Then Andross had said nothing for a long time.\n“What is a man’s oath, Kip?”\nHe wasn’t looking for an answer.\n“What is a man’s oath but his will put into words? If a man puts his\nwords false, and sets will against word, are not both weakened?”\nKip’s skepticism—not about the sentiment, but on the source of it—\nmust have shown, because Andross said, “You will notice, grandson, that\nthough I often misdirect and manipulate—”\n“Lie.”\n“Yes, lie,” he said as if the difference were a trifle. “But I almost never\ngive an oath.

Every people from the moment\nOrholam gave man the light of reason has known and allowed the petty lies\nthat are as natural as breathing, the words to which no will is attached. And\nevery people has distinguished those from oaths. Vows. The moment of\ncreation itself was a perfect word perfectly wedded to a perfect will.”\n“You believe that?” Kip asked. “I thought you were an atheist.”\nThe instant intensity came back to Andross’s multicolored eyes. “A word\nI hope you use not of me publicly, idly or otherwise.”\n“Never,” Kip said.\nHe seemed placated. “I have more… nuanced beliefs than most.\nOrholam is a lawgiver in a distant land. He is king of a thousand worlds.\nSuch is enough for his majesty, and the actions of men are either mostly or\nentirely beneath his notice, their loves and hatreds, their triumphs and\ntragedies—”\n“But not their lies?” Kip asked, pushing it by interrupting once again.\n“Does the stone need to notice when you release it from your hand in\norder to fall? Orholam is lawgiver. When young lovers fornicate and sire a\nbastard, they aren’t being punished. It’s a natural consequence of the laws\ngoverning the system. Are you as dull as the luxiats that you cannot see the\ndifference between this and atheism?”\n“Orholam is a caring lord,” Kip said. Not so much because he believed\nit, but to see what Andross would say.\n“Caring enough to give us rational and consistent laws, which is great\ncare indeed. Laws that apply to the faithful, to apostates, to pagans, and to\nthose in vast reaches beyond unknown oceans who have never even heard\nthe word ‘Orholam.’ I find that infinitely more caring than some bearded\ngiant who embraces some and smites others without reason.”\nKip had an intuition. What do you do with a fog of deceptions and\nmisdirection? Drag that sonuvabitch into the light.\n“I’ve really enjoyed training with Karris,” Kip said. It was a non\nsequitur if his grandfather weren’t doing what Kip thought he was.\nBut Andross Guile clapped his hands once with real delight. “Well\nplayed, boy!”\n“All that about Orholam and laws, just to remind me to keep my oath\nabout not telling her about Zymun?” Kip asked.\n“Swords are dulled with constant use, wits, sharpened,” Andross said.\nBut it was a stall. He played his Nine Kings card, and Kip had now played\nenough games that he realized Andross was almost certainly going to win in\na few turns. Kip drew, needing Day of Darkness. He didn’t get it.\nAndross seemed to decide to expand. “You want to break your oath, and\nyou’re looking for excuses to do so. But no. That’s not all I’m doing. I’m\nteaching you how to be a man, Kip. One has duties to one’s family. This,\ntoo, is Law. It was a task to which your mother was unequal, and now that\nyou’re an orphan, there is no one else.”"

It was a task to which your mother was unequal, and now that\nyou’re an orphan, there is no one else.”\nA cold rage settled over Kip like the sheets of ice covering the Karsos\nMountains’ peaks, ice that lived through the hottest summer, frozen purity\nin the embrace of rock. The bluntness of brute certainty hit his faith like an\niron hammer hitting ice, shattering and scattering it. Kip had to believe\nGavin was alive, because without his protection, his possible vengeance\nagainst any who hurt Kip, Kip was naked and vulnerable and surrounded by\nenemies. He believed because he wanted to believe.\nWhat do you do with a fog of self-deception?\nThough the game wasn’t finished, Kip silently gathered his cards, never\nlooking his grandfather in the eye, and left.\nAndross Guile didn’t say anything until Kip reached the door. “I should\nhave known you weren’t ready. I misjudged you. A boy you are, still.”\nBut Kip had kept his oath, which perhaps meant that Andross had gotten\nexactly what he wanted.\nIt was enough to keep him up late at night, wondering what he should\nhave done or said instead—which made the training a welcome relief. It\nwas a few hours of total absorption. The language of hand-to-hand combat\nwas direct and simple, the deceptions revealed within seconds, and in Kip’s\ncase, spoken with a very limited vocabulary.\n“Form up!” Trainer Fisk barked. “Squads today. We’re doing Specials.”\nAn appreciative mumble went through the inductees. Specials was the\nterm for the quirky, dangerous assignments Trainer Fisk and Commander\nIronfist came up with to challenge the inductees to think creatively. It was a\nchange to the old way of doing things, but Commander Ironfist was\nfearless. He needed Blackguards immediately, so the old system of\ngraduating in cohorts was out, too.\nNow, he’d told them, as soon as they’d learned all the skills they needed\nand had proven that they had the character needed as well, they could be\npromoted. For some of them, that might be soon, he said.\nEveryone assumed he meant Cruxer and a couple other boys from\ncohorts ahead of theirs, but everyone hoped it applied to them, too.\nThere was some grumbling among the senior cohorts, of course, but\nmuch of that was alleviated when Ironfist immediately took half of them for\nfinal vows. There were new scrubs, too, comprised of young men and\nwomen who gazed with awe at even the inductees. That felt odd.\nBy the Feast of the Longest Night, they’d gone on Specials a dozen\ntimes, and seen twenty inductees sworn in as full Blackguards.\nBut not all the changes had been instituted by Commander Ironfist. As\npromachos, Andross Guile had immediately set most of the full\nBlackguards to training the small army the Chromeria kept. In addition,\nevery drafter on the Jaspers, whether enrolled at the school, or doing\nresearch there, or even civilians who had long ago left the school, was now\nrequired to attend combat classes led by Blackguards.\nAll of it had been done by Kip’s suggestion to Andross—and he kept"

The Blackguards would lynch him for it, though he\nwas still convinced it was the right thing to do.\nThough many of the squads experienced turnover, Kip’s squad\ncrystallized with Cruxer, Teia, Big Leo, goofy Ferkudi, mechanical-\nspectacled Ben-hadad, little Daelos, and Gross Goss, who was currently\npicking a scab.\n“If you put that in your mouth, so help me,” Daelos said.\n“I wasn’t gonna,” Goss complained.\n“Sure.”\n“I don’t see what’s so terrible about it.”\n“Form up, nunks,” Cruxer said. He was the undisputed leader of the\nsquad, though challenges could be made every week. Cruxer was the\ntoughest and the best leader. The squad left well enough alone.\n“Squad Aleph!” Trainer Fisk barked. “Swear to Orholam, you keep\nlagging, I’ll bump you down to Yod next week. Asses to your lines. Now!”\nKip’s squad, despite having him in it, was the best squad: they were\nAleph—the first letter in the Old Parian alphabet. Kip had asked. Of course,\nthe good squads kept getting members promoted into full Blackguards, so\nthe chaos weakened their teamwork. Cruxer had been offered promotion,\nwhich would have made him one of the youngest full Blackguards ever, but\nhe’d turned it down.\nTen squads of six, seven, and eight each lined up. The Specials were\ndifferent every time, but they were always meant to reinforce some lesson\nabout the Blackguards’ life. Sometimes the special task was simply\nwatching a street corner—where nothing happened. The squads that got\nthose tasks always complained bitterly, of course, because the other tasks\nwere usually a lot more fun.\n“Squad Yod! There’s a jeweler off the embassies called Master\nAthanossos. He has received a ruby worth twenty thousand danars. Bring it\nhere. Go! On the double!”\nWhen they were out of earshot, already jogging up the ramp, he said,\n“Squad Teth! Steal that ruby from Squad Yod before they get back. If\nthey’re not successful lifting it in the first place, I expect you to do it. No\none injured. Use your wits. Go!”\nAnd so it went. Squad Kheth was assigned to shadow a diplomat visiting\nhis mistress on the other side of the city. They were to work in rotations so\nthey weren’t seen, and be ware of the man’s bodyguards, who were\nmercenaries from the Cloven Shield Company. Squad Zayin was to watch\nan alley in the slums, and only if a Blackguard inductee came running\nthrough the alley were they to do anything—at that point, they were to take\nwhatever it was he or she had and take it to a house in the slums.

If\nthey were not caught, they were show their loot to a full Blackguard who\nwould be in the market. Squad He was then to put it all back, again without\nthe merchant noticing.\nSquad Daleth was to find the leader of one of the criminal gangs gaining\nstrength among the refugees, and beat up him and his top two lieutenants—\nand get out without losing anyone to injuries. After they left, Squad Gimel\nwas assigned to take up a position where they could watch. They were to\nact as reinforcements if it looked like Daleth was in serious trouble. No\nkilling, but anything short of that they would be allowed. If everyone in\nSquad Daleth swore they hadn’t needed help, those squads would swap\nrankings.\nSquad Beth was set on a fetch-the-item run. Those were the worst.\nSometimes they were utterly straightforward, and other times the squad\nwould be attacked by almost anything. It was, of course, a pretty good test\nfor young Blackguards, who never knew when an assassination might be\nattempted, and had to learn to deal with boredom without losing their edge.\nAnd that left Kip’s squad.\nTrainer Fisk grimaced at them. They fully expected to get the hardest\nassignment. They were the best, after all. “You’ve got a new squaddie. Boy,\nform up!”\nThe squad looked at each other as a young mountain Parian came\nforward. He wasn’t tall, and he had some baby fat, where his people were\nfamed for their lean height. But they all recognized him. It was Winsen.\nHe’d been part of their class, until he failed out, losing to Kip in the final\ntesting—losing, only Kip had known, on purpose to spite his master.\n“We get the bump-outs now?” Big Leo asked.\n“How come he gets in?” Ferkudi asked. “He came in twentieth. Why not\nlet fifteen through nineteen first? Even those washouts would be better than\nhim, right?”\nKip didn’t point out that he was number fifteen, thanks.\n“Breaker was fifteen,” Daelos said.\nThanks.\n“Maybe the others were already gone? Recruited elsewhere or shipped\nhome?” Big Leo asked.\n“You don’t think the Lightguard recruited ’em, do you?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Lightguard,” Big Leo scoffed. “That’s a rumor.”\nCruxer stepped in. “What’s the word, Winsen?”\nWinsen shot a look at Kip. “Just lucky, I guess.”\n“Are you ladies done with your kopi and chat time?” Trainer Fisk\ndemanded.\n“Ladies?” Teia complained. “I was the only one not—”\n“Are you interrupting me, nunk?!” Trainer Fisk shouted at her. He\nwalked over and got right in her face. She swallowed and shook her head.\n“Good! There’s a man spouting heresy on a street corner, calls himself\nLord Arias. Ain’t no lord I ever heard of.

That was different.\n“How many guards does he have?” Cruxer asked.\n“None we know of.”\n“So why are—I mean, why should it take all of us to beat him up?” Teia\nasked. Kip could tell she only narrowly avoided asking what she really\nwanted to ask: why are we beating up someone just for talking?\n“It’s an order,” Trainer Fisk said. “You have a problem following\norders?”\nChapter 42\n“Soul poison,” Orholam said. “You never told me about the soul poison.\nWhy didn’t you tell me about the soul poison?”\n“Stop it,” Gavin said. “Stop saying that.”\n“Had you not been told it is death and evil and murder? It is eating you,\ndestroying you!” Orholam said, eyes bright with fervor.\nThe Bitter Cob had made it to the edge of Rath Harbor last night before\nhaving to anchor. Once the sun rose, the portmaster would be out to assess\ntaxes and to direct them to a berth. Gavin’s options for escape were rapidly\ndwindling.\nNo, that wasn’t true. There had never been many options. Once the\nportmaster came, Gavin had to go with the man or resign himself to\nMalargos custody. He would, doubtless, be their “guest.” Without drafting,\nhe would be helpless.\nWell, overawing one portmaster. How hard could that be?\nGavin left Orholam and jumped up on the gunwale. He could swim.\nSharks and crocodiles swarmed to the carrion that inevitably washed into\nthe waters of a great city—not least of which was the dead people who were\ndisposed of in that old favorite way: tossing them in the river. Fishermen\narmed with harpoons hunted the sharks and crocodiles in turn, harvesting\nfins and skin and teeth. It was a rather smaller circle of nature than Gavin\nwas comfortable with. Set against the perennial battle of nature versus man,\nswimming in a harbor like this was a big bet on the men.\nEven if he made it to shore, dripping wet, dirty, emerging from the\nshoreline muck, he would then have to escape. Without coin sticks, without\nfriends, without drafting. Gavin had been naked before and felt less naked\nthan he felt now. He looked at the tranquil, trashy water below him and\nrealized for the first time that he could drown in that.\nVulnerability sat hand in hand with Mortality. They beckoned Gavin to\ncome.\n“Tell me about the black luxin,” Orholam said, quiet, tense. Gavin\nhadn’t noticed his approach.\nLosing my edge, to be startled like that.\n“It’s a myth to scare young drafters.”\n“You wish to be unflinchingly honest with yourself. Yet here you fail.

Made you piss yourself. Made\nyou run. But there was nowhere to run, was there? Of a sudden, the world\nwas not as you’d believed. Did you see them?”\n“Them? I have no—”\n“You were a better liar when first Gunner pulled you out of the sea. Or is\nit especially hard to lie to me?”\n“One would hope that it would be especially hard to lie to Orholam,\ndon’t you think?” Gavin said lightly.\n“Man’s first recorded words to Orholam were a lie, so no. Men lie to\nOrholam as readily as they lie to their wives. Show me your hands.”\nGavin got down off the gunwale. The sky was lightening, but there were\nstill few sailors awake. They had privacy. Not that he wanted it. He showed\nthe man his hands.\n“Remarkable,” Orholam said. “As our mouths utter both blessings and\ncurses, clean water and foul from the same well, so too your hands. You’ve\ndrafted white luxin, too.”\n“What the hell are you talking about?” Gavin said.\n“Hoo-hoo! A puzzle you are indeed! You remember drafting the black,\nbut not the white?!”\n“Quiet, dammit!”\nGavin had seen men whose hamstrings had been cut who didn’t fall so\nfast. The prophet simply dropped. Gavin bent over the man—\nWho blinked up at him. Then stood, shaking his head. His eyes stuck on\nGavin’s, and he stood, transfixed. He swallowed. Tried to speak. “You’ve\ncome face-to-face with truth, and refused to see it. You’ve chosen\ncowardice when you had it in you to choose courage. You’ve chosen black\ninstead of white. You’ve failed, Guile.”\n“I’ve failed?! You sent me those dreams, didn’t you? Through some\nmagic I don’t know, some kind of will-casting. You did this to me. You, and\nhim.”\n“Tread lightly, o Son of Am.”\n“I’ll tread how I please! I didn’t fail. God failed.”\n“Those two words cannot be put together in any way that makes sense.”\n“God failed me.”\n“Because an earnest prayer cannot be answered no?”\n“Lies!” Gavin hissed.\n“Then Orholam will give it to you plain: you keep up your lies, and\nyou’ll be stricken blind.”\nIt was such a bizarre threat that Gavin was taken aback. “I already am\nblind.”\n“Perhaps that much is true,” Orholam said. “He who refuses to see is no\nbetter off than he who can’t.” Then he hobbled away, carefully avoiding\nsleepers on deck.\nMust have smacked his leg in his fall. Lucky I didn’t smack more than\nthat.\nThe boy would be up on deck any time. Then Antonius would follow\nGavin like a puppy.

No idea that Gavin had stymied his cousin Tisis’s\nentry to the Spectrum. Either he had no idea about any of these, or he didn’t\ncare.\nBut hoping that Eirene Malargos would share her nephew’s lack of\nconcern was a bridge too far.\nMight Eirene be turned into an ally? She was known to be fiercely\nprotective of her family, prone to anger and jealousy, but scrupulously fair\nin her business dealings. Never broke her word, but went out of her way to\ncrush those who broke their word to her, whether in business or in bed.\nShe’d held her own family to bad business deals they’d made with others,\neven when she could have used her burgeoning power to overturn them. In\nshort, a woman to be feared and admired. She was exactly the kind of\nperson to remind Gavin that not all power was magical. If Gavin could\nsurvive her rage… no. He’d injured her family too many times.\nIf he were still a Prism, it would be one thing, but now? What exactly\ndid he bring to an alliance?\n“What were you talking with the godmonger about?” a voice asked, low.\nGunner.\nThe crew had found a cage in the hold, last used to carry a cheetah from\nthe edges of the Verdant Plains. They’d tied the cage down on deck and\nstuffed Gunner in there, after giving him a good beating. His eyes were\nswollen to slits. Gavin had stopped them before they killed him.\n“Don’t talk to me,” Gavin said. “I’ve had enough with crazy men today,\nand the sun isn’t up yet.”\n“Gunner ain’t crazy,” Gunner said. “Gunner’s mad! It’s differnt.” He\nchuckled to himself, but quietly. He was obviously in pain.\nGavin looked to the city, aglow, catching the first rays of the rising sun.\nThe city had grown around a massive fortress on the hill overlooking the\nGreat River Delta. Long ago, Oakenshield Fortress had become Castle\nGuile for a single generation and then as the family’s fortunes had waned, it\nbecame Corinth Castle, then Rath Skuld. Now it was simply known as the\nCastle. During Taya Oakenshield’s time, it had extended two great walls\nlike legs down to the harbor so that it couldn’t be cut off from supplies.\nLater wars and lulls between wars had seen walls built out farther from\nthose original walls, the original walls plundered for their stones, the new\nwalls demolished by a Blood Forest army, and the original walls rebuilt.\nThe city’s petitions to the Spectrum to rebuild the wider walls after the\nBlood War was finally over had been turned down time and again. Andross\nGuile had been at the center of that denial, preaching peace through mutual\nvulnerability—for others, as always. Of course, the army this city had to\nworry about now wasn’t Blood Foresters but Blood Robes.

It had been bold, bloody, and effective. To a younger\nGavin, the only thing that mattered was that it had worked. He wasn’t likely\nto find allies here.\nGavin looked around the ship. The Bitter Cob indeed.\n“You give me that rifle, I’ll punch a hole in that portmaster for you,”\nGunner said. “One shot, no tricks. From here, they wouldn’t even think it\ncame from us. They’ll be looking on that ship for the shot’s original.”\n“Origin,” Gavin said. “And what the hell’s Rifle? Family name?” Men\nnamed weapons all the time, but that wasn’t a language he was familiar\nwith.\n“A rifle. Not a name. It’s the spirals inside the barrel. Knew me a smith\nwas working on the idear. Worked real good, but you had to cast your\nmusket balls perfect, file off the seams, make exact globes. Don’t think this\none shoots globes. That smith’d give his dick hand to see my girl here.”\nHe ignored Gunner. In the distance, the portmaster boarded another\ngalley half a league west. The shore was half a league north. A long swim,\nthe last few hundred paces covered in scum that was likely sewage. It\nwasn’t simply gross. Gavin had known good swimmers during the war\nwho’d gone through muck like that to return from scouting. A day later,\nthey were fevered and shaking. Three days later, dead.\n“That’s half a league,” Gavin said. “Gotta be close to two thousand\npaces. Those boys kicked whatever sense you had left outta you.”\n“Two shots, maybe. No more’n three.”\nGive Gunner this, the man never doubted himself. It had been something\nthey’d had in common, once.\nGavin didn’t have to make it all the way to shore here. There were river\nbarges and the rowing galleys favored for transport up and down the Great\nRiver all throughout the delta. With the sun coming up and dazzling the\neyes, it was possible Gavin might not be seen.\nAnd there weren’t only sharks and crocodiles in this water, right? Gavin\nrecalled hearing something about friendly river dolphins. Maybe that had\nbeen a myth, though. He’d heard they were pink. Friendly pink dolphins?\nRight, those sounded real.\n“’Ay. Fukkelot,” Gavin said. The man was waking, not far away. “And\nthe rest of you.” He didn’t raise his voice, and he held a finger to his lips.\nHe didn’t want Antonius hearing. “This here’s my musket. As some of you\nknow, I paid all my magic to get it. I got nothing now, nothing but this.\nTime was, I would have demanded your service. Now, I just ask. If I ever\ndone you a good turn—” He couldn’t help it. ‘If I ever done you a good\nturn’?

I can’t compel you to do this thing, and\nI wouldn’t if I could.” Well, there was another lie. Harmless, though. “Hide\nthis musket from the boy, and from the Malargos woman, and from my\nfather, and from this one.” He nodded to Gunner. “Time comes, if I can, I’ll\nrepay you a hundred times. But I can’t carry it with me.”\n“Wa-wa-why not?” Fukkelot asked.\n“Because,” Gavin said, giving his best devil-may-care grin. He always\ngave that grin when he was terrified. “I ain’t a good enough swimmer to\ncarry it with me.”\nHe tossed the rifle to Fukkelot while the sailor cursed in appreciation\nand Gunner cursed in frustration and Gavin’s own throat swelled with\ntrepidation.\nIt was stupid, but it was simple: stay and let what would happen happen,\nor risk crocodiles and sharks and sewage. Sewage shouldn’t be so bad\nduring flood season, right? Or did that make it worse? Gavin stood on the\ngunwale, balancing without even touching the lines. He turned to the\nprophet, who was still watching him with burning eyes from across the\ndeck.\n“Orholam,” Gavin said, “do I have your full attention?”\n“Always.”\n“Good.” He cracked his neck right and left. “Because fuck you.”\nHe dove into the water.\nChapter 43\nThe water was warm and buoyant. That was Gavin’s first warning. Now that\nhe was in it, swimming a stroke that one of the Guile house slaves had\ntaught him long ago in a different life, he remembered that the confluence\nof the Great River and the Cerulean Sea caused odd currents and warm\nspots throughout the Great Delta—and that the sharks didn’t like the\nfreshwater coming from the river. On the other hand, the crocodiles didn’t\nlike the saltwater. Crocodiles were much more likely closer in to shore. So\nGavin would be giving both kinds of predators a chance at him.\nAnd yet. There was something of that old blue peace here in the sea.\nBetter, of course, to float on a narrow blue luxin skimmer. Better to feel the\nsun like a caress on the skin, the water a cool counterpoint. Better by far to\nbe able to see the blue. He felt the briefest pang of loss, and then pure,\nunadulterated rage washed over him.\nLimbs cutting smoothly through the waters, he suddenly wished that a\nshark would come. He wanted to fight. No, he wanted to kill. He wanted the\nterror of almost dying and the mastery of killing, of triumph.\nInsanity.\nHe headed straight in, not pausing to look behind.

Perhaps the leaner muscles of rowing\nwere better suited to the task than the bulk he’d developed from shooting a\nskimmer from a dead stop in the water to flying across the waves. That was\na freedom he would never feel again.\nThe river galley started moving when he was still two hundred paces\nout. Its inertia should give him a chance. He kicked.\nNo damn sharks. Please no damn sharks.\nWater was streaming through his beard, causing a drag he’d never felt in\nhis clean-shaven past.\nLet them be blind to me, just for a little longer.\nBut the galley began moving, and within moments, it was no longer\nperpendicular to him. He cut the angle, but ended up only even with the\nriverboat, and then behind it.\nAnd then it pulled away, and left him exhausted.\nBut he’d come to some sort of channel. He saw buoys to either side. He\ntreaded water for a minute. When he looked back, the Bitter Cob was in the\ndistance. But the oars were out, and it was turning toward him.\nOh, hells.\nBut another river galley was sweeping through the channel, from farther\nout. It would pass fifty paces south of him—so he swam back toward the\nBitter Cob. In another minute, he saw he’d miscalculated, or the river galley\nwas turning, because it was headed straight for him. It was going to hit him.\nHe started to swim off to the side, when he saw a fin and a dark shadow,\nthat way. He turned, heart in his throat, and saw another to the other side.\nIt was too late to move either way now. The galley was on top of him,\nsending out little sprays to each side of the bow as it cut the water.\nGavin took the deepest breath he could, and flipped around, his feet\npointing toward the hull, and dove backward. The hull slapped against his\nfeet even as he sank, but he absorbed the shock and pushed off it, using the\nhull’s force to propel himself deeper into the water.\nHe arched his back as he sank, hoping he’d made it deep enough not to\nbe crushed by the rest of the hull or ripped to shreds against barnacles. He\nflipped over, opening his eyes, ears full of water, pressure on his chest. The\nmonstrous shadow was passing above him. It was impossible to tell exactly\nhow far away the hull was.\nThere was good news, if you could call it such. There were no barnacles\non the hull. Of course, it must be a riverboat. Easier to keep clean and\nmoving fast.\nIt meant he could surface, and if he misjudged, it wouldn’t be his death\nby scraping and infection. Though if he shed blood in this water, the sharks\nwere close.\nHe kicked, and felt his hand brush something rough and muscular. He\nbarely saw the shape as the shark’s shadow disappeared into the murk. He\nlost a bit of air. One chance at this.\nA bank of oars went down on one side, agitating the water. A sharp turn."

Lungs afire, Gavin swam hard\nfor the surface, nearly cracking his skull against the last edge of the hull as\nit passed above him.\nHe shot out of the water and clawed for anything, blinded by the spray\nof water.\nHis fingers caught in something, but his left hand pulled free\nimmediately. He held on by his right hand alone, body dangling and then\npulled through the waves. He almost lost his grip before he was able to slap\nhis left hand up into the net as well.\nHe blinked and coughed, trying to get his bearings. His legs were still\ndragging in the water and his hands were holding on to a thick net, the\nindividual ropes cutting into his fingers as he tried to support his entire\nbody’s weight on their narrow cords.\nThe net wasn’t empty. There was a tiger shark in it. Alive. One of\nGavin’s hands was right by a pectoral fin. The other was stuffed nearly into\nits gaping, gasping mouth. Gavin’s weight was holding his hand away from\nthose rows of razory teeth, but one thrash—\nThe shark thrashed.\nGavin dropped his hand and his body spun. With the motion of the boat\ndragging his body through the water, he couldn’t stop his momentum. The\nother hand got twisted painfully into the net. He almost cried out.\nThen, being dragged backward, he almost cried out again at what he\nsaw. Four fins in the water—no, six. All following the boat. Being dragged\nlike this, he was the bait. And the boat wasn’t traveling nearly as fast as the\nsharks could swim.\nHe saw blood course down his extended arm. It wasn’t his. The shark in\nthe net above him had been harpooned. With Gavin at the net’s lowest\npoint, he became the path for the blood to course into the water. He was no\nexpert on sharks, but he had seen them in frenzy—and it all started with\nblood.\n“Blood’s drawin’ ’em, Kleos. See if you can get another before we get to\nthe freshwater!” a voice called out above Gavin on the deck.\nHe heard the heavy breathing of a fat man on the deck above him,\naudible even above the hiss of the waves, and he could just see the tip of a\nharpoon bobbing in and out of sight.\nGavin almost called out to the man. But he knew how he looked. He\nlooked like an escaped slave. Most mariners would claim him as the bounty\nof the sea, and immediately put him back on an oar. Without papers to\nprove he wasn’t a slave, there would be nothing he could do except try to\nconvince them to ransom him—to whom? Would Karris hear about his\nplight before his father would? Would the men believe that the Prism\nhimself had come to their boat, or would they dismiss it as the ravings of a\nmadman?\nHe wouldn’t work an oar again.

Gavin spun again, this time with the net\nreleasing its grip on his hand. He couldn’t even feel that hand, couldn’t tell\nif his grip would hold. He scrambled, kicking in the waves, desperate to\nswim to steal the smallest moiety of assistance.\nTwo fingers of his other hand caught the net. Worn to scar and callus by\nhis months on the oar, those blessed fingers held despite everything. And\nnow he was being dragged straight backward, giving him a perfect view of\nthe shark approaching. This would be no exploratory nuzzle, he could tell.\nIt was going to strike.\nSwinging slowly from left to right, Gavin got his fists full of net. He\ncouldn’t spare the time to look up and see if he was putting a hand in the\ncaptured shark’s mouth above him; he couldn’t take his eyes off the shark in\nthe water.\nHe pulled his knees up to his chest as the shark struck. Jaws flashed past\nhis feet—missed. The shark spun in the waves and swam off in a broad\ncircle. They didn’t like approaching the hull. Didn’t like that they could\nonly strike from directly behind.\nAt least Gavin hoped that was how they were thinking, and that none\nwere swimming deep under the waves to strike him from below.\nThe man on deck had almost retrieved his harpoon now, and Gavin saw\nhis chance. The weight of the harpoon meant that it would dangle within\nreach of him at the stern. When it came, he would grab it and yank hard.\nThe sailor, not expecting any such thing, would be hurled overboard. For\nthe sharks.\nIt meant killing a stranger. A man about whom Gavin knew nothing. An\ninnocent.\nFuck him. Gavin would live, and he would live free, and he would be\narmed.\nThe rope stretched within reach for one heartbeat, but Gavin couldn’t get\nhis cramping hands to loosen in time to swing—and then the sailor pulled\nthe harpoon off to the side so it wouldn’t tangle in the net. Damn!\nGavin turned his eyes back to the sharks, but none of them came at him.\nAnd indeed, they began hanging back farther and farther. The sailor with\nthe harpoon swore.\n“Freshwater,” he said, grumbling to himself.\nAnd now that Gavin’s vision wasn’t battle tight, he saw that they had\nentered the very mouth of the river, not far from the western shore. The\nriver itself was vast, wider than any river in the world. But the western\nshore was close—and as dirty with the sluggish current as he’d feared. If\nthe boat he was riding on docked somewhere nearby, at least its hull would\ncut the sludge, and a quay would give Gavin plenty of places to hide. If,\ninstead, they went farther up the river, he would jump off at the Great\nBridge.\nIn a few minutes, though, he realized that he was being terrifically\noptimistic. He was hanging on the back of a boat, and though his arms\ndidn’t have to bear the full weight of his body since he was half immersed,\nhe did have to fight against the waves trying to pluck him from the boat,\nand his hands were losing feeling again."

He fell into the\nwater.\nThe pain in his unclenching fingers was excruciating at first, but as he\nflopped his way to the surface, the pain almost felt good, a promise that his\nhands would function again. Someday.\nWith the river galley pulling away from him, Gavin got his bearings\nagain. In the mouth of the river, with the sun rising, he was far more visible\nthan he had been before. If he could get far enough up the river, he would\nfall under the city’s jurisdiction, and then at least he could hope to be turned\nover to a magistrate rather than directly enslaved. Depending on how law-\nfearing whatever captain picked him up was.\nBest not to get captured at all.\nBy luck, he wasn’t too far from the Great Bridge. If he could make it to\nits shadow, he would be far less visible. Swim to a huge pylon, climb up the\nscaffolding, and make it to shore.\nHe set off immediately. He’d not made it this far in life by hesitating.\nWhen he was two hundred paces away from the bridge, he saw two\nthings at the same time, both of which took his breath away, for opposite\nreasons. A Ruthgari war galley was emerging from the shadow of the Great\nBridge, and the standard flying from its low mast—deliberately just a\ncouple of feet shy of the height of the Great Bridge—was the proud bull of\nthe Malargos family. At the same time, Gavin saw a dolphin coursing\nthrough the river toward him. It popped out of the waves, and though Gavin\ncouldn’t see the hue, he remembered the drawings, long-beaked and\nmuscular. A river dolphin.\nPlease come here, you little miracle.\nGavin had heard of dolphins saving swimmers before. He’d heard of\nthem letting men grab on to their backs and ride. The dolphin was his only\nhope to make it to the shadow of the bridge in time.\nRiver dolphin. He couldn’t tell if it was pink or not, of course. It could\nhave been piss yellow for all Gavin cared: it was salvation.\nGavin kept swimming as the dolphin slipped right up to him. But at the\nlast moment, it turned and stabbed its beak into his ribs. His breath shot out\nand he inhaled water. Before he could even cough it out, the dolphin\nemerged again from nowhere and hit him again, cracking a rib.\nHe flailed, gasping for breath. Then it hit him again, this time smacking\nhis head. Dazed, he sucked up a lungful of water. He lost consciousness.\nChapter 44\n“I can’t do this,” Big Leo said. “This Lord Arias is a twig.”\n“What’s hard about it?” Daelos asked. “Go out there and lower the boom\non him.

There was nothing particularly special about this\ncorner that they could see. No one else was watching it. It wasn’t\nparticularly prosperous. It wasn’t the busiest in the city. Perhaps, for a\nheretic, that meant fewer merchants’ guards and house guards who might\nthrow an elbow or a stone. Perhaps he was just moon mad and he’d picked\nthis corner randomly.\nDaelos and Goss were still out watching approaches to the corner, and\nTeia was ambling through the intersection itself, seeing what she could see,\nbut the rest of them were huddled in a circle behind a store, trying to figure\nout what to do. They usually found a rendezvous point farther away, but\nthere hadn’t been any good spots.\n“Hey! What are you boys doing? Get out of here, scram!” a hairy-armed\nstore guard barked.\nCruxer gave a mild oath at himself. Kip knew the young man would see\nit as a personal failure that someone had noticed them clumped up. Cruxer\ngestured, and they all started walking away from the shop.\n“Yeah, that’s right. Scurry away, ya little vermin,” the store guard said.\nThey gritted their teeth and didn’t reply. Knowing that you could win a\nfight wasn’t a good enough reason to jeopardize a mission.\nTempting as it was.\nThe goon sneered. He obviously thought they were up to no good, but as\nlong as they weren’t threatening his employer’s store, what did he care? He\ndidn’t follow.\n“Feels like there’s got to be some trick,” Kip said.\n“There is,” Teia said, rejoining them silently. “But not on us.”\n“What is it?” Cruxer asked quietly.\n“There’s a woman watching the preacher from across the street. She’s\ncarrying bandages. And the preacher himself, he’s the real thing. He’s a\nBlood Robe. He’s got sealed scroll cases that he’s handing off to certain\npeople as they pass. He’s a handler of spies.”\n“Oh, I can do this. This Lord Arias is a twig,” Big Leo said. He loosened\nup a shoulder that would have made a draft horse jealous.\n“Hold,” Cruxer said. “We don’t know that he’s alone. But I do feel better"

But I do feel better\nknowing there’s some plan, even if I don’t know what it is. Give me a\nsecond.”\nAnd the insane thing with Cruxer was that it was only a second. He\nscowled, looked at his team, and then started giving orders.\nIn moments, the team scattered, each to his or her appointed task. It left\nonly Kip with nothing to do. “Cruxer,” Kip said. “Captain, I mean.” When\nthey were on assignment, even the inductees were supposed to observe the\nofficial order scrupulously. “You’ve done me nothing but good turns. We\nboth know I wouldn’t be in the Blackguard without you, but you can’t keep\nme out of the action. Doing that will only make those who are already better\nthan me get even farther ahead. I need to be in the thick of things.”\nCruxer’s brown eyes, barely edged with green and yellow around the\niris, fell on Kip like a sledge. “I’m captain,” Cruxer said.\nThat was all there was to it. “Yes, sir,” Kip said.\n“There’s a good vantage. But we’re gonna have to climb,” Cruxer said.\nHe took off.\nA climb difficult enough that Cruxer found it worth mentioning?\n“Wonderful,” Kip said. He jogged after the older boy.\nThey cut wide a few blocks, slowed as they crossed the main streets, and\ncame eventually to a building on the opposite side of the intersection from\nthe spy. They went around the back of the building, which had scaffolding\nup, as the dingy dome was being worked on. The ladder had been pulled\naway from the scaffolding—doubtless to keep young scoundrels from\nclimbing it.\nCruxer rested his back against the wall, took a wide stance, and cupped\nhis hands, waiting for Kip to use it to jump.\n“I could draft a ladder,” Kip said.\n“You’ll jump,” Cruxer said.\n“I’ll jump.”\n“Hand to shoulder, then pull yourself up.”\nEasy for you to say. Kip rolled his shoulders, shook his head, and took a\ndeep breath.\n“Not got all day here, Breaker.” Cruxer leaned his one shoulder forward,\nto give Kip more space to step.\nKip charged with the grace of a drunken turtle-bear, stepped into\nCruxer’s cupped hand, onto his shoulder with the other foot even as Cruxer\nheaved his foot upward, and jumped. His hands slapped easily onto the\nedge of the wood platform, and he still had upward momentum. He pulled\nhimself up and flopped onto the platform.\nHe spun around on his stomach and offered a hand down. Cruxer,\nstanding in place, jumped straight up, grabbed Kip’s hand, kicked off the\nwall, and landed—standing up, stepping carefully over Kip.\nAnd that’s why he’s the captain.\nThe scaffolding extended around the front of the building, and there\nwere piles of brick stacked on it, waiting to be put in place and\nwhitewashed.

Cruxer and Kip moved forward, keeping low. The\nintersection was forty paces or more wide here, and against the dingy dome\nand the bricks, the two of them should be virtually invisible. Close enough\nto watch, far enough away not to be seen, and close enough to help if it all\nwent to hell.\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said. “It’s time we acknowledge something.”\nThat doesn’t sound so good. “Mm?” Kip asked.\n“You’re never going to be a Blackguard.” Cruxer didn’t say it as a\nthreat. He said it as simple fact.\nKip’s heart leapt into his throat. “I’m getting better. I’ll catch up, I\nswear.”\n“It’s not that.”\nThen Kip understood. “Look, I know the squad has this thing about me\nbeing the Lightbringer,” Kip said. “But—”\n“Doesn’t matter.” Cruxer poked his head up over the edge. Big Leo was\nstill making his way up Verrosh. Even hunched to seem smaller than he\nwas, the young hulk was hard to miss. “They’ll never let you take final\nvows.”\n“They?”\n“Let’s say you make full ’guard. And you get put on rotation to guard\nthe Red, whom everyone knows you’re feuding with. Hard to imagine, isn’t\nit? Or maybe you’ve patched up your feud with him, and you get put on\nrotation to cover the White—whom everyone knows he’s feuding with.\nHard to imagine, isn’t it? I’m sure your grandfather has plans for you.\nBecoming a Blackguard would give you all sorts of protections from him.\nThere’s no way he’d let that happen. That’s if the White doesn’t have her\nown plans for you.”\n“Maybe her plans involve me getting those protections by staying in.”\nBut Kip was only denying it because he wanted it to be wrong.\n“Blackguards face the truth, Breaker. It’ll be a miracle if she lives long\nenough for you to make it to final vows.”\nKip’s stomach sank. Everyone knew the White had a year left, two at the\nmost. Cruxer was right. There was no way Kip would be ready to be a full\nBlackguard in that time. Ironfist had bent the rules to get him this far.\n“And if your father comes back in time to work his own particular\nmagic, I’m sure he’s got his own plans for you.”\nHe thought of his grandfather’s view of oaths. If Andross Guile had\nmeant what he’d told Kip, he definitely wouldn’t want Kip to make an oath\nthat might put Kip against him—which was precisely what taking the\nBlackguard oath might do. He threw his hands up. “So why even have me\nin the squad?”\nCruxer body-slammed him with a disappointed look. “Don’t go back to\nbeing that whinging fat boy Kip. You’re Breaker now.”\nOuch.\n“You’re in the squad because you deserve it,” Cruxer said. “The\nquestion for you, knowing that your time with us is limited, is what are you"

Heads up. We’re go.”\nBig Leo walked as inconspicuously as possible through the thin crowd\nuntil he was about ten paces from the preacher, who was holding forth,\nthough no one seemed to be paying him any attention. From their vantage,\nKip couldn’t decipher a word either said, but Leo had planned to allege that\nthe heretics had been responsible for killing his sister.\nLeo shouted something, and then jumped on the preacher before the man\ncould flee.\nSince his cover was as a simple laborer, Leo was careful not to fight like\na trained fighter. He simply grabbed the preacher’s hair in one hand and\npunched him rapidly in the face. If you’ve never been hit in the face, it’s\ndeeply shocking even if there isn’t much power in it. Kip knew that Leo\ncould have killed the man in a blow. Instead, he was pulling each punch,\nhitting the man in succession: cheek, eye, nose, mouth, cheek, eye. Blood\npoured freely, and the man was going to look and feel like he’d been beaten\nwithin a thumb of his life—without actually endangering him much. Big\nLeo hauled the man up, holding his entire weight by his hair as the man\ncollapsed, and slugged him twice in the ribs, hard enough to break them.\nLeo dropped the man and turned, and this time spoke loudly enough that\nKip could hear him: “Shame on all of you for tolerating this heresy in your\nmidst! These people are monsters! Murderers! You let him walk free and\nspread his poison here? Shame!” Leo spat on the stones and turned to stomp\noff.\nNo one did anything. Not that the squad had expected them to, but it was\nnice to see something they’d planned work: by identifying the spy as a\nheretic, they’d hoped Leo could get out clean.\nUnseen though, behind Leo, Lord Arias had risen on unsteady feet. He\npulled out a knife. Leo’s back was to him. The spy lurched toward him.\nIt was too far away for a shout to do any good. Worse, a shout might\ndistract Leo from the sound of the spy approaching him.\nThe spy drew the blade up to bury it in Leo’s back—and his arm\ndropped, limp. The sound of the blade tinging off the paving stones made\nLeo spin. He saw the knife and the staggering man at once, and his fist\ncame up in a flash.\n“Don’t kill him!” Cruxer whispered, as if he could will Leo to inaction.\nBig Leo unclenched his fist and grabbed the spy at the collar and the\nwaistband. He spun in a rapid circle with the man and hurled him out into\nthe street. He stood for a long moment, flexing his fists. Kip could see that\nthe battle juice was on him. Big Leo had gone for a quick fistfight, and had\nalmost ended up dead. It was hard to think rationally. Leo took a step\ntoward the downed spy.\nTeia darted out from the crowd. “Brother!” she shouted. “Thank"

Leo took a step\ntoward the downed spy.\nTeia darted out from the crowd. “Brother!” she shouted. “Thank\nOrholam!” Kip couldn’t hear the rest of what she said, but she took Leo by\nthe arm and pulled him away. He didn’t resist. Her appearance had snapped\nhim out of his rage.\nShe pulled him down Verrosh Street.\n“What the hell was that?” Kip asked.\n“Good luck?” Cruxer suggested. But he grinned. Kip could tell he knew\nexactly what had made that knife drop.\n“I’m serious.”\n“That was paryl. You’re not the only one changing things around here.\nTeia’s got a few tricks, too. That one doesn’t usually work for her yet,\nthough. Thus: good luck.”\nTogether, they watched. Teia was soon indistinguishable, but it took\nlonger for Big Leo to blend with the crowds. Then Ferkudi and Ben-hadad\ncame onto Verrosh, blocks down, almost out of sight, and began separately\nwalking toward the square. They passed Big Leo with neither side\nacknowledging the other.\n“You see anyone follow Leo?” Kip asked. He hadn’t.\n“One possible. We’ll see in a moment.”\nIf the spy had an ally eager to exact a quick vengeance or even just to\nsee where Leo had come from, it was vital that that friend fail.\nFerkudi stumbled into someone and they both went sprawling, Ferkudi\ntaking by far the worse of it. He made a big show of it, crashing into a\nParian headscarf seller’s booth and sending scarves flying.\nOnly Ferkudi could lower the boom on himself.\nA slender Parian woman dodged out of the booth instantly, shouting and\nwaving her arms in big gestures.\n“They get away?” Kip asked.\n“If they didn’t with that? I’ll give them a thrashing myself,” Cruxer said.\nDown in the intersection below them, though, another quieter drama was\nplaying out. The woman Teia had seen had come to the downed spy and\nwas tending to his wounds.\n“Thoughts?” Cruxer asked.\nKip studied the woman. Teia said she’d already had bandages near to\nhand before anything had happened. “A spy to spy on the spy,” Kip said. “A\nbetter way to insinuate her into their ranks than just showing up and saying,\n‘Hello, I hate the Chromeria, too! Can I join you?’”\n“Good point. And see that one back there? Beaded beard, gold\nearrings?”\nKip grunted an assent. He hadn’t seen him before now.\n“That’s the spy’s actual handler. He almost came out of hiding when Leo\nstruck, and then he almost ran away. Now he’s just watching. I think we can\ncall this mission a success.”\n“As long as no one saw us,” Kip said.\n“We’ll wait here for a bit.” Cruxer sat with his back against the bricks.\nKip sat beside him.\nMinutes passed, and Kip had a thought that he’d had half a hundred\ntimes before.

It seemed that he got in\ntrouble for the times he didn’t speak nearly as often as he got in trouble for\nspeaking too fast. But he’d been a coward with inaction too many times.\n“Captain…” Kip said. “I just… about Lucia. The assassin—the assassin\nwas aiming at me.” He could still remember Lucia with her back to the\nassassin, stepping into the line of fire at the last instant. He would never\nforget the look on Cruxer’s face as the young man had pulled Lucia’s\nbleeding body from Kip’s stunned arms and into his own.\nCruxer stared into the distance. Then his mouth twitched into a sad\nsmile, remembering Lucia. Then he was back. “I know,” he said.\n“You know?”\n“I went back to that alley. Recreated the murder. The target could only\nbe you.” He shrugged.\n“You’re… you’re not mad?” Kip asked.\n“I’m furious. But not at you. Breaker, if Lucia died saving your life, her\ndeath may still have been an accident, but it’s no longer meaningless. Death\nfor a purpose? What more could any of us ask? Lucia wasn’t good enough\nto make it into the Blackguard. She knew it, and she was just beginning to\ngrapple with the death of that dream. She was never going to make it into\nour ranks, but she still died serving our highest ideals. It’s not for nothing.”\nSo this is why he wants me to be the Lightbringer so much. If I am,\nLucia died for the most important person in history.\n“But what if I’m not the Lightbringer?” It just slipped out, quiet and sad.\n“Don’t you take it away from her,” Cruxer said. “It has nothing to do\nwith that. All are equal in Orholam’s eyes: she died for a friend, a squad\nmate. It is our earthly task as Blackguards to die for Colors and Prisms—\nbut in Orholam’s eyes, dying for a pauper means as much as dying for a\nprince.”\nKip sat there for a few more minutes. He knew Cruxer meant it. But\nCruxer saw Orholam’s hand everywhere. He believed that Orholam\nintervened in the world constantly. Commander Ironfist saw Orholam as a\ndistant king who could intervene when he chose, but rarely chose to do so.\nAndross thought Orholam had set the world in order, but hadn’t touched it\nsince, allowing the whole system of the Chromeria and the Magisterium to\nbecome a swindle that the nobles and Chromeria had pulled over on the\nSeven Satrapies.\nOddly enough, the latter part seemed to be the Color Prince’s view, too.\nWhat Gavin’s view was, Kip didn’t know. Nor did he know what the\ntruth was.\n“Captain. I don’t know if this is the time, but what do people really\nknow about the Lightbringer? At worship that one time, Klytos Blue said\nwe’re all Lightbringers, and I’ve spent a few hours looking up prophecy\ninterpretations in the libraries, but they all seem to contradict each other, so"

All I got is that he’s going to restore true worship—whatever\nthat is. He’s going to comfort the afflicted, open the eyes of the blind, throw\ndown the altars and high places, raise up the oppressed, and cast down the\nwicked.”\n“And kill gods and kings,” Cruxer said. He smirked.\n“Gods and kings, plural?” Kip asked uncomfortably.\n“I can’t remember. Of course, it depends which Seers you accept as\ncanon. Those things are accepted by pretty much everyone. Some of the\nweirder Seers said, uh, can’t remember the exact phrasing, something about\nkilling his brother—”\n“Well that’s promising.” Zymun could use a good killing.\n“—and dying twice.”\n“I take that back,” Kip said.\n“You did go overboard, and we thought you were dead, so that might\ncount as one,” Cruxer said. “And everyone dies at the end of their life, so\nthat could be it.”\n“Or… the pirates who rescued me threw me back overboard, so maybe\nthat’s twice,” Kip said. He didn’t buy it, though. “Great! Really helpful.\nNow I know I only need to die one, two, or zero more times. I may have to\nkill at least one more god and one more king. I do have to figure out how to\nheal blind people, and maybe pick up a bit about true worship.”\n“Breaker, if it was easy, everyone would agree about it. A Seer sees a\ntrue vision, but they have to translate that into words, and that means into\ntheir own language, and into their own metaphors. And that’s if she’s a true\nSeer—there have been false ones. There are luxiats who make their life’s\nwork of this sort of thing. Luxiats who are much better scholars than Klytos\nBlue, I might mention.”\n“But if it’s all theological complexity and uncertainty, it’s useless! I\nmean, if I can’t figure out what it means, what’s the point?”\n“Maybe it’s not for you.”\n“I accept that, but if I were the Lightbringer wouldn’t I need…”\n“No, even then.”\nKip looked at him, puzzled. “I’m… uh, not following.”\n“The Lightbringer Prophecies may well not be for the Lightbringer’s\nbenefit. They’re for everyone else. For the soldier who understands only a\nsnippet, but it helps him hold the line. For the bereaved widow. For the\nyoung scholar, searching for meaning. What’s it matter, anyway? You’ve\ndone pretty well so far not knowing the prophecies,” Cruxer said.\n“Deliberate ignorance. I like this idea,” Kip said. He thought for a\nmoment. “Everything we’ve said could be talking about my father. People\nthought he was dead when he fell into the water—” And somehow survived\nbeing stabbed with a knife that had morphed into a sword while it impaled\nhim. Kip hadn’t told that part to anyone.

Kip didn’t believe it; half the time he was convinced his eyes must\nhave been playing tricks on him. “—and we’ve already talked about how a\ngod being killed on Gavin’s command could well count even if he didn’t\nland the final blow.”\n“His childhood doesn’t fit. Prophecy says the Lightbringer will come\nfrom the outside, outside the accepted or something. It fits a bas—a person\ninitially thought to be a bastard coming from Tyrea. Doesn’t get much more\noutside the accepted than that. Gavin Guile is the son of Andross. He grew\nup here. He was groomed to take power. It doesn’t get much more inside\nthan that.”\n“Well, you didn’t tell me about that part!” Kip complained.\n“I’m a Blackguard, not a luxiat. If you want to talk about prophecies, the\npeople you should see are… well, actually they’re the last people you\nshould see. In fact, I’m not so sure we should be including Quentin in any\nof this.”\n“Quentin? Why not?”\n“Somehow I thought it would be obvious to you. I forget you grew up in\nTyrea.”\n“Why wouldn’t I go to the luxiats?”\n“Because if now is the time true worship needs to be restored, it means\nthe luxiats are doing things so wrongly that Orholam himself is putting his\nhand in to make it right.”\n“Well, shouldn’t they welcome Orholam moving? I mean, they’re\nluxiats.”\n“Breaker… are you really that naïve?”\n“They serve Orholam! That’s their job!” Kip said.\n“Voice down.”\n“Sorry, Captain.”\n“We Blackguards exist to stop assassinations. It doesn’t mean we look\nforward to them.”\n“Totally different,” Kip said.\n“The more power you have, the more skeptical you’re going to be about\nsomeone coming along who wants to take all of it away. There have been\nfalse Lightbringers before. If you show up out of nowhere without\nundeniable proof that you are who we suspect, you might find yourself\nstanding right at the fissure line of a schism. There have already been\nattempts to kill you, Breaker. Where do you think those have come from?”\nOne came from my grandfather, but he denied the others.\n“Who else would even know you were alive?” Cruxer asked. “I don’t\nthink the Color Prince would think you were worth killing when you first\ncame here. If anything, you did him a favor by killing King Garadul and\nputting him in power.”\n“Thanks for reminding me.”\n“So if not him, Breaker, who?”\nThe Order of the Broken Eye? But they were just assassins for hire,\nright?\nSo unless there were yet more unknown enemies out there, it had\nprobably been luxiats who’d tried to kill Kip. But luxiats?

Learn to lead. Learn who your friends are, and then draw\nthem so close to you that every time someone shoots a musket ball at you, it\nhits one of your friends and not you.”\n“That’s… that’s a horrible way to think about friends.”\n“Breaker, if you become a Color or a Prism, and a thousand times more\nif you become the Lightbringer, you’ll no longer be merely our friend.\nYou’ll be our lord first. It is right and proper that we should die for you. It is\nour purpose.”\nSuddenly, Kip felt like he was locked in that closet again, covered by\nrats gnawing, gnawing, gnawing at him. But now the rats were cares,\nworries, burdens, people he could let down, people who would die if he\nfailed, people who would die even if he succeeded. He felt sick and\nclaustrophobic, hot and cold.\n“Knowing I would die for you, how would you live if you were worthy\nof that sacrifice? Live that way,” Cruxer said.\n“Simple, huh?” Kip asked sardonically.\n“Simple. Not easy.”\nThey sat in silence for a few more minutes. Kip pretended to be\nthoughtful, but the idea was so big it couldn’t bear the weight of someone\nlooking at you and wondering how much of it you’d processed. So mostly,\nhe sat there and pretended to think, and felt wretched and dumb.\nWhen they got up to go, he said, “Should we follow their route to the\nsafe house and check up on them, or should we go direct?”\n“Let’s go direct. They got away clean.”\nChapter 45\nWithin three blocks, Teia realized she hadn’t gotten away clean. As\ninvisible as she’d thought she was, someone was following her. There were\ntricks to this, as there were tricks to everything, but figuring out if you’re\nbeing followed was one of the things the Blackguard practiced. So Teia\nwended her way through the neighborhoods carefully. At first when she’d\nsplit from Big Leo, she’d moved at a fast pace. Not jogging, but clearly\nmoving with purpose. At the fifth turn, she was certain: she was being\nfollowed.\nIt was odd. Big Leo would be a hundred times easier to follow. But\nmaybe they figured Big Leo would be that much more careful. Or maybe\nthey were afraid of him. Or maybe they’d followed him as well.\nThe man she suspected of tailing her was small.

He was alternating putting the hat on and taking\nit off to make himself harder to spot as a constant presence behind her. Not\na bad trick.\nHe walked as if he knew the neighborhoods—not glancing around\nlooking for landmarks. When Teia slowed and turned back toward the\nneighborhood they’d left as if her guard were now down, he followed. That\nwas when she was sure he was following her.\nAnd this is where working with a squad is beautiful.\nTeia almost grinned as she headed toward their secondary ambush point.\nIt had been Cruxer’s idea, and Teia had been proud of his deviousness. He\nseemed so upright and good she’d worried he couldn’t be sneaky. Goss and\nWinsen would be waiting to incapacitate her tail. Ferkudi would be\nfollowing one minute back. Daelos would take care of helping Big Leo. Kip\nand Cruxer would follow Big Leo if it looked like he was being pursued.\nIt was the right division of labor. No enemy would be going to send a\nman who couldn’t fight after Big Leo. Still, the two squad members who\nleast inspired Teia’s admiration—or in this case, confidence—had to be\nGoss and Winsen.\nAs usual when they worked in town, none of them were to draft unless it\nwas life-or-death: they couldn’t give away who they were.\nTeia came around an alley and pulled her hood up. It was a brisk winter\nday, so it shouldn’t be too alarming to her tail, but the hood was her sign to\nGoss and Winsen that she needed scrubbing. She winced, though. She’d\nducked around that corner, hadn’t she?\nShe walked down the alley, past Goss and Winsen’s hiding places,\nwhispering, “Black hair, Atashian beard.” Then she kept walking.\nCan’t look back, Teia. Don’t give it away. She took care not to duck\naround the next corner, but she did stop as soon as she was out of sight. She\ntook a deep breath and drew a flat-bladed knife. She got down on her knees\nand extended the blade past the corner, trying to see in the reflection if a\nshadow darkened the entrance to the alley.\nNothing. Nothing she could see, anyway. She needed to buy a good little\nmirror for this.\nShe waited, certain she would hear the sounds of a scuffle, or a sharp\nyelp as Goss slammed the piece of wood against the man’s shins as they’d\nplanned. They would rob him if they could, too, to make it appear random,\nbut stopping pursuit was their first worry.\nNothing. Where is he?\nAs soon as Teia thought the question, she knew she was in trouble. She\nrocked back onto her feet, taking a squatting position from the kneeling one\nshe’d been in. She began leaping to her feet even as she felt the arms close\naround her.\nThe man yanked her backward, stopping her momentum with an arm\nacross her chest. Her reaction was instant enough to make any Archer\nproud: when you’re rarely as strong as those you fight against, you learn to\nchange the rules. Instead of trying to pull against the man’s grip, Teia"

Instead of trying to pull against the man’s grip, Teia\npushed hard into it: he had pulled her backward, so she jumped backward,\ntoo.\nSurprised, the man careened backward, and they slammed into the side\nof a building together, the man’s body cushioning the blow for Teia. His\ngrip relaxed, and she dove for the ground.\nThe last of his grip on her arm whipped her hand into the wall, though,\nand as they fell in opposite directions, they were suddenly both looking at\nher knife, dropped on the ground.\nThey both jumped for the knife that lay between them, and they both\narrived at the same second. But where the man grabbed for the knife’s grip\nas they slammed back together, Teia was already grabbing for the man’s\nwrist. Not finding resistance where he expected it again, the man couldn’t\nstop the blade as Teia helped its upward momentum—twisting the man’s\nwrist at the last moment so he rammed the blade full into his own gut.\nShock lit his eyes as he felt the blade slide home, and that gave Teia the\npause she needed to pluck the dagger from his fingers. Then they were\npressed hard together. He reached around her back and embraced her. He\ngrabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled hard. His breath was hot and stinky\non her face.\n“Adrasteia the Implacable indeed,” he said. “Bless me, goddess. Bless\nme!” He laughed sickly, and held her tight.\nWhat the—Where was Ferkudi? He was her backup. Where was he?\nTeia was trapped. She panicked. Her knife hand was free, and she\nstabbed. Stabbed, stabbed, stabbed. Not artfully, not carefully finding the\nangles between ribs that she’d been taught through so many hours. She was\nflailing, flailing, screaming, barely aware of the sound of her own voice.\nHer vision went red, and all the world was close and hot and unbearable.\nSomeone was shouting. Shouting her name. She twisted, lashing out\nwith elbows as the man slid down her body, grip weakening, but she hit\nnothing.\nSomeone ripped the little man off her. Ferkudi lifted the man in a hug,\ntrapping his hands down at his sides. Then he ran at the opposite wall of the\nalley, lowering his shoulder at the last moment and crunching the man\nagainst the stones. The man dropped in a bloody smear, falling to the dirt.\nTeia spun, crouched low, feral, knife in hand.\nGoss and Winsen both stood there with their hands up. “Orholam’s balls,\nTeia, it’s us!” Goss said.\n“Wow,” Winsen said. “You killed the shit outta him.” He sounded…\nappreciative.\nTeia looked at the dead man. He was all rags and blood now. Blood\nmatted his hair and his beaded beard. How had he got blood in his hair? She\ndidn’t even remember cutting his scalp. She wanted to vomit, but instead\nshe felt cold inside. Dead. A killer.\n“You have a rag?” she asked quietly. “I’m a mess.”"

A killer.\n“You have a rag?” she asked quietly. “I’m a mess.”\nGoss and Winsen looked at each other, looked at Ferkudi. Shook their\nheads in awe at the same time. That was funny. She laughed.\nA stricken look passed over their faces, like she scared them. Oh, they\nthought she was laughing about killing that man. For some reason, that was\nhilarious, too. She laughed louder. She sounded crazy.\nThen she walked over to the dead man. She found part of his breeches\nthat were clean, and wiped the dagger carefully. Then she found a portion of\nthe breeches’ leg and began cutting off a chunk of cloth. The young men\nboth just watched her.\nShe stood, oddly more disconcerted by seeing the bare, hairy leg of the\ndead man than by the fact that he was dead. Why were some men so… so\nhairy?\nHirsute. That was the word. Meant hairy. Why are there two words that\nmean exactly the same thing?\nShe took the rag and began wiping her face. It came away bloody, sticky.\nShe examined herself. She was wearing a light tan blouse. It had been light\ntan, anyway. Now, it was a wreck, bloody everywhere. All bloody, again.\n“Ferkudi,” she said. “Give me your tunic.”\n“Huh?”\n“Tunic, moron.”\n“Why?”\n“Because you can walk out of this alley not wearing a tunic, and no one\nwill remember it ten minutes from now.” She stared at him. He didn’t\nunderstand. “Versus me walking out of here without a tunic.”\nA moment passed. Ferkudi’s face scrunched.\nGoss said quietly, “Or her walking out of here with a bloody tunic,\nFerkudi.”\n“Oh!” Ferkudi said. He loosened his belt and peeled his tunic off.\nTeia stripped off her blouse. Battlefield rules, right? She couldn’t even\nfind it in herself to be concerned. ‘Oh no, my squad saw my stomach’?\nBlood had soaked through her short chemise, too, dammit. It was her\nfavorite of three, the only one that fit just right. She unlaced and stripped\nthat off as well. None of the young men looked. Ferkudi silently held out\nhis tunic, eyes averted. But Teia didn’t take it immediately. She used clean\nareas of her tunic—most of the back of it—to wipe the obvious smears from\nherself.\nNow she knew another reason why the Blackguard wore black. Hide the\nblood. Smart, that. She pulled on Ferkudi’s tunic, wrapped her belt loosely\naround the waist, and grabbed the dead man’s petasos. The young men\nstood around like rubes, doing nothing. She kicked her bloody clothes at\nWinsen and said, “Fold those up, nunk. Ferkudi, you drag the body over\nthere, hide it under the rubbish. Goss, kick dirt over the blood pools.”\nThe young men stood still for one long moment more, still stunned by\nthe dead man at their feet.\n“Orholam!” she swore. “Now. Now!”"

They moved.\nAnd in two minutes, in staggered turns—different directions, different\ntimes—they departed the alley. No one tried to stop them. No one cried out\nan alarm. It was like it never happened.\nChapter 46\nGavin woke bound and gagged in the back of a wagon, and started\nlaughing. These idiots had no idea—\nThat he was a Prism.\nNo more. Well, that left a bad taste in Gavin’s mouth. Or perhaps that\nwas blood and scummy river water. The wagon slipped on a cobble and\nrattled him. Oh, Orholam, broken ribs.\nDidn’t appear to be sticking out at any odd angles, though. So maybe\njust cracked. And he hadn’t drowned. So there was that. Didn’t think he’d\ngo swimming anytime soon, though. Attack dolphins. What the hell was\nthat? Dolphins were supposed to be nice.\nHe rolled over slowly, timing his roll with the bumping of the wagon,\nand was able to see through the side. The sun had risen high above the sole\npromontory that overlooked the great delta, and it illuminated all the vast\nfarmlands that fed Rath and much of the rest of the Seven Satrapies besides.\nLooking at the Great River and the farmlands here, Gavin was for the first\ntime appreciative of his handicap. Seen in black and white and gray, the\nvisual cacophony of the city was muted. Gray-and-black buildings rose in\nfront of the dazzlingly white river and farms but for once didn’t overwhelm\nor detract from that greater beauty.\nIt had been many years since Gavin had been in Rath during flood\nseason. As a boy from their estate’s walls atop Jaks Hill, he’d marveled at\nthe sheer expanse of water. Indeed, it still awed him. Every year, the Great\nRiver flooded so vast an area that maps—maps drawn at the scale of\nshowing all seven satrapies—drawn at different times of year showed a\ndifferent coastline. Nor was it merely the coast that was altered. As Gavin\nlooked out, it was like looking across an ocean, with villages in the distance\nsticking out like tiny islands on a sea of glass. This late in flood season, the\nwater was only a few thumbs deep, and all the silt had settled from it. When\none talked about the Cerulean Sea being calm in the morning, one\nunderstood it was a comparative calm. In the early morning like this, the\nGreat River was so calm as to be surreal.\nAs an adult who’d been involved in vast efforts, it was the engineering\nof the thing that awed him. The people who lived on the Great River had\nnot conquered nature; they’d slipped a yoke on it. Every year the great\nfloods came, and the farmers retreated to their little villages, and the rich to\ntheir estates. In each case, foundations had been dug deep, deep into that\nlife-giving silt. Entire villages sat only five to six feet above the level of the\nrest of the ground. The villagers knew exactly how much the river could\nrise. The floodwaters held no terror for them."

        "text": "life-giving silt. Entire villages sat only five to six feet above the level of the\nrest of the ground. The villagers knew exactly how much the river could\nrise. The floodwaters held no terror for them.\nFlood season became a time of relative rest. Marriages were performed,\nparties held, feats of sport and strength demonstrated, houses repaired, tools\nsharpened, songs sung, instruments dusted off, love made. And, until Gavin\nhad settled the Blood War, walls fortified, boys and men drilled, and\nweapons honed for the inevitable raiding that would come some months\nhence.\nBut the yoking of the river never really ended. As the waters rose and\nuntil the farmers determined exactly how high the river would rise this year,\nthe village elders directed channels to be opened or shut off, managing the\nspeed of the waters’ flow so their own soil didn’t get scoured away.\nThrough flood season, the old men would keep watch over the river as the\nold women kept watch over the people. As the floods finally began to\nrecede, the elders would direct which channels would be opened in order to\ndrain the waters from their fields slowly, only after depositing all their silt,\nalways trying to strike a balance that would give them the longest growing\nseason possible, and always ready to shore up levees in case of rainstorms.\nTheir gentle mastery of land and river and labor had meant perpetual\nbumper crops the likes of which the rest of the satrapies could only envy.\nAnd envy they did.\nThe same flat land that gave them so much food offered little defense.\nThe Great River itself was a defender on only one side. There was too much\nriver and too few people to put a watch on all of it—and that was assuming\nthat no village chief would allow himself to be bribed to turn a blind eye to\nraiders who promised to wipe out the next village over, where some rival\nlived or some ancient wrong wanted avenging.\nThey hadn’t called these the Blood Plains of old for nothing, though that\nhad also been the name of one of the nine kingdoms that had encompassed\nboth what was now Blood Forest and Ruthgar. United, the warriors of the\nforests and the farmers of the river had been unstoppable. They’d had the\nfirst functioning navy in recorded history, with the riches required to build\nand maintain and staff a true fleet.\nAnd the kings had used that fleet, one even navigating all the way up the\nGreat River to the Floating City, a trip only possible in that time during\nflood season. It was more impressive for the logistical challenges they had\novercome than the military ones. No one at the time had even dreamed of a\nstanding army. The expense of paying farmers not to farm must have\nseemed an insanity. Everyone knew that raiding was for late summer.\nAnd so when that fleet had reached the Floating City, the defenders had\nbeen entirely unprepared. The navy, filled with men who were starving after\nthe arduous trip, which had included numerous portages, and furious at each\nother, had done unspeakable things when they reached the city. And their\ncommanders, far from trying to restrain the baser passions, had inflamed\nthem instead.\nThey had done their best to bury what they’d done there, to proclaim\nonly a glorious victory. But a card of that time had survived."

        "text": "them instead.\nThey had done their best to bury what they’d done there, to proclaim\nonly a glorious victory. But a card of that time had survived.\nGavin had never viewed it. He’d seen enough slaughter in his life. Some\ncards couldn’t be unseen. Sometimes he wondered if that was what his\nolder brother Gavin had done on his thirteenth birthday. Had his father\ntaken him to see cards?\nAt thirteen? Surely their father wouldn’t be so foolish.\nAnd yet Gavin had never been the same, and refused to speak of it,\nlashing out at Dazen and hitting him in the face for the first time ever when\nhe wouldn’t let it go. It had opened a rift between the brothers, that innocent\nneedling and that punch. Dazen had thought it was his own fault for\npushing his brother too far. He’d seen the tears welling in Gavin’s eyes, like\nhe couldn’t believe he’d hit his little brother either. But he’d stood over\nhim. Hadn’t apologized. Hadn’t ever apologized.\nThat was where what had culminated at Sundered Rock had started.\nI’m sorry, Dazen.\nWhat the hell? I’m sorry, Dazen? I’ve worn this mask too long.\nWhat was I thinking on the boat? Telling them I’m Dazen? Madness.\nWhy would I do such a thing?\nThey hadn’t even treated him any differently. More importantly, in their\nbrief few days with Antonius Malargos, it hadn’t seemed that any of them\nhad told the boy that Gavin had once claimed to be Dazen.\nRegardless, it was a slip. A slip at the top of the rope and you fall a few\nknots down. But a slip at the bottom of the rope meant a plunge, and Gavin\nwas about as low as you could get.\nThe scenery rolled by, beautiful but dead to him. Then, as they wound\ntheir way up Jaks Hill, someone noticed his eyes were open. Mercifully,\ninstead of smacking his head with something blunt, they merely pitched a\nblanket over him so he couldn’t see. Sometimes men surprise you with\ngentility when you least expect it.\nPerhaps an hour later, after being slowly walked through a number of\ndoors with the blanket still over his head, Gavin was deposited in a cell and\nonly then allowed to see. He wasn’t there long when a door opened and a\nwoman walked in.\n“You willjacked the river dolphin,” Gavin said. “Clever.”\nEirene Malargos didn’t deign to respond. Despite the blanket, he was in\na dungeon, which told him pretty much all he needed to know about his\nprospects.\n“Punishable by death, that kind of magic, but undeniably clever,” Gavin\nsaid.\nStill she said nothing. Eirene Malargos didn’t have her sister’s rare\nblonde hair, instead she had brown hair in a straight curtain that hung to her\nchin, sometimes obscuring half her face. Nor could she draft. Nor did she\nhave her younger sister’s voluptuous curves, though it was hard to tell in the\nman’s tunic and trousers she wore. They did have the same heart-shaped\nface, and Eirene had an intensity Tisis lacked.\n“Everything’s about magic to you, isn’t it? Take you Guiles out of your"

Take you Guiles out of your\nsphere, and you’re hopeless.” She shook her head. “How do you make the\nworld follow… this? We trained the dolphins. The hard way, with treats and\nlove and consistency and a firm hand.”\n“Most likely a lie, but I appreciate the righteous indignation,” Gavin\nsaid. “Very convincing.” He swung his feet over the side of his cot and tried\nto stand. The pain in his ribs took his breath away. Cracked ribs. They’d\nbeen bound, and he’d been washed while he was unconscious, though.\nMaybe he did have a chance. He took a few light breaths, gathering his\nstrength, and stood. There’s a power dynamic that can be seized by sitting\nwhen others stand and standing when they sit, or refusing to do so.\nHe was taller than Eirene Malargos, and meat speaks. The dominance of\nheight and musculature, softened by his attractive face and features, usually\nundercut resistance quite a bit.\nEven women who like women like a good-looking man.\nEirene Malargos frowned, which told him it was working. Of course,\nbeing attractive merely opens doors a crack. Especially cell doors.\n“May I ask,” he said, “why I find myself in a cell? Apologies for my\nearlier unpleasantness. I find myself in a great deal of pain. It’s quite\nenough to make a man cranky.” He winced through a smile.\nCareful not to overplay it, Gavin.\nThe dungeon wasn’t much of a dungeon, in truth. It was merely a cellar\nfitted with a few cells. It was dry, and there were no rats, which meant they\nkept cats, but also no sign of fur or odor of cat urine, which meant they kept\na staff. With the substantial roof beams here, he had to be in the lower\nlevels of a large house or mansion. So a large, wealthy house in one of the\nnicest sections of Jaks Hill. It was unlikely to be anything other than the\nMalargoses’ own mansion.\nWhich meant, in turn, that he was within shouting distance of his own\nhome. Though he hadn’t visited in years, the Guiles owned an estate here.\nThey were neighbors with the Malargos family. With slightly better\nposition, of course.\nIt had to be a constant thorn in all the Malargoses’ sides: the Guiles had,\na generation past, only owned a sliver of swampland with a sad excuse for a\nrath on it. The family had made a play for power, binding together families\non both sides of the river—but a reversal had left them with only their\nholdings in Blood Forest and that one, moldy rath. Andross Guile had\nleveraged that rath into representing Red for Ruthgar. And with the Red\nseat, he’d forced his way into the best estate on Jaks Hill, which doubtless\nthe Malargos family had hoped to make theirs after the fall of the Maltheos\nfamily.\nAfter acquiring the estate, the Guiles didn’t even live here; they rarely\nvisited, and yet the Guiles had the premier estate as Andross’s pride\ndemanded.

It was, some said, better than the satrapah’s own, and she had to\nshare her estate with all the machinery of government. And here Gavin was.\nHe’d traveled all over the world, only to return home to a cell.\nEirene said nothing for some time, merely studying him. He kept his\nface pleasantly neutral, on the off chance that she would claim a\nmisunderstanding. As the Strategist had said, if you want your enemy to\nfight to the death, cut off all escape; if you want your enemy to retreat,\nleave a path open. As a young man, Gavin had liked to cut off escape, had\nliked to overwhelm, dominate, and destroy, even if it carried a higher risk of\ndefeat.\nOn some signal he hadn’t seen, a servant came from the hallway, where\nhe must have been standing out of Gavin’s line of sight. In a silk-gloved\nhand, he presented his mistress with a glass of liquor on an electrum tray.\nThere was no second glass.\nShe drank. Winced.\nGavin could smell it from where he stood. It smelled like burnt peat and\nfermented giant sweat. He was actually happy she hadn’t offered it.\n“What is victory to you, Gavin Guile?”\n“Pardon?” he asked.\n“What is your plan? It’s plain you’ve been a galley slave. The scabs on\nyour wrists haven’t healed, so you’ve worn manacles within the last two\nweeks. The stripes on your back are red, but healed, so you’ve been\nwhipped in the last year but not the last month. If you last shaved when you\nwere free, your beard says you’ve been enslaved perhaps six months. That\nlines up with the Battle of Ru. Surely in all your time on an oar, you were\nplotting.”\n“Perhaps all my plotting was taken up on getting free of slavery. Freeing\noneself from slavery is better than most galley slaves manage in six months,\nafter all.”\n“Most slaves don’t have my cousin rescue them.”\n“So you, ahem, know about that?” Gavin said.\n“He signaled us when you arrived in the harbor.”\nOh, the boy had a mirror. That was how Eirene had known to send a\ngalley first thing in the morning to scoop him out of the water. A mirror.\nGavin hadn’t even thought of it.\nIt’s the little things that get you.\n“You stupid, stupid man,” Eirene said. She threw back her liquor. “I\nspoke with him last night. Do you know that he is quite enamored with\nyou? With all these legends you’ve cultivated around you. He believes them\nall. He thought when he found you in that galley that he’d been sent by\nOrholam himself to rescue you. That it was destiny. Young, no men in his\nlife, you understand. Puts you on a pedestal.”\n“He’s a good boy. Not a boy much longer, either,” Gavin said truthfully.\nAnother glass of liquor appeared in her hand, but she waited until the\nservant—who avoided even looking in Gavin’s direction—was fully out of\nearshot before she continued. “Do you know that if you’d told him honestly\nwhy you didn’t want to come to Rath, he likely would have turned his back"

He would have defied even me, who has been both\nmother and father to him. You understand? I’m having to manage him\ncarefully even now, to make sure he doesn’t try to come rescue you or some\nfoolishness. But I’ll watch. I won’t let him tie himself to you. You’ll get no\nhelp from that quarter.”\n“And you’re going to silence an entire crew?” Gavin asked.\nShe didn’t like that. “It can be done,” she said. “I haven’t decided yet if I\nmust do it.”\nThere was only one way to silence a hundred and twenty-two sailors.\nShe’d sequestered them; now she was deciding if she’d kill them. How long\ncould you even feed so many imprisoned men without word getting out?\nHow long before one of them remembered Gavin had claimed to be Dazen,\nand traded that information in hope of gaining freedom?\n“So, back to my question,” she said. “What is your plan, and how do\nyou think you can get there from here?”\nHe was silent, but not even silence could hide all the truth from this\nwoman.\n“Because I have a plan,” she said, and there was nothing remotely\npleasant in her tone. “My plan is to find out your plan, and then to allow\nyou to achieve it, if you are indeed so capable.”\n“But,” he said tentatively.\n“But.” She smiled at him, big white teeth like tombstones in the sun. She\ngrabbed on to the bars of his cell, about to speak, then her thin lips twisted\nin distaste and she took her hands away from the slick bars. She rubbed her\nfingertips together, disgusted, and looked up. A servant was there with a\nkerchief instantly. She took it and waved the servant away. “Gavin Guile, I\nwant to know your plan. I want to know how you define victory so that\nwhen, against all odds, you achieve it, it tastes like water in the mouth of\ndrowning man.”\n“But that sounds like something bad.” As if puzzled. Patronizing.\nHer eyes flashed, but she rolled her shoulders and finished her drink\ninstead of striking him. “You’re many things, Gavin Guile, but you’re\nneither credulous nor stupid. You’ve got some plan.”\n“And now that you have threatened me at length, in what insane world\nwould I tell you about it?”\n“This one.”\n“Clearly you think so. The point is that you need to convince me of\nthat.”\n“If you don’t tell me, I kill you. Right now.” Her tone was flat and\ninsulted and more than ready to kill, and less than remorseful. It was the\nvoice of a woman who’d killed before, and attached no particular\nsignificance to the deed. He thought of a boat full of men who might die at\nher word. Could she get away with such a thing? In Rath? Unlikely. But it\nwouldn’t do those men or him any good after the fact to be proven right."

That isn’t very creative of you,” he said.\nShe didn’t even crack a smile. His charm was dust here. “Brutality oft\naccomplishes what creativity cannot.”\n“I see that—”\nShe said, “I don’t want to hear another word out of you, unless it’s—”\n“You really must—”\n“That counts as another word. And don’t you dare tell what I must or\nmust not do. I will not tolerate another interruption.”\nGavin stopped.\n“Test me on this. One word out of turn.” She leveled a flat gaze at the\nman who had made satraps and Colors tremble, and he saw that she hoped\nhe would test her.\nShe laughed as if she’d been joking. “Ha! You should have seen yourself\njust now, Gavin Guile!”\nHe smirked uncertainly.\n“In fact, perhaps you should see yourself!” She looked around in an\nunconvincing search. “But I see no mirrors here. Why, you know, I know a\ntorturer who claims that he can pluck out an eye with the sinews still\nattached, and that a man can be made to see his own face. Ought we try?”\nA snake turned over in Gavin’s guts, and he felt that fear he’d felt in the\nwar when he’d had to face drafters who’d broken the halo, who stared at\nhim with eyes full of desperation that told him they might do anything. He\nremembered a man holding a burning slow match in his hand, sparking and\nspitting, as he sat in the middle of camp on a barrel full of powder, quietly,\nabsently singing, while Dazen and four hundred men crowded into a little\ncave, hiding from his elder brother’s passing patrols. None of his men could\nleave without alerting Gavin’s troops and dooming them all, but if the\nmadman moved that slow match to the powder, most of them would\ncertainly die. Gavin—then Dazen—had talked his way out of that.\nCarefully, and with no magic.\nGiving her a moment to make sure she actually meant this to be a\nquestion, and that he now had leave to speak, Gavin said, “I’m sure I would\nbe quite a sight for a sore eye.”\nHer eyebrow twitched, but she didn’t smile.\n“By which I mean, no thank you,” he said.\n“So the question is simple, Gavin Guile, but I am not a simpleton to be\ntaken in by your breezy charm and a smile that once weakened hymens for\nten leagues around. Tell me less than the full truth, and you will die. Tell the\nfull truth, and I will do all I can to make your victory almost impossible, but\ntotally empty. What say you?”\nI say you’re fucking insane and I’m going to ram a sharpened spoon\nthrough the side of your neck.\n“So you want me to tell you my plan so you can make it nearly\nimpossible, but not quite impossible?”\n“And then I will do all I can to make it an empty victory once you"

It unnerved him as much as her flat, hating\ngaze.\n“Perhaps your time in the galley has dulled your wits,” she said. “Let’s\nsay your dream is to father a line of satraps and Prisms and Colors.

I’m waiting.”\n“How about you show me yours, and I’ll show you mine?” Gavin said.\n“I don’t even know why you hate me.” That was, of course, a lie.\n“Everything’s a competition with you, isn’t it?” she asked. Her tone was\nalmost sad, and Gavin got a premonition that this was a very, very bad\nthing. “It’s all about will, and Gavin Guile is will incarnate. Is that what you\nthink? Is that how you see the world? Even broken, in a cage, you think that\nif you act like the bars are nothing, they will be nothing. Perhaps that was\ntrue once. You’re not the Prism anymore, Guile. You’re a husk. You’re a\nbroken galley slave is all. Just another man, demanding my surrender. Do\nyou know what your weakness is, former Prism?”\n“Women. Especially glamorous women. A woman who knows how to\nnot just wear a ball gown, but really own it is rarer than hellstone. And fit\nwomen. And women with an ample bust. Or slender women. Let’s not\nforget intelligent women. You can’t dismiss the value of a wicked mind in\nthe bedchamber.” Or one woman who is all of that and more. Gavin’s heart\nached suddenly under a stupid grin mask.\n“Put your hands up on the bars,” Eirene said.\nGavin did.\n“Spread your fingers.”\nNot a good sign. But she was standing back far enough that he could\ncertainly snatch his own hand back before she could reach out and hurt him.\nHe did it.\n“Pick a number between one and ten.”\nDidn’t like where this was going. With his hands held up in front of his\nface… “One,” he said, as if picking that because he would always pick\nnumber one.\nShe started at the right. “One,” she said, pointing to his little finger on\nhis left hand. She smiled unpleasantly. “I’m going to give you a choice that\nI think will demonstrate to you your real weakness.”\n“I admit, when I have to count beyond ten, if my toes are in boots, I do\nhave trouble.”"

It was like she knew.\n“Would you prefer to have the word ‘FOOL’ tattooed across your face in\nas big of letters as we can fit, or would you prefer to lose your little finger?\nYour choice,” she said. She crossed her arms.\n“That’s a terrible test. It doesn’t even remotely show what you think it\nshows,” Gavin said.\nShe said, “You say one more word other than ‘finger’ or ‘tattoo’ and I’ll\nhave you suffer both.”\nShe was going to say he was being vain, if he chose to lose the finger.\nThat vanity was his weakness. But what army in the world would follow a\nman with ‘FOOL’ etched across his face? He had hurdles enough to\novercome with the loss of his drafting to try to lead. A constant humiliation\nwould make leadership impossible. There would be no covering such a\nthing. Gavin had seen people who’d tried to cover unfortunate tattoos. It\nwould make an even bigger joke out of him.\nHe looked down the hallway, where a pair of servants stood, looking\nthrough the open door, watching for any sign from Lady Malargos. He took\na deep, slow breath. With his cracked ribs, it hurt like hell. Which meant\nthis next was going to be ten times worse.\n“My name is Gavin Guile!” he roared, shouting toward the servants,\ntoward the open door. “And my father will give a fortune to whoever\nreports my presence here! My father is Andross Guile! Any who aid in this\ntorture will pay the price!”\nAs soon as he started shouting, the servants panicked. They didn’t\nimmediately see Eirene’s sign to slam the door, and he got almost all of it\nout before they did so.\nFor his part, Gavin sank to the floor, tears leaking from his eyes. He\ntried to breathe in tiny little gulps. Maybe not cracked ribs. Maybe fully\nbroken.\n“What the hell was that?” Eirene demanded.\n“That was me giving you the finger.”\nChapter 47\nTeia couldn’t stop looking at her bloody hands. Half under her breath, she\nsaid, “Wasn’t right.”\n“Huh?” Kip asked.\n“What we did. That wasn’t right,” she said. She looked up at him, and\nfelt shame cover her like a snowdrift blowing off Hellmount itself. She said,\n“I murdered a man.”\nThe safe house where they’d gathered wasn’t even a house. It had been a\nchicken coop built onto the side of a cooper’s shop. None of them knew\nwhen the Blackguard had acquired the place, but it had been walled off\nfrom the cooper’s, had a few tools propped up around the low front door,\nand was made to look like a shed. Inside, the ground had been excavated to\nmake the single room far bigger than looked possible from the outside. Half\na dozen bunk beds, three high, lined the walls.

Stores of food and weapons\nand clothing took up most of the rest of what little space there was.\n“You—we—killed a man,” Kip said.\n“Oh, what difference is there? He’s dead! I messed up!”\n“We’re warriors, Teia,” Kip said like she was being stupid. “That’s what\nall this is for.”\n“I know! I know,” she said. She looked around at the rest of their squad.\nShe shook her head. She was letting them down. She should just shut up.\n“Doesn’t matter. I’ll be fine. Can you throw me the fucking towel already,\nFerkudi?”\n“You’ll get it when I’m done, bitch,” Ferkudi said. He was usually good-\nnatured, but when he wasn’t, he was an ogre.\nKip moved faster than Teia would have believed he could. He grabbed\nFerkudi by the front of his tunic in both hands and lifted the young man off\nhis feet and slammed his back against the wall. “That’s my partner,” he\nsaid. “That’s your squadmate. I know you’re shaken up. But. Don’t.”\nFerkudi’s feet weren’t even touching the ground—and Ferkudi was one\nof the biggest boys in the squad. Holy shit. Kip was getting strong.\nKip released him. “Towel. Please.”\nFerkudi handed the towel over. Looked away. “Sorry,” he grumbled.\n“To her.”\n“Sorry, Teia,” he rumbled. “Didn’t mean to be such a flesh\nprotuberance.”\n“I’ll take it outta you in training,” Teia said. She hit him in the arm, not\ntoo gently. But she was glad he’d apologized. She liked Ferkudi, but that\nhad infuriated her, and she didn’t have it in her to take him down a peg\nherself. Not right now.\nKip handed her the towel. “You were saying?”\nShe took the towel angrily, which he didn’t deserve, and she knew it,\nand it made her angrier. “Get off it, Breaker. You’re not my father.” It\nwasn’t fair. She’d felt gratified that he’d come to her defense, but she was\nsuddenly just so angry, so close to tears.\n“No, but I’ve killed men. Spit it out.”\nTeia began wiping her hands off. Stared firmly down at the towel, her\nhands, the task. “What if… what if they have a point? The Blood Robes, I\nmean.”\n“To hell with them,” Winsen said. “Kill ’em all. Let Orholam sort ’em.”\nTeia had heard similar statements before, but they’d been boasts.\nChildishness. With Winsen, it didn’t seem like a put-on.\n“No,” Kip said. “Teia… Of course they have a point.”\n“What are you saying?” Cruxer asked, speaking up for the first time.\nHe’d been content to let his squad work through things themselves, but Teia\ncould tell he didn’t want the conversation to veer into heresy.\n“No one’s saying the Chromeria is perfect, Teia.

Lawlessness has a price, too.\nI grew up in Tyrea, the closest thing to the kind of lawless paradise that the\nBlood Robes hold forth. Tyrea is a lot of things, but paradise?” Kip gave a\nderisive snort.\n“Think about the Blackguard. Think about its leadership. Commander\nIronfist may be the best man any of us know. Watch Captain Blademan, a\ngood, good man. Not very imaginative—”\n“Breaker, you can’t—” Cruxer began, but Kip ran right over him.\n“Of course I can!” Kip said. “We’re Blackguards! We’re not afraid of\nthe truth! Remember? Not very imaginative, but dutiful, hardworking, loyal\nto a fault. An excellent second-tier leader. We lost Watch Captain White\nOak, obviously, but she was totally capable, too. Watch Captain Tempus?\nBookish but clever, better in charge than in a charge, but competent. Watch\nCaptain Beryl? She’s a little too friendly for an officer, but good. Blunt?\nNot quite friendly enough, but again, good. Then I look at the squads above\nus, and for the most part, I admire them. I look at us, and we’re the best I\ncan think of. Am I right, Captain?”\n“It’s why I gave up my promotion,” Cruxer said quietly. “Half of it,\nanyway.” Teia and the squad knew the other half. It was the same as theirs.\nLightbringer.\n“What’s your point?” Teia asked Kip.\nKip said, “If Cruxer hadn’t been willing to risk throwing away his own\ncareer, Aram would be in this squad right now. He was a rat, and despite all\nour good leaders, he was this close to getting in. Maybe he would have been\ndiscovered before he made full Blackguard, but with how undermanned we\nare, I doubt it. He probably would have taken final vows within a year’s\ntime. And that’s with the Blackguards doing almost everything right. Even\nwith us, let’s be honest. Some of those who have made it in aren’t squeaky\nclean. Some of us—even us inductees—have had blackmail or bribes tried\non us. Why? Because we’re powerful and we’re going to be more powerful\nsoon; because we have what others want. Some of us stumble, and some of\nus are downright rotten—despite every advantage, right? I mean, we’re\nrespected, we’re paid well, we have all we need, we have extra attention\npaid to us, we have the best the Chromeria can give us—and we still have\nweakness and venality and betrayers among us.”\n“It’s not that bad,” Ferkudi said.\n“Yes it is,” Kip said. “You just don’t want to face it yet.”\n“No one’s tried to bribe or blackmail me,” Ferkudi said.\n“Ferk,” Kip said, exasperated. “It’s because they think you’re too dumb"

They’re wrong on the first count.”\nFerkudi blinked like a dog whose nose had been swatted.\nBut Kip went right on. “But that’s not the point. If a group with the\nsmall size, the wealth, the good leadership, and all the advantages of the\nBlackguard can have its members go bad, how could we possibly expect a\ngroup that’s so much larger, and more powerful, and spread out over all the\nsatrapies—with poor leadership in some areas—to be more virtuous than\nwe are?”\n“You mean the Chromeria,” Teia said.\n“I do.”\n“I expect it because they made vows before Orholam,” Big Leo said,\nspeaking up for the first time. “Because they are Orholam’s hands on earth.\nThey shouldn’t fail that kind of a holy trust.”\n“No,” Kip said. “They shouldn’t. Men and women should never violate\ntheir oaths.”\n“But they do,” Ferkudi said. Bless him, always stating the obvious. But\nthen, sometimes the obvious benefited from being dragged out into the full\nglare of the light.\n“The Blood Robes are liars leading naïfs,” Kip said. “They don’t want to\nlive up to the oaths they took that when they became a danger, they’d end\nthemselves. They’re afraid and unfaithful, so they say their vows don’t\ncount. They want to lord their power over others, so they say the Chromeria\nunfairly lords its power over them. The Chromeria says that every man is\nequal in Orholam’s sight, that our powers and privileges make us the greater\nslaves of our communities. I don’t admire Magister Kadah, but she’s right\nabout that much. On the other hand, the Color Prince says drafters are\nabove other men by nature—and at the same time talks about abolishing\nslavery. Tell me, if drafters are above other men by nature, why would you\nabolish slavery?”\nSilence reigned for a few long moments.\n“Because he needed an army,” Cruxer said. “And coming from Tyrea, he\nhad to pass the mines at Laurion and the tens of thousands of slaves there.”\n“To divide your enemy,” Daelos said. “Armies afraid of what their own\nslaves will do when they’re gone won’t go far from home.”\n“Understand that everything the Color Prince does, he does for power,\nand you’ll understand everything he does,” Kip said.\n“It can’t be that simple, can it?” Teia said. “If so, how come you see it,\nand no one else does?”\n“Because I’m a bad person, so I understand how bad people think.”\nWhat the hell did he mean by that? Was he fishing for compliments?\nBut Kip was still speaking. “Don’t judge a man by what he says his\nideals are, judge him by what he does. Look at what the Color Prince has\ndone.

But he said, wife, rash, bed, and whore,”\nWinsen said.\nGoss said, “A lesson he had to learn the hard way, no doubt.”\nFerkudi laughed with them. Then he said, “I don’t get it.”\n“It’s one of those things, Ferk,” Goss said.\n“Where if you explain it, it doesn’t work?” Ferkudi asked. He was\nfamiliar with those. “Flesh protuberance!”\nWorst swear ever. Second worst, maybe. For a while he’d used\n‘proboscis.’\n“You think it’s that simple, Breaker?” Teia asked, ignoring the boys.\n“In the False Prism’s War, Gavin’s generals ordered the burning of\nGarriston. It was stupid. It was wrong. Horrific. The fires spread, and they\nkilled scores of thousands. It wasn’t strategy; it was vengeance for what\nhappened in Ru, but far worse. But Gavin had to win the war. And after he\nwon, he couldn’t punish those who did it, though I’m sure he wanted to.\nThey said—and maybe they even believed—that what they had done was\nnecessary to win. So he gave them medals and showed them the door. Not\none of those involved in burning Garriston is here on the Jaspers anymore.\nYou think that’s a coincidence? Those men are no longer in any position\nwhere they could do something like that again. Was what Gavin did once\nthe deed had been done good? No. But it was the best thing possible.”\n“And this?” Teia asked, showing her still-bloodied hands and the bloody\nrag that wouldn’t get the stains out completely. “This is the best thing?”\nKip stared her hard in the eye. He took the towel in his own clean hands\nand smeared blood first on one palm and then on the other. “Not the best\nthing, Teia. The best thing possible? A thousand times yes.”\nAnd staring into his eyes, she believed him. It was a damned thing, war,\nbut she wasn’t damned for fighting it. It shifted her burden only a little—not\nmuch, but enough.\nTwenty minutes later, after the squad had cleaned up, after Cruxer had\ndebriefed each of them in turn, they formed up at the door of the safe house\nto go back to the Chromeria together and report. It was obviously a duty\nCruxer wasn’t relishing.\n“Teia,” Cruxer said. “Up front.”\n“Huh?”\n“You’re my number two now. First sergeant.”\nTeia looked at Ferkudi, whom she was displacing. He didn’t look angry.\n“The promotion was my idea, Teia,” he said. “We froze up out there. I froze\nup. You deserve it.”\nDeserve it? She’d gone crazy out there.

When it’s time to listen to him, we listen. The rest of the\ntime, he listens to us. Fair, Breaker?”\nKip looked bereaved, but resolute. “So it begins?” he asked Cruxer\nquietly.\nTeia had no idea what they were talking about. “It began a long time\nago, Breaker,” Cruxer said. “The only question is if you fight fate or try to\nsteer it.”\n“Fate?” Kip asked. “You’re the one who gave me the name Breaker in\nthe first place.”\n“Oops,” Cruxer said. A wry grin.\n“Fair enough, Captain. I’ll take the half-step to the outside. I wanted this\nmore than anything, though. You know that, right?”\n“I know what it is to want… the impossible.” His mouth twisted, and\nTeia knew he was thinking of Lucia.\nKip said, “You’re the best of us, Cruxer. In every way. Don’t you dare\ndie, you understand?”\n“Meh, I’m invincible,” Cruxer said. “Now let’s get back, double time.\nLet’s see if we can work some more of this off.” He poked Kip in the belly,\nand they both grinned.\nBoys. How Teia loved them both.\nChapter 48\nWeeks later, they stood again in their ranks in front of Trainer Fisk. He cast\na baleful eye around the great yard beneath the Chromeria. Everywhere,\nBlackguards were training men and women who were not Blackguards. He\nstared at one arc of the great circle with particular, undisguised hatred,\nthough.\nThe rumored Lightguard was now a reality. The nunks joined him in his\nspite. Established with one stroke of the new promachos’s pen, the\nLightguard was Andross Guile’s own personal army, established to defend\nthe Jaspers, so he said, and answering only to him.\nThe Blackguards saw what he was doing, even if it seemed no one else\nin power did. The Lightguard was comprised of mercenaries, ruffians,\nveterans from the old war, and any others who were willing to do whatever\nAndross Guile wanted in return for coin and his protection from prosecution\nor vengeance for any crime they might have committed. They were led\nprimarily by washed-out Blackguards and the sons of poor nobles who\nwanted to throw themselves on Andross Guile’s mercy.\nThey had been given tailed white jackets with big brass buttons and\nmedals for trifles. Worse, they were given some of the Blackguard’s\nprerogatives: allowed to walk through the Chromeria armed, for one.\nAnd they were being taught—by the promachos’s incontrovertible order\n—by a Blackguard. It was like being forced to gut yourself with a rusty\nknife.\n“Today, Specials,” Trainer Fisk said, spitting in the direction of the\nLightguards, but then turning away."

It was like being forced to gut yourself with a rusty\nknife.\n“Today, Specials,” Trainer Fisk said, spitting in the direction of the\nLightguards, but then turning away.\nAlmost all of their training was special assignments now, and there was\nlittle pretense that it was only training. The swearing in to full Blackguard\nstatus of the best inductees had been halted. Commander Ironfist had seen\nthat once sworn, his people were sent to duties like training Lightguards, so\nhe held on to them.\nOther Blackguards were being sent on other missions: some of them\nsearching for Gavin, others disappearing for days or weeks, and coming\nback, sworn to silence about what they’d been doing. Word got out, at least\nin Blackguard circles, though. They were looking for bane. They said there\nmight be nexuses of each of the seven colors out there somewhere. Which,\nto Kip’s ears, sounded like more gods to fight.\nSome of them reported strange sights, odd phenomena they’d\nencountered. One brought back a small lizard called a sand dragon from\nAtash. The nunks thought it was the least exciting dragon ever. It didn’t\nbreathe fire or anything interesting, but when they killed it, they were able\nto set it on fire without any other fuel, and it burned for three days.\nSomehow the things incorporated red luxin into their bodies, much like\natasifusta trees used to do. This was the first one that had been seen in many\nyears.\nIn Ruthgar, there were stories of the grasslands—usually dormant and\nbrown this late in the year—growing green in great nine-pointed stars. It\nmight have been the work of rogue green drafters fertilizing the plains to\nmake a statement for the Color Prince, but two of the Blackguards had seen\none. They believed what they had seen was far too big to be the work of\neven three or four green drafters working together.\nIn Paria, a team had found a town where half the wells were full of\norange luxin. The village elders swore that there were no orange drafters\nnearby. And in a week, the luxin simply disappeared.\nThere were wilder rumors, too, of firestorms in Tyrea, where instead of\nlightning, great streaks of fire splashed down with the rain and hail and\nsnow. Sinkholes in Abornea. Boiling seas off Pericol. Animals acting\nstrangely, and even plants seeming to act with intent. It was impossible to\nfilter the truth from the nonsense and, quickly, impossible to get some of the\nbooks from the restricted libraries that had been sitting right under the\nsquad’s nose. Scholars appointed by Andross himself came in, grabbed a\nbunch of books and scrolls, and left without a word.\nAnd all the time, the war was being fought. The enemy was advancing.\nOthers were fighting in their place, far away.\nWith them all formed up, Trainer Fisk said, “Today your assignment,\nevery squad, is to go to the docks on East Bay. The Lists are being read.\nGo.”\nHe stopped.\n“And what, sir?” an Archer named Kerea asked. “What are we to do?”\n“You listen. Was there something unclear about your orders?

But he didn’t answer. Kip took his lead and\ndidn’t answer either. Knowing what a lesson was beforehand didn’t mean\nyou had to blunt its impact on those who didn’t.\n“Let’s take it at a jog,” Cruxer said.\nThey jogged through the enclosed bridge as the sunrise shone brilliance\non them. Kip had two thoughts: first, that he was no longer baffled at the\nwonders of magic of these islands. Running through a luxin tube suspended\nat the level of the waves had somehow become normal to him. The\nawkward bumpkin was gone. He wasn’t sure that was all good. How insular\nthe Jasperites became, every day seeing magic the likes of which a Tyrean\norchardist would never see in his life, every day rubbing shoulders with\nwomen and men who harnessed Orholam’s breath itself. All the world\nturned around the Jaspers, but the Jaspers were not all the world. Second, he\nrealized there was now no sign at all of the sea demon attack that had nearly\ndemolished this bridge. The sea demon itself hadn’t been seen since the\nFeast of Light and Darkness, nor the black whale. The mess had been\ncleared, the dead taken away—and none of them were people Kip had\nknown, or known by people Kip knew. It was like it hadn’t happened.\nThis is what it is to live in the cosmos that is the Jaspers. The world\nchanges here, but here there is not one world, there are many, and we only\nsee the others when they tread upon our toes.\nThey made it to the docks and slowed as they pushed through the press\nof bodies. Cruxer acted as a wedge, and Big Leo went second, clearing a\npath for the rest of them. In their inductees’ grays, no one resisted them.\nThere was a tall carven pedestal just wide enough for a crier to stand on,\nand a man was clambering up the ladder to stand there. He reached into a\npouch he wore and pulled out a scroll. He cracked the seal, and the crowd\nquieted, then he allowed the scroll to unfurl.\nMurmurs shot through the crowd as they saw the scroll unroll past his\nfeet. But they quieted again as the man began reading, his voice a clear,\ncutting tenor that carried easily over the murmurs and the sounds of sailors\nunloading their ships, wagons creaking past on old wheels. “This is the list\nof those dead or missing and believed to be dead who hail from Big Jasper\nor the Chromeria, from the end of the skirmish at Ruic Neck until the end of\nthe Battle of Ox Ford. This list is complete and truthful to the best of my\nknowledge, so swears Lord Commander of the Unified Armies of the\nSatrapies, Caul Azmith.”\nAnd then he began reading names. Noblewomen first, then noblemen.\nScant few though there were of either. Then female drafters, then male\ndrafters. As slaves—despite being drafters—the Blackguards came next,\nbarely before the commoners."

Which\nof course it was.\n“Norl Jumber, Orholam damn you. Jumber,” Big Leo said under his\nbreath.\nIt was Ben-hadad, the smart one, who said the dumbest thing. “They\ncould just be missing, right? I mean, this doesn’t mean they’re dead. Not all\nof them. It’s a list of the dead and missing. Right?”\nCruxer didn’t even turn his head. “There’s a hope that empowers, and a\nhope that enfeebles. Don’t confuse them.”\nSomeone down the line choked, strangling a sob. Ferkudi? Kip\nwondered why he wasn’t feeling anything at all, except awkward that he\nwasn’t feeling what he was supposed to feel. What was wrong with him?\nWhat if someone else in the squad looked at him and could tell that while\nthey stood and grieved, he was just standing?\nHe remembered Elessia. She was small, crooked grin, crooked teeth,\nlight-skinned for a Blackguard, got duty with the White a lot. Laya: she was\na red, older. Kip could remember her weeping on the barges as they came\nback from Garriston. Oh, that was it. She’d had to kill her partner, who’d\nbroken the halo in the middle of the battle. Tugertent was a literal archer,\nand the best in the Blackguard at that. People swore they’d seen her hit\ntargets around corners, which she’d never denied. Ahhanen Kip could only\nremember in that he always looked like he’d just drunk wine gone to\nvinegar. His partner was Djur, who had a trick of juggling two pistols and\nknife in dizzying patterns to amuse his comrades. Liked to gamble, and was\nbad at it, from what Kip had heard. Norl Jumber was small and eager, none\ntoo bright, but always infectiously happy. Pan Harl had been an inductee,\nlike Kip and his squad. He shouldn’t even have been there.\nThey couldn’t just be gone. Not just like that. A name read aloud in a\nsquare, and that was it? What had happened to them? Had they died\nheroically, or were they merely in the wrong place and their card had been\npulled?\nSomeone started keening, not ten paces away. She threw herself\nforward, as if to attack the crier, and several women grabbed her, held her\nback. Kip realized he’d lost some time. The crier had been reading name\nupon name, by satrapy and lord of allegiance. There had to be over a\nthousand names on his list.\nA thousand names, and he was only reading the dead who hailed from\nthe Jaspers. Someone said that the Ruthgari armies had taken the most"

Someone said that the Ruthgari armies had taken the most\ngrievous losses by far.\nOrholam have mercy, how many people had died?\nThe squads stood at attention for fifteen minutes as the names were read.\nName after name after name. As each lord’s dead was read, some would sob\nor shriek or collapse, while others tried not to let too much relief show. But\nas the list continued relentlessly, the balance shifted. The mood darkened.\nThe brightly shining sun glistened in mockery, as if Orholam didn’t see.\nIn some distant corner, a fight had broken out among the bereaved.\nFurious, flailing against the truth, punishing the innocent. The bitter\naggrieved and the guiltily relieved, fighting.\nWhen the crier finished, there was only silence and sobs, the broken\nbeing led away by stunned friends.\nKip wanted to shout at them. You thought this was a game?! When\nTyreans were dying it was exciting, but now, now it’s serious?! He hated\nthem for a moment, but the moment passed, and he saw their sorrow and\nwas moved.\nThat they have learned to weep at war is no victory. That they know loss\nis no gain.\nThen the crier announced where the names of each satrapy’s dead would\nbe posted around the plaza, and got down from his pedestal. There was no\nother word. No update.\nThey hadn’t announced the battle as a victory, or even as holding off the\nenemy. That lack, as much as the number of names read did, told Kip there\nhad been only crushing defeat.\n“This is why,” Cruxer said. The squad looked at him. “This is why we\nhave to be the best.”\nChapter 49\nTeia was following Murder Sharp again, to a different neighborhood. The\nwinter night was cold, but at least this time there was no fog. It didn’t make\nher feel much better.\n“So, this lightsplitter thing…” Teia said. That was what tonight was\nabout, and Teia was worrying at the knotted rope of anxieties in her gut.\n“Was that a question?”\n“I don’t get it. I mean, I get it. A Prism doesn’t need spectacles. Handy\nfor him, I’m sure, but I’m a monochrome and paryl doesn’t require\nspectacles. So even if I were a lightsplitter, that would be like… what? Like\nbeing the best juggler in the satrapies, only I don’t have any arms?”\n“Exactly like that.”\n“Really?”\n“No.”\nThey arrived at a dark-windowed home in Weasel Rock, were handed\ntheir hooded robes and ushered in to darkness.\n“Strip naked.” The voice was gruff, deliberately altered, the figure\nhooded, a splotch of black against the darkness.\nThe room was almost pitch black, a tiny thread of light let in under the\ndoor, and pants-wettingly scary, but Teia wasn’t anyone’s slave, not\nanymore. Not Aglaia Crassos’s, not Kip’s, not Andross Guile’s, and\ncertainly not Fear’s.\n“Well, that answers one question,” Teia said to the heavily cloaked"

That knot in her guts wasn’t fear, it was apprehension, anxiety,\nanimus, bitterness, bile, belligerence, contempt, contumely… cravenness.\nFuck.\nNo, fuck him.\n“Strip.” Definitely male, definitely irritated, definitely not very good at\ndisguising his voice when vexed. A bit of a haze smoker, if she didn’t miss\nher guess, from the rough edges on that voice.\n“That’s not going to happen,” she said. Fucking amateurs. She cursed\nmentally when she was trying to convince herself of her own toughness.\nHer knees weren’t trembling from fear. It was fucking cold in this fucking\nplace.\nDamn. Doing it double time. Much more of this, and my underwear is\ngoing to need an extra washing.\n“Your disobedience has been noted. I have whores to humiliate for my\npleasure. This is no test of your virtue. Nor indeed, of your will. This is a\ntest of lightsplitting.”\nA part of her thrilled with sudden hope, but she hid it. “And I need to be\nass-naked to do it?”\n“It works best if—”\n“So no.”\n“When beginning—”\n“You want me naked for one of two reasons. Either to humiliate me and\nmake me feel vulnerable, or for the gratification of your sick desires. Go to\nhell.”\n“Oh, Teia.” Low and amused, somehow more dangerous when he said\n“Teia.” Oh hell. “Sick desires? To see a comely young woman naked? In\nwhat world is that a sick desire? True, your curves are late in coming, but\nI’ve noticed a change even in the last few—”\n“Fuck you!” She trembled. He’d been watching? For months?\nOrholam’s poxy gemsack! How dare he comment on—fuck! She was not\ngoing to be extra aware of her body because of one word from this asshole.\nShe looked around the dark room. Nondescript, nothing to differentiate\nit from any of a thousand other rooms in a thousand other houses in the bad\nneighborhoods of Big Jasper. What was she playing at? Why was she here?\nWho did she think she was, playing these games, with these people?\nShe’d been at the reading of the Lists. She knew the stakes. There might\nhave been a time when being a Blackguard inductee would have protected\nher, when fear of what the Blackguard would do to avenge her if she were\nharmed would have kept her safe anywhere in the world.\nThat was before the war. Now, she knew, even here on Big Jasper she\nwasn’t safe.\nThe worst of it was the secrecy. Not being able to tell her squad, not\nbeing able to tell Kip? It tore her up, but it was the only safe way. For them.\n“This isn’t a debate. You’ll serve or you’ll die. It would be a terrible\nwaste to lose you at this point, but if you’re disobedient now, how would\nwe ever trust you with more power?”\n“You’re an asshole,” Teia said. “I’ll wear my underthings.”"

It was pitch black in here anyway, right?\n“Put this on,” he said, voice gruff again.\nWith some difficulty, she widened her eyes to sub-red and saw that the\nhooded figure wasn’t extending the bundle exactly to her. She’d taken a step\nto the side as she’d stripped, and he hadn’t noticed. He wasn’t a sub-red\ndrafter, then. Or paryl. She tucked the information away. Someday she’d\nneed it. Maybe. It made her feel less like a victim to do something,\nregardless. She took the bundle.\nA sack, no, another weasel-bear mask, this one bedecked with patches\nand straps.\nThe man said, “The test requires that you not use your eyes at all.\nEveryone cheats. It’s impossible not to.”\nIt’s impossible not to? Said like someone who’d taken the test and\nfailed, perhaps?\nTeia pulled on the hood. She didn’t have any idea if she’d put it on the\nright way, where the straps went. Orholam, it was hot and stuffy and she\ncouldn’t breathe right in—\nSomeone touched her naked shoulder.\nShe jumped, but it wasn’t the startled little-girl response it would have\nbeen even a year ago. She jumped, one foot shifting back, head ducking the\nblow that must be coming, center of mass dropping until that back foot gave\nher a base, and one fist snapping forward with the speed and force of all her\nemotional and muscular tension together.\nHer fist sank into a stomach. In Blackguard training, one of the less fun\ndrills involved taking hits in the stomach. You’d stand with a partner and\ntrade blows. There were different strategies depending on how big you\nwere. Clench and move back just as the punch hit you so you didn’t take the\nfull force, or if you were bigger and rock-hard, clench and move into the\npunch so it hit you before it was in the golden zone. But always, always,\nyou clenched your muscles hard. This stomach wasn’t fat, but it wasn’t\nclenched either: it was soft, muscles loose, and her fist sank into it easily.\nThere was a moment of total silence as Teia realized what she’d just\ndone. The scuff of a shoe as the man took a step back, and then the sound of\nhim collapsing on the ground. A moment later, there was a huge gasping\nbreath as he got his wind back.\nTeia froze. Chuckles sounded around the room. Five, six people?\n“Faces out!” the man snapped. “You’re not to see her!”\nTeia heard the man she’d hit—the same man who’d been tormenting\nher?—stand up.\n“No!” a second voice said. Master Sharp? “We wanted a fighter. We got\none. Strike her and I’ll strike you.”"

Strike her and I’ll strike you.”\nThe first man stood close to Teia, his breath on her mask. She stood still,\nvery still, not giving him any more excuse than she already had—and noted\nhow tall he was, to tuck away in her head.\n“My apologies,” she said, putting real apology into her tone and\nspeaking loudly and clearly so she could be heard through the hood.\n“To the test,” he said. “Let’s not take all night.”\n“I’ll be adjusting your hood,” the man said. “Do that again, and I’ll…”\nHe barely disguised his voice this time. Nobleman’s voice. Ruthgari accent.\nYounger. Got you, Teia thought.\nHe turned the hood so that two thick pads were over her eyes and a hole\nwas over her mouth. Thank Orholam, she could breathe! Then he tightened\nthe straps behind her head and under her chin. There were many layers of\ncloth and leather between her closed eyes and the outside world. He stepped\naway from her.\nThen something changed; Teia couldn’t even tell what.\nThe commander spoke: “To split light is to touch the raw stuff of\ncreation and to bend it to your will. To draft light is to participate in the\ndivine, but to manipulate light itself in its pure form is to be divine.\nAdrasteia, we seek the spark of divinity within you. We begin easily. This\ntest will determine if you can see colors with your skin.”\n“Pardon?” It just sort of slipped out. It sounded girly and scared, which\nwas exactly how Teia felt, dammit.\n“You’ll hear a chime, and you’ll have a few seconds to say a color. We’ll\ncontinue the test long enough to make sure you’re not getting them right by\nguessing. If you fail, you won’t leave here.”\n“Pardon?” Again, but worse.\n“If you fail, you’re useless to us, and know too much. So do your best.”\n“Red!” she said.\n“Easy. We haven’t started the test yet. Calm down.”\n“No! I’m color-blind red-green. You must know that! I can’t possibly—”\n“Then guess well.”\nThere was no way. They wanted to kill her. She should take the mask off\nand take her chances.\nBut then she had a moment of doubt. At the Threshing in the Chromeria\nwhere every discipula was tested to see what colors she could draft, the\ndiscipulae were told things to frighten them beforehand—even during. Fear\nmade their pupils dilate. Could this be the same? Were they lying? Surely\nTeia could still be of use to them even if she weren’t a lightsplitter, right?\nBut dilating the eyes wouldn’t help her in a test where her eyes were\ncovered, and though she might be of use, there was no telling if they\nthought she would be of enough use to counterbalance the danger she posed\nfor them. Orholam have mercy.\nOrholam, I’m sorry for talking about your gemsack.

Not helpful.\nPut it out of your head, T. Vengeance later. Store it up, hold it back,\nbuckle down, take care of the now first. Feel first.\nShe tried to drop all her awareness into her body. The room was cool,\nand gooseflesh covered her from toes to nose. Her legs were clamped\ntogether so tight she could have cracked a walnut between her knees, as\nmuch for warmth as for modesty.\nModesty’s a distraction right now, T. Battlefield rules. Feel your skin.\nYou’re a survivor.\nThe chime rang again.\n“Color?” a voice asked. It could only be Murder Sharp.\nThose bastards had wanted to see her stripped, right? What better for\nthat than full light? “White,” Teia said with a conviction she didn’t feel.\nA silence.\n“Correct,” he said. “A good guess, I think. We’ll proceed.”\nThe chime rang.\nNine hells!

Eight if you counted white.\n“Blue.”\nA brief silence. “Very good.”\nShe got it right? What the hell?\nA chime.\nDammit! These assholes! How many times could she get lucky? Of\ncourse, if they only tested all the colors once, her chances should get better\nevery time. One in eight, one in seven, one in six, one in five. Right?\nStop thinking and feel, T!\nNothing. She felt nothing.\nDing!\n“Yellow?” she said.\n“Correct.” Murder Sharp didn’t sound pleased.\nDing.\nOh, come on. How long could her luck hold?

What was\nshe doing? Flailing blindly? She had to think about this, put herself outside\nthe situation. There was no reason they had to exhaust all the colors before\nthey repeated new ones, was there? Surely they would understand that it\nmade guessing easier.

It turned out that generations of Whites had\ncreated or confiscated certain items that they didn’t share with anyone. But\nshe’d never had to use this one.\nShe fingered the spiky choker in her lap, concealed behind a heavy\nmanuscript on Atashian royalty in the previous century that someone had\nleft in a pile. It was a forbidden magic, but in a very limited way that had\nbeen tested for safety by every White for a hundred years at least. You had\nto wear it tight enough for two little spikes to reach blood, then—if you\nwere a drafter, of course—your own magic empowered the choker to alter\nyour voice lower or higher.\nAll the best things I learn, I can’t tell anyone.\nShe twisted the big ruby ring on her finger. Sometimes it felt like the\nonly thing in her life that averred that her marriage was real. But even\nlooking at it was too painful.\nMaybe it’s time to come to grips with the possibility that he’s dead.\nThe hot-cold feeling that shot through her was so strong it took her\nbreath. She blinked, slamming the lid down hard. None of that. None of\nthat. Kip said he was alive.\nKip wants him to be alive. There hasn’t been so much as a whisper. Of\nthe Prism. You think drunk sailors coming in to ports are going to keep such\na thing quiet? This quiet?\nI’ve work to do.\nKarris stood up abruptly and headed to the lift. She took it down two\nfloors, then snapped her fingers as if she’d forgotten something, and went\nup five floors. Of course, if she were being followed by a rotating team it\nwas a worthless gesture—but one can’t plan for everything.\nDon’t overestimate your enemies’ capabilities, the White had told her.\nAssume they’re as prone to mistakes as our people are. Every time Karris\ndelegated a task, she had fresh appreciation for the second half of that\nstatement. Like when a maid had dropped a cipher out of her basket of\nlaundry onto the floor. It had turned up—with the seal apparently unbroken\n—in the found items basket on the main floor.\nGiven the sensitivity of the thing, though, the cipher had to be\nabandoned, and every spy or spy handler in the network contacted\npersonally to be given the new one. And of course, Karris now had to\nremember that particular maid was either inept, unlucky, or suborned. The\nsheer amount of information Karris had to keep in her mind was ludicrous\n—and it was all far too sensitive to write down.\nTwo meetings this afternoon, and then one this evening with her most\nimportant handler: her hairdresser. His job not only gave him a perfect\nexcuse to meet with Karris for long periods of time; it gave him cover to\ndebrief the often nobly born spies he handled at length and put him directly\nin the gossip circuit. The sums the man demanded, however, were mind-\nboggling. All of his tastes were expensive. Sometimes Karris still had\ntrouble with that.\nI’m too cheap for this work.

Is that more gray hair coming in? Black, this time, I think.\nEasy meeting first today. A new contact, who couldn’t be allowed to\nknow that Karris was Karris: the slave turned Blackguard Teia. Karris had\ntrained some with Teia. She liked the girl, and saw her as a younger version\nof herself—albeit one who was a slave and hadn’t made all the mistakes\nKarris had made.\nYes, other than that—and the color-blindness and her paryl drafting and\nthat she didn’t start a war that devastated the Seven Satrapies—we could be\ntwins.\nStill, she liked the girl. But Teia was sixteen years old. Too young for the\nburdens they’d already put on her shoulders. Karris knew what that was\nlike. Too young to be trusted with more than they had to trust her with. Teia\nwas working with people who wouldn’t hesitate to torture her to get the\nidentity of her handler out of her. Best she didn’t know, even if Karris\nlonged to mentor the girl.\nAnd what’s that about? Am I feeling maternal?\nOr is it lonely?\nShe ducked into the empty apartment she kept on this floor for this\npurpose. Locked the door behind herself. The room was divided by heavy\ncurtains so she could question and debrief her spies without being seen. The\ncurtains hid chairs so Karris at least could be comfortable, and slits for her\nto look through. Precautions, precautions, and all of them for naught if the\nwrong person came walking down the hall at the wrong time.\nSpeaking of precautions, as Karris took up her place, she picked up the\nmail cowl and aventail and pulled it on, draping it over her head and chest\nand hooking the cowl shut so only her eyes were exposed. Ridiculous, but\nTeia was a smart girl, curious. She wouldn’t be able to help but look for her\nhandler’s identity with paryl. It was a little unnerving that the girl could see\nthrough cloth.\nNot as unnerving as her other abilities, Karris supposed.\nA quick triple knock, and then the door opened just as Karris finished\nputting on the choker.\n“Come in, sit, that side. No drafting,” she said, her voice lowered to an\nodd tenor.\nTeia’s body was tight as lute string, ready to attack. The heightened\nawareness was a good response to fear for a Blackguard, but tightness made\nyour body slow. “I was told to report?” It was actually her code phrase.\nGood, the girl could follow instructions, even when afraid.\n“And report you shall, little flower.” That was the answer phrase. “Now\nsit.”\n“I hate flowers,” Teia said. “Did you know that? My other handler did.\nAnd what’s going on, anyway? I mean, I understand that the White can’t\nmeet with me personally, but two handlers in a couple months?”\nKarris’s breath caught. There were other handlers?\nFor a moment, she was glad of the mail cowl covering her face.\n“You know, I’m sure you have good reasons for hiding your identity"

If she had,\nshe’d have seen the mail. “But there are dangers to hiding who you are from\nme, too. If someone found our code phrases, they could replace you, and I’d\nnever know.”\n“You’re infiltrating a group that would happily torture you to find out\nmy identity. Do you want the burden of keeping that secret?”\n“I can handle it,” Teia said.\nAh, the bravado of youth. Karris missed it, sometimes. It was a good\nattribute in a Blackguard, believing nothing was impossible for you. But it\nwas also why Blackguards had officers, and why those officers answered\nultimately to those who were not Blackguards.\n“In time, perhaps,” Karris said. “You are already carrying so many\nburdens, and so admirably. Speaking of which, tell me the latest.” Karris\nhad received a brief, coded report of Teia’s assignments—all written on\nflash paper, with luxin igniters woven in, either to burn when tampered with\nor when she’d finished reading them. The report, like others, had simply\nappeared on her desk in her chambers.\nThrough the slits in the curtain, she saw Teia hunch forward in her seat,\npropping elbows on knees. “The Order tested me. I don’t even really know\nhow. They say I’m a lightsplitter. I mean, I passed. They said they would\nhave killed me if I hadn’t.”\n“Tell me everything.”\nTeia told her everything, and Karris did her best—using the mnemonic\ntricks the White had taught her—to memorize every word. Karris thought\nshe could see the outlines of how the lightsplitter test must have worked,\nand was surprised that Teia didn’t. Then again, Teia’s mind had been\noccupied by other things, not least being forced to strip almost naked in\nfront of terrifying, masked, leering assholes.\nWhen she thought of it that way, Karris was surprised Teia had done as\nwell as she had. If she were honest with herself, Karris didn’t know if she\nwould have done as well herself.\n“Did you know your last handler’s identity?” Karris asked.\n“I already told you I did.”\n“Who was it, then?”\nTeia’s head cocked. “You don’t know?”\n“Do you have any reason not to tell me?”\n“Pardon me if it seems strange that you wouldn’t know. If you don’t\nknow, maybe I shouldn’t—”\n“Your place is to obey orders,” Karris snapped. “You’re under my\ncommand now.”\n“Spoken like someone who’s served in an army,” Teia said. She\nobviously couldn’t help but try to figure out who Karris was. “But things in\nthis field are a little less clear.”\nDammit, girl. I hope we don’t get you killed. You’re a natural at this.\nAnd Karris couldn’t let someone she was handling think she was inept."

You’re a natural at this.\nAnd Karris couldn’t let someone she was handling think she was inept.\nIf your agent doesn’t trust you, and you have to give them an order that\ndoesn’t make sense with their limited perspective, they might not obey it.\n“Feel free to speculate on my identity, but realize that the closer you get\nto the truth, the more likely you are to get me killed. There’s no benefit to\n—”\n“I already told you the benefit.”\n“This is not an argument,” Karris said sharply.\nEven as she said it, she could remember her dearly departed father\nsaying those very words to her when she was a girl. Clearly, it is an\nargument, young Karris had snapped back. All her defiances had been petty,\nback then.\nTeia’s chin floated up. “I am not a slave,” she said.\n“No one is saying—”\n“But I was one. And let me tell you, slaves know how to obey an order\nwithout actually accomplishing anything. People like you think that slaves\nare stupid. Slaves are smart enough to use that belief against their masters.\n‘So sorry I did what you said, and not what you meant, Mistress, I’m just a\ndumb slave.’ Treat me like I’m stupid, and you’ll get stupid out of me.”\nThe red in Karris reared up, and she nearly lost it. She was the\ncommanding officer. She would be obeyed. But then for an instant, she tried\nto imagine the White shouting at a subordinate.\nOf course, the White was the White. There was an institutional power in\naddition to the woman’s personal presence. When you answered her, you\nwere addressing all the weight of the Chromeria. But still.\nHow large could the pool of possibilities of who had been Teia’s handler\npreviously be? Because the key wasn’t someone who was smart and\nambitious and willful—in the upper echelons of the Chromeria, that ruled\nout practically no one—the key was that the person had to be able to report\nto the White. The White’s infirmity had confined her to her own floor in\nrecent months.\nSo it had to be someone with easy access to her floor. Who had that\naccess? The Colors… but most of them have their own agendas, and they’d\nhave spies tracking them, too, because they’re already so important. Who\nelse? The Blackguards.\nOrholam have mercy. A Blackguard? Of course, and it would have to be\nsomeone who could juggle watch schedules so that he or she could report to\nthe White immediately if there were an emergency that demanded it. That\nmeant one of the watch captains, as she herself had been.\nBlademan was too straightforward to manage spies. Beryl was a gossip\nand had been since her youth. Tempus was possible. Loved his books, good\nadministrator. But he never got out. He was always either on duty or in his\noffice. Blunt was too dumb. Not that he was stupid, but you had to be very,\nvery bright to handle all of this. Unless he faked that?\nNo, not Blunt.\nSo, none of them. Her breath escaped.

        "text": "No, not Blunt.\nSo, none of them. Her breath escaped. Unless… Commander Ironfist?\nThe man was always working, always going places and meeting with\npeople. Karris had always thought of him as a man who kept his own\ncounsel, but one could just as easily label him secretive, even reclusive.\nBut he seemed like he would stand out too much. Too famous, too\nrecognizable. On the other hand, his official duties had him rubbing\nshoulders with everyone, high and low. If he checked in with the kitchens,\nno one would be surprised. If he talked with room slaves, no one would bat\nan eyelash. If he spoke with a Color, or with that Color’s personal guards…\nHe was the perfect spy. His position gave him enough access, and was\nso obviously impossible, that he could hide in plain sight. Teia’s handler\nwas Commander Ironfist.\n“Marissia,” Teia said, apparently unable to bear the silence.\nKarris couldn’t find breath.\n“Because when slaves aren’t invisible, they must be beautiful. And when\na slave is beautiful, she can only be good for one thing, right?” Teia said,\nthe acid in her tone spraying all over Karris’s face, and burning, burning.\nAnyone but her. Anyone else.\n“Funny. She trusted me with her identity,” Teia said. “But to you, I’m\njust a former slave.”\nKarris had fought when wounded. Had fought with that sick feeling that\nsomething was terribly wrong, but you couldn’t stop to gauge how wrong it\nwas. Stopping to judge meant death. It was the same here. Fight on, fight\non, turn your eyes to the task.\nTeia was a good girl. Defiant, but every Blackguard had steel in them.\nStudy her, figure how to use her best, and don’t let her get under your skin\n—either to anger or to love.\nYou’ve got to keep your distance, Karris. What’s the most likely\noutcome here?\nThat she disappears at some point, and is simply gone. That’s what the\nOrder does. We’re going against them where they’re strongest. They\npractically invented spycraft.\n“At some point,” Karris said, as if the storm had washed past her\nwithout leaving a trace, “they’ll want you to steal a shimmercloak.”\n“What?” Teia asked. She’d wanted a fight, Karris could tell. Without it,\nTeia was like a ship becalmed.\n“The White’s been studying the shimmercloaks. You need to be a\nlightsplitter to use them. We thought light splitting was a gift only given to\nPrisms. We were wrong. But more to the point in your case, a lightsplitter\nwithout a shimmercloak is useless. None of their current Shadows—if there\nis indeed more than one—is going to give you theirs, are they? So if the\nOrder can use you to steal a shimmercloak for them, then even if you’re a\nspy and they have to kill you eventually, they still come out ahead. If they\ndistrust you, you’ll be getting that assignment soon.”\nTeia slumped in her seat. She knew a death sentence when she heard it.\n“You have to understand, Teia. The Order are masters of subterfuge.\nThey’re very, very good at finding and killing spies.”"

Her eyes were dead.\n“You expect me to fail. That’s why you can’t let me know who you are.”\n“Odds are.”\nThere was only bitterness and resignation in Teia’s voice. The sound of a\nsoldier sent to die, who thinks his death won’t even accomplish anything.\n“So what do I do? Feed that perception that I’m a clueless young girl?”\nPretending to be stupid enough that she couldn’t be used by their\nenemies, but still smart enough that the Order would trust her? It would be a\ndifficult line to tread. Impossible for one so young.\nSuddenly, Karris remembered what it was like to have her future taken\nout of her own hands and decided by her elders, to be thought beneath\nconsideration. She’d hated it, railed against it, and finally, she’d left a wake\nof destruction rebelling against it. She was still paying the price of that\nrebellion, and still dodging the cost of it—the son she’d abandoned, the\ndamnation she felt.\nWith an uncertain hand, Karris pulled open the curtain. Teia looked up,\njaw clenched. Scared. Karris unsnapped the voice-modifying choker. She\ntook off the mail cowl and aventail. “So,” she said. “Now we’re in this\ntogether.”\nTears welled up in Teia’s eyes. “I hoped it would be you,” she said.\nChapter 51\nTremblefist was grinning. Kip could hardly believe his eyes, but the morose\ngiant was grinning.\nAll the squads were crowded into the Prism’s training room, and every\nlast young man and woman was agape, barely blinking for fear of missing a\ncritical moment. Tremblefist was faced off against his brother Ironfist. Both\nwore training armor of leather imbued with luxin that would burst with\nspectacular yellow light if struck, to declare a solid hit. They wore steel\nhelms with bars woven like wicker, thick leather gauntlets, and they bore\nbamboo swords.\nAnd they moved. How they moved. The bamboo swords beat a tempo\nagainst each other that was like the music of the spheres, the great soft\nswish of the grinding gears of the universe keeping its time.\nBut not for long. Each point was scored within five seconds. With\nwarriors at this level, a single mistake led to a touch. It was too fast for Kip\nto even tell sometimes who’d scored the point. Other times, he only saw the\nluxin bloom.\nIronfist and Tremblefist didn’t rest between points, didn’t move back to\nthe center of the circle, merely took ready positions, touched swords and\nbegan again. The score stood at five to five. Tremblefist readied himself, but\ninstead of tapping his bamboo, Ironfist removed his left hand from his\nsword.\nTremblefist nodded and took his own left hand away. Kip had trained\nwith those swords, and though both men were taller and bigger than he was,\neven then those swords were too big, too long to wield perfectly in one"

If you had the hand and arm strength of an Ironfist, you did gain\nreach, but you lost speed. A good trade if you could hold a shield, perhaps,\nbut not to hold nothing.\nBut each man moved fluidly into a fighting style Kip had never seen.\nThey didn’t hold the sword in one hand, they merely held the hilt in one\nhand. Each put his other hand almost halfway down his blade. What\nfollowed was some odd blend of sword-fighting, staff-fighting, and body\nthrows. Lunges flowed into blocks into foot sweeps. It was just as fast, but\nmore muscular, each circling, constantly moving, using not just the point of\nthe sword but also blade and even pommel, dodges and even jumps blurring\npast. The speed of the men was incredible, but in this, Kip could see the full\nflower of the seeds his own training was planting. Those dodges, this strike,\nthat way of rotating the hips to get force.\nA clash and a rattle of bamboo, and Tremblefist’s hips twisted and his\nsword point was batted aside low, but he was merely cocking the gun, his\nhips snapped back, the sword point dipping behind Ironfist’s knee and\npulling sharply back toward Tremblefist and up.\nIronfist leapt with the cut, trying to avoid what would be a hamstringing.\nHe did a backflip, but before he could land, Tremblefist shoved his blade in\nthat two-handed grip against Ironfist’s stomach. Without any base, it flung\nIronfist backward. There was no way he could keep his feet. He flew across\nthe circle and landed, skidding, on his back.\nSeeing Ironfist put on his ass was like seeing the moon outshine the sun.\nThe nunks were aghast. Of course, they’d heard of the famous battle\nbetween the brothers, more than a dozen years ago in front of the whole\nChromeria, so they’d known that Tremblefist was nearly as good as his\nelder brother. But Tremblefist had somehow quietly faded into the\nbackground since then. He wasn’t even a watch captain, while Ironfist was\nlegend. It was said in the Battle of Garriston Ironfist had taken out whole\nbatteries of artillery by himself. The man could walk on water. Seeing\nanyone equal him was a shock. Seeing someone best him? Blasphemy.\nBut Ironfist merely leapt to his feet and shook his head while Tremblefist\ngrinned. They began again. They traded points, but Tremblefist led all the\nway. Ironfist barely tied it at nine-nine when his brother dodged back from a\nblow, but not far enough, and got his head yanked to the side as Ironfist’s\nbamboo brushed the steel bars of his helmet. In a real fight, it wouldn’t have\nhit him at all.\nIronfist racked his sword and pointed to Big Leo and to a nunk named\nAntaeos. “Pick weapons.”\n“Clawed bich’hwa and a sword-breaker,” Antaeos said.

        "text": "Antaeos. “Pick weapons.”\n“Clawed bich’hwa and a sword-breaker,” Antaeos said. It was an odd\ncombination, both usually secondary weapons. But of course, that was part\nof the fun of putting masters through their paces—seeing not just what they\ncould do if they were in a strange position, but seeing what was possible\neven in strange positions. As Commander Ironfist had told them many\ntimes, in the chaos of battle, you might end up with any weapon in hand,\nand you had to make it work.\nBig Leo grinned. “Heavy chain.” He’d been working on using thicker\nchains. When he draped the thick chains over his draft horse shoulders, he\nwas quite the sight. But chain weapons were difficult, brutal. You were\nmore likely to hurt yourself using a chain than any other weapon.\n“That’s a bludgeoning weapon,” Ironfist said.\n“It’s not only a bludgeoning weapon,” Leo said defensively.\n“But most of its attacks are, Leo,” Teia said. “You’d be making one of\nthem fight with half a weapon.”\n“Uh, then…” The big man suddenly felt the weight of everyone’s stares\non him and got flustered. He shrank into himself, which made him merely\nmuch bigger than everyone except Ironfist and Tremblefist.\n“Rope spear,” Teia suggested under her breath.\n“Rope spear!” Big Leo said, like a starving man reaching for bread.\n“Pick a number, one or two,” Ironfist said to Ferkudi. Obviously, he was\nmaking a lottery for himself and his brother for who would get to pick\nwhich weapon he fought with.\n“One,” Ferkudi said.\n“To yourself,” Ironfist said flatly.\n“Oh.” Then, light dawning, “Oh! Oh, sorry.”\n“Brother?” Ironfist said. “Be my guest.”\n“Two,” Tremblefist said.\n“Two it is,” Ferkudi said.\nKip and the rest of Cruxer’s squad all looked at him.\n“What?” he asked, defensive. “What?”\n“I’ll take the bich’hwa and sword-breaker,” Tremblefist said. The\nbich’hwa was Karris’s favorite, Kip knew. The clawed variety could both be\nused as a normal dagger (the scorpion’s tail) and as a punch dagger (the\nclawed feet). The training variety had the claws made of the same boiled\nrubber-tree sap that full Blackguards used on the soles of their shoes,\ndipped in red ink to make its ‘cuts’ obvious. The sword-breaker was a short\nsword with thick barbed notches all down one side, made to catch sword\nstrokes, and used correctly could twist a sword out of an opponent’s hand or\neven break the blade.\nThe rope spear was even more interesting, though Kip wasn’t surprised\nTeia had suggested it. She’d been practicing with it in private lessons with\nIronfist and sometimes Kip, who as her partner got to be her target. The\nrope spear was like a short gladius attached to a long rope. It could be used\nas a simple dagger, as a flail, or as a spear when sharply redirected from\nspinning to fly out straight. But the rope was what made it amazing. An"

An\nopponent would think that if only he could get inside the whirling death that\nthe blade cut through the air, he’d be safe. It was almost impossible to resist\ncatching the rope and trying to disarm the rope spear wielder.\nBut that was where almost half of the rope spear’s techniques began.\nWith a flick of the wrist, the wielder could throw nooses over her\nopponent’s fist or neck. Grabbing the rope was a prelude to defeat. It was\nstill a secondary weapon—not good against armored opponents, not good in\ntight spaces—but it was so unusual and challenging to use well that even\nIronfist had confessed he needed to do a lot of brushing up before he’d\nstarted training Teia.\nOf course, he’d done the brushing up.\nAnd he’d done it privately. Tremblefist most likely had no idea that he’d\njust assigned his brother to a rare weapon that was exactly what Ironfist had\nbeen practicing.\nKip still wouldn’t have wanted to try a rope spear against a sword-\nbreaker, which was made to entangle weapons.\nBut that was a sidelight. Ironfist wasn’t fighting his brother to entertain\nthe squads. That wasn’t his way. This was a lesson of some kind.\nSo what was the lesson? It wasn’t how to fight with these weapons.\nThe two men began fighting, and of course it was dazzling. To most of\nthe nunks, it had to look like Ironfist had picked up a weapon that he hadn’t\neven thought of in years, and had total mastery of it. It was a good way for\nIronfist to use the time he’d had to put into brushing up his skills to a\nsecond use. It also gave him an edge on Tremblefist, who obviously hadn’t\ntrained with his own weapons in a good long time.\nIronfist won, despite having what seemed a worse weapon, nine to six.\nThe brothers finished with double swords. Tremblefist won, but only ten–\nnine. The total of all the bouts went to Ironfist.\n“Form up,” Ironfist said.\nAnd here’s where we get the lesson, Kip thought.\nThe squads were, by this time, highly efficient at getting into place. In\nseconds they stood in neat lines.\n“Tremblefist, thank you,” Ironfist said. He bowed low to his brother, as\nto an equal. His brother bowed a bit lower, but a smirk played on his lips.\nIronfist motioned that Tremblefist could go. “Squad Yod!” he barked.\n“Being the worst has its perks. Take the rest of the day off. You’re\ndismissed.”\nThe members of Yod looked at each other. Some were dumb enough to\nlook excited at getting the day off. The smarter ones looked stung. They’d\nbeen called the worst. It was the truth, of course. Of ten squads, they were\ntenth. But those few had the sense to see that being dismissed early was a\nperk, but it wasn’t all perk.\nNevertheless, they bowed and left.\n“Squad Teth,” Ironfist said, addressing the ninth squad. “What did you\nlearn today?”"

It\ncarried more than intended.\nThey fell silent as they realized Commander Ironfist had heard it.\n“Squad Teth, Blackguards guard their tongues. One hour running.” They\nquietly groaned and hung their heads. He paused. “Minus half, because I\nam.”\nThe squads all laughed and cheered.\nIronfist cracked a grin. “Squad Teth, dismissed.” They left, clapping the\none who’d spoken out on the shoulders and giving each other a hard time.\nAfter they closed the door behind themselves, Commander Ironfist said,\n“Squad Kheth, what’d you learn?”\nKheth, Zayin, Vav, and He squads each came up with some technique or\ncombination they’d never seen before. Some of the comments were quite\ngood, noting that a counter only worked because of Ironfist’s or\nTremblefist’s reach or strength.\nAfter the door closed behind He, Commander Ironfist looked at the\nremaining four squads: his thirty-three best Blackguard inductees. “Daleth,\nGimel, Beth, Aleph,” he said, looking at each squad in turn. “Being the\nworst has its perks. So does being the best. What’s your perk?”\nBen-hadad said, “We get more instruction; they get more time off.”\n“And what’s that mean?” the commander asked.\n“They’re being punished for their ineptitude,” an Archer from Gimel\nsaid. “They think they’re gaining something by getting free time, and thus\nthey prove that they aren’t the best.”\n“Did all of them look elated to go?” the commander asked.\n“The smart ones looked heartbroken,” Kip said.\n“Which means the smart ones will redouble their efforts to get better,”\nCruxer said. “It’ll make the cream rise.”\n“Yes, and?” Ironfist asked.\n“Not an ‘and,’” Kip said. “A ‘but.’ But this means—”\n“Hold,” Ironfist said. “Squad Daleth, you’re dismissed.”\nIt was clearly a shot in the gut for the eight nunks of Squad Daleth.\nHaving been identified for one moment as elite, and then pushed out of the\ncircle, not a one of this squad looked happy to get out early.\n“Commander, please, let us stay,” the squad leader, Aria, said.\nAdmirably, she didn’t make it sound like begging, simply a request.\n“The best are not allowed to stay, they earn it,” Commander Ironfist\nsaid. “Dismissed.”\nThere was sharp silence as Squad Daleth left.\nBut Commander Ironfist ignored it. Kip had no doubt that everyone in\nthat squad would double their efforts. “Breaker, go on.”\nKip took a breath. “By kicking them out, it just means that the best get\nbetter. By our training more, we’ll continue to be the best.”\n“Is there any way around that?”\n“You could give the most instruction to the worst squads,” Cruxer said.\n“That would make them better, at the cost of making you worse than you"

We’re not interested in mediocrity here.”\n“You could have them train just as much as we do,” Teia said.\n“They do already. They were here; they saw what you saw, but I\nguarantee that all the remaining intelligent comments would have come\nfrom Gimel, Beth, and Aleph, not the lower squads. Because we’ve done\nthis before. We’ve seen it. We’ve seen how the worst—even in this elite\ngroup—slow down everyone. And my time is finite. I cannot teach a class\nof one hundred as quickly or as well as I can teach a class of ten. Nor ten as\nwell as one. Would that it were not so.\n“To have an elite of anything is to be at the best slightly unfair. There is\nalways someone who almost made it, and if you expand the bounds to\nencompass that one, there’s someone else who almost made that circle. The\nquestion is always, what do you get in trade for being slightly unfair? The\nBlackguard could be a thousand strong, or it could be ten. We make the\ntrades. We decide when to expand the circle to let in someone who is not\nquite as good as the rest of you.”\n“At some level, though, there’s a kind of equality,” Kip said. “Or at\nleast… the differences don’t matter. A Teia has such gifts you’d be a fool\nnot to bring her onto the Blackguard, even if she couldn’t fight at all. You\ntold me that. Ben-hadad can’t command like Cruxer, but he’s so smart, he\nbrings us other things. Big Leo might lose eight bouts of ten to Cruxer, but\nhis very size means there’s times we don’t have to fight at all. At some\npoint, a person has enough gifts that even if he isn’t the best at all things,\nhe’s too valuable to give up.”\nThe squads looked at Kip like he’d said something smart.\n“I agree,” Commander Ironfist said. “That’s why I’m lecturing three\nsquads here, and not just Aleph. Now, what lessons did you learn, Gimel?”\n“That practice can get you killed in battle. That you have to always keep\nthe limits of the training you’ve done in mind,” a singularly ugly young\nman named Cracks said.\n“A truism from the very first days of our training,” Commander Ironfist\nsaid. “How’d you see it, exactly?”\n“In the first sparring, you made a single mistake, and it led to a touch,\ninstantly. Maybe that’s because Tremblefist has fought you so many times\nthat he knows exactly what your skills are, but I think it was instead\nbecause in being totally aggressive, he only risked losing a single point. He\ncould fling himself at you with abandon, trying to grab that mistake. Would\nhe have been so fast to attack if he were risking his life rather than a point?\nI’d say no.”\nCommander Ironfist nodded. “Great tourney fencers often kill many and\ndie quickly in battle. Well done, Squad Gimel. You’re dismissed. Squad\nBeth, tell me something that good or better.”"

It’s an odd weapon, and\nshe hasn’t practiced in the open. He assumed you’d be out of practice. But\nwhat I don’t understand is how you got Teia to choose.”\n“I got that,” Cruxer said. “Inductees who use unusual weapons will\nalways choose to see their own weapon demonstrated by a master. So you\nknew Big Leo would choose heavy chain; you could reject that, and Teia\nwas standing right next to him. You’ve been working with her long enough\nto know that she’d jump on the chance. So you did set up Tremblefist.”\nA sly grin crept onto Ironfist’s broad face. “So sayeth the Tactician, ‘He\nwho knoweth himself and his enemy dreadeth nought.’ Squad Beth, well\ndone, you’re dismissed.”\nThey bowed low and left.\n“Being the best has its perks, Squad Aleph,” Ironfist said. “But it also\nmeans you work longer than anyone else. Prove that you’re the best in\nmind, and not just in arms.”\n“It’s the first time I’ve seen Tremblefist smile,” Teia said, musing aloud.\nA cloud passed over Ironfist’s face. “True, but what’s the tactical\nsignificance of that? Is there any?”\n“I don’t… I’m sorry.”\nNo one else said a word.\nIronfist blew out a breath. “You may know that my brother’s birth name\nis Hanishu. Mine is Harrdun. I was given my Blackguard name when I\npunched through a door and subdued a raider holding a hostage on the other\nside of it.”\n“Subdued?” Ferkudi whispered. “I heard he nearly ripped the man’s\nhead off.”\n“But Hanishu picked his own name,” Ironfist said, pretending not to\nhear.\nFor one moment, Kip was struck by how different this was than learning\nunder Magister Kadah. Where she mocked and belittled and ruled through\nfear, with Ironfist—a man whom the squad actually should fear—learning\nwas like being yoked together with him. Everyone had to push as hard as\nthey could to keep up with him, but one always felt that he was working,\ntoo. In comparison, Magister Kadah put the yoke on you alone, and then\ncriticized how unevenly you pulled it by yourself.\nKip looked at the faces of his squadmates. They were intent, utterly\nfocused, fearful of letting the commander down, but not fearful. He had\nthem heart and soul and strength, not because he gave them a respect they\ndidn’t deserve, but because he expected them to deliver the best they were\nable to deliver, always, and he thought their best was better than they\nthought it was.\nThis was a great man in action.

Years ago. That didn’t involve strange\nweapons; it was straightforward, and Tremblefist was better than you, but\nyou won. You won because he let you.”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said, “there were hundreds of trained fighters at that\nexhibition. No way someone could throw a match in front of all of them and\nnot be noticed.” Ah, Cruxer, the idealist.\n“At this level? What’s a couple points?” Kip asked.\n“Why would he do such a thing?” Ironfist asked, low, dangerous.\n“For the same reason he chose Tremblefist as his name. He didn’t want\nto lead, didn’t trust himself, but he trusted you. By taking a name that\nautomatically made people think of you, any excellence he showed would\nmake people think even more of you. ‘If Tremblefist is this good, how good\nmust Ironfist be?’ He killed his own prospects for advancement to help\nyours. When you fought in that exhibition, it had to be close. It had to be\nincredible. But in the end, you had to win. He smiled because today, he\ncould try to win. Because today, the match wouldn’t matter. Anyone can get\nlucky, and now it wouldn’t hurt your reputation.”\n“Very good, Aleph Squad,” Ironfist said, his voice raspy. “Dismissed.\nNow.”\nThe squad moved out quickly. Kip went with them, but when they\nreached the elevator, he finally stumbled upon the obvious.\n“Oh, shit,” he said. “I’ll be right back.”\nHe walked quickly back down the hall and opened the door, but the\nwords dried on his lips. Commander Ironfist was on his knees, face buried\nin his hands, weeping."

All these years, he\nthought his brother had chosen to be called Tremblefist because of his own\nbrokenness. All these years, and he hadn’t known what his brother had\nsacrificed for him, how Tremblefist loved him.\nKip stepped out silently—and found himself face-to-face with\nTremblefist. Kip swallowed, looking up at the giant, but the big man merely\nput a hand on his shoulder, squeezed it briefly, and went inside. Kip closed\nthe door behind him.\nThey never heard what was said between the brothers, but after that day,\nTremblefist seemed to emerge from the shadows. He took over the training\nof Squad Aleph, and from time to time, he smiled.\nChapter 52\nIt took all of Karris’s courage to open the door to her own room. There was\nno escape from this. If Marissia weren’t waiting in the room now, she’d be\nthere later, at some time when Karris wasn’t ready. In fact, the more she’d\nthought about it, the more certain she’d become that Marissia knew that she\nknew: of course a new handler in charge of gathering information would\nimmediately ask who the old handler had been.\nThus, in surrendering Teia to be handled by Karris, Marissia had\nknowingly surrendered herself.\nKarris opened the door. Marissia was seated at her desk off to the side of\nthe room, her quill scratching quietly. She looked up, and put the quill in its\nstand. She was perfectly calm. A perfect lady, despite her clipped ears.\nIrritatingly beautiful. A winter storm was raging outside, sheets of rain\ncascading past the windows, thunder rattling the tower.\nWalking straight toward her desk, Karris felt like a young Blackguard,\ncoming to report to her watch captain rather than as the lady of her\nhousehold, coming to confront a slave. A slave! But Karris’s knees felt\nweak.\n“The White told me long ago,” Marissia said, “‘She who controls the\ninformation controls everything.’”\nKarris was curiously numb. She walked over to Marissia’s desk, pulled a\nchair over, and sat across from her. Marissia studied her quietly, an\nexpression that Karris couldn’t quite read fluttering around the edges of her\nface like a moth trying to escape from a tent.\n“My father had a different take: she who controls the Prism controls\neverything,” Karris said.\nThey stared at each other for a long time, and for the very first time,\nKarris looked at Marissia as a woman; for the first time, she ignored the\nclipped ears and looked at her eyes. How had she missed it? She’d known\nMarissia was competent, of course. Blackguards liked working with\ncompetent slaves who made sure there were no distractions from the work\nat hand. Marissia directed her small army of subordinate slaves perfectly,\nmaking sure everything here was done precisely right, precisely on time."

Marissia directed her small army of subordinate slaves perfectly,\nmaking sure everything here was done precisely right, precisely on time.\nSuch oversight was more than enough work for any one woman, much less\nany one slave.\nMuch less any one slave? An odd thought. Slaves came from every\nsocial stratum in every land. One poor decision or too many bad debts and\nno family willing to pay for your foolishness, or bandits or pirates and no\nfriends willing to pay your ransom. Whether you were at fault, or utterly\ninnocent—it could be one tiny step away. When she was a girl, Karris had\nplayed with Taira Appleton, when they were young enough that\ncomplementary personalities had mattered more than differing stations.\nBut in the False Prism’s War, the Appletons’ lord had sided with Dazen\nGuile. The Appleton estate had been on the border of Blood Forest and\nAtash, directly in the path of Gavin’s army. Lady Appleton had known they\nwould be overrun if she answered her lord’s call to arms. She did it anyway,\nloyalty overcoming sense, mistaking a question of smart and stupid for one\nof right and wrong. Karris still wasn’t sure whether the action was more\npraiseworthy or blameworthy. Within a week, Lady Appleton’s estates were\ntaken, her six sons killed, her four daughters clipped and sold.\nMarissia stared at Karris, and Karris studied her back, each silent,\nbroken mirrors to each other, Marissia’s hair its natural red, Karris’s hair,\nnaturally red, now dyed black.\nWhere was Taira now? Where were her sisters? Even knowing how easy\nit was to fall into slavery, Karris had somehow kept slaves at arm’s length,\nmade them other. It made them more bearable. One misstep and she could\nhave sat in Marissia’s place, serving some lord.\nCome to think of it, if her own loathsome father hadn’t been careful to\nkeep the White Oaks aligned with Gavin and Andross Guile…\nNo, no, no, Orholam, please no. She’d never thought of it this way. His\nmaneuvering had been all cowardice; it hadn’t been…\nShe remembered her father’s face, during the feast, while the real Gavin\nGuile had mocked him and made bawdy jokes about bedding his daughter\nin exotic ways. Father had looked stricken. He’d looked pathetically weak.\nBut what could he do?\nWith Dazen’s burning of their estate on Big Jasper, the White Oaks had\nlost the bulk of their fortune and all their best people. They’d also had\nenormous debts to nobles who’d sided with Dazen, debts they could never\npay. Debts they might not be required to pay if Gavin won the war. From\nher father’s perspective, the White Oaks’ only hope was in binding\nthemselves to the real Gavin Guile and his father, Andross.\nWhat if father had thought, while the young, drunken Karris was being\nled away to be… forced… what if he thought, ‘Better she be forced once\nand be married to the Prism than that she be made a slave and raped by\nwhoever wanted to, forever’?"

Disgusting. Wrong. But not selfish. Not loveless. And he’d blown\nout his brains when Karris hated him for it.\nShe hadn’t shed one bitter tear for her father since she’d refused the\nabortifacient.\nShe felt suddenly very, very sick, but she tried to regain focus. No\nweakness here, not in front of this woman.\nMarissia opened a cabinet, hesitated, choosing, and pulled out a decanter\nfull of amber liquid. She produced a single, ornate crystal glass, and filled it\nwith a more than generous double pour. She set the glass exactly in the\nmiddle of the small table. It was an homage to an old Blood Forest custom,\nborn of a hospitality that defied poverty. A family might be able to afford\nonly one nice goblet, but that one would be shared between host and guest.\nWhether families retained the tradition as they grew in wealth or quickly\ndiscarded the tradition to give each person her own glass said a lot about\nhow that family felt about their origins.\nMarissia took the glass, inclined it to Karris, and drank.\nChromeria tradition, though, dictated that slaves and masters or\nmistresses not drink together. If two social unequals dined or drank\ntogether, at least the lesser was supposed to defer to the greater.\nMarissia’s eyes danced, as if daring Karris: Am I your host who is\nsharing her own liquor with you, or a slave? Who am I to you? she asked.\nTo hell with it. In this, Marissia was Karris’s superior. She’d been\nrunning a spy network for how long? Besides, it had always been wine or\nbrandy shared in Blood Forest, never whisky. Maybe it was time for new\ntraditions.\nKarris took the glass and took a gulp. It set her on fire, and pain had\nnever felt so good. She counted it a victory that she didn’t cough. As the fire\nspread through her gut, she held up the glass, as if admiring the color. It was\na thing aficionados seemed to do. “Barrenmoor?”\nWhiskies were a niche taste, made even more so by the vast distances\nthe barrels had to travel from the distilleries at the edge of Blood Forest in\nthe highlands above Green Haven and their subsequent cost. Karris hadn’t\nbeen able to afford the stuff on her Blackguard wages. She’d guessed\nBarrenmoor only because it was one of the two best.\n“Crag Tooth,” Marissia said, examining it in turn and taking another sip.\n“Mmm,” Karris said. The other one. Dammit.\n“Easy miss. This is the sixteen. After it’s matured sixteen years, it\nmellows to be easier drinking like Barrenmoor. I prefer it because it still\nretains its fiery character and complexity while time takes off the rough\nedges and impetuosity.”\nKarris looked at Marissia sharply. Sixteen years? Rough edges and\nimpetuosity? The woman’s eyes danced again.\nDamn her, Karris was not going to like this woman.\n“And how does it do as it ages further?”"

They\nwatched the storm smash all its rage on the Chromeria, lightning striking\nthe tops of the towers themselves, power channeled down into the earth\nitself, diffused, harmless. Rain sheeting the windows so thickly it was\nimpossible to see to any distance. Wind hammering the tower so hard it\nswayed, but was unbroken. And whether it was the warmth of the whisky or\nthe fire or, oddly, the company, Karris found herself enjoying the storm.\nThe storm was subsiding by the time they finished their second whisky,\na little light fighting through the clouds just at the horizon.\nKarris set the glass down on the table, stood, and walked to the door\nwithout a word. She opened it and, looking back, saw woman, and storm,\nand light. The eye can see all at once, but only focus on one at a time. The\nclouds were still dark, angry.\nShe said, “You know, sharing a glass with you is—” one thing, but\nthere’s no way I’m sharing my husband with a…\nBut the words didn’t make it to completed thought, much less out of her\nmouth. There was a sudden stiffness in Marissia’s spine, a grief in her eyes\nat all that was denied her. As Karris had been a warrior in the Chromeria’s\nopen battles, so had Marissia been one in its secret battles, and perhaps\nneither was content anymore to fight alone.\nKarris started over. “Sharing a glass with you is the best thing I’ve done\nin months.”\nChapter 53\n~Samila Sayeh~\nToday is the day we make a god. The crowds are gathering, paying\nobeisance to me and to the other Elect around me, and above us, to the\nColor Prince himself. All the people are gathering today. A special day, a\nspecial victory, but also to commemorate our people’s great victory at Ox\nFord, and mourn our losses. The Color Prince wishes to tie all these\ntogether in the small folks’ minds.\nI find it terribly uninteresting, so instead I regard the mathematical\nprecision with which I have remade my left hand with blue luxin. No,\nremade is too grandiose. Augmented. My hand has become superior in most\nways to a human hand, but I am a mere mechanist. Perhaps I would have\nbecome a creator had not the Guiles’ War made a warrior of me.\nIt is, however, a masterpiece. Blue luxin is crystalline, solid, hard, nearly\nunbreakable on one plane but easy to snap or shatter if pushed from the\nside. Supplementing the human animal with all its shifting and bending and\ntwisting forms is well nigh impossible to do without impinging on its\nfunctionality. Sheathe your arm in a blue luxin carapace? Easy. And then\nyou sweat, and the sweat and oil gets trapped. The skin softens and, chafed"

Exposed to that sweat and oil and dead skin, after a time,\ninfection sets in. Then the body attacks itself. Unable to swell, the blood\ngets cut off, the infection spreads, fever comes, and throughout, incredible\npain.\nIt is my hypothesis that much of the madness of color wights has had\nnothing to do with luxin. It has been the result of unending pain, the sadly\nself-inflicted torture of incorporating luxin into one’s self imperfectly.\nPerhaps such madmen are so dangerous they must be put down for the\nsafety of others, but to call madness evil is a grave error. The pre-\nLucidonian philosopher said, ‘Every act intends some good.’\nThe damage done by wights has been done through ignorance. One\ndoesn’t punish ignorance with death. One fights it with knowledge. Not\ndarkness, but light.\nMy companion and I have long talks about this. She isn’t real, of course.\nShe is merely a dialectical prop. She—I picture her as a grown-up version\nof my niece Meena, who was murdered at the Great Pyramid—questions\nmy research, and we debate. It is the only way for me to have an equal here.\nIt makes me miss the Chromeria. So many fine minds there. Of course,\nthey forbid all this research, but if they could overcome their fears as I have\novercome mine… But of course, I know the Color Prince has people\nrecruiting within the Chromeria. The people here are eager, but they aren’t\ndisciplined thinkers. They think being Free means being free of the\nconsequences of their actions, free of nature’s laws. It is an attitude the\nprince has not seen fit to curb. Not yet, not when he still needs soldiers and\ndrafters to die for him. Later, he promises me, we will work to channel such\nfervor.\n‘Light cannot be chained, but it can be directed,’ he tells me. He seems\nto like the phrase, and I can tell he will use it again. Later. After victory,\nafter the first phrase has bought him willing martyrs and power, he will add\nthat second clause to nullify the first. And those fool martyrs will have died\nonly to put a new king with a different title on a new seat in the same place.\nThus ever does a tyrant’s noose tighten, I suppose. Expanding, building that\nfuture speech in his head, he says, ‘All the world is open to the light, but\nour eyes can only look one way at a time.’\nI see these rhythms, with Meena’s help. How nine kings became seven\nsatraps, and how failed attempts at making a high king yielded to a\nsuccessful attempt to make a Prism, and how the Prism’s power and the\nsatraps’ was eroded by jealous Colors. As a wolf hungers for meat so a man\nlusts for power. It is unwise to get between either one and his prize. This is\nnot a condemnation but a fact. And only a fool allows herself to become the\nprize.\nThis is the reason why someone else is becoming Mot today, not I,"

She\nthinks that—Oh, more cheering. Everyone else on the podium is\napplauding. I join them.\nShe thinks that having an overseer would grate on me. I say, what’s the\ndifference between having one overseer to direct me to do the Color\nPrince’s will, or having two overseers to direct me to do the Color Prince’s\nwill? Plus, those who fail the prince directly feel his wrath directly. Dervani\nMalargos and Jerrosh Green fought tooth and nail to be the Atirat, and when\nthe prince made his choice, he gave one godhood, and the other a musket\nball in his brain pan. And soon thereafter Dervani had joined Jerrosh in\ndeath, albeit at Gavin Guile’s hand. Godhood is a dangerous business.\nStill, Meena thinks I will chafe under the rule of a lesser mind. Ramia\nCorfu is certainly that, though the man is beautiful. One oughtn’t discount\nthe power of beauty. It is a change I notice in myself. It has been months\nsince I last took Usef Tep. We’d made love nine times in that last week\nbefore the Freeing, knowing it would be our last. We’d even slipped out of\nthe line at the Freeing, fooling none, and not trying to fool them, either.\nHuman delicacies break down in death’s acid gaze. While I had not Usef’s\ndaily hunger, by now I would usually feel the lack keenly. Now my libido\nlies dormant. I look at Ramia’s well-proportioned face, and I understand\nthat other women see only boyish charm and willfulness, smoldering good\nlooks. It’s not that I don’t see it, or understand from memory what it will do\nto others; it’s that its effect on me is limited.\nIt matters not. My sole strategy with Ramia Corfu will be to make\nmyself appear to be what I actually am: indispensable and utterly without\nambition. Meena pretends to be content with this, though I think she has\nmore ambitions for me than I do.\nThe Color Prince is going on, and seems to be doing a good job of it. He\nusually does.

He nods to the\nrest of us, as if we’re lucky to be seen with him. My face remains\nimpassive, but some of the others bristle. It’s one thing to revel in such a\ntriumph; it’s another to act as if you got there because you were smarter\nthan the rest of us.\nWhy him?

The word is that the fire unmanned him, which means the damage\nmust have been severe. It has never been taught officially in the Chromeria,\nbut the uses of luxin in sex have been explored by drafters from time\nimmemorial.\n“Ramia Corfu, Lord of the Air, come forward,” the Color Prince says.\nAs the young man joins him, the Color Prince goes on. “It is my place as a\nleader of free men and women to recognize and reward excellence. In your\nascension, you will bow the knee to no man and no woman, but to your\nprince alone. We establish order not so that we may have lords, we establish\nlords that we may have order. Ramia Corfu, do you pledge your magic,\nyour sword, your will, and your obedience to me?”\n“I so swear,” Ramia Corfu says. He gets down on one knee and touches\nthe Color Prince’s foot.\n“Then today I declare the restoration of the Old Order,” the Color Prince\nsays. “It is not my wish to rule. It is only my wish to see a people who rule\nthemselves. Free women. Free men. So what authority you have trusted to\nme, I turn back to you. The white light of the sun is all colors working in\nconcert. Our ancestors, the nine kings of old, forgot this. They pitted\nthemselves against each other, and in their weakness, a heresy came among\nthem. A Prism shattered them. We shall not fail as they failed. I have been\nyour Color Prince, a man only, wounded, made whole with many colors.\nBut today I tell you I have a vision for all of us to be united in freedom\nunder the light. The Prisms have split light, have split satrap from satrap,\nhave split us into those who steal and those who are stolen from. We will\nunite all of us instead, and we will find strength together. Nine gods, nine\nkingdoms, and all peoples, united under one White King.” He holds up a\nmulticolored arm, blue plates and green seams and luxin running beneath it\nall, constantly. “But a poor White King am I. One day, when we have taken\nback our kingdoms, I shall remake myself. On the day when you unite the\nsatrapies, I, too, shall be made whole. My friends, will you serve—”\n“Yes!” many shout.\n“We will serve!”\nBut he quiets them, playing to the critical. “Will you serve not me, but\nthis noble ideal?”\n“We will!”\n“Will you give your all to see the nine kingdoms come again?”\n“We will!”\nHe goes on, but I stop listening. The rest of it is mere whipping the\ncrowd up. Interesting turn there, making his own healing synonymous with\n‘healing’ the Seven Satrapies under his banner. Healing with war.

Could a statement be more transparently at odds with his talk of all\nbeing equal?\nRegardless, if nothing else, the Color Prince has given himself a new\ntitle: he is now the White King. I seem to remember him swearing at some\npoint that there would be no kings among us. Does no one remember?\nBut through it all, he’s left Ramia Corfu on his knees, and the young\nman is clearly uncomfortable and peeved about it.\nWhen the cries of “The White King! The White King!” fade, the newly\ndubbed king steps back to Ramia Corfu. He produces a small ivory box and\nopens it. He pulls out a many-pointed crystal, holding it between thumb and\nforefinger. It spins, seemingly of its own volition, scintillating in a thousand\nshades of heaven.\nThe White King hands the crystal to Ramia. The young man stands. He\ndoesn’t move at all for a long moment, but when he does, he looks around\nat the others on the platform. He looks at the soldiers nearby. He looks at\nthe king.\nRamia Corfu’s eyes are sapphires lit from within, and crystals race\nacross his skin, breaking as he moves, and reforming, renewing from within\ninstantly.\n“A king?” Ramia says. “What is a king before a god? You have given\nme the power over the luxin in your very body!” His entire body is sheathed\nsuddenly in crystalline armor so thick a cannon shot would bounce off. He\nraises a razor-edged arm as the king’s men cry out in alarm.\n“And you have given me an excellent demonstration,” the White King\nsays.\nThe blue crystal carapace shatters at Ramia Corfu’s neck, and he\ncrumples to the ground as if his strings have been cut. His head rolls free\nand as all his blue luxin armor blows apart into grit, the scent of chalk and\nblood fills the air.\nMost of the crowd can’t see what decapitated him, but I can. It was the\nnecklace the Color Prince gave us and commanded us to wear at all times.\nThe so-called black luxin pendant has pierced Ramia’s neck front to back,\ntearing through the spine and emerging behind him, and the chain tightened\nuntil it cut all the way through his neck, popping his head off.\nOr maybe it isn’t ‘so-called’ black luxin. Maybe it really is black luxin.\nMaybe I’ve been studying the wrong color all this time.\n“Some of us, sadly, are not worthy of trust,” the White King says loudly.\n“And such traitors will be winnowed out mercilessly. However! There are\nin our ranks many more faithful who are true to our cause, and who will\nnever betray us. Who will serve us all, high or low, to the best of her\ncapabilities—which are great indeed.”"

I’m not taking\nover your spy network because you’re roombound and you can’t go see\nthem all yourself.”\n“Oh?”\n“At least that’s not the only reason,” Karris said.\nThe White’s wrinkles deepened as she smiled. She had lines aplenty, of\ncourse, and the smile lines were not so deep as the worry lines. “Push me to\nthe window, dear.”\nScowling, Karris did so. One couldn’t push the woman’s chair across her\napartments without being painfully aware of how thin and saggy her skin\nwas, how delicate the bones. It was as if Death were gently announcing his\nimpending arrival by these hints at how close to a skeleton this woman was,\nhow near the end of her term of service on this earth.\n“Hold. Are you deliberately reminding me how frail you are so I don’t\nyell at you?”\nThe White laughed. “Not everything is a trick, girl.”\nKarris frowned deeper. “Oh. Well, sorry then.”\n“But that was.”\nThe White’s grin was infectious, and Karris couldn’t help but grin along\nwith her. She took back all her thoughts about Death’s arrival. This woman\nwas going to live forever. Somehow Orea Pullawr was a little girl caught\nfilching sweetmeats, smiling like, ‘Mommy, you can’t be mad at me, I’m\ntoo cute!’ and simultaneously the wisest old crone in all the world.\nKarris couldn’t lose her. She sat down on the floor with her back to the\nblue luxin wall, looking up at the woman who had become hero and mother\nto her. “Please don’t leave me,” she said. She couldn’t help it.\n“Not until it’s my time, girl,” the White said.\nKarris scowled again. “Well, that’s meaningless.”\nThe White waved a dismissive hand. “Bah. People say meaningless\nthings all the time when they’re about to die. How about this one: ‘As long\nas I’m in your heart, I’ll never truly die.’ Ha! Please don’t keep me trapped\nin your heart after I die, girl. I get claustrophobic.”\n“How about, ‘You’ll be watching over me’?” Karris asked, only half\njoking."

I get claustrophobic.”\n“How about, ‘You’ll be watching over me’?” Karris asked, only half\njoking.\n“Sure—so please spend less time in latrines, because I don’t want to see\nit!”\nKarris laughed. And then she couldn’t bring up what she’d come to ask\nabout. Her courage wasn’t doing so great today.\n“You’ve had a little talk with Marissia,” the White prompted.\n“I just came from there, how do you know? I thought we had all your\nspies!”\n“What need for spies, when I have eyes?”\n“Huh?”\n“Or a nose. You reek of that whisky she drinks. Crag Tooth, which\nmeans she was trying to make peace. Otherwise she’d have given you that\nswill Barrenmoor.”\nOh. Right. Not everything was about spies and betrayal. You still had to\nuse your wits. Karris took a deep breath. “You brought me on to handle\nyour spies, you said. But you’ve already got Marissia. She’s been your spy\nhandler for years, hasn’t she?”\n“Yes,” the White said.\n“So why did you ask me to do what she’s already doing, probably better\nthan I ever will? Were you just trying to give me purpose? You thought I’d\nkill myself without Gavin around, without the Blackguard?”\n“I don’t see you as one for self-slaughter.”\nKarris said, “You’re giving me nothing here. Please.”\nThe White smiled sadly. “For many years now, Marissia has handled my\nspies within the Chromeria. I personally handled the external spies. She is\nvery, very good. She would be better than I am at such work, were it not\nthat I am the White and meeting me personally tends to carry weight. With\nthe spy we’re handling in this matter, it’s unclear whether this should be\ntreated as an internal Chromeria matter or an external threat.”\nSo the White was simply transferring a spy from one handler to the next.\n“That’s all?” Karris asked.\n“This didn’t come up when you fought with her?” the White countered.\n“There weren’t that many words exchanged.”\n“Oh dear. You didn’t break any of her bones, did you, darling?”\nKarris kept a straight face. “You’d be surprised how much pain I can\ninflict without doing permanent damage.”\nThe White winced.\n“But that’s it?” Karris asked. Fun as it was to mislead the White in\nsomething harmless, Karris had gotten awfully wound up over something\nthat turned out to be utterly trivial.\nThe White lifted her hands. “There isn’t always a grand design.”\n‘With you there is,’ Karris almost said. Instead, “I could have used some\nwarning.” About Marissia, she meant.\n“You needed to have it out with her. I expected you to do it on your own\nlong ago. Perhaps your abstention from red and green is doing you more\ngood than I’d hoped.”\n“About that,” Karris said. “How long—”\n“No.”\n“But—”\n“No.”\n“I’ve—”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Very well, then,” Karris said. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a desire to go\nthe training room and destroy something.”"

I’m sure Marissia will be eager to come give me her\nversion of events.”\nChapter 55\nKip woke from another nightmare, drenched in sweat, fists balled so tight\nhe had to massage his hands together to keep them from cramping.\nRemembering the specifics of the nightmare was like grasping smoke,\nthough. He sat up.\nAn exploding head, the bullet blessing, that was it. Again.\nThunder rumbled outside. The nightmares must have been triggered by\nthe storm lashing the Jaspers. It was nothing.\nWait, that had only been the second dream. In the first, he’d been on the\ndeck of the Wanderer again, stabbing his father, taking out all his fury of\nabandonment while his father’s eyes went wide—\nGavin had looked at Kip. In that look, Kip had seen acceptance, self-\nsacrifice for his son. In that look, Kip had seen love chosen, knowing the\ncost but undeterred by it.\nWhat Kip hadn’t seen was prismatic eyes. The light had been poor—it\nhad been night, after all—but Kip’s eyes were fully adjusted, and he\nremembered. He was sure of it.\nKip got up, throwing off the clinging webs of dream-hatred, and went\nout. He’d never been to the luxiats’ rooms, but he remembered Quentin\nsaying his room was in the blue tower, the floor called Justice, six. The\nluxiats sometimes referred to floors by names of sins (dark sides of the\ntowers) or virtues (light sides). It was an acolytes’ mnemonic so old that it\nhad passed into orthodoxy.\nHe found the floor and walked brazenly into the room. It was a barracks\nlike any of the Blackguards’ or discipulae’s, so it was no problem finding\nthe right one, or finding Quentin’s bed among the rows. He nudged the\nsleeping luxiat.\n“Oh, it can’t be time for morning prayers already—” Quentin cut off at\nthe sight of Kip looming over him, and the whites of his eyes became fully\nvisible around his irises.\nSome people lash out when they’re terrified. Quentin was a freezer.\nFor a long moment, he didn’t blink, didn’t breathe. It lasted longer than\nKip would have expected. Surely Quentin recognized him?\n“I’ve got a question for you,” Kip said, quietly so as not to disturb the\nother sleepers.\nSomething about that unlocked the luxiat, and he took a big breath. He\ngot out of his bed, his body scrawny, no muscles at all. Kip was so used to\nbeing surrounded by the training-honed physiques of the Blackguards that\nhe was kind of shocked by what was surely a more normal body than theirs.\nAgain he thought, My father did this on purpose. He surrounded me\nwith the best, so I would always use them as my comparisons, so I would\nalways stretch myself. It was a little cynical, very smart, mean in the short\nterm, and probably best in the long term. Damn. Gavin Guile was rightly a\nlegend."

Great. Look, I need you to tell me how a Prism is chosen.\nWalk with me.”\nQuentin fell in beside him, and they talked with lowered voices.\n“Chosen? They aren’t chosen. They’re discovered. I mean, they’re chosen,\nof course—by Orholam.”\n“Right,” Kip said. “Sure. So how are they ‘discovered’?”\n“All luxiats report to their superiors, passing along possibilities gleaned\nfrom their areas, those pass it on up the hierarchy of the Magisterium, and\nthe High Luxiats meet with the Spectrum to confer and test whoever has\nbeen sent.”\n“Let me guess that whoever’s been sent is always from one of the\nleading families.”\nQuentin blinked, then his eyes flicked up as he tried to remember. “With\none arguable exception, and one definite one—yes, at least for the past two\nhundred and twenty-two or -three years.”\n“And that doesn’t seem curious to you?”\n“It’s not curious at all. It’s not like you’re the first to notice that, Kip.\nBreaker? Why do some people call you—Never mind. It’s more evidence\nthat Orholam has blessed the political order of the Seven Satrapies. And the\nexceptions prove that Orholam sees all men, and when the nobles displease\nOrholam, he is more than willing to go outside our human politics.”\n“Convenient how that works for you, either way.”\nQuentin held a reproachful silence. Finally, he said, “Did you wake me\nonly to mock me?”\nKip wasn’t angry at Quentin, who seemed like he was outgrowing his\nnaiveté, though with great pain. Kip was angry at his grandfather. It seemed\nthat if there was one place free of politics, it should be Orholam’s house.\nBut that wasn’t Quentin’s fault.\n“No. I wanted to ask you how a Prism’s… uh, installed? Elevated?\nWhatever. Is there a ceremony?”\n“It’s ‘consecrated,’ actually.”\n“How’s it happen?”\nQuentin looked a little peeved that this was what Kip had woken him\nfor. “It’s all very secret. There’s a feast. There’s mourning for the Prism\nwho has died, and every light in the city and the Chromeria is extinguished\nfor the night except for the great braziers that they light in the star towers.\nPeople mingle and drink and mourn their own dead and sing songs and only\nthese little beacons of light remain.”\n“What about the ceremony itself?”\n“It is known only to the Spectrum and the High Luxiats. I think the\nSpectrum may only be told what to do on the night of. I mean, the High\nLuxiats can be very close-mouthed about the things they think are\nimportant, and it doesn’t get much more important than that.”\n“Who’s currently on the Spectrum who was there seventeen years ago?”\n“You mean when Gavin was made Prism?”"

It’s been a hard seventeen years.”\n“Would there be something about it in the restricted library?” Kip asked.\n“What’s this about, Kip?”\n“It’s about a knife.”\n“A what?”\n“A knife. Maybe a holy knife.” Kip paused. “Your face just did a thing.”\n“A thing?”\nKip was suddenly suspicious. “Do you know something about this,\nQuentin?”\nThey’d reached the restricted library. “Let’s wait until we’re inside,”\nQuentin said.\nKip manipulated the panels to bring the diffuse yellow luxin glow to the\ndarkened room. Quentin didn’t look any better in full light.\n“Kip, I—I swore to tell you anything you asked about.”\n“Uh-huh.”\n“And I wasn’t… precisely forbidden to share this, but I did know that it\nwasn’t meant to be shared. If you ask it of me, my oath to you supersedes\nan implicit understanding, but it makes me very uncomfortable.”\n“Out with it,” Kip said.\n“So you’re compelling me?”\n“Damn right.” It wasn’t even a question.\n“One of the High Luxiats let slip to me that they lost something very\nimportant some sixteen or seventeen years ago. He said that Andross Guile\nhad taken it, and then claimed it was lost.”\nKip rocked back on two feet of his chair and blew out a heavy breath. “I\nwas right,” he said. “I just woke up and I knew. Huh.”\nIt was the Blinding Knife—or, as Andross had called it, the Blinder’s\nKnife. If Kip hadn’t been working and studying and fighting every hour of\nthe day before collapsing into bed and nightmares half the time before\nrepeating all of the rest again, harder, he would have thought of it sooner.\nKip had stabbed Janus Borig’s assassin Vox with that blade, and the man\nhad failed to draft green at the very moment he’d gone toe to toe with Kip.\nIt had saved Kip’s life. Vox had shouted, ‘Atirat! Atirat, come back!’ Atirat,\nthe green goddess.\nKip had stabbed one of the green demigods at the top of the bane, and it\nhad robbed the woman of her color.\nKip had thought that Zymun had stabbed Gavin when they were\nescaping the Battle of Garriston. And he had.\nThinking again of the fight on the ship, when Kip screened out\nGrinwoody’s contorted, furious face, and the flailing blows, and Andross\nGuile’s intense concentration, and Gavin’s self-sacrifice, and his own guilt\nabout his ineptness and that he had gotten his father nearly killed—when\nKip screened it all out and thought only about the right things, everything\nbecame clear. And the right things were Gavin’s eyes, and the knife. Gavin\nhad looked at Kip and his eyes hadn’t sparkled with refractory elegance of a\nPrism’s eyes, and then Kip had seen the dagger grow."

No longer a dagger with a single gleaming blue jewel, it was\nnow a gleaming white-and-black sword with seven burning gems in the\nblade.\nKip strained to remember how his father’s eyes looked then, but Gavin\nhad been five paces away, in the darkness, shouting with pain, eyes\nnarrowed or averted.\nNot Gavin’s eyes, then. Andross Guile’s. Kip had been face-to-face with\nthe man, and he had seen the broken halos in his eyes. And since then, Kip\nhad seen his eyes again. Kip had sunk the dagger into Andross’s shoulder\nthat night, if only for a moment.\nThe Blinding Knife was what made Prisms. And the knife had taken that\naway from Gavin.\n“What is it? What does it mean?” Quentin asked.\n“Well I’m not going to tell you. I know you can’t keep a secret.”\nQuentin looked ill.\n“Quent. I’m joking.”\n“So what is it?”\nKip shook his head. “I wasn’t joking about not telling you—I’m not\ntelling you. I like you, Quentin, but I barely know you, and I don’t know\nhow much of what we say the luxiats make you share with them. I wouldn’t\neven hold it against you. It’s very hard to say no to some of these people. I\nwas joking that you can’t keep a secret.”\n“Not really joking about that, though,” Quentin said.\n“I wasn’t questioning your character.”\n“Yes you were.”\n“Yes, I was.” Kip shrugged. “Tell me I’m being irrational.”\nQuentin opened his mouth, then closed it. “Might be rational, but it\ndoesn’t feel very good.”\nThat was why Andross Guile had been so focused on the blade. Kip had\nthought him a monster for caring more about the blade than about his son\nGavin. But to Andross it wasn’t a blade, it was the future of all the satrapies.\nThe Blinding Knife was the key to making a new Prism.\nAnd Kip’s mother—his drug-addled, hate-filled wretched harpy of a\nmother—had stolen it seventeen years ago. And disappeared.\nIt had meant that Gavin couldn’t be replaced. Most Prisms lasted seven\nyears or fourteen, but despite his clashes with the Spectrum and with his\nfather, Gavin hadn’t been replaced. Because they couldn’t replace him.\nThey had lost the one implement by which the gift of Prismhood was\nconferred—and, probably, taken. They killed the old Prism with the blade,\nit took his or her power, and they somehow transferred it to the new one.\nIt didn’t explain everything—how were there two Prisms during the\nwar?—or how had Dazen faked being a Prism? But that the blade was a\nwell of power—Kip was certain of that. He’d seen the evidence.\nOrholam have mercy. What happened if the previous Prism didn’t want\nto give up his power and die? They were usually young. Who wanted to\ndie?"

To protect the Prism for the satrapies,\nand if necessary, to protect the satrapies from the Prism.\nWhat kind of spectacle would that make, if some Prism angered the\nSpectrum enough to get ousted, and they voted to kill her? It would surely\nbe the commander, perhaps one or two others, who would bring the ousted\nPrism forth and slay her to take her gift. For the good of the satrapies.\nNo wonder they shrouded it in secrecy. It might even be necessary. All\ndrafters reached their end and had to be put down, so surely Prisms must\nincur some cost for their ceaseless drafting. Perhaps they went mad.\nBut Prisms were there to Free others. When Blackguards subdued and\nkilled a screaming, fearful Prism—that would not be a moment to increase\nthe faith of the faithful.\nNo wonder it was a night of mourning and darkness.\n“You don’t look very well,” Quentin said.\n“I don’t feel very well.” It also meant that Gavin Guile was no longer a\nPrism. Even if the Blackguard found him now, he would be useless to them.\nBetter, then, to find the knife, before the Color Prince does.\nAnd all this, Andross Guile had understood in an instant. He’d acted\nimmediately. Kip didn’t know whether that made him admire the man or\nhate him.\nBut Gavin wasn’t dead. Unlike every Prism before him, he’d survived.\nBecause he was unique. Perhaps unique in all history.\n“Quentin, you said you’d figured out the shelving scheme in here?”\n“Just yesterday, actually. Shouldn’t be a problem now to find out\nwhatever you need about anyone’s family—or even the Black Cards.”\n“I’m going to have to trust you, Quentin. Can I do that?”\n“That’s an illogical question, isn’t it? For if I were not trustworthy,\nwould I not tell you that I am?”\n“Whereas if you were trustworthy, you’d point out the illogic of the\nquestion,” Kip said.\nQuentin raised a finger to protest, but then lowered it. He looked first\npuzzled, then vaguely gratified, as if Kip had shown him a particularly\nuseful trick. “Ah. Aha. I see. Thank you. How may I serve?”\n“Forget the genealogies, forget looking up the Black Cards. I want to\nknow everything you can find about the Lightbringer.”\nChapter 56\n“I looked up to your mother,” Eirene said. “She took me under her wing\nwhen my own mother died. She knew I had no women to look up to. As an\nadult, I can see why else she was doing it, of course.

One day,\nFelia Guile is visiting all the time, and inviting me to visit her, and then…\nNothing. She refused to ever even talk to me again. What happened?”\nThat strange intensity was suddenly back. The worst of it was that Gavin\nwas slowly starting to believe that Eirene Malargos wasn’t insane. She was\na normal woman driven to extremes by her circumstances. Circumstances\nthat the Guiles had much to do with.\n“I don’t know,” Gavin said, rubbing his eyes, nearly scratching himself\nwith his bandaged hand. “But I’m sure it was all my fault somehow. How’s\nit going keeping your nephew silent?”\n“This was fifteen years ago. Think about it. Why would Felia Guile shut\nme out, suddenly, then?”\nGavin fixed stupidity on his face and thought about it. It didn’t take him\nlong. First he thought it was the war or his fraud, but that was sixteen years\nago now. Fifteen years ago was when Felia had learned that Dervani\nMalargos had survived the war, after being lost in the wilderness for years,\nand was making his way home, carrying Gavin’s secret. She’d confessed at\nher Freeing that she’d tried to buy him off, first, and then sent pirates to\nintercept his ship, murdering him, or so she thought.\nFelia Guile, willing to kill to protect her last living son, but not willing\nto face the daughter whose father she’d had murdered and smile. That\nsounded like mother. Hard when she had to be, but soft underneath. Not like\nAndross Guile, who never would have thought to befriend a Malargos in the\nfirst place. But if he had, he would have played it to the hilt.\nThis world has only two kinds of people: villains and smiling villains.\nGavin said, “Of course I know why. Because I kept my silence about\nwhat happened at Sundered Rock from even her. For two years, I told no\none, and then she heard a rumor that your father was alive. She asked me\nabout it, because I’d made a passing reference at some point to him being\ndead. She asked me if I could be mistaken.” He closed his eyes and blew\nout air, as if it were a painful memory.\n“And what did you tell her?” Eirene asked.\nYou dumb cunt, I’m going to enjoy killing you. You have no idea about\nme, do you? I’m going to tear your fingers off with chains and make you eat\nthem. “I told her the man was an impostor. He wasn’t the first or the last\nwith a lot of scars and wild tales to come back to a wealthy estate to claim\nthe empty seat at the table.”\n“He wasn’t an impostor,” Eirene said.\n“Yes.

Some sugar of what the listener\nwants to hear helps a bitter lie go down. “He stood when many fell, in my\nbrother’s and my last clash.” First part was true. Second part was not. “He\nwas there, at Sundered Rock. At the end. He lived through the\nconflagration.” True, he had lived, and he had been at the battle. But he’d\nonly lived because he’d not been near the center at the end. No one had\nlived through that magical miasma except Dazen and Gavin. “Dervani\ncharged me at the end, trying to save Dazen. He… died heroically.” Pure\nfabrication.\n“You lie!” she said.\nGavin looked away. Looked back at her. Pursed his lips. “He tried. He…\ncharged me, knocked me over. He pointed a pistol at my face, and it\nmisfired. When I rose, I disarmed him, and… he broke. I grabbed a javelin\nand threw it through his back as he ran away. I didn’t see his body\nafterward, but I’ve seen a lot of battle. He didn’t live through that. I\nguarantee it. I then picked up that pistol. Little thing. Decorated with silver\nsparrows, if I remember right. Must have been a backup pistol. Be the only\nreason it was still loaded that late in the battle. No bigger than my hand.\nOdd thing in the middle of a battlefield. There were no damned weapons\nhandy except that javelin and that pistol. I couldn’t bear to draft the least\nluxin at that moment, and my brother was barely conscious. I took that little\npistol, and I put it between my brother’s eyes. It didn’t misfire for me.”\nThe dead look on my face doesn’t have to be painted on. It’s close\nenough to truth to bring those memories close to the surface again. The\ndetail about Dervani’s pistol was particularly good. How would Gavin\nknow of a small secondary pistol carried by one of Dazen’s retainers?\n“No,” Eirene whispered. “No.”\n“My mother didn’t understand. She never saw battle.

Those at the top have\nnothing to gain in a revolution like the Color Prince was proposing. Inviting\nan aggrieved army into your city? You shouldn’t even invite a friend’s army\ninto your cities.\nBut hatred and envy birth self-destruction in every heart that gives them\na bed to breed in. To dislodge the Guiles, this woman without children\nmight be willing to risk losing all her family owned as well.\nSo I lie, in service of the greater good. As always.\nStill she stared.\nThere was nothing to be gained now. If she felt pushed into a decision,\nshe’d doubt it in the future. Whatever action she took, she had to feel that it\nwas hers, and inevitable with what she knew, then it would be irreversible,\nand their alliance unbreakable.\nThe fingers? She might never pay for that. Or at least not for a long time.\nGavin would have to bank the coals of his rage, let them glow warm under\nthe earth. Someday. Maybe. But not today. Not soon.\nHe didn’t hold her gaze. He looked at her, glanced away, looked back,\neasing his shoulders into a slump, as if he felt exposed. Not a challenge. It\nwas important to let her think this through.\nFinally, she said, “After the wars, my family had estates everywhere, but\nmany of them had been devastated. They required huge piles of gold to\nrestore. Tens of thousands of danars to import vines for the vineyards, to\nbuy new slaves for the cotton fields, to pay the tuitions of drafters and\nindenture them afterward, to rent and then finally to buy the river barges to\ntransport our goods. New axes for logging, iron for the brackets of new\nwater wheels, millstones which if cut from local softer stone would cost\nhalf as much but only last a third as long versus those we shipped in. But\nevery time I would do my calculations in my father’s ledgers—actually, the\nledgers my father’s steward Melanthes kept, but he died during the Blood\nWar—every time, I would see these line items: ‘Cost of Hired Guards,’ and\nsometimes ‘Bribes to Blood Forest Conns,’ and ‘Losses to Pirates.’ And at\nthe end of the year, ‘Repairs for Damage from Raids’ and ‘Replacement\nDrafters from Raids.’\n“Eventually, of course, I filled those ledgers and moved on to new ones,\nbut I left those columns. And I studied what those costs had been. Old\nMelanthes was our steward for forty-five years, and he could predict those\ncosts within a few points per hundred after a while. When you know you’re\ngoing to lose one boat in ten when they make a Tyrean orange run, you\nknow what sort of profit you need to make in order to justify trying next\nyear. Over time, it matters. My father never realized that Melanthes was the\nreal reason we even had estates by the time the False Prism’s War and the\nBlood War were finished, though we lost too many sons and daughters.”\nShe took a deep breath. “But every time I picked up those ledgers to make a"

        "text": "Blood War were finished, though we lost too many sons and daughters.”\nShe took a deep breath. “But every time I picked up those ledgers to make a\ndecision about shipping this or that, I saw those costs. I haven’t had to pay\nthose.\n“I’m very good with numbers, and I’ve compared my numbers to\nMelanthes’s. And what I’ve learned, what I can never deny when I see those\ncolumns laid out before me, is that I owe you, Gavin Guile. How much is a\nmatter of what assumptions I make. For though those parts-per-hundred\nlosses are unyielding—I would have lost men and treasure to raids and\nmurder and piracy at some point regardless—when I might have lost them\nmatters most. If you lose a prize stallion and a mare from a herd of\nhundreds, it stings. If you lose them before you ever breed the herd, it\ndestroys you. So, I worked my abacus many different ways and calculated\nwhat I could. I chose not to quantify any emotional toll of losing family\nmembers or trusted servants and slaves. I also found it impossible to\nquantify the merely possible, but significant cost of my own lost time,\nshould enough of my own close family have been killed that I would have\nhad to marry and bear my own children. Women in my family have tended\nto have quick recoveries, but it was impossible to calculate how many\npregnancies I might have suffered, or exactly how much work I might have\nbeen able to do while in the late stages of pregnancy or early stages of\nrecovery. And of course, I didn’t assign any value to not having to marry or\nbear children—as I now don’t. Given my present wealth, I would pay a\ngreat deal more for such a privilege than I would have were circumstances\nquite different. You see you present me with conundrums.”\n“You may have lost me somewhere in there,” Gavin said. He thought he\nfollowed, but it was rarely a mistake to make an enemy think they were\nsmarter than you.\n“Because you stopped the war, Gavin. And then you wiped out the\npirates. Several times. And that’s without crediting you for taxes falling\nbecause there was no longer a war to finance. One way or another, Gavin\nGuile, your family cost me my father, my last uncle, and four distant\ncousins.\n“But from my calculations, I owe you somewhere between four years\nand twenty-three days, to twenty-seven years and sixteen days. Years of my\nlabor. Years of my life. You’ve saved me perhaps a thousand thousand\ndanars; you’ve allowed me to reestablish my family, and by stopping the\nBlood War, you have certainly saved me the blood of many people I love. I\nwant to kill you so badly that my stomach aches, and I’ve been getting the\nkind of headaches that would bring an empire low just thinking about you. I\nam well-known, perhaps famous, for dealing straight. I’ve never cheated\nanyone, though it has been in my power to do so for quite some time. But\nhow does one balance blood?”\n“I leave a complicated legacy,” Gavin said drily.\n“One balances blood with blood,” she said.\n“Oh, that was a rhetorical question,” Gavin said. “But you seem both far\ntoo grim and far too elated at my suffering to be about to say, ‘Gavin,"

Did you hear about the Battle of Ox Ford?”\n“I was so busy… felt like I was stuck rowing in endless circles. Missed\nit.”\n“The Chromeria lost fifty-five thousand men in one day. Thirty-five\nthousand of those were Ruthgari. My people.”\nGavin felt like he’d been kicked. “What happened?”\n“General Azmith thought to crush the Color Prince against the Ao\nRiver.”\n“The Ao? That river’s not that deep, is it?” Gavin asked.\n“Deep enough, during the wet season.”\nGavin had only seen the river in summer.\n“The general tried to catch the Blood Robes as they crossed the ford.\nTheir wight-drafters drafted new bridges within half an hour, encircled our\narmies, and crushed us against the river instead. The Blood Foresters hated\nthe plan, and had sworn to withdraw, but General Azmith wasn’t moved. He\nwent ahead without them. So the Color Prince invaded Blood Forest, and\nBlood Forest lost no one, while my people took a blow from which we may\nnot recover.”\nMy people. She said it not as a native daughter, but as a leader. She must\nown Satrapah Ptolos outright. But that wasn’t the worst of it. With the\nbattles of Ru and Ox Ford, the Seven Satrapies had endured two military\ndisasters in a row. Even with the riches of Ruthgar, a satrapy could only\nstand to lose so many lives.\n“Nor have things gotten better. After Ox Ford, he split his armies and\nsent half up around the headwaters of the Ao, trying to cut off their supply\nlines.”\nThat was a long trip, and a long time to be without half your army.\nGavin would have sent small parties across the river to raid, not half his\narmy.\n“General Azmith entreated Raven Rock to hold out, told them that he\nwould save them. They held, but he got there too late. He fled in disarray,\nleaving behind cannons and gunpowder, and whole wagons full of rations\nand muskets.”\n“Clearly, there’s only one thing you can do,” Gavin said.\n“And what’s that?”\n“Free me.”\n“And why would I do that?”\n“Because I win battles. Because if you want to keep track of debts owed\nin blood, then the Color Prince owes you most dearly.”\n“I don’t know about that. I think the blood debt is yours.”\n“Mine?” Gavin asked with real incredulity. “How could those lives\npossibly be put on me?”\n“You let this war happen. You could have stopped it in Garriston, or long\nbefore then.”\n“What? What?! Everything I’ve done I’ve done to stop this war! How\nbad are your spies if you believe anything else?”\n“You’re a liar, Gavin Guile. They all agree on that.”\nIt was one thing to be killed for your sins, many as they were. It was"

It was\nsomething else altogether to be killed for the very thing you’d been trying\nto stop. He tried another tack. “Do you remember your number, in the\nlottery?”\n“One fifty seven. Everyone remembers their Orholam-damned number.\nTwo days with that damned thing folded in my hand, wondering if it would\nmean my death.”\nThe lottery had been a furious young Gavin’s way to end the\ninterminable Blood War. Only the leading families of both sides had been\ngiven numbers. Two thousand of the richest and most connected people in\nBlood Forest and Ruthgar had been gathered at Gavin’s command. His\nBlackguards had apoplectic fits at the very thought of it. Not that that\nstopped him.\nGavin had invited them all to the hippodrome to pray for peace.\nAttendance was not voluntary. No drafters were allowed in except those\nwho were members of the families, and Gavin’s Blackguards had relieved\neach person of larger weapons, though knives and the like for personal\ndefense had been allowed, allaying their suspicions. The heads of all the\nfamilies understood you didn’t want swords and ataghans and spears when\nyou gathered bitter enemies in one place.\nEach family had lined up in a column according to their number. A\nrandom number, so they thought. Felia Guile had helped Gavin decide who\nshould be in the front ranks. She’d also helped with the deception itself:\nGavin had marked each folded slip of paper with a superviolet number as\neach person dropped it in. Felia had worn Lucidonius’s superviolet\nspectacles around her neck, though no one knew they were that, and fewer\nstill would have known what those spectacles did. With her head bowing as\nif in prayer each time she reached into the bowl, she’d look through the\nspectacles and grab out the appropriate paper.\nIt worked for all but one family, who had swapped their folded papers.\nYounger, and angrier, Gavin had merely shrugged and said, “They want to\nlie to the Prism? Sow the wind.” His mother knew how the saying ended.\nShe’d acquiesced.\nWith the columns of families facing him in a circle, with only the lowest\nnumber from each family standing in the narrowest circle, facing Gavin, he\nhad gestured to a large circular wooden table he’d placed on the raised\nspina with him. He had led a prayer for peace, some drivel he didn’t\nremember. After they’d all agreed to his sufficiently abstract and non-\nbinding words to Orholam, bobbing their heads and making the sign of the\nseven, he’d gestured to that rough-hewn round table beside him. “My\nfriends,” he said. “Here sits the table of peace. In the blessed light of\nOrholam, who will join me at it?”\nOne family, the Blue Bells, had sent their mother forward. The Blue\nBells had once been numerous and fierce. Now they were a shadow. Two\ndaughters, two distant cousins left, and not much land, no riches. They were\nwithin a breath of being commoners or being extinct.\nEveryone else looked to their lady or lord, banconn or conn."

Your war has stripped your\nlands bare. It has soaked every field in unclean blood, with each act rivaling\nthe next in baseness and inhumanity. Your war is an affront to Orholam. All\nthis you know, but your bloodlust is greater than your shame. You daren’t\nask forgiveness for your atrocities because then you might have to extend\nforgiveness for your enemies’. Your bitterness is a boil on your faces,\nobscuring your sight. So every year, you send a tribute of your sons and\ndaughters to death, so you can continue your foolishness and pride. And\nevery year, you send a far greater tribute of those who have been pulled in\nthe wake of your impiety, your blasphemy, your arrogance. You have not\nonly insulted Orholam; you have insulted me. You have not only robbed\nyour own families and your enemies’ families and the innocent, you have\nrobbed the Seven Satrapies. You have had satraps and, yes, even Prisms\ncome to you and to your fathers to stop these wars. You have responded\nwith temporary truces and lies. Lulls in which you rearm and breed, picking\nsons and daughters based on who might be the strongest drafter, who might\nhave the most colors.\n“I know. Yes, I am the product of this breeding myself. But now I am\nPrism, and what I do today isn’t for my family; it is for the Seven Satrapies.\nToday, your war is finished. Now I ask again, will any join me at the table\nof peace?” He swept his hand, as if in invitation toward them.\nNone did. Gavin, who moved the world on the fulcrum of his desires,\nGavin, loser and leader, drafter deceiver, exile executioner, Gavin was being\nignored.\nHe stared at the sun, as if praying. It was one of those white-hot days,\nthe delta air was thicker than blood, the sounds of the city coming in even\nto the center of the hippodrome. He prayed, but he wasn’t praying. He was\nfilling himself with power.\n“So be it,” Gavin said. He swept his hand again, and this time, blue\nluxin spikes shot out along the superviolet guide-wires he’d place at the\nthroats of each man and woman in the first rank of the circle. Through the\ncenter of each throat, and into the center of each spine.\nThe front person in each family’s column dropped dead.\nIt was so sudden, so stark and brutal and so quiet that no one said a\nword. Many didn’t even know why the people had fallen.\n“War seems so random,” Gavin shouted. “Does it not? Who lives, who\ndies? It’s like a lottery. But in my lottery, only you who are responsible for\nthis war will die. I think the common folk will prefer this greatly.

In\neach case, “Orholam” had picked the most pugnacious, the bitterest, the\nmost hateful or guiltiest person in the whole family to be first in line. Some\nfamilies had to be happy to be rid of their most troublesome member, and\nfar more so to see the worst of the other families die.\nBut these were families bred to war, in many cases literally so.\n“Are you insane?!” a Willow asked.\n“You killed my father!” a sixteen-year-old, fiery-haired Green Apple\nshouted. Damned Blood Foresters and their tempers. The young man pulled\nout his belt dagger, a wild look in his eyes.\n“Your father was a fool, and you’ll be a dead fool if you attack me,”\nGavin told him.\n“Ahhh!” The young man charged the platform.\nSome people simply don’t react well to surprise.\nGavin astounded everyone by turning his back. “There’s no need for\nanyone else to die,” he shouted. Behind his back, the rising young\nBlackguard Watch Captain Ironfist materialized from nowhere and cut the\nyoung man down before he reached Gavin.\nIt was so nonsensical that Gavin was swept into sudden fury. “Sit at the\ngoddamn table, and no one else needs to die!” he roared.\nAnother pulse and another row of men and women died. He’d almost\nforgotten the sound of projectiles thunking into human flesh.\nThey broke and fled across the sands. He’d known they would. The\ndamned cowards. Like he’d never set up an ambush in the course of the\nPrisms’ War. He still thought of it as the Prisms’ War as the losers did,\nthough he didn’t think he’d failed once to call it the False Prism’s War when\nhe spoke of it.\nHe was so furious he thought of waiting until they were in its teeth to\ntrigger the trap. No. No. Enough killing. The point was to shock them into\nsubmission, not to turn the few survivors against him forever.\nHe reached into the superviolet he’d laid under the sand out in a great\nring and pushed luxin into it, hard. A great spike-toothed ring of death leapt\nout of the sand in a fence around all the nobles. Green and blue and yellow\nluxin twined, shivered, begged the nobles to impale themselves on the\nbarbs.\nThe nobles tripped over each other, literally falling and smashing into\neach other as they stopped.\nBeyond the glowing wall of death, blocking each exit from the\nhippodrome, they saw stony-eyed Blackguards, weapons unsheathed, in the\nloose, easy posture of killers, luxin readied.\n“No one else need die!” Gavin shouted. “Get back to your lines.”\nHis Blackguards and the drafters he’d brought echoed his command,\ncircling outside the wall, bellowing at the people inside, “Back to your line.\nNow! Move!”\nOthers were gentler, but the result was the same. In minutes, the lines\nhad reformed. Now, more quietly, Gavin said, “Would you rather die than\nhave peace? No one else in your family or on your lands has to die.”"

How is my little family to stand against the might of the\nWillows on one side and the Malargoses on the other?”\n“Whoever takes my peace gains my protection,” Gavin said. “Whoever\nbreaks my peace gains swift and brutal death.” He swept a hand slowly\nacross the columns, and this time set glowing yellow targets where the next\nmissiles would fly. In the front of many of the columns were children, or\nfavorite aunts, favorite sons. Orholam forgive the families if they were too\nstubborn even now. Orholam forgive him.\nHe held the tense silence until someone was about to speak, and then he\nswung a hand so fast at the table that the entire crowd flinched, thinking it\nanother attack. He sent out waves of sub-red so that the air around him\nshimmered, a trick he’d honed in the war to make it look like he was\nradiating power, and roared, pointing at the table, “This is the end of your\nwar. Who. Will. Sit?”\nOver the bodies of the dead obstinate and the dead murderers and the\ndead proud, they made peace. It hadn’t been easy, but it had been quick. Not\nall justice could be done: how far back does one go with judgment, after\nwhat horror in the chain does one say, ‘All before this is forgiven’? But\npeace had been forged. Hostages were exchanged, and hostages were sent\nto the Chromeria where Gavin would have personal oversight of them. In\nthe years that followed, a test of the Prism’s Peace had come, of course. It\nhad come from a Guile cousin, Marcos-Sevastian Guile, who’d exacted\nvengeance for a wartime rape in like fashion, doubtless thinking his blood\nconnection to Gavin gave him extra leeway. If he’d had a shred of the Guile\nintellect, he’d have known it meant exactly the opposite.\nMarcos-Sevastian had been found mutilated in the town square, limbs\npiled neatly nearby, a sign propped under his bloody chin: “So too to all\nwho break the Prism’s Peace.”\nAnd later, Gavin had needed to send an emissary to a Ruthgari lord\nusing his economic might to ruin one of his vassals who’d turned on him\nearly that day.\nThat had required only a stern talk. Blood and words. Peace by sword\nand will.\nEirene Malargos had been the first of the heads of the most powerful\nfamilies to sign.\nNow Gavin said to her, “Do you think that lottery was random? Your\nuncle Perakles was a warrior coward. Happy to take insult, happy to send\nmen to die, but would never dare the line himself. And his wife Thera? You\nthink that vicious heifer had it in her to lead a great family to a picnic, much\nless to a peace?

She selected you, Eirene. Do you remember\nthe moment at the table, when they wanted you to be the hostage at the\nChromeria, because Tisis was too young? My mother picked you to lead\nyour family. Your lottery number was her choice. So you can decide if you\nowe me everything or nothing, but your life and your position, those you\nowe to my mother.”\nEirene’s eyes were damp, and Gavin didn’t know if she was thinking of\nthose who’d died that day, or her father who’d died before, or all that she\nhad lost in leading her family, or whether she was thinking about Felia\nGuile and the friendship of that great woman that she’d been deprived of.\n“Did she… did she speak of me? At the end?”\nThe most tempting lies are often best shunned. It proves your honesty.\nGavin shook his head slowly. “I’m sorry. Our time was… very limited. The\nColor Prince was almost literally at the door, and we had a city to defend. It\nwas an abbreviated Freeing, at best.”\nAnd he had her. By Orholam’s beard, he had her. He was going to claw\nhis way up out of this cell, and out of this country, and he was going to\nclimb the heavens. He would fell the sun. There was nothing Gavin Guile\ncouldn’t do. He was not only his magic. He was a man unlike any other\nman who’d ever gone before. He was a man to rival Lucidonius himself. He\nwas a god.\n“Lady Malargos, set me free. I will win this war, and I will repay every\ndebt you are owed, and I will make the Color Prince pay in blood.”\nBut then the door opened, and of all people, of all the real Gavin’s old\nfriends and lovers and enemies and those who were all three in a singular\nbody, the Nuqaba walked in. She was dressed in the casual style that a\nParian lady would usually only wear in her own home, among her ladies\nand eunuchs, and that she was dressed so here told Gavin that she was an\nhonored guest and a close friend of Eirene Malargos. She wore jeweled\nslippers, women’s loose mid-calf-length trousers secured with a multifolded\nbrocade belt with long fringe, a light blouse open in the front, and a vest\nsnug about the bust decorated with precious stones matching those on a\nnumber of necklaces and a loose scarf about her hair.\nShe wore the small tattoos of her position as Nuqaba, almost invisible\nagainst her rich black skin: one just below her lower lip, and one under each\neye in decorative Old Parian script. Under the left eye, it read, “Cursed\nAccuser,” and under the right “Blessed Redeemer.”\n“Greetings, Gavin,” the leader of Paria said, “do you know what this"

Among\nother things, it detects lies, and you, you glorious fuck, you are a liar.”\nChapter 57\n“I’ve figured out something really exciting,” Quentin said. He was standing\non the table in the restricted library. His hair was askew, and he had a few\ndays’ growth of scrubby uneven beard. “Unfortunately, it’s trivial and not at\nall helpful!” He laughed, and it was the ragged sound of someone right on\nthe edge.\nKip said, “Quentin, why are your teeth red? Tell me that isn’t blood.”\n“Heh-heh-heh.” His voice pitched up crazily. “Nah, it’s not blood. Khat.\nYou know khat? It’s a stimulant. Never used it until today—uh, three days\nago. With kopi and khat and…” He looked down at several bowls below the\ntable.\n“Please tell me you haven’t been using the High Luxiats’ flower jars as\nchamber pots,” Kip said.\n“Kip, under a thin veneer of excitement, I think I might be about to\ncollapse.”\n“That seems likely,” Kip said. “What did—did you drink the flowers’\nwater first?”\n“I couldn’t drink it second. That would be gross. Plus, there wouldn’t be\nany room.”\nKip shook his head. He reached up and grabbed Quentin and put the\nyoung man down on the floor. He didn’t trust Quentin to jump down\nwithout hurting himself. The reedy scholar barely weighed more than Teia.\n“Um, thanks?” Quentin said. “And please don’t touch me again. I\ndon’t… I just don’t like being touched. Thanks.”\nKip shrugged. So Quentin was weird. Not any weirder than the rest of\nthem. “So…?”\n“The Black Cards and the Lightbringer are connected!”\n“That is… exciting. I guess. How?”\n“That we don’t know anything about either of them! Ha!”\nKip said, “Not so exciting.”\n“I, I, I told you that I figured out the organization scheme, right?”\n“That was like three weeks ago.”\n“Right, right. I, I found all the references to the Lightbringer—I’ll show\nyou those in, in, presently—and there was a problem with all of them—”\n“Problem?” Kip interrupted. “What kind of problem?”\n“One moment, one moment! So I had this thought and I went and I\nfound all the books on the Black Cards. I couldn’t find them at first, but\nthen I didn’t look for books on Black Cards—those have all been burned or\nstolen or what, what have you—so instead I looked for books about all the\ncards, but written before the Black Cards were declared black, that is,\nheretical, see?”\n“Smart.” Kip wasn’t following, but it didn’t seem to matter.\n“And I found the very same thing!”\n“Same as what?” Kip asked.\n“Same as the Lightbringer mentions!”\n“But you didn’t tell—”"

Spaces floated as if someone\nhad written in invisible ink in them, but there were no words there. “What’s\nwith the gaps?”\n“Look at the translation book, right, right below it.”\nThe book of translation had gaps, too. They weren’t precisely aligned\nwith gaps in the original, at least not by spacing. But Kip could guess that\nthey must be aligned by meaning.\n“It’s, it’s the same in all of these,” Quentin said. “Someone’s erased a\nlot.”\n“Erased ink?”\n“Or, or, or… or they wrote in some invisible ink. You’re the\npolychrome. You tell me.”\nKip shielded his eyes from the lantern and widened his pupils out to\nlook in sub-red. Nothing. He soaked up some sub-red luxin from the lantern\nand brought it to his fingers—\n“Kip, you’re forbidden to draft sub-red in a library!” Quentin said. “You\ncan get expelled!” He obviously meant to whisper the last word, but he did\nit so loudly he might as well have been shouting.\nBut Kip was already done. There were no heat-reactive inks. He\nnarrowed his gaze to superviolet—so often used for secret writing. Nothing\nthere. He gently streamed superviolet luxin over the page, but nothing\nfluoresced. Then he donned each pair of colored spectacles in turn and\ngazed at the page. Nothing, nothing in any color.\nBut when he drew forth his superviolet spectacles, he found that one\nlens was broken.\n“Oh, hells,” he said.\n“Oh, Ben-hadad didn’t tell you about—Oops!” Quentin said.\n“Tell me about what?”\n“So! Nothing in any color?” Quentin asked.\n“Tell me about what?”\n“They all thought you were dead. He had some experiments he needed\nto do. Something happened. And then I think he’s been trying to find the\nright time to tell you. He, he feels terrible.”\n“Then why are you telling me this?”\nHe looked nonplussed. “It slipped.”"

Show me\nthis.”\n“It’s all the same. I’ve copied them all out. In each book, in each\ntranslation, there are fragments only of Lightbringer prophecies. I thought\nat first they might have used bad ink. You can see that in some old\nmanuscripts: ink that fades with age and gets illegible. But you wouldn’t\nhave the translations with blanks in exactly the same places.”\n“Why not? I mean, if the gap was already there when they wrote the\ntranslation, why wouldn’t they leave a gap, too?”\n“Because I looked at the various times in which each of these\ntranslations were made, and there have been different copyists’ notations\nused to show that a text was illegible or absent. None wrote those notations\nin these gaps, and none of their methods involved leaving long blanks, it’s\nan inefficient use of the space on the pages, which are often expensive. So,\nso someone erased the relevant sections in the copies and the translations.\nWe didn’t lose all of the Lightbringer prophecies in existence, of course.\nBut in these books, we get only fragments. And not all the texts have\ntranslations, so some of these translations are my own.”\n“Wait, wait, wait,” Kip said. “How did they erase ink?”\n“With hide you can scrape it off. Often followed by putting down\nanother layer of whitewashing solution. With papyrus, you—”\n“But I don’t see any change between the scrolls where there’s writing\nand where there isn’t. It doesn’t look like it’s been treated.”\n“The treatment may be so old that it’s impossible to tell the difference.”\n“Meaning that the erasures happened a long time ago?”\n“Well, that makes sense with those with old translations, but that’s not\napplicable to all of them. If there was a single time period where someone\nerased lots of documents all at once—”\n“Like the Office of Doctrine? When the Chromeria anointed luxors?”\nQuentin bobbed his head, chagrined. “They must have figured out some\nmixtures of luxins that would bond with ink and lift it out. When combating\nheresy, it’s the kind of thing they would have loved to find. And use.”\n“Those assholes,” Kip said. “Long dead and still causing problems.” If\nTeia had been alive during that time, the luxors would have burned her on\nOrholam’s Glare as a heretic.\n“Anyway, here’s the prophecies I’ve got, and then I want to tell you one\nmore thing.”\nKip read:\nDeath in hand, his card, his lot\nHe fights/struggles with/kills forethought\n“He fights/struggles with/kills?” Kip asked.\n“That was my translation. Sorry. It was a tough one. It could mean he’s\nimpulsive? Maybe he kills without thinking ahead?”\n“Are they all this bad?” Kip asked.\nHe could tell the words wounded Quentin. “Some of these languages are\nhighly contextual, and the pertinent portions have been deliberately erased.\nSomeone did this exactly so it would be impossible to reconstruct.”"

But look!” He pulled out the two books side by\nside. “The translation is wrong, so it wasn’t erased. They missed it. The\nablative with this phrasing usually would mean ‘on the gift of light,’ but it\ncould also mean ‘on the giver of light.’”\n“You keep looking at me like I’m supposed to have a revelation,” Kip\nsaid.\n“In the original, the common way to construct it would be ‘doniae luxi.’\nBut the word order doesn’t matter in an inflected language except for\nemphasis, but here it’s ‘luxi doniae.’”\n“Still not—”\n“Centuries ago the Parian accent gave way to the Ruthgari, and ‘luxi’\nstarted to be transcribed as ‘luci’.”\n“Still…”\n“Luci doniae. Which in the nominative case is… C’mon. This is like\nhaving to explain the punch line of a dirty joke.”\n“Oh! Lucidonius! So a poem ‘On Lucidonius’? But what does that\nmean?”\nQuentin deflated. “Well, I don’t know. But it does mean the Lightbringer\nis tied to Lucidonius somehow. The Light Giver and the Light Bringer?\nWhat if they’re the same? What if the Lightbringer has already come?”\n“And nobody noticed?”\n“Everyone noticed Lucidonius.

This last one is a contested\nprophecy, but I don’t know whether it’s because they aren’t sure if it’s about\nthe Lightbringer, or if it was contested later because it’s impossible.”\n… he’ll pluck the immortal’s own beard and steal the shade from his\nhead in the Great Library.\nQuentin shrugged. “The plucking of beard hair is an idiom for vexing\nhim, and to steal the shade from a man’s head—to a desert people? Not\nappreciated. So irritate and infuriate? Why the repetition? I don’t know.\nChecking the dates on both of those idioms to see when they were in use in\nthe pertinent cultures might shed some light, but it’s a rejected prophecy\nanyway, so that’ll be low on my list.”\nKip said, “But why contest that one? It seems specific and clear.”\n“It is. Unfortunately, we know that Lucidonius never went near the\nGreat Library, and it’s been ash for nigh unto three hundred years now.\nTellari separatists burned it down. Gave their lives, merely to take away\nsomething we loved and that made us better.

Then he took his hand away at Quentin’s\nfrown.\n“And what’s that?” Kip asked.\n“There’s some great stuff in these libraries. I mean I found out why the\nFeast of Light and Darkness can be a month off the actual date of the\nautumnal equinox, like it was this past year. It’s—never mind. Doesn’t\nmatter.

She was standing in the\ndoorway of the Prism’s exercise room.\nAs the winter months had passed, Kip and Karris had fallen into a\ncomfortable rhythm. They spent most of the morning together every day,\nsix days a week, then each went off to their other duties.\n“Putting in a bit of time on the bag.” He shrugged.\nWhen he’d first started training with Karris, Kip hadn’t known her well\nenough to pick out her moods, so over the months, he’d only seen after the\nfact that she was slowly taking off the shuttered lenses of depression. When\nshe was down, she was more serious, adult, focused. She had that mask on\nnow, her hair dyed raven’s black, pulled back.\n“He’s coming back,” Kip said. He turned away from the heavy bag and\nlet his green luxin gloves dissolve. Six months had passed since Ru, almost\nsix months of training and fighting and watching only full Blackguards go\nout on the skimmers to look for Gavin or the bane. Almost six months of\nbad news from the war: the loss at Ruic Head, the raids in northern Atash,\nthe cataclysm at Ox Ford, the pyrrhic victory at Two Mills Junction, the\nsteady reading of the Lists, the rolls now full of names of those who’d died\nfrom camp diseases, infections, dysentery.\nAlmost six months hitting this damn bag, hoping to convince that one\ntorn seam to give way and rip open, and it had barely loosened. It was a\nyouthful fantasy to beat the sawdust out of a heavy bag, he knew. He knew\nit, but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to do it.\n“So you always say.” Karris disappeared behind a screen set up off to\none side, and reappeared, wearing the equivalent of Blackguard garb. Red\ntoday.\nThe White was snipping away all Karris’s ties to the Blackguard. The\nred garb had been an early imposition. Then she’d forbidden Karris to train\nin the Blackguard’s area in the great yard below the Chromeria. Forbade her\nto draft. Sent her on little errands. And if it seemed some days like Karris\nhad been crying before she came to train Kip, she never missed a day, and\nKip knew that she’d come to look forward to their training. It was one last\nlittle slice of her old life, mixed with a new purpose.\n“I’m right,” he said. “Last time I was worrying about when Gavin would\nshow up and save the day, I turned around and he was standing right there.\nScared a stain right into my pants.”\n“Kip! Ew!”\n“I was wondering,” Kip said to distract her. “Why do you always call me\nKip?”\n“Because I’m not a Blackguard anymore?” she asked. She did this\nsometimes, making him dig deeper.\n“It’s not that. Some of the others use Breaker for me, too.”\n“Breaker’s your warrior name.”\n“You teach me how to fight as much as anyone.

She balanced it\nacross her shoulder and stooped, digging through another barrel of nubs and\nguards. She found what she was looking for and fastened a hard wooden\nguard with a sponge projecting on each end. Pensive, she said, “We put on a\nface when we go into battle. You can forget Kip for a time and become\nBreaker when musket balls are whistling past your ears and your throat\nburns with the black smoke, and the luxin rage and battle rage join in you.\nBut you’re still Kip. Inside, somewhere, even in that moment, you’re still\nyou. Some warriors want to throw away the other man trembling within\nthem and become only a warrior. It can be done for a time.\n“But the other man always comes back, and if he’s been shut in a closet\nsomewhere, unable to grow and learn and come to accept what the warrior\ndoes and what the warrior loves, then both of them will be cripples in peace\nand in war. If you despise your own frailty, rather than come to peace with\nit, you’ll not only hate yourself, you’ll hate everyone who’s frail. A good\ncommander knows the strength of his men and pushes them to the edge of\nit, but not over. A good man knows his own strength and does the same.”\nShe smiled. “Of course, at your age, you like to think your limits are both a\nlot greater and a lot narrower than they actually are.”\n“And at yours, you like to think the converse?” Kip said. He wasn’t\nexactly sure what he meant, but it seemed witty.\nInstead, Karris’s mouth tightened, her eyes narrowed, and her voice\nwent chilly. “You’re calling me old?”\nKip gaped. “I—I…”\nShe grinned.\n“Ah hell. Got me again.”\n“Watch your mouth, young man, or I’ll wash it out with soap.”\n“That was only my second!” Kip complained. She said he could say hell\ntwice a day, no more. Blackguards guard their tongues, and all that.\n“I distinctly counted three,” Karris said.\nKip glowered. Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell.\n“I know what you’re thinking,” she said sternly. “And quit it.”\nHell, hell, hell. Kip smiled.\n“I heard that, too. You always smile when you’re being secretly defiant.”\nI do? I do not!\n“Yes, you do,” she said.\n“Now you’re just guessing,” Kip said.\nShe shrugged. “If that makes you feel better…”\nHe grinned, but then got pensive. They were both skipping a ceremony.\n“So… this Feast of Waxing Light. What are they doing? I mean, without\nGavin, what is there to do?”\nIt had been almost six months since the autumnal equinox that had seen\na sea demon and a whale do battle for the Chromeria, or for the Cerulean\nSea.

Six months of war grinding its gears slowly through the winter,\nshipping made difficult with heavy seas and torrential downpours, and ships\nlost and caravans delayed and stalling actions as the Color Prince pushed\ninto Blood Forest. But the dry season was here, and all the satrapies knew\nthat meant more war.\n“First there’s a procession in honor of your grandfather, the promachos.\nSome fireworks. Some martial demonstrations. Given that there’s a war to\nspend money on, it will be a much-diminished thing.”\n“What isn’t, these days?” Kip asked.\nShe shook her head. “Was I a know-it-all like you when I was young?\nDon’t answer that.”\n“Do I have to go?” Kip asked.\n“You don’t want to? Even diminished, it will be a bigger party than\nyou’ve ever seen.”\n“I’d rather learn things that might save my life than eat cakes and\ncandies.”\nShe gave him a dubious look.\n“Depends on the cake.”\n“Chocolate?”\n“That would be worth dying for,” Kip said.\n“Can’t get chocolate worth the name since we lost northern Atash,” she\nsaid.\n“Thus me, here.”\nKarris grinned. “Today, I’ll show you the sharana ru, the tygre striper.”\nShe hefted the flexible spear in her hands, and spun it easily. “The sharana\nru is said to be carved from sea demon bone. It doesn’t work the way other\nmaterials work. Note.” She spun the flexible shaft, and stopped it with an\narm. The shaft bent around it like jelly, more flexible than a green branch. It\nsprang back suddenly.\n“Excellent,” Kip said. With his slowly growing knowledge of weapons,\nhe guessed that the sharana ru would be a difficult weapon to master, but\nwould then be terribly effective because it would move with surprising\nspeed when used properly. Still, an odd weapon. How fragile was it to get\nthat springiness? Could it parry a sword?\n“You haven’t seen the half of it,” Karris said.\n“And what’s the half of it?” Kip asked.\nShe looked like she’d been about to tell him, until his big mouth said\nthat.\n“Let’s let you find out the hard way,” she said.\n“Oh, goodie,” he said. He scowled, though he deserved it for acting wise\nwith her.\n“Fencing,” she said. “Let’s see that yellow. Five, four…”\nKip drew in a bit of superviolet and then shot it across the room at the\ncontrol panel. Yellow light bathed the room. He sucked it in hungrily, the\nrush of clarity giving him the hard edge he would need to draft the perfect\nyellow he’d practiced so much. He flicked out his hand, and with it, yellow\nliquid that he furiously worked to solidify and narrow as it streamed from\nhim.\n“Three, two…” she counted.\n“Too fast, too fast!”\nShe lofted the sharana ru and began swinging the dual blades in loose\ncircles, swishing the air.

Excess yellow luxin coating\nthe blade burst into light with the energy of the collision between blunt\nyellow blade and blunt wooden guard.\nHe didn’t make it, and instead the yellow luxin burst apart.\nBut both of them had narrowed their eyes against the blast of light, used\nto this. A slash cut across Kip’s front shin, a smear of ink from the sponge\non the sharana ru’s guard: a bruise for Kip and a point for Karris.\nShe let him form the sword correctly. It took more than ten seconds. And\nthey went again. Their bout was fast, ridiculously fast, and finished in less\nthan two seconds.\nHe cursed inwardly, and settled into his stance again.\nAgain, a loss. And again, and again, and again. Aptly named, the tygre\nstriper left Kip with streaks—mercifully of ink, rather than blood—across\nstomach, arms, forehead, shin, and hands.\nOn the tenth round, he scored a point, just before Karris did. She\nnodded. In a real fight, they’d both be dead. The Blackguard didn’t want\ndead Blackguards who’d also killed their opponents; they wanted\nunscratched Blackguards who’d killed their opponents. Still, from the\nhumble acorn…\nAgain, a loss. And again, and again, and again. But Kip was starting to\nfigure out how the sharana ru worked, how it sprang back when Karris\nwould snap one side against her own leg as she attempted a short sweep—a\nfeint—at Kip’s face to set up the speedier long sweep. The flexibility itself\ngave a small measure of predictability, for what bent must become straight.\nEven with the guard and the sponge, Karris’s weapon hurt. Every time\nthey sparred, Kip’s body was covered with bruises for days. His favorite\nwas when she used a rapier and his bruises looked like freckles. Bruise-\nfreckles on the turtle-bear. Not that Karris cared if he complained about it.\nAnd her fighting—learned the hard way with Blackguards—wasn’t the\nspeedy, light dance the court duelists used. It was full-contact, brutal action.\nHip throws and leverage, forearm strikes and elbows and grabbing your\nopponent’s blade with a gloved hand—or grabbing your own and pressing it\nto his neck. Kicks and throws and foot sweeps and clothing pulls and eye\ngouging and knee strikes to the kidneys—everything, everything dirty and\nfast and effective and lethal.\nKip’s weight and burgeoning strength should have been a significant\nadvantage. Maybe it would have, if they’d been wielding battle axes or war\nhammers. Karris was fast and a small target, and she was an expert at using\nleverage to compensate for what she lacked in strength compared to her\nbeefier Blackguard brothers.

Learning to keep some\nattention on other things kept you from getting war-blind, too focused on\nwhat was immediately in front of you. Last time she’d taught him about the\nother magic-using fighting companies in the world: the Nuqaba’s guard in\nParia, the Tafok Amagez; the old Blue-Eyed Demons that Gavin had\ndestroyed after the war; a few of the martial elites from the highland Parian\ntribal societies; the secretive Shadow Watch of Ruthgar, whom she knew\ndid exist because Gavin had checked them out personally to see if they were\na threat to the Seven Satrapies. Few individuals within any of those groups,\nthough, also used magic with anything near the facility of the Blackguards.\nThe Cwn y Wawr were archers and tree climbers and green drafters and\nmasters of camouflage in the deep parts of Blood Forest, and some of the\nShadow Watch were highly talented drafters as well—but no one group had\nthe range of drafting abilities available to them that the Blackguard did. No\nother group had the critical mass of drafters to maintain a drafting tradition\nin each color, so instead each generation had to invent again techniques\ntheir forebears would have been able to teach them easily.\nSuch martial societies were born from wars and all too often\nextinguished in them. The Blood War had birthed a dozen. The False\nPrism’s War had wiped out half that many. Some faded as the reasons\nthey’d come together had disappeared—those formed in the Blood War had\neither morphed into mercenary companies like the Blue Bastards or the\nCloven Shield, or the men and women had simply gone home or had\nbecome soldiers or outlaws or farmers as the demand for teachers\ndisappeared. The martial arts of drafting died especially quickly because of\ndrafters’ short lives.\nIt made Kip realize that anything awe-inspiring that they discovered had\ndoubtless been discovered before. It had simply also then been lost.\nKarris said, “Now, are you ready for the other half?”\n“Other what?” he asked.\nShe lashed out with the tygre striper. Kip blocked, and blocked, and\nblocked again. Then she whipped part around an arm and popped it back—\nbut it moved twice as fast as it should have and it cut across his belly long\nbefore his block arrived.\n“The hell?” Kip asked.\n“Strike it. Downstroke, in the middle.”\nKip did as he was told, slashing hard between Karris’s hands. The\nsharana ru bent a long way and popped his yellow luxin blade back upward.\n“Again, the same.”\nKip cut again—and this time nearly had the yellow blade knocked from\nhis grip as the sharana ru didn’t bend in the least. It was suddenly like a\nsteel bar.\n“This is what’s special about the sharana ru—sea demon bone or\nwhatever it is. It is the only known mundane material that reacts to will.\nYou want it to be hard, and it is.”\nMy problem is more often that I don’t want it to be hard, but it is.\nThank Orholam, this time Kip didn’t say it.\nKarris paused and looked at Kip, who stared back at her, all innocence.\n“Mind out of the gutter, Kip.”"

Now all I can think about is, uh…\nAhem. All of them work best if you’re bloody, though.”\nWell, that killed any innuendo. “Bloody?” Kip asked.

Some part of the soul resides in the blood, some luxiats say. Or\nperhaps it’s merely coincidence. Regardless, it works with the sharana ru.\nThere was a warrior caste on the Isle of Glass, before it sank into the seas\nand became White Mist Reef.”\n“Legend, right?” Kip said.\nShe tossed him the sharana ru. “You hold the stuff of legend in your\nhands.”\nWhich just begged for a ribald joke.

We couldn’t build one today, but the\nengineering was obviously known, once. Of course, the legends say the Isle\nof Glass was a hundred times the size of the Floating City. Perhaps it was\ntwice as big, or smaller. Perhaps it sank because of its blasphemies against\nOrholam. Perhaps it was merely caught in a winter storm. Or both. These\nthings, being, of course, not exclusive.”\n“Did they have other weapons?”\n“What would you think?” Karris asked.\n“Bows.”\n“A few. It was said that it took years of training to gain proficiency—the\ndifficulty being in figuring out how much Will you were using, and keeping\nit consistent, despite being tired or scared or furious. None survive.”\n“Catapults?” Kip asked.\n“Broke the men who tried to use them.”\n“What happens to a man whose will has been broken?” Kip asked. “I\nwilljacked Grazner once in training, but he seemed fine.”\n“Depends on how much of his will is in it. You foil what someone has a\nwhim for, he might be left dazed for a moment. A man strains to put steel\ninto enough sharana ru to fling a stone two thousand paces and fails? He’s\nleft an idiot. Forever.”\n“Dear Orholam.”\n“Anyway, as I was saying, there was a warrior caste that used sharana ru\nweapons. They had a dozen war dances they used to get themselves into a\nfighting trance. Most involved lightly stabbing their own scalps and their\npalms. They went into battle bloody, and they didn’t leave until there was\nno more blood to shed.

There is a forest there where they say at dusk you can sometimes\nhear the sound of their war dance.”\n“That sounds… spooky.”\n“It’ll scare a stain right into your pants,” Karris said. She smirked. “You\nknow, Kip, I wanted to say that you’ve become like…” Her eyes clouded.\nKip felt a sudden well of longing open beneath his feet, and he was\nfalling into it. He finished the sentence in his mind, but he couldn’t speak\nlest the last bubbles of his breath escape, like so much hope.\n“No,” she said, her tone changing abruptly, “you haven’t become like a\nreal warrior, you are becoming a real warrior, and I’m proud to train you.”\nShe patted his shoulder lamely.\nIt wasn’t what she was going to say, and he knew it. It wasn’t what she\nwas going to say. Was it? She was going to say that other thing, that thing\nhis stupid fool heart yearned for, pretending it would make everything\nbetter.\nKip nodded and took it as a compliment and crawled out of the well,\nhalf drowned and dripping false hope everywhere.\nBut he bobbed his head and smiled modestly. He was getting better at\nlying.\nChapter 59\nAh, the trouble one botched assassination can cause.\n“The empire is broken, Gavin,” the Nuqaba said. Odd for her to start\nthere. After her abrupt entrance and accusation, she and Eirene Malargos\nhad withdrawn together. Apparently they’d come up with a plan, but only\nthe Nuqaba was here now.\n“How’s your husband?” Gavin asked. “Well, I hope?”\nHer eyes flashed. Through circumstances Gavin had never heard a\nsatisfactory explanation for, Haruru had married Izîl-Udad, the head of the\nfamily that had tried to have her mother assassinated. Izîl-Udad was now a\ncripple. It was widely rumored that the Nuqaba had pushed him down a\nflight of marble stairs during a drunken fight, leaving the man with shattered\nknees that even the most skilled chirurgeons couldn’t fix. The truth, Gavin’s\nspies had told him long ago, was that the man had beaten Haruru fiercely\nand often. One night, she had drugged him, drafted orange luxin on the\nstairs so that he would slip, and then crushed his knees with a hammer\nwhile he was helpless. He’d woken with no memory of the incident, or was\nso fearful that he claimed no memory of it, and because of the political\npressures at the time, they’d stayed together. He was confined to a chair,\nand it was said she did not make his life easy.\nGavin had seen portraits of her as a younger woman many times, not\nleast of which was the masterpiece in Ironfist’s room, and she had looked\nquite beautiful, though artists were apt to gloss over flaws for powerful\npatrons. Despite the years since she’d sat for that painting, she was still a\nstriking figure. Perhaps more so now, in the fullness of her power. She wore\nan immaculately folded and doubtless colorful haik, if Gavin had been able\nto see the colors. Shiny metal—gold?—fibulae in sunbursts at each"

Coral necklace and coral earrings, not through pierced earlobes,\nbut hanging over the ears instead, in the traditional Parian style. Reedy\nmuscles and heavy eyes, full lips and few curves, despite three children.\n“Such a pleasant surprise to see you here,” Gavin said. As if that covered\nthe half of it.\nShe laughed aloud. “Do you know, the seed crystal tells me that you\nactually are happy to see me. You’re a complicated man, aren’t you, Gavin\nGuile?”\nHe blinked. “What’s this about a seed crystal?” You never knew.\nSometimes you just ask, and people will tell you what you want to know.\nShe studied the crystal. “A genuine question. Really? Really?”\nShe laughed again.\nGavin quirked an eyebrow. For the last two hours, his mind had been\nspinning like a mill with the gears uncoupled, whizzing furiously,\naccomplishing nothing.\n“Do you remember the mosaic on the left-hand wall, as you enter my\nlibrary?” she asked.\nBy ‘my library’ she meant the Library of Azûlay. The building itself was\nmore than eight hundred years old, and probably built on top of a library\nthat had been there at least two hundred more. The mosaic was of King\nZedekiah, skin depicted in onyx, the scroll-spear of wisdom in his right\nhand and whatever had been in his left hand long ago chiseled out by\nthieves. The kings and queens and satraps who followed had never found\ntwo scholars who agreed on what had been lost—a scepter? scales of\njustice? a sword?—or they would have restored it long ago. King Zedekiah,\nGavin remembered, wore a crown with seven stars. One for each color,\nnaturally. The red and blue and green, most likely ruby and sapphire and\nemerald, had been picked out at whatever time the left-hand mosaic tiles\nhad been stolen, but those had been easier to replace.\nThough it was a famous place, and he knew much about it, Gavin had\nnever been there. He had never visited her. And he had never taken her to\nhis bed, made Orholam only knew what promises, and then left her without\na word—unlike his older brother, the real Gavin.\nThanks for that, brother.\n“The crown?” Gavin said, dubious. “Surely metaphorical.”\n“King Zedekiah was one of the nine kings.”\n“I’ve heard that speculation before,” Gavin said. “You think—”\n“Not speculation. You think I support scholars for the warm feelings I\nget for my charity?”\n“Never that,” Gavin said. He smirked to try to take the edge off. It didn’t\nwork.\nHer expression darkened. “They confirmed it for me. Along with some\nother fascinating tidbits.”\n“Pray tell,” Gavin said.\nShe looked down at what she’d said was the orange seed crystal.\n“Mostly sarcastic, but interested, too. You hoping I’ll slip up? You want to\nbattle with me, Gavin?”\n“Seems like that trinket is doing more than telling you yes or no on"

You want to\nbattle with me, Gavin?”\n“Seems like that trinket is doing more than telling you yes or no on\nwhether I’m telling the truth,” Gavin said.\n“King Zedekiah was holding a sword in his hand. All diamonds, except\nfor a helix of obsidian up the spine, wrapping around seven jewels. Ah, I\ndon’t need the seed crystal to tell me you’re familiar with the blade.” She\nwalked up close to the bars. She had a terrible walk. Heavy and direct, like\na man trudging under the weight of a pack, no sway to her slender hips at\nall.\nBut then she was at the bars, and the scent of her perfume wafted over\nhim. Lemon and jasmine and balsam and amber. It reminded him of\nKarris’s scent, a brief flash of the paradise that was having her hair drape\nover his face, skin to skin.\nBut he was brought back instantly as she spoke. “Haven’t you ever\nwondered why so much of your approved history starts only four hundred\nyears ago?”\n“That was when Lucidonius came. No empire likes to laud that which\ncame before it.” Gavin shrugged. “Simple exercise in maintaining power.\nBury the past until you’re sure it’s dead.”\n“Another truth wrapped around a lie. You’re hoping I’ll be frustrated and\nexplain why you’re wrong.”\nSometimes Gavin wondered how well he would have ruled if he hadn’t\nhad the handicap of maintaining his façade. He’d had to keep the Nuqaba at\narm’s length throughout his time as Prism because he didn’t know the full\ndetails of her tryst with his brother, and she was said to be one of the\nstrongest intuitive thinkers in the Seven Satrapies. He’d feared that she\nwould take one look at him and declare him a fraud.\nLuckily, her religious duties had kept her tied to her own country, and its\ngreat distance from the Chromeria had been enough excuse for Gavin to\navoid going there. But now here he was, her prisoner, and she had a means\nof knowing whenever he told a lie.\n“So then, why do you think the empire is doomed?” Gavin asked.\n“Because Eirene and I are deciding whether we’ll join the Color Prince\nor stay with your father and the Seven—pardon—Five Satrapies.”\nIt took Gavin’s breath away. Treason. Treason, discussed as if they were\ndiscussing who could give a better price for alligator leather.\n“You see, Gavin, the Spectrum has become so insular that they’ve\nforgotten they exist for us, not the other way around. When’s the last time\nany member of the Spectrum even traveled to their home satrapy? Six years\nago. And that was prompted by one of Delara Orange’s cousins dying\nyoung, with two wills and four bastards.”\nGavin said nothing, but it was more than his breath that was gone. It was\nhis spirit, limp as a wind-starved sail. Why would she tell him her planned\ntreason, and tell him so bluntly?\nBecause there was, quite simply, nothing he could do to affect what she\ndid. Ultimately, she was saying, all of Gavin’s power rested on his magical\npower. This was her vengeance."

This was her vengeance.\nNo, it was only the beginning of her vengeance. She would dismantle all\nhe’d accomplished in his time as Prism.\n“You see,” she said, “the Spectrum was so busy hobbling you that they\nignored every other threat. Think what you could have accomplished if the\nempire had been an empire in truth. Ilyta could be a center of smithing that\nwould enrich everyone. Instead it’s ten thousand pirates, two hundred\nsmiths, and a few hundred thousand people in poverty. Did I say Five\nSatrapies? Four. And think about Tyrea. Well, surely you know what a\nwasteland Tyrea is. Totally unnecessary. If a man as strong as you couldn’t\nunite this empire, then this empire is too weak to stand.”\n“So you’ve made your decision?” he asked.\nShe smiled almost shyly. “I’ve made mine. The Color Prince thinks he\ncan control us. You see this?” She held up the jewel. It was a six-pointed\nstar, with black tips on each point, both the color—orange, he assumed—\nand the black somehow throbbing with life. She had it contained in a tiny\nglass box, and the box on a chain.\n“The seed crystal?” Gavin asked.\n“Didn’t you find them when you destroyed the other bane?”\nGavin shook his head. “Is this a cruel joke?” The term ‘seed crystal’\ndidn’t bode well.\nShe shook her head. “All that work. All those lives. Wasted. The bane\nwill reform if you don’t seize the seed crystal. Within months. They look\nfor a host; a drafter to whom they give enormous power. And for some\nreason, this man, this Color Prince thinks he can then control all of them.\nBut so long as I hold this, rather than it holding me, I don’t need to find out.\nHe thinks an orange drafter must, by her very nature, desire to become a\ngoddess. But I’m smart enough to choose freedom. Freedom from the\nChromeria. Freedom from him, as well. But I won’t leave without Ruthgar.\nTo get the terms we want—that we need—it will take both of us.”\n“So my hopes reside with Eirene Malargos? Comforting.”\n“I could force her hand, you know. Your father has offered to buy you.”\n“He has?” Father knew. He knew Gavin was here. That solved some\nproblems. And made more, naturally.\n“Ah, so you think he knows you’re here? No. He’s merely offered a\ngeneral bounty—er, reward. You hurt me, Gavin. And for that I’m going to\nhurt you.”\nGoing there would be disaster if that trinket really did what she said it\ndid. “Tell me about the orange seed crystal,” he said.\nBut she wasn’t about to let him control the conversation. “You turned\nmy brothers against me. You made them abandon me.”\n“You’re angry about that? Not the other?” Gavin asked.\n“You thought I’d been pining after you for sixteen years? You took my\nvirginity, not my wits.”\nGavin was left speechless. He’d known she was furious with his brother"

He’d figured Gavin had deserved it, but it wasn’t the kind of thing\nyou could ask in a letter. ‘Are you still angry that I left you behind?’ That\n‘I’ could be a bitter thing to write, at times.\n“You stole Hanishu and Harrdun.” She wouldn’t call them Ironfist and\nTremblefist. “To be Blackguards! Slaves. Disgusting. And they left me to do\nit. They thought you were more important than I. And you let them go.\nWhat are they to you but more bodies to be spent in your protection?\nNothing. If you had a thumb’s worth of generosity in you, you would have\nsent them back. You left me at my home, seventeen years old, in charge of a\ntribe shocked and devastated by our enemies. I had to marry the man who’d\nhad my mother assassinated. I spent ten years digging myself out of the\nhole you put me in.”\n“Join the fucking queue,” Gavin said. “War is hard. People die. You got\ndealt such a raw hand that you rose to become the Nuqaba. Your brothers\nwould be ashamed of what you’ve become.”\nHer eyes went cold. “Well, at last some fire. I wondered if that man was\ndead. You’ve become a schemer, Gavin Guile, but at least you have some\npassion left.”\n“Your brothers did what they thought was their duty. I compelled\nnothing. I won’t deny that I wanted Ironfist to stay. He’s one of the smartest,\nmost capable commanders I’ve ever met, and having him on my side is a\nhuge advantage. What Prism would willingly give up such a strong right\nhand? And Tremblefist didn’t want to stay in Paria. Couldn’t. Of course he\nwent where Ironfist went, but he, too, has been exemplary. His quiet\ncompetence inspires all the Blackguards.”\n“He should have turned to me. After… after Aghbalu.”\n“To his little sister? To understand a killing rage? Rather than to his big\nbrother, who’d been a veteran of war?”\n“I’m his sister! He shouldn’t have turned to you!”\n“It wasn’t to me.” Well, the seed crystal would tell her that was true, at\nleast. But she wasn’t even looking at it.\n“It was you.”\n“Fine, then. I gave him what you never could,” Gavin said. His sins\nmight be manifold and worthy of death, but this wasn’t one of them. “I gave\nhim trust, when he didn’t trust himself. A sister’s trust means nothing in\nsuch a case. No fault of yours. He needed something that he would have to\nearn. The trust of a man who had no reason to love him? That brought him\nback. He is not that which you knew as a little girl. He’ll never be that.\nWhat was done to him, and what he did, changed that forever. When I look\nat him, I don’t look for the man who’s gone. You would. That’s why he’s\nnever gone back.”"

I’m a master of orange luxin. I’m the\nnearest thing to a queen these satrapies have known in centuries, and you\nmake me feel a stupid little girl.”\nShe reached into the folds of her haik and produced a small matchlock\npistol. Working the match cord free, she walked over to one of the small\nlanterns in the cellar. She rested the pistol on a shelf, lifted the lantern hood,\nand lit the match cord. “If you died in Eirene’s custody,” she said, “your\nfather would hold her accountable. Her protestations that I’d killed you\nwould seem weak lies, evasions.” She took up the pistol, cocked the\nhammer, and affixed the match cord. “Eirene would be furious with me, of\ncourse, but she wouldn’t risk putting herself in reach of Andross Guile’s\nvengeance. She’d join me.”\nThe Nuqaba leveled the pistol at Gavin’s face. Stepped forward so she\nwas certain she wouldn’t hit the bars.\nShe winked at him, grinning, and he almost grinned back. Then he\nrealized she’d winked closing her right eye. She was giving him the evil\neye: judging him with Cursed Accuser, while the right eye of Orholam,\nBlessed Redeemer, was closed.\nGavin flicked his eyes ever so briefly up over her shoulder, toward the\ndoor, and twitched his lips in a fraction-of-a-second grin.\nThe Nuqaba glanced at the door. Gavin lunged. He slammed against the\nbars, extending one arm, jamming a shoulder as far through as he could. His\nhand slapped against her hand and pistol, for the barest instant, he had it in\nhis grip, and then, without his third and fourth fingers, he couldn’t hold on\nto it. The pistol flew out of her hand and smacked into the wall, discharging.\nThe rapid whine of ricochets filled the cellar.\nAfter the roar, for a long moment, they stood staring at each other. Gavin\npulled his shoulder back through the bars, and felt himself, to see if he’d\nbeen hit. He hadn’t, but his two stumps of fingers were bleeding again.\nDamn. He’d had to attack with his left hand, but his instincts hadn’t\nadjusted to the loss of his fingers.\nHe looked to the Nuqaba to see if she’d been hit. Her eyes were wide.\nHer arm was bleeding. She took a handkerchief and dabbed her forearm.\nJust a scratch.

Why is my…”\nShe looked down and lifted a bit of her haik from over her thigh. There\nwas a small hole in the fabric. But Gavin’s eyes were drawn lower, where\nblood was pooling around her feet.

This, of course, has no bearing on its\nrighteousness. But by my inner light, I know this is darkness.\n“Orholam himself set the earth to spinning, little brother,” Brother\nTawleb says. Tawleb is one of the six High Luxiats, and I’m nervous just\nspeaking with him.\nHe doesn’t need to finish the phrase: to give the earth and all its\ncreatures rest from his burning gaze. That there be a time for light, and a\ntime for darkness.\n“A line oft abused, big brother. As you yourself pointed out in\nSoliloquies on the First Ten Years.” I’m a coward. This is wrong. Death, for\na child? Barely an initiate. Besides, I know how Brother Tawleb is going to\nanswer, now that I think about it.\nBrother Tawleb smiles. I’ve heard that when he was a young luxiat, he\nwas renowned for his looks and his wealth. He’d had a luxurious Atashian\nbeard bedecked with gold beads and anointed with myrrh. After her first\nhusband had been killed in the Blood Wars, his mother had been forced to\nput him in the Magisterium when she remarried, so as not to muddy her\nnew husband’s lines of succession. But Tawleb had still been her favorite,\nand she showered him with gifts.\nHe says, “‘Quentin Naheed, first of his cohort, a pupil of the top rank, a\ndisciplined, thoughtful young man. Highly intelligent, probably brilliant,\npossibly a genius, though he guards his tongue so as not to shame his lesser\nbrothers.’ It’s no mistake I’ve asked you to do this task for me, Quentin.\nYou know how that quote from my treatise ends, don’t you?”\n“‘Some men’s abuse of a truth is no excuse for all men to abandon the\nuse of that truth,’” I answer. There is a time for darkness, for secrecy, and\nfor deceit. But most scholars agree that such times lie at the margins: in\nrighteous warfare, for example, where one cannot announce one’s intentions\nor they will be thwarted; or in the case of protecting the innocent from a\nsinful authority.\nAnd of course, knowing such scriptural exceptions, every tyrant and liar\nargues that his case fits those exceptions.\nBut this is murder."

Surely he is not lost to the\nnight at so young an age?” He is only six years younger than I. If I were to\nhave gone to face judgment at that age… I can’t bear to think of it. No\ninnocent, I. But I am more of a sinner than many of my brothers.\n“Your instincts are good, Quentin, and your heart is full of mercy. The\nbrothers were right about you. Not just intelligence, but a heart after\nOrholam’s own,” Brother Tawleb says.\nMy heart pounds. The brothers have been talking about me?\nComplimenting me in such high terms? The reference is to one of the\ngreatest saints in all scripture. My heart swells, followed by a horrible\nthought: am I taking a compliment and turning it to arrogance? Arrogance is\na blindness we choose.\n“It isn’t arrogance to recognize the truth, Quentin.” That Big Brother\nTawleb is calling me by my name is itself a compliment I’m not worthy of.\n“All are equal under the light,” I manage.\n“A foundational truth indeed,” he says. “And one that must be handled\ncarefully. When Orholam looks down on us as from the height of the sun\nitself, the difference between a dwarf and a giant is insignificant. The\ndifference between your intellect and an idiot’s is puny when compared to\nthe infinite intelligence which is Orholam’s. But though we walk daily with\nOrholam and for him, we walk among men, and the difference between\ngiants and dwarfs matters greatly to us indeed, though it doesn’t matter to\nOrholam—and oughtn’t matter to us—in terms of justice and mercy and\nrighteousness. This is another truth easily abused. Just as all sins are one\nbefore Orholam, but we differentiate between a whitewashed lie and a\nmurder because here one undeniably has worse effects. It is not sin to\nrecognize what is true, little brother. Indeed, it is a sin to choose not to see\nit. So that you are gratified by a truth being recognized by others that you\nhave long known yourself, but have not wanted to say aloud, is no sin.”\n“But I will be proud. I know my heart, and it is deceptive,” I say. I’m not\ncomfortable speaking of these things. I will hoard these compliments like a\nmiser and revel in them in the dark hours of the night. I will sneer at my\nbrothers who flub their memorization, hold my sisters in contempt for\nsaying a quote is from Strong’s Commentary when it was from Strang’s.\n“That you have been given a great intellect is not something to be proud\nof; it is a burden to bear. It is muscle to be used in lifting greater weights\nthan others can lift. That, little brother, that is why I’m trusting you with\nthis. It is a heavy burden, I know.

One does not blithely carry secret death sentences for others. If I\nsay no to this assignment, or threaten to tell others in the Magisterium about\nit…\nDear Orholam, what would Brother Tawleb do?\nMore specifically, what would he do to me?\nAnd there a light dawns.

Those who live seeking the light will spend\neternity in the light. There is little that can be taken from me that I don’t\nalready despise.\n“You have had a thought,” Brother Tawleb says. He is still a handsome\nman, though too lean of face, with a few pockmarks that a beard would\nhave covered. A year into his full vows, he’d fasted for forty days,\nsprinkling ashes in his hair, and had shorn his beard, had given away all his\nbelongings to the poor, and renounced the privileges of his birth and wealth.\nParadoxically, that had only cemented in everyone’s mind his birth and\nwealth, and wedded to it an air of deep righteousness. His rise in the\nMagisterium after that had been swift.\nHad that been on purpose?\nNo, no, please no. Such a scheme was worthy of one of the kings of old.\nA brilliant maneuver by one angling for power. Such should not be the way\nof the Magisterium. Surely, so close to the light, there should be no\ndarkness.\nAnd yet the heaviness in my heart, my inner light itself, tells me the\ntruth of this. I have mentally elevated my brothers, have honored them as\nmore than men, better than men. That fawning adoration is blindness, too.\nBut my heart despairs to see the truth."

        "text": "truth of this. I have mentally elevated my brothers, have honored them as\nmore than men, better than men. That fawning adoration is blindness, too.\nBut my heart despairs to see the truth.\nI say, “Many thoughts, and some contradictory. I can see what you\nmeant by a heavy weight, big brother.” It is true, but not the truth he thinks\nit is.\nHe chuckles mirthlessly.\n“I will trust you,” I say, lying to a brother for the first time in six years.\n“But I ask that you trust me, too.”\n“You think my entrusting you with such orders doesn’t show trust?” he\nasks archly.\n“Not the orders, the why. Why are the orders necessary? Orholam gave\nme the mind he did. When I stand before him for the judgment, I cannot tell\nhim in good conscience that I didn’t ask why one of his innocent children\ndeserved death. That a church father told me to won’t be sufficient. He\nhasn’t given me such blind faith.”\nHe exudes an air of deep sadness. “I’m not sure you’re ready for that\nknowledge yet.”\n“I’m not sure I’m ready for this action yet,” I say. I hurry to add, “Big\nbrother.” But I may have been just a little too glib. Too smart.\nHe looks at me sharply, and something in that gaze reminds me that here\nis a man willing to sign a secret death sentence. I may not fear death, but I\nhave no wish to die, and this man could not only order my death, he could\n—quite openly—send me to some living hell. There are always more luxiats\nneeded to minister to leper colonies, to evangelize the Angari (and be\nmartyred doing it), to take the news of Orholam’s love beyond the Cracked\nLands. But he doesn’t look like he wants to throw away a perfectly good\ntool at the first difficulty in its use.\nHe says, “There is a holy relic that the High Magisterium has been\nentrusted with since the days of Karris Shadowblinder. During the False\nPrism’s War, Andross Guile seized it from us. He then claimed to have lost\nit, and accused us of stealing it from him, but we know this to be a lie.\nAndross Guile is an atheist, and a devious one at that. You must understand,\nI’m already telling you too much.” His voice is low and thready. I could\nswear there’s real fear in it.\n“How do we know he was lying?” I ask. I want to ask what the relic is,\nbut I can tell he won’t divulge any more than he must.\nBig Brother Tawleb chews his lip. “Though they pretend to be at each\nother’s throats, Gavin Guile is still the Prism. He wouldn’t be if Andross\nreally opposed him.”\n“So this relic is necessary to keep power?”\nBrother Tawleb blanches momentarily. Guessed it. Or he’s a better liar\nthan I’d thought.\nOrholam have mercy, what am I doing?\n“That’s more than you need to know, and let me enjoin you never to\nspeak of this with anyone, until you sit on the High Magisterium yourself.\nYou understand?”"

Orholam’s tears, until I sit on the High Magisterium?! He says this\nnot like it’s bait to tempt me, but as if it’s a foregone conclusion. I nod.\n“The High Magisterium was… content to let this travesty pass.” He\ngrimaces, and I can tell there’s a whole lot more to it than that. “Because the\nHigh Lord Prism has been a very reasonable friend and ally to us, despite\nhis hidden alliance with his father. And because he has at most five years\nleft. His father, our real enemy, has less time. We can deal patiently with\nprovocation and take back what is ours after he dies, without any disruption\namong the faithful.”\nThe relic has been gone for at least sixteen years, and you haven’t tried\nto do anything to get it back? I don’t believe it. You all must have failed,\nspectacularly, and been warned that another attempt would mean some great\nvengeance. The Magisterium is patient, but it isn’t that patient.\nOrholam, he’s lying to me. Easily. In multiple ways. How can a High\nLuxiat lie so blithely?\n“But there’s a young man who just came to the Chromeria, Kip Guile. At\nfirst, they claimed he was a bastard, and High—we—thought…” He’s\nalmost given away whoever it is who agrees with him in the High\nMagisterium. “We naively thought that might be the end of it. The Guiles\nhave no heirs, nor does Gavin seem interested in producing any. We thought\nperhaps we could do nothing, and the relic would revert to our care still.\nBut now they’ve named him a legitimate son. A lie, no doubt, but it means\nhe will inherit. Kip’s appearance takes the theft of our relic from being an\ninsult that we knew would be remedied to being the prospect of our\nprerogative lost and the Magisterium marginalized, forever.”\nSo this artifact is something on which the Magisterium thinks all of its\npower rests.\nI say, “But the boy himself, he may be amenable to reason. He might\ngive it over. He’s an innocent.”\n“This is war; innocents die for the sins of the powerful.”\nBrother Tawleb thought he meant the sins of Andross Guile, but I’m not\nso sure he’s right. That innocents die in war is a fact. It is unavoidable that\nwhen siege engines obliterate a city wall, the children in the houses beyond\nit often die.\nBut targeting children is something else altogether.\nHe continues, “When the Magisterium is weakened, everything every\nluxiat does is weakened. We minister to the refugees of war, but without\npower, how can we get the funds we need from the Spectrum to pay to send\nluxiats to give succor to those refugees? We feed the poor. We treat lepers.\nWe heal the sick. Most of the money comes from alms, but there are times\nwhen alms can’t arrive fast enough.

Can you imagine if we were faced with\na flood on the coastal plains of Paria, and we had to wait until all seven\nsatrapies heard about it, donated, and shipped their gifts here, then we\nbought the necessary supplies and sent the luxiats there? It would be\nmonths. Months in which how many innocents would die? Without the\npower to do good, what good can we do?”\nPray. The glib answer is also the scriptural one, the one every luxiat has\nbeen taught for hundreds of years. It is not by our power that Orholam’s\nwill is accomplished, but by his. What are our black robes but a constant\nreminder of our own emptiness, our own need for Orholam’s light? And our\nneed for his power.\nIn pursuing Orholam’s business, Brother Tawleb has forgotten Orholam\nhimself.\n“This is very troubling, big brother, but I hear the ring of truth in your\nwords.” I bow my head. “I will pray for his soul. And deliver your\nmessage.”\n“I don’t want you to deliver a message, Quentin Naheed.”\n“Pardon?”\n“I want you to deliver a bullet.”\nChapter 61\nKip came back from training to find his room trashed. His mirror was\nbroken. The legs of his chair were broken. His pillow was slashed open. His\nmattress was slashed open. The coin purse with his wages he kept hidden on\na roof beam had been stolen. His desk’s surface had been scored with a\nknife, his inkwell upended all over it. His chamber pot had been filled by\nwhoever had done this, and had been emptied in the middle of his bed. A\nnote, carefully tented on heavy wood pulp paper, sat on the desk, slowly\nwicking up ink.\n“I’m done playing games. Come see me immediately.—T.G.”\nT.G. The Guile. Because that’s how Andross sees himself. Not as\nAndross, not as the Red, not even as the promachos, but as the\nrepresentative of all that is this family. That was the most important thing,\nto Andross Guile.\nThe urine was incredibly pungent.\nUgh. Someone’s not drinking enough water.\nAnd to think of that first, someone’s been training with the Blackguard\ntoo much.\nBut aside from that wry thought, Kip was oddly unmoved. So his stuff\nhad been smashed. So what? He’d had less in the past. So his money had\nbeen stolen. So what? He didn’t need money. He had friends now, and work\nto do, things to accomplish. That was infinitely more precious, wasn’t it?\nHe stared at the mess and knew that he wouldn’t even have to clean it up\nhimself. There were slaves whose services he could borrow from the\nChromeria. If this was meant to be a kick in the nuts, old man, you’ve\nmissed. This is barely a kick in the thigh.\nIn fact, more than anything else this does, it tells me about you. If you\ndid it to irritate me, it’s because you imagined it would work. You imagined\nit would work because it would work on you. So this is the worst you can\nimagine happening to you? Can’t bear to be disrespected, can you?"

        "text": "it would work because it would work on you. So this is the worst you can\nimagine happening to you? Can’t bear to be disrespected, can you?\nInteresting. I’ll remember that.\nKip’s first urge was to go somewhere else, anywhere else. But passive\ndefiance was the old Kip. Passive defiance was indistinguishable from\ncowardice. He told himself it wasn’t that he cared if Andross thought he\nwas a coward; it was what he thought of himself. He was afraid of the old\nman. He could accept that fear. It was perfectly rational. But to let himself\nbe controlled by his fear…\nFunny how I’m echoing things I’ve heard in Blackguard training as if\nthey’re my own thoughts.\nEnough thinking. Kip stepped into the hallway. He spied a slave\napproaching. “Calun!” he called. “Who’s your master?”\n“I serve at the pleasure of Gariban Navid,” the man said, obviously not\nappreciating being singled out.\n“He’s a discipulus?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“There’s been a crime here. Report it to the Black’s desk downstairs.\nYou’re allowed to cut to the front of the line. And ask that they send slaves\nto clean up the mess once the Black’s men are finished investigating.”\nSlaves not serving Colors could be compelled by any free man or\nwoman in an emergency or to report a crime. Of course, it was a privilege\nthat the wise exercised with caution. No one liked a stranger\ncommandeering his property.\n“Yes, sir,” the man said.\n“Hold,” Kip said. He dug into his purse. One didn’t tip slaves, and Kip\nonly had three danars left, but hell with that. He gave the slave two of them.\n“Thank you,” he said.\nThe slave sneered, like Kip didn’t know what he was doing, like Kip\nwas an uncouth mixed breed.\nHe began walking toward the lifts, and realized that the slave’s presence\nwas terribly convenient. He turned.\n“Oh, and if it was you—drink more water,” Kip said.\n“Sir?”\n“Kidney stones. I hear it’s like having the tip of your penis pounded with\na hammer.”\nThe slave’s face iced over. He looked like he wanted to spit in Kip’s\nface. “I’ve been cut, sir.”\n“Oh. So there’s a bright side to gelding. Never would have thought.\nCarry on, then.”\nKip knew that he should be taking advantage of his walk to form a plan,\nan approach to the most masterful manipulator in the Chromeria, but his\nthoughts kept going in circles. He nodded to the Blackguards, waving the\nletter in their direction, and opened the door to Andross Guile’s rooms\nwithout knocking. It wasn’t locked. That was sort of funny. Andross was so\ncertain that his reputation would scare the hell out of people that he didn’t\neven have his slave lock his door or command the Blackguards to maintain\nhis privacy. Unless, of course, Grinwoody had simply forgotten to do it. The\nman was getting older.\nA small, mean part of Kip delighted in the hope that Grinwoody was\ngrowing senile. He would weep when Andross cast off the old wrinkled\nsack of excrement. Tears of joy."

Tears of joy.\nKip moved through the antechamber and saw Grinwoody dozing on his\nfeet, just leaning against the wall next to the door to the inner room. But\nGrinwoody woke before Kip took three steps.\nHe was bleary, though, trying to hide that he’d been asleep. Kip handed\nthe old slave the ink-stained note as if it were an invitation and strode right\npast him.\nAndross wasn’t in the main room. Startled, Grinwoody hustled to get\nback in front of Kip. “You can wait in the—High Lord Guile is—”\n“You can kiss the bald spot where my fat thighs rub together,” Kip said.\nHe threw open the bedroom door.\nHis grandfather was in bed, and he wasn’t alone. Worse, Kip had seen\nthe woman lying next to him before. It was Tisis Malargos, heart-shaped\nface and pale skin. Lots of pale skin. Just like when she’d tried to kill Kip\nduring the Threshing. Tisis Malargos, who had been a Color for the space of\nonly moments before Gavin had unseated her.\nKip was rooted in place. Tisis’s hair was piled in delicate blonde curls\nheld in a web of emeralds. And her hand was under the sheets, moving up\nand—oh, dear Orholam!\nShe didn’t see Kip immediately—or at least he hoped that was why her\nhand hadn’t stopped moving—but Andross Guile did. He looked up at Kip,\nand Kip could see the sudden war of Andross Guile’s natures: the\ncalculating spider, already figuring how to turn this surprise back to his own\nbenefit, versus the Red who’d drafted passion and fire and all things hot and\nburning for decades.\nThe worst of it might have been that it was far more shocking to see his\ngrandfather naked than Tisis.\nTisis saw that she’d lost Andross’s attention and she followed his gaze.\nA fraction of an instant of shame passed through her eyes, and then it turned\nto pure hatred.\n“The funny thing is,” Kip found himself saying, “I think I’ve seen you\nnaked more times than I’ve seen you clothed. Huh. I guess if you only have\none thing going for you, you’ve got to play it to the hilt, huh? Too bad such\na beautiful package has to house such ugliness.”\nTisis was out of the bed in an instant. She was still wearing a slip,\nthough the straps had been pushed down off her shoulders, so apparently\nKip had only interrupted their foreplay. Tisis picked up a vase and hurled it\nat Kip. Her arm tangled in her slip’s straps, and she missed by a league,\nsplashed water over herself, and dropped roses on the floor. And smashed\nwhat was probably a priceless vase. “Get out, you—you fat worm! You\ndetestable little, little—bastard! You—” Her pale complexion flared with\nrage and frustration as she tried to throw items and words and hike up her\nstraps over her shoulders all at the same time."

        "text": "detestable little, little—bastard! You—” Her pale complexion flared with\nrage and frustration as she tried to throw items and words and hike up her\nstraps over her shoulders all at the same time.\nInterrupting, Kip said, “I like, ‘You fat carbuncle on the ass of a great\nfamily.’ I mean, if we’re going for fat jokes. Comparisons with beached\nwhales are routine but acceptable. Bonus points for slipping ‘oleaginous’ in.\nYou know what’s sad? What’s sad is that you probably think what you’re\ndoing is smart. You think you can play Andross Guile and get more out of\nhim than he gets out of you. Pathetic.” Kip’s tongue was fully in charge\nnow. And he didn’t care. The tongue is a flame, and Kip was throwing fire\nat every flammable surface he could see. Let it burn. “You know what else\nis pathetic? My grandfather is so vain that he’s probably convinced himself\nthat you’re falling for his charms. Even though he’s smart enough to know\nyou’re just prostituting yourself. Tell me, Tisis, how do you hide your\ndisgust when you see his body? When you moan, do you worry that he can\ntell you’re putting him on, or do you despise him because you know he\ncan’t tell?”\nShe screamed and threw a pillow at him.\nA pillow.\n“Grinwoody,” Kip said, not turning, but somehow aware of the presence\nbehind him, “you oleaginous worm, if you so much as touch me, I’ll kill\nyou. Think twice before you lay hands on a Guile, even an adipose one.”\nKip took in red and yellow—there were colors everywhere in this room—\nand let them swirl under the skin of his face and neck, going visibly down\nto his hands. It was the magical equivalent of cocking a pistol.\nThe slave didn’t touch him.\nAndross Guile got up, impassive. The spider in him had won out.\nSomehow Kip knew it would be a mistake to think he was less dangerous\nsimply because he wasn’t shouting. He was unashamed of his nudity.\nWhich makes one of us.\n“Enough,” Andross said.\n“Enough?!” Tisis shouted. “Enough?”\nHe slapped her, without passion.\nIt caught Tisis unaware. His big meaty hand caught her across the neck\nand cheek. Her head snapped to the side and she dropped to the thick\ncarpet, not even trying to arrest her fall. She was unconscious. For a\nmoment, Kip was afraid she was dead.\nApparently, it was a concern Andross shared. He knelt over her, poking\nfingers into her neck. Satisfied by what he found, he stood.\n“That worked rather better than I expected,” Andross said. “Grinwoody,\nput down the knife. My robe. Then attend to Lady Malargos. She’s easily\nembarrassed, so cover her before you use the smelling salts.”\nAs Grinwoody draped the robe across Andross’s bare shoulders, the\npromachos turned to Kip. “So, you got my note. I wasn’t expecting you yet.\nThought you’d sulk for a while. Come, let’s sit in my parlor.”"

Come, let’s sit in my parlor.”\nKip followed him into the main room of the apartments where they’d\nplayed Nine Kings so many times. Like this was normal.\n“You’re not even going to try to deny it?” Kip asked. “You trashed my\nroom and pissed on my bed. Destroyed everything. Stole my money.”\n“Well, not personally. Brandy?”\n“No, I don’t want your damn brandy!”\n“That’s too bad.” Andross poured two glasses anyway, and put one in\nfront of Kip. He sat in his chair and gestured for Kip to sit across from him.\n“Knowledge of fine alcohols is mostly an affectation, but an important one.\nMen respect those who have greater knowledge of the trivial than they do,\nwhen that trivia is costly. Nothing more so than spirits.”\n“Here’s the thing,” Kip said. He was saying ‘Here’s the thing’ a lot\nrecently. It irritated him. Why didn’t he just launch into what he had to say?\n“Here’s the thing.” Dammit, twice! “It isn’t that you would tear up my room\nthat I find surprising. You’ve tried to have me killed before, so I don’t really\nthink anything is beneath you. It isn’t even that you would claim the action\nafter you did it. I know you like watching people jump. I think you were\ntrapped in this room so long becoming a wight that you needed people to\ncome to you so you didn’t only hear second- or thirdhand accounts. You\nlearned to become obvious so you’d get the thrill of having some power in\nthis world. I understand all that,” Kip said. “You’re a pathetic shut-in who is\nsuddenly not shut in anymore, and you aren’t adjusting to it well.”\nAndross’s eyes, so amused mere seconds ago, turned into wells of\ndarkness. He sipped his brandy as if watching Kip dig his own grave.\n“Here’s what I don’t understand,” Kip said. “How could you be so\nstupid?”\nAn arched eyebrow.\n“I am of you,” Kip said. “I am Guile as much as you are. True, I have a\nscrap of decency, but only a scrap. How do you think you can treat a Guile\nwith such disregard and get away with it? Because I am you. I’m as cold as\nyou, I’m as smart as you, and when you push me, I’m as evil and cruel as\nyou. I have a thin film of goodness floating on the top of my Guile,\ngrandfather, but I don’t know how senile you must be to miss just how thin\nit is.”\n“Hmm. Words, like the stench of a fart,” Andross said. He waved a hand\nas if to dispel them. “You’re marshaling them better than you did, but don’t\nbring your games to me. We’re past that now. There is nothing about you\nthat inspires fear, Kip. Your very name is insubstantial. Kip.” He smirked\ncondescension. “Words without actions are weightless. Throw them against\nthis wall, and see? Nothing.”"

Nothing.”\nKip wondered how fast he could draft. He wondered if it was faster than\nGrinwoody and Andross together. He wanted to kill them both. He wanted\nto stand up and piss on Andross Guile himself to show what he thought of\nhim. But he didn’t think he could get away with it, and having emptied both\nbarrels of his rhetoric in Andross Guile’s face and having hit nothing, he felt\nsuddenly vulnerable, empty. There was no more powder at hand. He was\nthe barely acknowledged bastard, alone, insulting the Guile, throwing\nepithets and disrespect at the promachos himself.\nAnd all he had at hand was the fact that he didn’t care if he wrecked\nhimself.\nPaltry ammunition indeed. He did his best to keep his sudden fear off his\nface, but if there was one emotion Andross Guile was attuned to, it was\nothers’ fear. He fed on it.\n“Want that brandy now?” Andross asked archly, the very personification\nof a lupine grin.\n“I’ll take it,” Kip said, keeping his voice level.\n“No you won’t,” Andross said.\nThe glass was sitting within easy reach. Kip thought of snatching for it\n—and then thought, how fast Fortune’s wheel turns. One moment, I\nthreaten death in high dudgeon. The next, I grub for a glass of brandy.\nAnd this was part of Andross Guile’s curious power. Another lord might\nhave thought denying his guest a drink was simple rudeness, and been\nabove it. Andross Guile didn’t mind if he lowered himself, as long as he\nlowered his opponent more. Indeed, shame was a tool to be used against\nothers, because Andross himself was shameless.\nPerhaps literally so. He had gotten out of bed naked, without even\nacknowledging the fact. He seemed unperturbed about being naked, despite\nhaving all the spots and wrinkles and sagging skin of a man his age. Though\nKip could swear that the paunch Andross had carried was shrinking, he\nstood at the antipodes from his beautiful son Gavin. Nor did he seem more\nthan peeved at being interrupted pre-coitus.\nPerhaps Kip was a poor judge. His own glass of self-horror was\nconstantly full, so the slightest additional drip made the whole thing spill\nover. But even a normal person would be embarrassed at such a thing,\nwouldn’t they?\nKip had assumed that his grandfather was ashamed, and had simply\ncontrolled it. That his sudden rage had been a cover over the\nembarrassment. What if, instead, there was a simple void where shame\nwould be for others, and the rage had been merely for Kip interrupting\nwhatever plan Andross had in place to snare Tisis?\nA dozen times, Kip had wondered how his grandmother, by all accounts\na good woman, had loved this man.\nAnd now another thought occurred to him. What if, instead of loving\nAndross, she’d loved the world? What if she’d seen herself as the only one\nwho could keep this wolf from the flocks? Felia Guile had been smart,"

She’d been an orange. She’d been the only person\nwho could get Andross Guile to change his mind. She’d been the bulwark\nagainst the storm.\nAnd now she was gone.\nKip was staring at an old man with saggy skin sitting in a faded robe, the\nbare skin of his legs almost translucent, almost obscene in itself—and he\nwas the one who suddenly felt naked.\n“What do you want?” he asked. “You’re old. What does winning even\nlook like for you?”\n“Old?” Andross chuckled. “I’ve got a good twenty years left. Kip, if you\nand Zymun don’t pan out for me, I can start a new family and still have\ntime to groom the next generation. I have the options of a young man again,\nbut with all the advantages I didn’t have when I was young. Do you not\nknow your family’s history?”\nKip wasn’t looking for a lesson. “I looked back as far as my grandfather\nand gave up in disgust,” he said. It was the best insult he could slip around\nthe thick knot of fear blocking his throat.\n“A weaker man would say I owe you, Kip. For what you did on that ship\nabout my… surfeit of red. But I’m not that man. I respect that you have the\nstrength to not be groveling at my feet. However. Defiance is initially\ninteresting, but it grows tiresome quickly.”\n“I’d love to hear about the family,” Kip said snidely. The mere fact that\nhe could say ‘the’ family and not ‘your’ family was a huge victory.\n“You’ve killed my desire to reminisce. Let it be enough to say that I\nearned everything we have. By my generation, we were wool merchants—\nwool merchants with debts and a worthless title that my drunken wastrel\nolder brother nearly sold to pay them. Everything we are—even you, little\nbastard who’s weaseled his way into legitimacy—is because of what I’ve\nmade us.”\n“You wrested control of the family from your brother?” Kip asked,\nincredulous.\n“Wrested? I’ve had more trouble with a bowel movement. I handed Abel\na stack of papers for his signature when he was hungover. He barely\nglanced at them. I paid his own steward a few danars to countersign as a\nwitness, saying it was contracts for warehouses. He didn’t read them either.\nI seized all the accounts, and my brother didn’t even have the money to pay\na solicitor to bring it to a magistrate. Nor the friends willing to lend him\nsuch sums.”\nKip reached out for the brandy, unthinking, and this time Andross let\nhim take it. “Oh, thanks,” Kip said automatically.\nAndross grinned, as if this too were a victory.\n“You’re telling me that three generations of Guile brothers have been at\neach other’s throats?” Kip asked.\n“Three? No. Six that I know of. There was a tale that a witch cursed us\nwhen Memnon Guile wed her and then, as we Guiles do, cheated on her. Or"

Since then.\nThat was six hundred years ago, though I personally doubt that our blood\nhas even a drop of that Guile’s blood in it. Many other families have taken\nthe names of the heroes of old; I’m not sure why we would be different. Not\nthat such a thing bears repeating in public, yes? Regardless, the tale held\nenough force that it was said in our family that if your wife was older, and\nyou already had one son, not to have any more children, lest you end up\nwith two boys. Not that a son and a daughter guaranteed any better. Selene\nGuile the First had more mercy than most of the men in our family—or less,\ndepending on what you value.

Which it\nstayed for a hundred and fifty years, until an enterprising Guile son\nmanaged to wrest control back.”\nKip took a drink. He barely noticed the burning. “And you think that’s\nan acceptable way for families to act?”\n“Acceptable? One doesn’t reason with lions. One doesn’t accept reality.\nOne adapts to it.”\n“But you aren’t like my father, you didn’t adapt to a situation where\nyour brother was betraying you. You were the betrayer.” The words had\nsounded so logical, so reasonable in Kip’s head before he said them. But as\nthey came out the blunderbuss that was his mouth, they expanded into a\nrazor cloud.\nAndross Guile’s expression froze, his knuckles whitened on his brandy\nglass, showing the hit. It was with visible effort that he contained his rage.\nHe hadn’t become the Red—of all his colors—by accident. “How is it to be\nyou, Kip? Cocooned in layers of protective ignorance thicker than your\nblubber, a blundering whale with sperm for your brains and unintentional\nruins all around? Abel thanked me for saving this family. He thanked me for\nsaving him from a burden he was ill fit to bear, and a string of failures that\ndrove him to self-destruction.”\n“So he forgave you. That tells me something about him. What does it tell\nme about you? Except perhaps—”\n“Insolent boy!”\n“—that you would destroy a good man who swam seas you wished to\ncall your own? That you are a sea demon, mindless in your territorial rage,\ndestroying your enemies, true, but also driving away even—”\nStop, Kip! Stop before—\n“—your own family. Even finally your own wife.”\nOh. Shit.\nAndross’s eyes glittered, and Kip’s training took over. His eyes darted"

        "text": "Stop, Kip! Stop before—\n“—your own family. Even finally your own wife.”\nOh. Shit.\nAndross’s eyes glittered, and Kip’s training took over. His eyes darted\nback and forth from the whites of Andross’s eyes to his hips: the first places\nhe would be able to detect danger, whether magical or mundane. Then out\nto his hands, one of which held the crystal brandy glass, which could be\nflicked toward Kip as a distraction, the other of which could be used to\nsignal Grinwoody.\n“Took you long enough,” Andross said. “Finally reached the bottom of\nyour rhetorical toolbox, have we?”\n“Huh?” Kip asked. His sense of impending doom hadn’t relaxed one\nwhit, but Andross didn’t look dangerous. Everything Kip’s gut was telling\nhim was contradicted by what Andross’s eyes were saying.\n“Bringing up my departed wife. Such an obvious target that I wondered\nif you were either stupider than I’d imagined, or more self-controlled—and\ntherefore more dangerous—than I’d believed. Turns out I was right about\nyou after all.”\n“Did you even—”\nAndross raised a finger, and Kip shut up. He hated himself for it a\nmoment later, but his brain must have realized that raised finger was a\nlifeline, and, for once, had taken control from his tongue.\n“Something you should realize,” Andross said. “Merely because a\ntarget’s obvious, and an initial line of defenses stands in place, that doesn’t\nmean the target isn’t still there, and still soft as an egg in its shell. You\nunderstand this, Lard Guile. Your disgusting obesity can withstand one\ninsult, at least to the public eye, but even the slightest brush causes your\nsecret self-contempt and shame to grow. So you’ve found my obvious weak\nspot. Congratulations for having eyes. Just know this: Grinwoody, if he says\none more word about Felia, blow his brains out.”\nKip heard the click-clack of a hammer at his left ear. “With pleasure, my\nlord,” Grinwoody said.\nSlowly, so as not to be thought to be attacking, Kip glanced at the pistol,\nand the man. Grinwoody was indeed pleased, and the pistol barrel looked\nhuge. Too close to Kip’s eyeball for him to see how good the quality of it\nwas, how likely to misfire. But then, this was Andross Guile’s pistol. It\nwould be the best. Kip was getting faster at drafting, at moving, but he\nwasn’t this fast. Not yet.\n“You wouldn’t,” Kip said. Stupid thing to say. Grinwoody was even\nstanding off to the side so that the gore—and possibly the bullet—wouldn’t\nfly from Kip onto Andross.\n“If you think I’m bluffing,” Andross said, leaning forward to pour\nhimself more brandy, “say her name.”\nThe moment stretched between them like a lazy cat. Kip knew already\nthat he was going to fold. Andross knew it, too.\n“Well, that was a great talk, grandfather.” A little needle to drive home\nthe past loss on that count. “Are we done here?”\nShouldn’t have asked permission. Kip stood. Should have stood first."

Should have stood first.\n“The thing that astounds me, grandson,” Andross said, embracing the\nloss, showing it didn’t hurt him as much as Kip hoped. Probably deceitfully,\nbut still. Damn. “—is that it must be equally obvious to both of us that I am\nyour only hope. Our family’s enemies will try to destroy you, and our\nfamily’s friends won’t try to save you, because they know I despise you. To\nsay nothing of what I may do to you myself. Yet you choose this path. Still.\nYour father’s gone, surely dead by now. The facts have changed, but you\nhaven’t. Held too long, stubbornness is indistinguishable from stupidity.”\n“And would you respect me if I’d come in here and licked your boots?”\nKip asked.\nAndross Guile looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language.\n“Respect? Kip, I’ve destroyed many men I respected. If you wish to add\nyourself to that list, you’re close to earning the destruction, if not the\nrespect.”\n“Please,” Kip said, “underestimate me. It will only make this sweeter.”\nAndross grinned wryly, genuinely amused, and it was disconcerting to\nsee that grin. It was all Gavin Guile, and the sense of bereavement Kip felt\nat seeing that winsome grin on this monster’s face threw him off balance.\n“If your strategy rests on being underestimated, might not be best to\nannounce such, you think?” Andross asked.\nKip could only find inchoate curses on his once-nimble tongue. He said\nnothing.\n“Enough,” Andross said. He stood and shepherded Kip to the door. He\nlowered his voice. “Now. The matter I summoned you for.”\nOrholam’s knobby knee to my testicles—all this, and we still haven’t\ntalked about what he summoned me for?\n“The cards,” Andross said quietly as they reached the door. “I don’t\nknow where you’ve hidden them, but I want them. If you give them to me,\nyou will be my heir. I will take you under my wing and teach you all I\nknow, and I will tell you secrets you cannot conceive.”\nThe cards? Again? “If I found them, once I gave them to you, you’d just\nkill me,” Kip said.\n“Voice down,” Andross said. He stroked his chin, thinking. “Surely\nJanus Borig told you how they work. I can draft four colors. But one of the\ncolors I lack is blue. I can feel, taste, and sense what happens inside the\ncards, but I can’t see anything. In order to use the cards to their fullest, I\nneed a full-spectrum polychrome. The other polychromes are…\nunacceptable for various reasons. I need you, and I would have a continuing\nneed for you. And you would need me to teach you how to translate\nknowledge into power after I’m gone. If anything, you would be the partner\nin the superior position.”\nKip blinked. It made too much sense. “If I did this,” he said, “I’d keep"

It made too much sense. “If I did this,” he said, “I’d keep\nthe cards in my possession. Otherwise, if you tired of me, you could simply\nfind someone who drafts the colors you lack and put together the pictures\nfor yourself, albeit more slowly than I could do it for you.”\n“Done,” Andross said. “With one caveat: my card, my sons’ cards, and\nmy wife’s are mine. If you even look at them before you hand them over,\nthis deal is moot. Think on it. I’ll give you until your half brother arrives or\nuntil Sun Day, whichever comes first. Understand, though, if you try to\nhand over the cards to someone else, I’ll have no choice but to kill you.\nYour time is running out. Grinwoody?”\nThe slave made a small, unobtrusive sound to signal his presence.\nKip looked from one to the other. Why were they all still whispering?\nWhy were they standing right at the door to the promachos’s room?\n“How much did she overhear?”\nGrinwoody shot a glance at Kip, as if wondering that Andross wished\nKip to hear this, then said, “Most everything you said at the couch. She\nawakened almost immediately, and moved to eavesdrop soon after. She\nwon’t have been able to hear any of this.”\n“Well, then, Kip, your move,” Andross said. “Unless I miss my guess,\nshe’ll try to exploit the schism in our family, and being the green that she is,\nshe’ll be impulsive enough to think she needs to act immediately, so she\nwon’t wait for instructions from her much more formidable sister Eirene. I\nwould imagine Tisis will come to speak to you in tears at some point this\nweek, playing the damsel in distress. That tends to work well on men who\nwish they were strong. Don’t thank me, she’s too young for my tastes, and\nas you surmised, not good at feigning pleasure. It’s a skill most women pick\nup early, so I’m not sure if she’s stupid or stubborn. Quite the hotblood,\nthough, according to her best friend. Eager for the bed, though she’s kept\nher suitors short of the jade gate itself.”\n“Jade gate?”\n“Her quim. It’s her family’s horse trader roots showing through. They’ve\nbeen nobles a bare century. Knowing how some value such things, she’s\nintended to sell her virginity dearly, even if it’s virginity only by the most\ntechnical of definitions. Her friend, being her friend, swore up and down\nthat her chastity, such as it is, wasn’t merely for bargaining purposes,\nthough. She claimed Tisis has always had romantical notions about her first\ntime being special. Hmmph, youth. I imagine she’ll be too smart to lead her\nefforts on you with seduction, but as long as you play your cards right,\nshe’ll flop on her back in no time. She did for me. Not sure how you’ll fit\ninto the special first-time. But she’ll remember it forever, and surely that is\none definition of special, is it not?”"

The sheer\nmeanness of the man baffled him.\n“I just told you, I didn’t drink from that well. I left it for you, on\npurpose, in case you were delicate about sharing with a better man. You\nthrow my kindness in my face. Perhaps you are thick in more than the\nobvious sense. We’ve spoken too long.

The\nBlackguards outside the door said nothing, but then, that was what they\nwere supposed to do, wasn’t it?\nFour puzzled slaves were waiting for him at his room. “My lord,” one\nsaid, “there was a crime reported?”\nKip stepped past them into the room. Everything was pristine. The desk\nhad been replaced. The feather bed had been replaced. Every surface was\ngleaming with polish. Even his purse was back in its hiding spot. Kip\ndismissed the slaves with an apology. They looked at him like he was crazy.\nAnd who’s to say they’re wrong? What am I doing?\nI’m being used in fights I know nothing about, and I’m taking sides\nbased purely on the personal charisma of the players, not on what’s wrong\nor right, or where I should be, or even what’s most advantageous. I’ve been\nacting like a child.\nAndross knew exactly what I was going to do when he trashed my room.\nI’m that predictable.\nHe felt suddenly sick to his stomach.\nIn Nine Kings, I’d be the Blunderbuss—good only for short ranges, and\neasily picked up by any enemy and pointed wherever he wished.\nWhat am I going to do?\nChapter 62\n~Shimmercloak~\nThe perspective isn’t right. It’s hovering around waist height, swinging back\nand forth. It’s a hand, swinging as a young woman walks.

Not so much\nshaped like a knife as like a shark’s tooth, a broad triangle with a winking\ndiamond in the center.\nThe bouncing accelerates as the young woman begins jogging.\nBefore I can see much more, the perspective swings violently as the\nblade slams into a woman’s side, is pulled out, bloody, and then poised at\nher throat.\nWith the blade at her throat, now I can see her face. Her irises are\nstained red, halfway to the halo, and wide with fear and pain.

She holds up the living\nstone to a magnifying lens, studies it minutely.\nShe moves to a work table, puts the ruby in a delicate vise. In a few\nminutes, she’s bored a tiny, shallow hole into the gem. Satisfied, she\nprepares the rest of the room. She pushes everything else off her work table\nand carefully drapes a long muddy-brown cloak across it. She pulls forward\na choker concealed in the collar.

She\nreaches the end finally, and as she stops, I see that the ruby is now as\ndrained of color as the murdered drafter was.\nClicking her tongue, the old woman examines her work.

Kip had skipped again. That was happening\nmore and more often. Despite that, he wasn’t falling behind. Between his\nprivate training sessions with Karris Guile and sparring with the squad\nunder Tremblefist’s personal instruction—and they’d all taken Kip under\ntheir wings, giving him pointers at every opportunity—Kip was actually\nworth his spot on Squad Aleph now. And not just for his mind.\nFine, primarily for his mind.\nPeople were bumping into Teia. She didn’t have a purse on her belt, so\nshe wasn’t terribly alert, but it was irritating. For all the good that being\nsmall did her sometimes, when she moved through a crowd, if she wanted\ngo faster than a crawl, she had to really move, ducking and dodging in a\nway that had become second nature to her, but doing that didn’t exactly\nengender the meditative thoughtfulness she was seeking. No one bumped\ninto Commander Ironfist. Not on accident, anyway.\nTeia remembered an instance of a young woman stepping into the\ncommander’s path just in time to be bowled over. The commander’s\nreflexes were quick enough that he’d practically snatched the woman out of\nthe air. She’d purred, melting into his arms. The Blackguards had laughed.\nThe commander hadn’t been amused. As always, he was on his way\nsomewhere more important. He lifted the woman in front of him—and it’s\nnot easy to look seductive when a man lifts you by the armpits—stared her\nhard in the eye until she nearly wet herself, and dropped her off to the side\nwithout a word.\nIt had kept that woman from ever trying it again, but had backfired\nwhere others were concerned.\nTeia grinned at the memory and finally emerged from the market. She\nwasn’t even sure where she was now. Not that it was possible to get truly\nlost on Big Jasper. She put her hands in her pockets—Blackguard trousers\nhad pockets. She loved them.\nThere was a note there.\nShe pulled it out, and a hollow formed in her stomach. Fine flash paper,\nof course. If she tried to simply open it—or anyone else tampered with it—\nit would burn up in an instant. She wondered if Karris had been good\nenough to pass her the orders herself, or if she had people to do that now."

She wondered if Karris had been good\nenough to pass her the orders herself, or if she had people to do that now.\nShe tore into the bottom right corner, edged the tear around the left side\nlike she’d been taught, and finally opened the note: “Kip is going to be\nassassinated on a raid, today. Most likely by a Blackguard. Several,\npossibly. They’ll be at the docks before noon. Save him.” It was in Karris’s\nhand.\nTeia’s breath caught. The docks. The squad’s current safe house was on\nthe way. She ran.\nIn minutes, she arrived at the safe house. She knocked the code rapidly\non the wood, and then opened the door. Cruxer was alone inside, seating a\nnew flint in the cockjaw of his pistol. He looked up. He frowned as soon as\nhe saw the expression on her face. “What’s going on, Teia?”\n“Kip. It’s Kip. He’s going to be murdered. We have to go help!” Teia\nsaid.\n“What? What are you talking about?”\n“Now, Crux!”\nChapter 64\nKip was sitting at his desk with mounds of books threatening to bury him\nwhen someone knocked on his door. It could only be Tisis Malargos. Kip\nhad been preparing for this since he’d left the old man’s room. He still\nwasn’t ready.\nThe truth was, Kip didn’t really know Tisis. Sure, she’d pretended that\nshe was going to kill him during his Threshing. Sure, she’d single-handedly\nmade him fail by giving him back the bell rope after he’d thrown it away,\nbut perhaps Kip shouldn’t take it personally. He was starting to understand\nwhat it was to inherit the enmities of your people. How could it have been\npersonal? She’d never even met him before that day.\nAnd of course, Kip had later killed her uncle. That kind of made them\neven, didn’t it?\nHe got up, braced himself, and opened the door.\nIt wasn’t Tisis. It was two Blackguards, Buskin and Lytos, looking\nalmost like a comedy, Buskin was so short and Lytos was so tall. But they\nweren’t smiling.\n“Know how we been searching the seas?” Buskin asked.\n“For my father?” Kip asked eagerly.\n“No,” Lytos said at the same time Buskin said, “Yes.”\nThey shot a look at each other.\n“No need to keep it from him if he knows,” Buskin said. “Some of us go\nlooking for the bane, and some of us go looking for the Prism. It’s supposed\nto be secret.”\n“My grand—the promachos told me about it,” Kip said. “And he said\nI’d get a chance to go.”\n“This ain’t that. With so many of us full Blackguards training everyone,\nWatch Captain Fisk has got us dipping into the nunks to help look for bane.\nYour number came up.”\n“Watch Captain Fisk?” Kip said. “You mean Trainer Fisk?”\n“You’d know about his promotion and the schedule if you bothered\ncoming to practice more often,” Lytos said in his odd eunuch’s tenor."

That\nwas a small disaster. Fisk had worked with Andross to try to keep Kip out\nof the Blackguard. For all the times he’d seemed friendly, he was a traitor at\nthe core.\n“How long we going to be gone?” Kip asked.\nLytos said, “Back before dark. They don’t want the nunks missing any\ntraining—any more training, maybe I should say—so you all don’t do\novernights.” He looked around Kip’s room. “Nice quarters. You sure you\nwant to give this up for a barracks?”\nRight. Because my life is so wonderful and easy. Kip let retorts dance\nbehind his teeth, as if taking the jibe with good humor. “Enough of the easy\nlife for me. I’m ready to buckle down and really start to work.”\n“Good. Well, let’s get to it, then,” Buskin said. He really was incredibly\nshort. Even with his silly high shoes.\nSuddenly though, Kip really didn’t want to go with these two. There was\nsomething off. They hadn’t ever before been hostile to him. It was like\nsomething had worked them up. Had he done something to insult them?\nMaybe it was like his father had warned him: they disliked how easy it\nseemed he was getting a good life handed to him.\nWhatever it’s costing me, at least I’m coming out ahead of Lytos, whose\nparents made him a eunuch in hopes it would help him get into the\nBlackguard.\nAnd it was Kip’s first chance to get to take part in the search for his\nfather himself, even if only tangentially.\nHe grabbed his stuff. “Ready.”\nChapter 65\nTeia and Cruxer ran into Winsen not a block from the safe house. Cruxer\nhesitated. They didn’t know Winsen as well as they knew each other, but he\nwas in the squad.\n“We’ll need all the help we can get,” Teia said, but she let Cruxer make\nthe call.\n“Someone’s going to try to kill Kip,” Cruxer told Winsen. “We’re\nheading to the docks to stop them.”\nGive Cruxer this: right or wrong, he made his decisions quickly. And his\npenchant for trusting people and believing in them might get him killed\neventually, but it meant that the circle of people who liked him and wanted\nhim to approve of them was always growing.\nWinsen blinked once. It was the closest to surprise Teia had ever seen\nfrom him. “Then you don’t want to go to the docks. I passed him not two\nminutes ago. He said he was going out bane hunting with Lytos and Buskin,\nbut they’d told him to meet them in Little Hill. He was headed there.”\n“The slums? Why there and why go sepa—” Cruxer started to ask.\n“Fewer witnesses,” Teia said. “If they go out to sea and come back\nwithout him, they’ll be suspected. He meets them in a slum, they kill him,\nand if the deed itself isn’t witnessed, it’s clean.”"

How do we kill Blackguards?”\n“By surprising them,” she said.\n“That’s not what I meant.”\n“I know.”\nHe looked at her and was suddenly just a boy again. “How could they?”\n“Ask it later.

We see them draw\nweapons, we shoot.”\n“Got it,” Winsen said, rejoining them. He was wearing street clothes\nnow, and holding not one but two bows. One was one of his yew longbows,\na foot taller than he was, and the other was a simple recurve that he tossed\nto Cruxer.\n“If we do this, and we’re wrong,” Cruxer said, “we’ll look like traitors.\nIt’ll be Orholam’s Glare for all of us. We don’t know that Breaker is who\nwe think he is.”\n“We know him,” Teia said. “That’s enough for me.”\n“Me, too,” Cruxer said. “Winsen?”\nWinsen shrugged. As ever, he was a loaded musket. He didn’t care so\nmuch which direction he was pointed, so long as he could fire.\n“Then let’s go!” Cruxer said.\nWithout another word, they ran, heedless of who would wonder at them.\nCruxer was tall enough that he appeared merely to be loping, though his\ngait forced Teia to run full out.\nWhen they got to Little Hill, they slowed. They walked briskly, but no\nfaster than many merchants on their errands. With a wink and a smile,\nCruxer got an old baker to tell them exactly when some Blackguards had\npassed through and where she thought they were going.\nThey pushed faster than they would have if they were tracking anyone\nelse. The likelihood of blundering over their prey at the speeds they were\nmoving was high. But Buskin and Lytos didn’t know they were being\nhunted.\nThe base of Little Hill was a Tyrean slum. Not precisely dangerous, at\nleast during the day, but the neighborhood bore unmistakable signs of the\norigins of so many of its residents. Almost half the women wore long tunics\nover trousers, and the men wore strong green-and-black-patterned tunics,\nmore shapeless than the tailored tunics most people favored on Big Jasper.\nMost notable, though, was that the domes on the buildings in this area were\neither perfunctorily small or had been hollowed out.

The Tyreans liked to\nuse their roofs as another room—an open room. Most of the hollowed-out\ndomes, standing bare in their frames on flat roofs, at least at one time had\nshutters, which when closed retained the dome shape, but in their poverty,\nthe people here didn’t fix such frippery when it failed.\n“Tssst!” Cruxer said.\nTeia saw his hand signals: two blocks ahead, then right. We’ll\noverwatch.\nThere wasn’t time to see exactly what they planned. Teia jogged toward\nthe corner. It started raining. She threw her hood up, and drew in as much\nparyl as she could hold. She stepped around the corner, nonchalant, just in\ncase.\nNothing.\nShe moved down the narrow street at a half jog, as if hurrying from the\nrain. Dozens of others traversing the same street were doing the same. The\nonly thing she could hope was that Lytos and Buskin were wearing their\nblacks so they’d be easy to spot.\nThrowing glances left and right as she passed intersection after\nintersection, Teia’s heart was beating harder and harder. With people\nducking their heads and hurrying, it would make murdering Kip and getting\naway with it easier and easier.\nShe heard a musket shot above her and jumped. No, not a musket,\nsomeone slamming shut a shutter against the rain. Broken stones and\nbroken bones.\nThere! She’d crossed one of the crooked alleys and caught a glimpse of\nblack. No street in the city was supposed to be crooked. It made dark places\nwhere the light of the Thousand Stars couldn’t reach. But slums were slums\nthe world over.\nShe was only behind the Blackguards by about thirty paces now, and the\nalley cleared out. No one except Teia and her prey.\nAnd what am I supposed to do when I catch them?\nWhat if Lytos and Buskin were just here to get some gear for their trip?\nIt wasn’t out of the question, was it? The Blackguards would have used\nsupplies and weapons from their stores and safe houses near the docks first,\nbut eventually those supplies would be exhausted, and they would have to\ndip into what they’d planted even in warehouses in the slums. Usually,\nslaves could do such work, but safe houses were kept secret.\nMaybe it was all innocent. Karris could be wrong, right?\nThe sun was still high in the sky, but the clouds were so thick and black\nthat it was getting dark. The rain became a full downpour, leaving Teia in a\nrace between rising fears and wet-kitten hopes.\nShe heard Kip’s voice and poked one eye around the corner.\nToo late.\nLytos had drawn a knife, left side, unseen by Kip and was stepping—\nHe dropped to one knee, almost gracefully, as if making obeisance, the\nbarest whisper of arrow feathers disappearing fully into his armpit. He\nlooked down, doubtless wondering what had happened, but it looked like he\nwas bowing his head to Kip.\n“Lytos?” Kip asked, turning, all unaware of what had just happened."

He saw Teia first, then saw Lytos pitch onto his\nface. The look on his face was pure guilt, then rage.\nHis hand dipped to his belt where he kept his throwing knives. Being\nshort and not strong, Buskin liked his throwing knives, and he was one of\nthe few people Teia had ever seen for whom throwing knives were not an\naffectation.\nTeia’s hand was already up, but it wasn’t the familiar paryl that came\nthrough her. A wave bigger than her own body rushed through her and\nsnapped like a whip at her fingers.\nAll the world was fire. She dropped. Kip staggered. Buskin flinched in\nmid-throw, sending his knife into the sky even as he jumped backward,\nthrowing his hand up over his face.\nThe wave passed.\nSilence. They all looked at each other, staggered. No one was on fire.\nAn arrow streaked through the space Buskin had been occupying not a\nheartbeat earlier and shattered against the stone wall beside him.\nThe moment snapped; Buskin fled as if loosed from a bow himself.\nKip was agog, looking at Teia and then himself, apparently wondering\nwhy he wasn’t on fire. “What th—”\n“Get him!” Teia shouted. She bolted after Buskin. Kip didn’t follow, at\nleast not fast enough to be helpful.\nBuskin turned at the first intersection, his lead on Teia only thirty paces.\nLightning crashed nearby, the frenetic flashing of multiple strikes coming at\nthe same instant thunder rattled windows through all of Big Jasper. The\nlightning threw a shadow into the intersection. Faster than her conscious\nmind could grasp what she had seen, Teia reacted. Trap.\nShe was already sprawling, slipping instead of jumping aside. Her feet\nskidded across rain-slick stones. One foot shot forward while the other went\nback. She slid, doing the splits, right past the corner. A glittering blade\nflashed right over her head.\nBuskin staggered, almost stepped on her as his blade didn’t meet the\nresistance he expected.\nOn hands and feet, Teia scuttled backward. She twisted her wrist on an\nunseen stone and fell flat on her back.\nBuskin advanced, raising his sword for the killing—no wasteful, big,\ntheatrical slash from a Blackguard; he would stab the point straight into her\nheart, twist quickly in case he’d pierced a little to the right or left, and be\ngone in less than a second’s time.\nBut as he stepped forward, an arrow flashed past his face. He shot a\nglance back up the alley, must have seen Winsen or Cruxer or both, and\nleaped back and away. Teia shot paryl at him from her back, but it shattered\neasily with his rapid movement.\nShe struggled to her feet and went after him.

Lightning flashed again,\nthis time farther away, hitting the great lightning-catchers above the\nChromeria, the boom of thunder following a few heartbeats later. Teia\nfound herself in a market. It was in an uproar. All the shoppers had already\ndeparted as soon as the rain began pounding, but the merchants were\ntrapped, gathering their goods, trying to soothe panicking donkeys and\noxen. Others were running around their shops, shuttering windows and\npulling merchandise inside.\nIn all the chaos, a lone runner was nearly invisible. Any other time, such\na sight would stick out and cause outrage. Now it was one whitecap in a\nstorm-tossed sea.\nA crash rang out as a cart lost all the barrels inside it. Teia saw Buskin\nrunning past it, having opened the back gate to loose the barrels. One giant\nbarrel ruptured as it fell, and dumped its contents—olive oil—in a vast slick\nacross the wet stones. Half a dozen pedestrians rushing past went down in\ntangles of limbs. A horse pulling an empty cart shied as its driver sawed on\nthe reins, trying to avoid crushing the fallen. He lost grip of the reins,\nthough—and it was a miracle he did. The horse, head free, looked down and\nquick-stepped over the people lying at its feet.\nBut it turned aside to do so, and the wheels of its cart hit the slick and\nlost traction immediately, sliding the cart inexorably into the olive oil\nwagon—and blocking the lane entirely.\nTeia dodged into another pathway through the market, ran straight into a\nyoung woman and knocked her flat. Teia spun out of the collision, jumped\nover a rack of thobes that had fallen into the street, and kept going.\nSomething lit the sky that wasn’t lightning, but as soon as Teia looked\nfor the luxin strike, she plowed into someone else, much bigger than she\nwas, and turned her eyes back to the market and her target.\nShe made it to the edge of the market, just in time to see Buskin snatch\nup two burning lanterns and hurl them at the ground in the alley behind\nhimself. One ignited, but the other didn’t—at least until he sprayed the alley\nwith red luxin.\nThe flames roared up, blocking the alley, and for half an instant Teia\nthought of trying to leap through the flames before good sense asserted\nitself. She barely stopped in time. The red luxin would gutter out in a\nminute at most, but that was too long. She didn’t know this part of town\nwell enough to be certain that going one block to either side would take her\nback to Buskin’s path: she might get lucky and find that he’d turned the\nsame way she did—or not.\nShe was looking for another path, a way to climb around the flames, a\nwindow above them in the second story, anything, when Buskin’s flames\ndied as if a giant had stomped on them, splattering liquid orange in every\ndirection.\nA figure tore past her. Kip.\nHe was drafting even as he ran. On top of the fire-smothering orange\nluxin, he threw down planks of green to give himself footing, and sprinted\nright across where the fires had been.\nHis momentum carried him past Teia, who was standing still.

He flicked\noff the spectacles that he was wearing, holstered them in the pouch he wore,\nand drew out another pair as he ran. He threw a hand up into the air and\nshot yellow symbols into the sky that dissolved into light even as they arced\nupward—directions for Cruxer and Winsen about where Buskin was going.\nTeia saw them running across a roof, each holding a bow, approaching\nan alley gap that was too far to jump. Cruxer sped up and leapt anyway—\nand made it. Winsen followed his lead, except he threw his hands and a\ngout of unfocused luxin out of them to give himself extra lift the way they’d\npracticed.\nIt would have worked if he hadn’t been holding the longbow in one\nhand. Instead, it impeded the luxin thrust and threw him off balance even as\nhe was flying through the air. But Kip was running right under that gap, and\nhe threw up a wide hand of green luxin that bobbed Winsen gently back up\ninto the air. Instead of smashing into the side of the building, Winsen landed\nsideways just at the top of it. He rolled across the roof and smacked his\nhead on the dome, but was unhurt.\nThey were almost to the great fish market near the docks when lightning\nstruck again, blinding Teia. The boom of thunder literally threw her from\nher feet. She tumbled as she’d been taught, throwing one hand down hard\nso that her head didn’t take the impact.\nShe regained her senses in time to see that one of the Thousand Stars\nhad been struck by lightning. They were supposed to be insulated with the\ncopper lightning-catchers, but either it was gone or hadn’t worked. The\nentire stiltlike Star was leaning, shattering, stones raining down. Then the\narch collapsed all at once, coming down in a roar of stone and dust in the\nheavy rain.\nThe placement couldn’t have been worse—right in front of them, and\nbetween them and Buskin. As if the gods themselves had intervened to save\nhim. On the other hand, the arch had hit the edge of the building on which\nCruxer and Winsen stood. If Cruxer hadn’t stopped to help Winsen, he\nwould have been crushed by the falling rock.\nTeia stopped behind the rubble. She could climb over it, but every stone\nwas shifting. Too much delay. Oh, hells. Kip!\nKip had been ahead of all of them.\nTeia looked for him. He was nowhere in the fish market beyond the\nrubble.\nOh, no. No no no.\nHer heart stopped. The air of the intersection was awash in a cloud of\ndust, only slowly being beaten down by the downpour. People were\nscreaming, horses were whinnying in terror, but Teia had no mind for any of\nit. She drafted a paryl torch, the beams of its light cutting through the dust\ncloud. She charged forward, barely pausing long enough to pull a cloth in\nfront of her face so she could breathe.

The ground was littered with broken\nmasonry, shattered mirror-glass, and there—dear Orholam, a body. Was it—\nTeia grabbed the hand she could see and pulled. It came out, with half an\narm. She held the arm in both hands, part horrified beyond words, part cold\nand analytical. This arm seemed skinnier than Kip’s. The skin was…\ncovered in grime, colorless in her paryl vision. She went back to the visible\nspectrum, but it was too dusty. She couldn’t see anything. She turned the\narm over, went back to paryl.\nNo drafter’s scars on the hands or wrists.\nIt wasn’t Kip. It was a star tower slave. What were they doing up there\nin a storm?\nShe tossed the arm aside. She didn’t care about some slave.\nA part of her wrote down that thought in stone. It would come back to\nhaunt her. But right now, she didn’t care. Kip. Dear Orholam, where’s Kip?\nShe picked her way over the rubble, looking in paryl through the dust.\nThe rubble ahead of her shifted and sank. Suddenly, she heard coughing.\nWith quick, light steps, she crossed the rubble. There was Kip, upside\ndown. He’d drafted an egg of luxin around himself as the arch fell all\naround him, but had quickly run out of air and let the egg collapse.\nTeia grabbed his hand and pulled him up and out. He was besmirched,\nthe heavy rain turning the dust coating his features into mud in instants.\nFor a split second, he’d looked so terrified coming out of that little space\nthat Teia couldn’t reconcile the little-boy terror on his face with the kind of\ndrafting she’d just seen out of him. He stared at her, frantic, frightened,\nchest heaving, coughing still.\nShe tried to hand him a cloth to breathe through, but he swept her up\ninto a bear hug.\nFor one moment, she was utterly stunned. Then, in the next, a sudden\nthawing. She hadn’t been really touched in so long, she couldn’t even\nremember the last time. Kip’s pure, delighted-to-see-you, I-care-so-much-\nfor-you touch? Oh, dear gods. There was something about the pure\nphysicality of it: an acceptance beyond words, a joy that spoke only truth.\nBut she was frozen, too surprised by the sudden emergence of Kip from\ndeath, by the flood of emotion. She didn’t hug back, even as the complete,\ntotal, abject need to hug back rose in her. She wanted to cling to someone—\nno, not to someone; it wasn’t just a need to connect, though it was that, too\n—to connect with Kip, her friend.\nHer best friend. The one who saw her.\nThe tides rising in her were obliterating, scouring away the dross of\nevery preconception and prejudice.\nAnd Kip dropped the hug, suddenly awkward at her failure to hug back.\nNo! her mind cried, but her arms—her treacherous arms—didn’t rise.\n“Sorry.

Thanks,” Kip said quickly, as if to cover, as if to ignore, as if he\ndidn’t feel rejected.\nNo, Orholam no, I didn’t mean it like that.\nBut Teia said nothing, didn’t move.\nKip turned. They were on the very edge of the rubble—they’d come\nthrough it, together. But they were too late. Kip pulled his blue spectacles\non. They were miraculously unbroken, and he drafted quickly, again as if it\nwere nothing. In a few moments, there were stairs from where they stood up\nto the edge of the building where Cruxer and Winsen still stood.\nThey joined the young men there. They hadn’t given up the hunt. They\nstood ready as hounds at the leash. Cruxer pointed. “There!”\nBuskin was almost through the crowded, emptying fish market. People\nwere running everywhere, still packing up their stalls, trying not to lose all\nof the day’s catch and sales. Winsen was standing with an arrow nocked,\nthough he hadn’t drawn it—there was no shot yet, and holding a longbow\ndrawn for any length of time was impossible.\nBuskin reached the far side of the market. He turned and grinned fiercely\nat them. He put his fingers under his chin and flicked them forward in rude\nsalute. Then he turned his back and walked away.\nWinsen pulled the arrow back into the big longbow, using the thick\nmuscles of his back to help with the massive draw-weight, even as people\nran to and fro, obscuring Buskin. The shot was at least two hundred paces.\nA young mother tried to pull three children out of the street, but found\nherself with too few hands, juggling tools in one hand and recalcitrant kids\nin the other, at least one crying.\n“Winsen,” Cruxer said sadly, “it’s too far. You can’t—”\nWinsen loosed the arrow.\nTeia put a hand to her mouth, certain she was going to see a child die.\nThe arrow flew too fast for eyes to follow. She and Kip and Cruxer and\nWinsen, too, all looked to Buskin. He reached the corner and looked back—\nand suddenly hurtled to the ground sideways as the arrow ripped through\nhis chest, lodged in whatever mail he was wearing, and flung him down.\nIt took them several minutes to cross the empty market and get to him.\nHe was dead. No one lingered in the market or the streets. No one wanted to\ninvolve themselves in whatever private quarrel this was. Not today, not in\nthe storm and the rain and the lightning that might slay good or bad.\nWinsen finally unstrung his great yew bow when he saw that Buskin was\ndead. He didn’t seem moved in the least, other than being satisfied. Cruxer\nlooked at him, disbelieving, and not just of the accuracy of his shot.\n“What the hell, Winsen?” Kip asked. “There were nearly a hundred\npeople here. How’d you even make that shot, with that many innocents in\nthe way?”\nWinsen looked at Cruxer, then at Teia, and finally at Kip. Teia had killed"

        "text": "people here. How’d you even make that shot, with that many innocents in\nthe way?”\nWinsen looked at Cruxer, then at Teia, and finally at Kip. Teia had killed\nbefore, and it had left her shaken and weepy. She’d been stunned at first,\nsure, not able to understand or process what had happened exactly. The\nfinality of it had sunk in immediately, so she was slow to judge those who\nseemed cold when they killed. It wasn’t the same for everyone. But\nWinsen’s eyes didn’t have that numb look in them that said he hadn’t\nprocessed the killing yet, that he was stunned. His eyes were clear. Buskin\nhad been a bad man. He needed to be killed. Winsen had done it. What\nmore was there to say or think about?\nWinsen shrugged, puzzled. “I didn’t care if I missed.”\nChapter 66\n“Why am I reporting to you rather than Commander Ironfist?” Kip asked\nKarris. He stood in the Prism’s quarters in the Blackguard’s informal\nposture, back straight, legs shoulder width apart, hands lightly clasped\nbehind his back. Dressed in his inductee’s grays—which were loose and\nshapeless, standard-issue baggy rather than the tailored, formfitting luxin-\ninfused clothing full Blackguards earned upon taking final vows—he\nlooked martial. Karris noted the change.\nKip’s eyes were no longer simply the striking blue he’d been born with.\nGreen ringed each pupil, many tiny flecks of blue served to subtly brighten\nhis irises, red bloomed like stars or fires, and a close inspection revealed\nhints of every other color there, too. She would have reprimanded him for\nburning through his life so quickly if it weren’t so hypocritical. He was still\nstout, maybe always would be, but the baby fat was almost gone from his\nface, and when he stood here with determination and mild pique at doing\nsomething that didn’t make sense to him, he hearkened back unmistakably\nto a young Gavin Guile.\nMoreover, his question was a good one, and it deserved better than the\nlie Karris had prepared. “Commander Ironfist is a bit busy these days. I’ll\ndebrief you and pass on the relevant details to the commander and the\nWhite. Though I no longer serve in an official capacity, it is war, and we all\nserve where we’re needed.”\nKip looked stung. “Not even this is important enough for a direct report?\nThe betrayal of two Blackguards, and their deaths?”\n“We’re in a civil war. Betrayal is commonplace. Do you know how\nmany Blackguards we’ve lost in the sweeps this month?”\n“Six,” Kip said.\nShe stopped. “That’s right.” Kip seemed oblivious at times, as caught up\nin his own world as sixteen-year-olds get. But maybe he was more aware\nthan she’d credited.\n“Tell me everything,” she said.\nAnd he did. It wasn’t as good of a report as she’d expect from a full\nBlackguard, but for one unpracticed and ignorant of the expectations for\nsuch a report, it was excellent.\n“Again,” she said.\nHe told it again, this time clearer, with fewer oh-I-forgot-to-say’s.

But\nthen he stopped and rubbed his forehead. “I wasn’t going to… It doesn’t\nhelp anyone, but…”\n“I expect your reports to be fully honest, Breaker,” she said.\n“I didn’t understand it at the time, and then things happened so fast it\nkind of got buried, but right before the first arrow took out Lytos, I heard\nhim say, ‘Fuck it, I can’t do this.’”\nA chill invaded Karris’s bones. “And you took that to mean what?”\n“I didn’t take it to mean anything. All hell broke loose right then, but\nlooking back, I think he had second thoughts right at the end. I think he was\ndrawing his knife to attack Buskin, not me.”\nLytos. Orholam have mercy. Karris had been holding off her own\nmemories of the big eunuch. He’d been a practical joker with an infectious\nlaugh, constantly short-sheeting the newly sworn Blackguards, putting fire\nbalm in their underclothes, dropping live scorpions in young Blackguards’\nboots (though he sealed the scorpions’ stingers in solid luxin first—he\nwasn’t malicious, just a prankster).\nThat Lytos might come through and do the right thing at the last second\nbroke her heart for some reason even more than the abstract thought that he\nmight have been deceived or blackmailed into betraying them.\nAnd then to be killed before he could prove his fidelity. Oh, Lytos.\nNo wonder Kip hadn’t told his friends: By the way, one of the men you\nkilled? He was on our side.\n“As he lay there, he said something about a luxiat,” Kip said. “But it\nwasn’t clear. He died before he could tell me.”\nHis voice was level as he said it, but something in his tone reminded her\nsuddenly that as much as this boy looked like a soldier, stood like a soldier,\nreported like a soldier, he was also still a boy. “I’m sorry, Kip,” she said.\n“Am I right, not to tell them, I mean?” Kip asked brusquely. He didn’t\nwant her softness and understanding now. “The commander says we’re not\nafraid of the truth, that that’s what makes Blackguards different. Am I\nserving my team by holding this back, or betraying them by not trusting\nthem to handle it?”\n“Who took the shot that killed Lytos?” she asked. She knew from his\nreport.\n“Winsen,” Kip said, puzzled.\n“Then what do you think?” she asked.\nHis brow furrowed. “Winsen’s… different. It doesn’t seem to bother\nhim, killing, I mean.”\n“There are some few like that,” she said. “I think if you told Winsen that\nhe would say Lytos shouldn’t have been there in the first place. That Lytos\nput himself in the line of fire, that he gave your team no choice. I think\nLytos would agree, don’t you?”\n“It’s just that simple for some people?” Kip asked.\n“Some people are what they appear.”"

Just the misplaced\nemotions of youth, or something more particular? Then Kip said, “When\ndid you know you loved my father?”\nIt was someone tearing the bandages off a wound. “Pardon?” she asked.\nHe didn’t repeat the question.\n“That is a very personal question,” she said.\n“Not really,” he said.\nPart of her wanted to slap him for countering her so insolently, but in the\nnext moment she knew that it was really that she wanted to slap Dazen for\nkeeping so many secrets. Now to keep the secrets of that man who might\nwell be dead, she was going to have to lie, too. “There was a dance. The\nLuxlords’ Ball. I danced with both him and his brother. I think I fell in love\nwith him then.”\n“So you always loved Gavin?” Kip asked.\nShe saw the trap just in time. “This, this conversation is finished,” she\nsputtered.\n“But you tried to elope with Dazen. Why would you do that if you loved\nGavin all along? Dazen was the younger brother. There was no advantage in\nmarrying him. There was no reason to elope with him except for love.”\n“I was young!”\n“I’m young. I don’t destroy the world over it.”\n“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Karris said.\n“Because I only get lies and evasions every time I ask.”\nIt took the wind from her sails, though anything but becalmed. He was\nright. He deserved the truth, and he couldn’t be told the truth. He thought\nhis father was his uncle, and his uncle his father, and he hated the one and\nloved the other, in the wrong order.\n“Kip,” she said quietly. “How many times have you told the story of\nwhat happened to you at the Battle of Ru?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Yes you do.”\nHe said nothing for a moment, then gave in. “Once or twice, when I was\nwith the squad. We’d been drinking. Even in my squad, some of them were\nso… so excited to hear about it. It seems… obscene somehow.”\n“I was there with you, Kip, and you did nothing wrong. In fact, you\nwere the hero that day.”\nThe word dropped between them like an ill-fitting garment. Kip couldn’t\npick it up.\n“We all acted bravely, Kip.

I talked to some of the most popular minstrels in the\nJaspers.”\nKip’s face twisted like she’d betrayed him. “But you… you understand.\nHow could you?”\n“Because it’s true, Kip. It’s not all the truth, and what’s true about it may\nbe misunderstood, but that others will misunderstand doesn’t mean we keep\nthe truth in a basket. And because the day may come when you need a\nName.”\n“I don’t want another name,” he said, glum teenager again. “I’ve already\ngot too many.”\n“Not a name like Kip, a Name, like Breaker. As in, ‘I am become a\nName.’” If he didn’t know the Gevison, he should.\n“I don’t want that either,” he said.\n“I wasn’t done. You can barely tell a story about a battle in which\neveryone came out looking good. You didn’t fail. You didn’t fire a musket\nas a friend moved into the line of fire and got his face blown off. You\nweren’t a coward that day. We fought odds beyond human comprehension,\nand if it wasn’t a victory for us, at least it wasn’t a victory for our foes.”\nHer lips were suddenly dry, for here she must tell him truths and lies\nlinked, and he would never forgive her for it. “There were no battles that\nsimple in the False Prism’s War. None. How can you tell stories of what you\ndid when it seems everything you did was wrong? When you were a coward\nand your friends died because of it? Or is it less painful to tell of when you\nalmost died because your own kin failed you, running away when they\ncould have saved you easily? A man who’s a hero one day can be a coward\nthe next, and sometimes even telling of our heroism reminds us of our\ncowardice.\n“My brother and sister Blackguards fought and killed cousins they’d met\na hundred times. Classmates with whom we’d played pranks on our\nmagisters. Lovers with whom we’d shared a first kiss. Samite had an\nunrequited love for this ridiculously handsome cavalier. His family joined\nthe other side. Samite was part of a strike force that infiltrated a city, found\nthe cavalier with his fellows and their families camped in one of the great\nstables of the city. They barred the doors and set it afire. She listened to him\nburn to death, screaming to her to have mercy, not for himself but for his\nfamily who were inside with him. Samite loved horses. Riding was her one\nrefuge from her cares. She won’t ride now unless she must. She doesn’t feel\nworthy after burning two hundred and seventy of the innocent creatures to\ndeath—and all those people. She was sixteen years old.”\nKip was aghast. “I didn’t know.”"

        "text": "worthy after burning two hundred and seventy of the innocent creatures to\ndeath—and all those people. She was sixteen years old.”\nKip was aghast. “I didn’t know.”\n“Because it’s not the kind of thing a warrior shares often. Not even in\nher cups.”\n“And you and my father, you have stories like that?”\nShe hesitated. How close to the truth did she dare go? How long would\nhe accept evasions?\n“Worse?” he asked.\n“You can’t rate soul wounds,” she said.\n“One thing,” Kip said. “I have to ask. My mother left me a note asking\nthat I take vengeance on my father. She was a…” He swallowed, but\ncontinued manfully. “She was an addict and a liar and Orholam only knows\nwhat else. I assume she was a camp follower who was spurned afterward,\nbut she said… with her dying breath, she said Gavin was a rapist. It’s not\ntrue, is it?”\nRapist. For some reason, Karris didn’t flash back to that awful bedroom\nand lying on her back quietly, passively drunk, wishing she would pass out,\nwishing she would fight. Instead, she thought back to the long walk home,\nthe shame at her torn-off buttons that kept her from covering herself\ndecently, the averted stares of the guards she walked past. No one had even\noffered her a coat. Who wouldn’t offer a young girl, who was half naked\nand ashamed, a coat?\n“Your father,” Karris said levelly, locking eyes with Kip, “is not a\nrapist.” The man Kip knew as his father, the man who had claimed him as\nson, Dazen, was not a rapist.\n“But it was war. Are you sure?” Kip asked.\nHer initial hesitation had been too long. He needed more. It was not the\nkind of question to which you could leave doubts. Karris said, “Once, in\nbed, he mistook my cries for cries of pain. It distressed him so much he\nwent soft. Not the reaction a rapist would have, you think?”\nFor a moment, Kip didn’t seem to understand. Then he blushed\nfuriously. “I, uh, I think that was more than I wanted to know.”\nKarris cleared her throat. It was more than she’d wanted to share. She\nfelt the blood rising in her own cheeks. But it was necessary. “Good\nenough?”\nKip averted his eyes. “About that? Dear Orholam, yes. Please, let’s\nnever speak of it again!”\nKarris laughed. “Uh-oh, now I know your weakness!”\n“Oh, come on, you can’t!” Kip complained. “No one wants to hear about\ntheir parents having—Parent, I mean. Their parent… never mind.”\nParents. Like she and Dazen were Kip’s parents. Dazen—as Gavin—had\nadopted Kip, and he’d married Karris. So that sort of made Karris Kip’s\nmother, right?\nParents. One little slip. One little plural. Parent. Mother. It touched\nsomething in Karris so cold that the word itself froze on the point of impact.\nIt dropped and broke like a young girl’s princess hopes had on a cold\nmidnight wandering home alone in the cold, eyes wet, thighs wet."

Perhaps that\nKarris had been spending time with him every day for months, training him,\ngiving him advice, supervising his education. She’d been manipulated into\nacting like a mother. Into showing care that could be mistaken for love.\nThat bitch.\nThe White had done this on purpose.\nWhat had it been? Her spies must have told her how, after Gavin’s\ndisappearance, Karris had wept when her moon blood came, how she’d\nobviously hoped that their single night together had impregnated her, like in\nthe stories.\nBut then, one night had been enough for Karris before, hadn’t it? Back\nwhen she’d been a girl, and hadn’t been ready for a child. The mere thought\nof it sent black clouds churning in her heart. No, don’t think of it. Of\ncourse, the White had thought that Karris wanted a child. Karris was facing\nthe end of her childbearing years, and the loss of her purpose as a\nBlackguard, and the loss of Gavin. Surely Karris would desire to have\nsomething of his, of theirs, something to show that all her sacrifices hadn’t\nbeen for naught.\nThe White was trying to make Kip a son for Karris simply because she\nthought Karris had never had her own. She didn’t know. Karris’s secret was\nsafe.\nAnd how could Karris fault the White for trying to manage Karris’s\nemotions? Karris was doing the same thing to Kip: lying so he wouldn’t do\nsomething disastrous, because if he knew too much, he would act, thinking\nhe knew more than he did.\nShe moistened her lips. Kip was already studying her as one might study\na large dog, wondering if it was going to lunge for your throat or if it\nwanted to cuddle.\nBut then that old fear poked its head out of the dark cellar where Karris\nkept it. Surely the White, so careful in all things, would have investigated\nKarris fully before handing over her spies. And how good had Karris been\nat covering her tracks? She’d only been sixteen and seventeen years old.\nThat cold place went hot. All the shame of that concealed failure ignited.\nWho abandons a child? Who leaves a helpless babe in a far country with\npeople she doesn’t even know?\nHad they been good to him? Was he well?\nShe’d lain there, holding Dazen after their marriage, and she’d\nchallenged him to be a good father. She’d been so cool, so correct. All while\nsitting on her own secret failure like it wasn’t a burning coal. Hypocrite.\nAnd the White knew her shame. Was holding on to it, maybe only to use\nit if she absolutely had to. Karris would never be free. She felt hot and cold,\nnauseated.\n“Sorry, ‘mother,’” Kip said. He was trying to make a joke of it, but the\nword was so sharp-edged that Karris couldn’t even hear the joke. None of\nKip’s tone could make it past the roaring of the blood in her ears. Just that"

Just that\none, lancet word piercing a boil.\n“You are not my son!” Karris spat. Her heart was bile and she was\nvomiting it out on him, foul and acid, and it tore her throat and ate\neverything it touched.\nKip had the same look on his face she’d seen on men mortally wounded,\nstaring at their own guts in ropes in their hands, shocked they weren’t\nalready dead, but dying nonetheless.\nHe turned unsteadily and walked out. He closed the door quietly.\nChapter 67\n“This is the last time you and I will meet,” Marissia said. They were seated\nside by side on one of the benches ringing the Great Fountain of Karris\nShadowblinder. Marissia dressed in humble slave’s grays, eating her lunch.\nTeia was in her nunk’s grays, taking a break from her calisthenics,\nostensibly nursing a spasming calf muscle. “I hear you gave your new\nhandler a hard time.”\nIt was hard to maintain the spy discipline of not looking over to see if\nshe was saying it wryly. Was there a bit of pleasure in Marissia’s tone?\n“Could say that,” Teia said, leaning forward to massage her leg so her\nmouth would be obscured. The point of meeting in public wasn’t to disguise\naltogether that you were speaking to your handler, it was to make sure you\nweren’t overheard and to give lip-readers an impossible task. Strangers\nmight exchange a few words, after all. “I want to tell Kip everything. I\ndon’t have anyone. It’s too hard.”\nA long pause as Marissia took a drink from her wineskin. “You want to\nreveal everything to Kip the Lip?” She paused, then delicately took a bite of\na small meat pastry.\nTeia scowled. That wasn’t fair. Kip might shoot from the hip when he\nwas angry, but he didn’t spill other people’s secrets. He was a good man.\nA good man? Kip? When had she started thinking of Kip as a man?\nSometimes she looked at him and images seemed to shear off from him like\nlight splitting: different facets, different Kips. Perhaps it was a side effect of\nthe light splitting or drafting so much paryl. If drafting red gradually made\nyou more passionate, and drafting green made you wilder, what did drafting\nparyl do to you? She saw Kips frozen, each in a line:\nFat Kip, as he had been when he first came to the Chromeria. He was\nsunk into himself, the blubber a defense against fear and isolation, chin\ntucked down, shy, self-consciousness and self-pity at war, but thinking.\nBroken Kip, mentally going back to Garriston and whatever had\nhappened to him there.

None of the inductees had been there, and the\nBlackguards said nothing to the inductees about such matters. “He’s a\nGuile,” was the most they’d say, as if that said everything. As if that said\nanything. Broken Kip would show up at practice after having thrashed a\nbully, and he looked defeated instead of victorious, as if he couldn’t believe\nwhat he was capable of.\nThe Weeping Warrior. Teia had only seen glimpses of this one, had\nheard more of it. Teia had heard Kip self-deprecatingly say something like,\n“I’m the turtle-bear.” Others said he was a berserker. Kip fighting Aram in\nhis last fight, about to lose his last chance to become a Blackguard. Kip had\ngone insane as Aram held him down, beating his face in but letting Kip slip\njust enough so that the judges didn’t call it.\nMost young men who went crazy in a fight went stupid, too. But Kip\nhad shot out the lights. It might have been enough for him to beat Aram, if\nsomeone hadn’t fixed the lights almost immediately—and was there a rule\nfor that? Aram had picked Kip fully off the ground and was throwing him\ndown in a neck-breaker—Aram himself getting terrified of what he felt\nburgeoning in his opponent.\nTeia had overheard two Blackguards nearby talking. “It’s a good thing\nthey stopped that,” Hezik said. “That Kip would have died.”\n“Or if he hadn’t,” Stump said, “a bunch of the rest of us might have.”\n“Huh?”\nStump looked at Hezik. “At Garriston, I saw that boy go green golem.\nYou remember the south flank at Sundered Rock, when we thought their\nline was going to snap, and we suddenly saw Dazen Guile himself? Out\nthere all alone. Captain thought we’d take us a prize?”\n“You know I don’t remember shit about that battle. I woke up afterward\nand couldn’t see or hear for a week.”\n“You can still fucking count. Number a men we had before, number a\nmen we had after. It ain’t accountancy. Why you gotta trip up my story?\nYou know what happened there even if you don’t remember it all for your\nown self. Anyway. Garriston was that. I tell you. It was that. Boy’s fucking\nfifteen.”\nThey’d noticed Teia then, and gave her a look that would wilt flowers.\nThen she saw the next Kip, right after the Weeping Warrior. She saw Kip\ntaking his place in line after Cruxer had come in like a righteous,\njudgmental god and crippled Aram. Kip, suddenly accepted, beaten,\nbruised, staggering, beaming, weeping, and whole. That was Kip Unalone:\nKip with the scrubs, Kip with his team. Laughing, for one frozen moment,\nbelonging. There was a tragic undercurrent in his face even as he laughed,\nthough, as if he knew this moment was fleeting.\nThen Kip Confident. She’d seen this for one second, and only one, but"

Kip, averring that while\nthis war wasn’t the best thing, it was the best thing possible. Kip, unself-\nconscious, who knew when he knew what he was talking about. Kip, who\ndidn’t sleep much. Kip, who knew some of the cost of what he was talking\nabout. Kip, in that moment, wasn’t trying to impress anyone—and that\nmade him more impressive. He was suddenly solid. Adult.\nAttractive.\nShe thought of how she’d not hugged Kip. Why hadn’t she hugged him?\nShe should have. Orholam, she should have.\n“I suppose if I tell you something that you already know, you won’t\nlisten to me?” Marissia said.\nTeia blinked.\n“Like if I pointed out the foolishness of getting your heart tangled with a\nGuile?”\n“No danger of that,” Teia said quickly. Marissia was a room slave. She\nhadn’t had any say over Gavin coming to her bed. That she had chosen to\nmake her service easier by pleasing him rather than harder by fighting him\nsimply meant she was smart. She was doing what she needed to do to\nsurvive.\nMarissia said, “Someone who says you shouldn’t do something while\ndoing it herself could be considered a hypocrite. Or an expert. Hypocrite or\nexpert, that of all people, I offer you advice is not a reason to dismiss it, but\nactually the opposite.”\n“I didn’t call you a—” Teia was baffled. What was Marissia saying?\n“You’re sixteen. You thought it. I judged my elders harshly when I was\nyoung, too.”\nSo Marissia loved Gavin. What kind of irony was it that Teia, who had\nbeen a slave, would have assumed that Marissia couldn’t love Gavin—\nbecause she was a slave?\nIt wasn’t… what? Normal love? Because Gavin was Prism and Marissia\nwas a slave? Could Teia tell Marissia that what she felt wasn’t love? That\nMarissia was fooling herself, that really she was only making a bad\nsituation tolerable? If a power difference made love impossible, who could\never love a Prism? Who could ever love a slave?\nMaybe it was love, then. But it wasn’t good. Or at least, it wasn’t fair. It\nwasn’t easy.\nWhich was Marissia’s point exactly. The chasm between freed slave and\na Prism’s son was narrower than the chasm between slave and Prism. But\nnot by much.\nMarissia ate more. Drank more. No hurry, no apparent interest in Teia.\nShe casually scanned the crowd, but the way a bored person eating lunch\nmight. Then she said, “Do you know, I was made a slave at your age.”\nTeia stood, turned, propped a foot up on the bench, and began working\non her calf in a way that would give her a glimpse of Marissia’s face.\n“Things were suddenly expected of me that I found very, very hard.

This is an order. In the\nsight of Orholam, let all the evil you do be on my head, and on the White’s.\nWe’re playing against the Old Man of the Desert himself, you understand?”\n“No,” Teia said quietly. “No.”\n“You will,” Marissia said. She gazed up at the statue of Karris\nShadowblinder, Karris’s namesake. “And stop giving her nonsense.” She\nwiped her mouth with a napkin, stood, and walked away.\nTeia remembered herself enough to continue pretending to massage her\nleg. It wasn’t like she’d had a long time to bond with Marissia, but the\nwoman had been the only person Teia could tell the whole truth. The\nsudden emptiness in her chest felt like a death.\nDeath. She’d killed a man in this war in shadow. Maybe Kip was right.\nMaybe it was justified. But she was going to have to kill again, for the other\nside. She had no doubt of it. How would the Order really trust her until\nshe’d killed for them?\nIt wasn’t a matter of if they ordered her to do so, it was a matter of when.\nAnd she was supposed to meet up with Murder Sharp right now.\nChapter 68\nAliviana Danavis followed Phyros into the slum bar. It was the kind of\nplace she would have feared a year ago, with good reason. She’d found new\nstrength in the last months, or at least new fearlessness. But even with that,\nshe never would have come here in her dresses and murex purple. Now she\nwore her hair in a simple braid, a tricorn hat, her fawnskin trousers still\nbearing the dark stains of what might have been blood. Before they’d died,\nshe’d had her blue and her green drafter work together to fashion clips onto\nher pistols like Gavin Guile had, so she could wear all four pistols on her\nbelt and not worry about losing them. She also wore a short saber that she\nstill didn’t know how to use well, despite Phyros’s efforts to train her. A\nfigure-hugging white tunic, but worn long over her trousers in the Tyrean\nstyle, and a green jacket waxed against the rain completed the ensemble.\nShe still stuck out, here in Wiwurgh. Just across the Coral Strait from\nIlyta, and positioned at the very mouth of the Everdark Gates, the city was\ninhabited mainly by Tyreans, Ilytians, and Parians. The crowds of darker\nfaces made something unknot in Liv’s soul. You could hardly get farther\nfrom the Jaspers if you tried. Here, she felt beautiful. Men whistled in\nappreciation, unlike the cool-blooded meat stares the men of the north and\nwest coasts gave. Here a man would let you know his interest, but take his\ncue and leave you alone if you ignored him or gave a glance and no more."

There were women here, too, but they\nwere even harder than the men. Every sailor and pirate had to walk with\nfriends in the seaside slums, of course. The danger of being knocked out in\nan alley and waking as the iron cut your ear was real for everyone. But a\nwoman’s lot was worse, as always. As the saying went, ‘A man ’slaved\nworks one oar, a woman ’slaved works every oar on deck.’\nAliviana stepped into the low-ceilinged tavern and glanced around with\na haughty, uninterested look on her face. But then she gasped aloud as she\nsaw the man sitting in a corner, staring at her. Her father.\nCorvan Danavis was slowly rising to his feet, as transfixed by the sight\nof her as she was of him. Her father? Here? Impossible.\nAnd he wasn’t alone. There were a good ten drafters in some sort of\nmilitary attire with him, light blue tunics emblazoned with a golden eye\nhigh on the chest. Her father wore one as well, though richer, with brocade\nand a sword at his hip. He was the leader of them.\nEmotions rolled over Liv like a swell rolling over a swimmer at sea.\nAfter the surprise, there was a little bit of that little-girl glee, but trailing\nthat like a secondary wave that engulfs you just when you think the worst is\npast was raw anger, unfaded despite the passage of months.\nHer father waved her over to join him at his table, and she went, but as\nshe walked, she felt the tableaux shift in her head. It took on sudden\nsymbolic connotations: her father beckoned her to walk to him; he didn’t\ncome to her. He stood there, asking her to leave her friends and join him at\nthe place he had prepared for her.\nWhat was he doing here? Had he been following her? Impossible! But\nhere? In one tavern of hundreds, on the other side of the world? It was too\nmuch coincidence to be coincidence.\nStop being a twit, Liv. It’s your father.\nHe crossed the last few steps between them quickly, as if he couldn’t\nhold back any more, real joy etched on his features. They embraced.\nFor a dozen heartbeats, all was well in the world.\nFinally, they released each other.\nHere it comes. She stood with her back straight. She suppressed an urge\nto tug the laces at her tunic’s open neckline tighter.\n“Aliviana,” her father said. “You look so strong.”\nIt was the last thing she’d have expected from the legendary General\nCorvan Danavis. It slipped right under her armor. “So do you, daddy.”\nHe laughed, and she couldn’t help but smile.\n“Will you join me?” Corvan said. “I saved us a table.”"

How could he know she’d be here?\n“Of course,” she said.\n“I’ll dismiss my people if you dismiss yours,” he said, eyes twinkling.\nLiv hadn’t even been aware of Phyros coming to stand behind her. But\nshe paused. She didn’t need to let her father dictate what she did or didn’t\ndo.\n“No disrespect,” Corvan said to Phyros. “I’ve heard you’ve done yet\nmore mighty deeds in keeping my daughter safe, Lord Phyros Seaborn. I\nowe you everything.”\nPhyros scowled, and Liv realized she’d never heard his surname, nor\nknown that he was of noble blood. The thought that he’d concealed that fact\nfrom her, and that her father had known it, nettled Liv. “He can sit with\nyour people.” In a place this crowded, being at the next table would be\nenough to be out of earshot.\nA one-eyed bar slave came over as Liv took her seat, and her father said,\n“Drinks for these three tables. On me. You have mead? Keep it flowing.”\nWhen the man left, Corvan said, “Have you had it before? There used to be\na large Angari community here in Wiwurgh, so you can find some of their\nfoods and drinks still. Little of their blood.”\n“There were Angari here?” Liv asked. She hadn’t seen a single blond\nhead here.\n“After the Everdark Gates were closed, the community was isolated. A\nplague came and killed the Angari in much lower numbers than the Parians\nhere. The Parians blamed them for the plague. They exterminated them all.\nAny half-bloods they could find, too. Even people who were a quarter\nAngari, or children generations later born with light skin, found life here\nunbearable. They moved elsewhere in the satrapies or simply found it\nimpossible to marry. Extinguished, completely.”\nIt was the kind of trivia her father knew that had always amazed\nAliviana. He knew something interesting about most everything.\n“It was the superviolet,” she said.\n“Huh?”\n“The Angari priests were superviolet drafters.”\n“Really? Oh, maybe I have heard that,” he said, his eyes flicking up as\nhe searched for the memory. “But…”\nShe felt a little stab of pleasure. “The priests of Ferrilux blessed their\nworshippers’ food and water. Living in poverty for generations, the Angari\nmust have noticed that it had an effect. So if that later plague was born of\nbad meat or bad water, the Angari wouldn’t have died as much.”\n“Religion saving lives?”\n“Clearly only in the short term,” Aliviana said. “Since it got all of them\nkilled.”\n“I still don’t understand,” Corvan said. “Are you saying their god\nintervened with their food?”\n“It’s the superviolet.

They don’t understand why it\nworks, but they’ve seen that it does.”\n“No, I didn’t mean the discovery—though it was.

Of\ncourse you’ve already put it to the best use. I’m sorry. I had no idea that my\nhistorical anecdote would intrude on our present… difficulties. How have\nyou been? Did you get my letter—no, never mind, that doesn’t matter.”\nThe bar slave finally brought their mead, having served Phyros and\nCorvan’s men first. Stupidity, or a deliberate slight? Liv wondered.\nDrinking the sweet sharp mead gave her an excuse to gather her wits. She\ncouldn’t see any harm in sharing, and if she shared, surely he would, too. So\nshe began.\nThe sea had fought them all the way. Liv and her crew had been through\nhorrible storms. They’d frequently needed to stop to make repairs. Then\nthey’d been marooned in a fishing village for a month, stuck in what they’d\ncome to call a crystal storm. Shards of blue luxin the size of a thumb and\nedged with sharp angles beat down day and night, for a count of twenty-\nseven, then stopped for some multiple of that long, and then began again.\nAnyone caught outside in the storm was shredded. The crystals themselves\nbroke apart almost instantly in the sun afterward, leaving gritty blue dust\neverywhere.\nIt had seemed like the end of the world must be upon them, but when\nthey finally escaped, they’d found the crystal storm was localized. People\ntwenty leagues away hadn’t even noticed clouds.\nThey all knew what it had to be, though Liv didn’t tell her father. The\nblue bane had regrown, somewhere, and no one was in control of it.

When Aliviana\nhad seen a small river running green and wanted to go investigate, the crew\nhad been so frightened, they’d nearly mutinied.\nThey’d later lost two drafters after the idiots had humiliated some pirates\nin a tavern fight. The pirates ambushed them in a dark alley, and mortally\nwounded them.\nThe lesson Aliviana’s men had taken from that was that when you fight\npirates, kill them and all their friends. Against her orders, they’d gone\nlooking for vengeance and sunk the pirates’ ship. With all the pirates\naboard.\nShe’d had to execute another drafter for instigating that and disobeying\nher. She had qualms about that. One of the men killed in the ambush had\nbeen the drafter’s lover. The men were greens. They had a hard time\nobeying rules.\nBut after that, her authority hadn’t been questioned again.\nIt also meant that as they finally made it to Wiwurgh, she had only two\ndrafters and Phyros. The captain and his men had disappeared, not even\ntaking their pay—though they had stolen the galley.\nThat brought her here, carrying a fortune, looking for a ship and crew\ncrazy enough to search the very mouth of the Everdark Gates for the\nsuperviolet seed crystal—or bane. Though of course Liv didn’t tell her\nfather that they were looking for anything. “And that’s it,” she said. She\nrealized as she’d been speaking that it was tremendously comforting to talk\nto someone who loved her. To connect.\nShe’d slowed down on drafting superviolet since she’d gotten away\nfrom Zymun, and she’d realized what a crutch it had been. Not that she\njudged those who burned through their halos joyfully—many of the Blood\nRobes celebrated such, though the Color Prince himself took a more\nnuanced approach. But for her, it was too much, too fast. She didn’t feel\nlike herself when she was drafting all the time. Maybe she’d gone a little\noverboard for a while.\nTalking to her father again, she saw a new respect in his eyes. He was\nworried for her. Of course he was. These were dangerous times. But she\ncould tell he was trying hard not to interject advice. It was nice to be\nreminded of relationships that weren’t all about power. And yet, power\ninterfered even here.\n“Now…” she said. “What about you?” As if they were just old friends\ncatching up, not father and daughter. She was an adult now, not his\nsubordinate. She’d done amazing things in her own right, and even if he\nwasn’t pushing her down, she could feel herself wanting to slip back into\nthat old role. She’d worshipped her father, and he was a great man. That\ndidn’t mean he was infallible. It didn’t mean he was right about the\nChromeria, about Gavin Guile, about any of it.\n“I’ve… well, you’re going to hear it sooner or later.

They’re calling it the City of Gold. Gavin Guile helped us. He\ndrafted tens of thousands of solid yellow luxin bricks that we’ve used to\nbuild most everything. He even managed to win us back Tyrea’s old lost\nseat on the Spectrum.”\n“That’s, that’s great news. Who would have known? They’re going to\nhave to start calling him Gavin the Builder, what with Brightwater Wall\naround Garriston, and now that.”\n“He’s gone now. A slave on an oar currently. With worse ahead.”\n“What?”\n“A bit of intelligence, as a sign of good faith.”\nKind of you, but… “Father, how did you find me?”\n“You like your truth unvarnished, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“I’ve fallen in love. I married a woman on Seers Island.”\n“Oh. Uh… congratulations. I’m so happy for you.” Married? Liv felt the\ntwist in her guts. So fast? The detachment that superviolet had taught her\nhelped her speak levelly, as if it were merely interesting.\n“She told me I could find you here. Did you know this place doesn’t\neven have a name? Hard to find by description alone, I assure you.”\n“You what? Married?” Easy, Liv. Not like your own love life has been\nparticularly laudable. You have no right to feel betrayed.\n“Also, I’m a satrap now.”\n“What?!”\n“You like it straight. That’s straight.”\n“So that was your payoff for turning your cloak?” she asked.\n“Was your payoff for turning yours that you be made a goddess?” He\ntapped a finger firmly on the tabletop.\nShe wanted to spit at him. “I changed sides because I saw what I’d\nbelieved before was wrong.”\n“So did I.” He was calm, cool, and hard. So very rational that the\nsuperviolet part of her couldn’t help but be impressed.\n“Gavin Guile is a monster. You told me so yourself.”\n“Gavin Guile was a monster. People change,” Corvan said.\n“People don’t change that much!”\n“You did. I did.”\n“He killed people. Thousands upon thousands,” she said. “Innocents. He\nwiped out Garriston.”\n“You mean in the Prisms’ War? He wasn’t even at Garriston. But yes, he\ntold his generals to take the city. But you’ve seen battle now. War is a flame.\nIt escapes even the best-laid plans. Your actions were vital in laying Ru\nprostrate. And now you know all the vileness that can happen to a city laid\nprostrate.”\nIt took her breath away. She had been the decisive factor in the Battle of\nRu. She had birthed a god. All those sailors dead, all those men enslaved,\nand all the massacres and rapes and horror within the walls, too. They\nweren’t her fault, not exactly, but they wouldn’t have happened without her,\neither.\nDid she have an entire city on her conscience? Was that why she had\nwanted so badly to escape?\nIn the end, was she different from Gavin Guile only in degree, and not in\nkind?"

It was only logical.\n“So the weak will surrender more quickly than they would have\notherwise, while the strongest will fight to the last man and woman,\nknowing what will happen if they lose,” Corvan said. “He’s taken Raven\nRock, since you left. It’s a small city, perhaps twenty thousand souls,\nperched on the side of a cliff. They refused to surrender and he put them\nunder siege, though they didn’t hold out long against his wights. When he\nbroke down the gates, two hundred young women who heard what he had\ndone in Ru leapt off the cliffs. Some young mothers jumped with their\nchildren.”\nLiv felt sick. “It can’t be true.”\n“I don’t lie to you. Indeed, perhaps we wouldn’t be here if I did.” He\ntapped his fingers.\n“He wouldn’t have hurt them. Ru was a one-time thing. He’s not\nbloodthirsty.”\nHer father said nothing to that, and she heard how it sounded.\n“Two hundred? Surely an exaggeration. One or two, perhaps. I know\nhow these stories are.”\n“They’re saying a thousand. They’re saying every woman in the city. It\nwas two hundred. The Third Eye saw it herself. She counted them. It was a\nquick vision, though, she might have been off by ten or fifteen.”\n“And you’re certain she’s telling you the truth?” Liv said.\n“She has told me hard truths. I trust her entirely.”\n“Fealty to One, huh?” Liv said bitterly.\n“Indeed. But my ultimate fealty is not to her.”\n“Nor is it to me!” Liv had to work hard to keep her voice down. As it\nwas, people were already staring.\n“No, it’s not. Fealty to your own family is the smallest possible circle\nbeyond the self. To hold fealty to your own and to call it a high virtue is\nludicrous. Even animals protect their own. It is a good, but it is a common\ngood, an easy one. It’s a miser who says he grows rich not for himself, but\nfor his children. His vice is not thus magically made virtue. Fealty to One is\nthe expression of a high virtue. It is what sets Danavises apart from those\nwho take easier roads.”\n“It doesn’t set you apart if you take your fealty from one man and give it\nto his mortal enemy.” It wasn’t fair, but Liv didn’t care about fair. Her\nfather was saying she was supporting a monster. That all she had done, all\nshe had worked for, was worse than nothing.\nHis fingers flexed hard around his mead.

It’s\nyour own.” He drummed his fingers on the tabletop and then stood. “I have\nto go. My wife said I may still save her life if I don’t tarry.”\n“Wait. What?”\n“She’s a Seer. She can tell all sorts of things. But there’s an order of\nassassins that wears these special cloaks. It makes them invisible to her gift.\nShe’s seen that in many futures she dies, but she can’t see how, which has\nnever happened to her before. So we believe one of these assassins must be\nafter her. Me coming here likely means that the woman I love will die.\nThat’s how much I care for you. I came for you, knowing it might cost me\nher. Fare well, daughter. Orholam’s light shine upon you.”\n“I’m sorry, father, I—I didn’t even congratulate you. A satrap, that’s—”\n“No time,” he said, glancing down.\nAnd he left. His people swarmed around him, and they were gone.\nWithout so much as a parting embrace. Liv was stunned. She felt hollowed\nout, and suddenly more alone than she had ever been. What if she’d done\nthe wrong thing? She’d been hasty. She’d been young. She hadn’t known—\nshe hadn’t known much of anything.\nShe’d done the best she could. Better than anyone could have expected\nof her. Isolated and afraid, she’d chosen the best of bad options.\nHadn’t she?\nAnd what the hell was it with her father tonight, fidgeting, acting—\nShe looked at the tabletop as Phyros came over to sit with her again. She\ntightened her eyes for an instant. On the tabletop, written in spindly\nsuperviolet luxin invisible to any eyes but hers, was a message: “Under the\ntable. Hide it in your left boot. Tell no one.”\nPhyros sat and rested his arms on the table, setting down his drink. The\nmotion broke the fragile superviolet luxin and it disappeared. “You good?”\n“It was upsetting. But I’m fine.”\n“I found us a crew,” he said. “You ready?”\n“More than ready.”\nPhyros stood, and as his back turned, she slid her hand under the edge of\nthe table and found it. A knife. A knife? When she had four pistols, a sword,\nand another knife on her belt? This was what her father gave her?\nNonetheless, she swept it into her hand, palming it, and followed.\nChapter 69\n“They tell me you’re good,” Murder Sharp said. He’d taken residence\nupstairs in a midtown porcelain shop. The large, round room had lots of\nwindows, and Master Sharp had lots of roses. Blooming roses, at this time\nof year? That meant he either could draft green, or had access to the\nservices of someone who did. He was watering the roses as Teia came in.\nTeia mumbled something under her breath."

He was watering the roses as Teia came in.\nTeia mumbled something under her breath.\n“I lied,” Sharp said. “They don’t tell me you’re good.”\nShe looked at him, a quick flick to his disconcertingly intense gaze, then\naway. What was his problem? He turned back to his watering. He wasn’t, as\nit turned out, bald. He’d merely kept his carrot-red hair shaved in a pattern\nto make it appear he was. Then he’d cut it all off so it could grow in\ntogether, without drawing attention to his old disguise. So now it was\nboyishly short. It made him look young.\n“Truth is,” he said, putting down the watering can and turning to study\nher, “they tell me that you’re better than I am.”\nThis time when her eyes flicked up, his amber eyes were waiting, and\nthey held her like a fish on a line.\n“Do you know why they’d tell me such a thing?” he asked.\nShe shook her head. Was he even telling the truth?\n“They hope I’ll kill you. They hope I’m that vain.” He slid knives home\nin his belt. “And you know what? I am.”\nHer breath was suddenly short. She glanced toward the door. No. If he\nwas going to kill her, it was too far away. And who was to say he’d use a\nknife? He was watching her eyes, waiting for her to widen her pupils to\nlook into paryl.\nThe whole room was probably full of paryl. Her heart sank. But she tried\nto keep her voice light. “Why not just do it themselves?” she asked.\n“You don’t know the Old Man. If they kill you out of hand, they’ll have\nto answer to him. Killing a paryl lightsplitter? He’d be furious. And when\nhe’s furious, people die. On the other hand, if they take in a spy, he’ll be\neven more furious. He’ll wipe out the whole mission here as traitors or\nincompetents. But… if they get me to kill you, it becomes my problem. And\nthe Old Man isn’t likely to kill me. I’m too valuable.”\nI didn’t even think of fighting him.\nThe thought pissed Teia off. She was a Blackguard. Near it, anyway.\nPeople feared her. Should, anyway. And she was thinking of running, of\nletting herself be pulled down from behind? Like what? Like prey. She\nwasn’t prey. She wasn’t a slave who had to curl into a ball while her\nmistress beat her, only defending, forbidden to answer rage with rage.\nI am not a slave, not even to fear.\n“So what’s it going to be?” she asked. “You wouldn’t be telling me if\nyou were really going to kill me out of hand. You’re too careful for that.\nAnd I’m too dangerous.”\n“Are you?” he asked, bemused.\n“I am.” She smiled, and her rage smiled with her. Test me? Please do.\n“I’ve half a mind to take your dogteeth for that impudence,” Murder\nSharp said. He fingered his necklace, showing her the glittering pearls-that-\nweren’t-pearls."

By putting on a\nmask of rebellion, she’d be above suspicion.\nBut that wasn’t really true, because fuck him.\n“You’re not afraid of me?” he asked, smirking.\n“I’m afraid all the time.

But she was ready. A small\ndeflection, and his open hand went over her shoulder rather than striking her\ncheek. She moved in, instantly. As she was small and not strong, everything\nabout Teia’s fighting had to be technically sound. She went for the elbow\nlock, saw she wasn’t going to get it, stepped on his foot as he spun out of\nthe elbow lock, and pushed hard.\nAnd like a professional, he went with it instead of fighting it. He flipped,\nand she had no warning before his other leg clipped her in the back of the\nneck. It launched her into a wall, and she was so stunned, she couldn’t get\nher hands up in time. She smashed into the wall face first, staggered like a\ndrunk, unable to control her limbs suddenly, and went down. Black rushed,\nstars winked. She felt her limbs being manipulated, bound, but it was too\nfast, they didn’t move right. She spasmed.\nTwo cupped hands slapped down on her ears, and trapped air went\nrushing into her head. The pain blotted out all. She gasped, breathless with\npain.\nBy the time it faded enough for Teia to be aware of anything else, she\nrealized she was trussed like a lamb, except her limbs were all pulled\nbackward, her stomach on the ground, her feet and hands bound back in the\nair behind her. She had no leverage to fight the bonds. She heard a suck-\nclick as Murder Sharp cinched the last rope, one hand knotted through her\nhair, pressing her face into the rough wood floor. Something wet dribbled\non her cheek.\nDrool.\nShe spasmed again. Some part of her retreated deep into the recesses and\nshe bucked and thrashed like an animal. No use. No matter. She rolled over\nas he stepped clear. She tried to bite his feet. It felt like her arm was going\nto be pulled out of the socket. She gasped.\nMurder Sharp stood. “Glad we got—ssscchhhht—that out early.”\nShe couldn’t do this. She couldn’t.\n“Are you afraid of me now?” he asked.

Then he grabbed\nthe back of her trousers and yanked up on them and her underclothes,\ncleaving the moon painfully. He chuckled like a mean adolescent.\n“Just so you know,” he said. Ssschhtt. Again, that slobbery slurp-click.\nWhat the hell was that? The fear jumped from her stomach all through her\nwhole body like lightning. She almost screamed. No no no. She had to wall\nthat off. It held her vocal cords.\n“Just so you know, you’re mine. To do with as I please.”\n“I understand,” she said. It was supposed to be defiant. It wasn’t even\nclose. Orholam save her! What was he going to do? “Please. Please…”\nDon’t weep, Teia. I forbid. I forbid. She’d been a young girl enslaved,\nbut she’d never been raped. Too boyish, too young, too lucky, maybe even\nprotected by some small scrap of decency of her mistress or by her hope to\nsell Teia’s virginity. Whatever the reason—or for no reason at all—in that\none thing, she’d been spared.

There was a first, intense spike of self-\nhatred for her fear like a snakebite, and then there was nothing but the fear\nitself coiling, curled around her, squeezing out her breath. But it wasn’t\ncrushing her from outside, it was like the serpent was growing from within\nspiraling outward as if it wanted to escape. There was no room for Teia in\nher own skin.\n“Shh, shh,” he said. “I want to tell you a story, Teia, a true story though\nfive thousand or a thousand thousand years old. Or so widely regarded as\ntrue, it doesn’t matter.” He paused. Ssschht. Ssschht. What the hell was that\nsound? “Wait here,” he said. He stood.\nHe lit a lantern, then shuttered the windows, one after another. He kissed\nhis roses, told them he wouldn’t be but a minute. He took his time, and\nslowly, the room filled with shadows.\nMurder Sharp came back with the lantern, his handsome features\nghoulish in the bobbing, harsh light. He put it down and sat again, cross-\nlegged.\n“Pretend this is a campfire. It works better that way. It’s a campfire\nstory.”\nOrholam, save me, save me.

She couldn’t remember what he’d been talking\nabout—she arched her back, twisted her shoulder to see his face. He was\nlosing his good mood rapidly.\n“The Lord of Light,” some part of her answered for her. Perhaps\nOrholam himself had reached down and given her those words.

Like this was\nsomething people did for each other. “I don’t mean you to misunderstand. I\nwon’t violate you. Rape is disgusting. Beneath my dignity. There, does that\nset you at ease? My fault. Now, the story…”\nShe turned and rested her face on the rough floor, slave again, survivor,\nsilent, and so very, very thankful.\n“There was no light yet, yes? So It—‘He,’ if we must, since we are\nsaying ‘Lord’ and one must admit the limitations of language in such cases\n—He couldn’t be a lord of light, then, right? There was no light. Ssschhtt!\nRight? Got it? Language can mislead us on all these things. We say there\nwas him or it and nothing. But we don’t mean that he sat there with\nnothingness. He wasn’t on a porch swing with nothingness in a box on his\nlap, wondering what he’d do with it. We say Orholam and nothingness, but\nreally it was Orholam and Orholam-not-ness. There was only him, but\nsomehow he was lonely—though how could you be lonely, having never\nknown company? Creation stories are impossibilities packaged in lies. He\nwas, and it wasn’t good, though he is all good and he was all that was? How\ncan such be? He was, and it was good, but it wasn’t good enough? Perhaps\nthat. I’ve felt that way, when alone.

You’ll be glad to know you just broke the adhesive. Else I\nwould have been angry,” he said. “Do you know, with paryl, I don’t ever\nhave to kill someone with my bare hands? It’s almost disappointing. There\nare other Shadows out there who let that make them lazy. And then they get\ncaptured by some oaf house guards because they can’t break a grip, and\nthere are times when someone having a seizure is a bit too coincidental.\nThis is why I am still a fighter, though I am so much more. Sometimes the\nmeat must sing, and spirit merely nod and clap to the beat. Now where was\nI?”\n“Light,” she said quietly.\n“Ah yes.” He sat again. Folded his hands in his lap. “Calf muscle is\ncramping?”\n“I hope n-n-not.” And then it went, cramping hard.\nHe grabbed her leg and she was spun around on her stomach.

He worked\nher calf like an athlete or chirurgeon, skillfully working out the cramp in\nshort order, and without causing unnecessary pain. Then he spun her back\nas if nothing had happened. He lowered the lantern light so that the barest\nridges of his facial bones could be seen.\n“In the beginning, God made light. And he saw that it was good. So he\nmade the First Ones, that they might enjoy the light with him, and each\nother’s company. But the greatest of the First Ones rose up, and spoke for\nthe Light. He said Light cannot be chained, that to sit in stasis and worship\nwas no fit end for creators so glorious as they. And so he stole a light from\nthe Lord of Light himself, and brought it to earth, and they called him\nLightbearer. And he broke this light into colors so that all might enjoy it, so\nthat even if some part were lost or chained again, yet light itself would be\nfree. And he kindled many flames from that one solitary light he stole. And\nOrholam, in fury at this rebellion, barred the Lightbearer and those who\nfollowed him from the kingdom he now called the Heavens. And the\nLightbearer and his Two Hundred set up their reign on earth, becoming\ngods in miniature, and over the course of eons, they bickered and fought,\nand when Orholam made men, they bickered and fought and used men to\ndestroy men in their games. For God loved men, but men loved destroying\nwhat he loved.”\nHe turned the lantern up. “Tell me, child, is that close to the story you\nheard?”\n“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes.” Her heart was a hummingbird in a cage.\n“Then let me tell you: half of that version is lies. A cunning lie, close to\nthe truth, as the best lies are, yes? The Lightbearer did not steal a lesser\nlight. He stole the Light itself. And with it, he fashioned Man. Yes. And he\nfashioned us not in the image of himself, but instead, in the image of the\nLightmaker and the Light, and this is why Man has two natures. This is why\nwe are a mirror of God himself, sides reversed, smudges showing the flaws\nof the model, not the copies. The Lightbearer and his host are the gods of\nold. And when we ascend to the bane, it is an ascent to a fraction of the\nformer glory. It is not a usurpation, for we are created in the image of the\nlight itself and are no lesser sons for this. Indeed, in some ways, we are the\ngreatest of all. Though, one must admit, the most fragile. Orholam and the\nLightbearer have been at war since, with Orholam using the Prisms to try to\nchain all light and bring it into obedience to him again. With Orholam\nstomping out those colors he finds his people cannot control. Like paryl.”\nHe pulled out a knife. “All of this, Teia, is prelude.” His face twisted\nthrough a dozen expressions in two seconds. “What I do, what you seek to\ndo, this has weight. Not the, not the killing. We might as well be harvesting\nfish from the salmon runs. Necessary, but not worthy of deep"

Turn over. Look.”\nHe kicked her, hard, right in the kidney. It took her breath and made her\nroll over. The sudden savagery—for no reason!—after he had been so calm\nand steady, pushed her right to the brink of tears again. She had no idea\nwhat he wanted her to see. “What?” she said. “What?”\n“This, stupid.” He was holding the hem of his cloak?\n“The cloak?” she asked. A little muscle in her back started cramping,\nand she gasped involuntarily.\n“Yes, the cloaks. The shimmercloaks, Teia. What are the\nshimmercloaks? What do they do?”\nShe wasn’t getting it. Did he want more than the obvious? Was he going\nto hurt her if she answered wrong? “Make you invisible?” she ventured. She\nbraced herself for a kick.\n“That’s right,” he said, amused once more. “And what does it mean to\nbe invisible?”\nMean? What kind of question was that? It just was. “I don’t know. I\ndon’t know. Dear Orholam, don’t hurt me again.”\n“‘Dear Orholam,’” he echoed quizzically. But he let it go. “When the\nFirst Man and the First Woman first sinned, what did they do?”\n“I don’t know. They were ashamed. They were naked. They hid. They,\nthey clothed themselves.”\n“They clothed themselves so the light wouldn’t touch their skin. They\nhid from Orholam. But of course, they couldn’t hide, could they?”\n“Of course not, for Orholam sees all.” She stopped as soon as the old\nmaxim crossed her lips.\nMurder Sharp squatted on his heels, right next to her head. “To be\ninvisible is the sinner’s first desire. To be invisible is to hide from man and\nangels and light and the Lord of Light himself. It is to be oralam Orh’ olam,\nhidden from Orholam. The pagan ancient Tyreans had a myth of a ring that\nwhen its bearer twisted it, it rendered him invisible. They didn’t believe in it\nliterally, of course, how would a ring do such a thing? It was a parable for\nwhat a man might would do with all temptations laid before him. For,\ninvisible, hidden from the eye of gods and men, what could a man not do?\nAllowed to do whatever he wished, what would a man do? To be invisible\nwas to show the true condition of one’s heart. To the Tyreans, it was a story\nto muse upon. To the luxiats, it is more. Wanting to hide, to them, is itself\nevidence already that one is ashamed, that one’s heart is black. Who else\nwould hide from the light, from truth?”\nHe cut her bonds. She didn’t stand, just lay there, rubbing life back into\nher limbs, the wood grain beneath her face somehow reassuring.\n“So think of that, if you ever are struck by a desire to confess to them.\nThey cannot help but suspect you.

They will never trust you.\nThink of what they have done before to drafters of paryl, a mere color\ninvisible to them.”\nThey hunted them down. More than once. Because they feared them.\nBecause seven colors sounded right to them.\nHe reached over and turned the knob of the lantern down, extinguishing\nit. The room was plunged into darkness, but even that wasn’t total. Bits of\nlight leaked in around the shutters.\n“Tell me, Adrasteia,” he said quietly. “It’s dark here. Have you\ndisappeared because it’s dark?”\n“No,” she said.\n“Are you different because it’s dark? Taller? Thinner? Smarter?”\n“No,” she answered, uncertain.\n“Tell me, have you ever been, say, trapped in a bathtub and a visitor\ncomes, and your clothes are on the opposite side of the room?”\nShe still didn’t know what he wanted to hear, and she only wanted to\ngive him what he wanted. She sat up. “Uh, I was trapped changing after\nBlackguard training last year. Someone took my clothes as a prank. Is that\nwhat you mean?”\nHe didn’t answer. “Tell me, were you doing anything wrong?”\n“No,” she ventured. Unless you counted letting yourself be vulnerable to\nhaving a prank played on you in the first place as wrong.\n“No. And yet you would have been ashamed to walk out into the eyes of\npassersby, wouldn’t you?”\n“Of course.”\n“But if it had been dark, you wouldn’t have been embarrassed, would\nyou?”\n“No.” She was starting to see it now.\n“You probably hid, didn’t you? But it wasn’t because you were bad, on\nthe contrary, it was because you were modest. Because you were good, as\nthey would call good. Yes?”\n“Yes.”\n“So not all shame comes from wrongdoing, and not all hiding is\nevidence of moral failure, is it?”\n“No,” she said.\n“And so we stumble together onto the truth: Darkness is freedom. And\nthat is why they hate it. That is why they fear it. Because some abuse\nfreedom, they want none to have freedom. Because light is power, they\nwish to control light itself. But freedom need not be feared, and light cannot\nbe chained. It is ever more than we see and more than we know, and when\nwe hold it too tightly, it dazzles us and makes us blind. You and I,\nAdrasteia, we are called to serve in the dark. And look. You’re not blind\nnow, are you?”\nIndeed, her eyes had adjusted, even without her using her tricks. It was\nnatural. Her eyes knew what to do in darkness.\n“We are the friends of light, but not its chattel. We do not fear its lash.\nWe are equanimous; we know we are both meat and breath, flesh and spirit,\nanimal and angel, and neither more truly one than the other. We are the\npriests of light and darkness, the arbiters of dusk. Neither day nor night is\nour master. And do you know what happens when a woman walks without\nfear?”"

And do you know what happens when a woman walks without\nfear?”\nTeia shook her head, but there was a sudden longing deep in her that\nswelled so strong it paralyzed her tongue. Tell me. Tell me.\n“She becomes.”\nBecomes what? Teia didn’t say the words aloud, but he knew what she\nwas thinking, for he answered:\n“She becomes whatever she wills. Minus only one thing.” In the dark, he\nheld up a finger, almost like he was scolding her.\nTeia was silent now. The question was obvious, and now she didn’t want\nto ask it.\nSharp said, “She has one thing she can never be, never again. You know\nwhat it is, don’t you?”\nThe words came unbidden to her lips, from a place so dark no light had\never touched it: “A slave.”\nChapter 70\nAfter Karris made him look like a complete asshole, Kip went to the\nPrism’s exercise chamber. He hoped Teia would be there. He didn’t want to\ntalk about it, but training with her was better than training alone. She made\nhim feel better, just by being there.\nShe wasn’t there.\nHe tried this week’s layout of the obstacle course, sinking into the\nblessed distraction of taking apart problems—how could you transition\nfrom swinging across the ropes to leaping that pit to climbing that wall\nwithout stopping? It was a warrior’s meditation. Of course, the calm of it\nwas punctuated when he figured out a perfect combination. He’d need to\nswing one-handed, left, then right, to build up momentum, and then swing\nhis whole body up parallel: he’d clear pit and wall all in one move. He tried\nit twice, and had to accept that he wasn’t strong enough to lift his bulk the\nway he would need to.\nBrain better than body. Again.\nHe ended on the heavy sawdust bag, as usual, trying to break it open.\nHis fists were getting tougher all the time, and he’d been building up scar\ntissue and calluses on his knuckles slowly, but he still wrapped his hands in\nluxin in order to protect his wrists. As usual, after doing his drills, he\nfinished up by working on that one loose stitch. It didn’t seem to have\nbudged in six months.\nKip was just finishing pounding on that one side with all his fury when\nsomeone cleared his throat. Kip almost wet himself.\nCommander Ironfist was setting down a stack of books on a side table.\nBooks? Down here? But Kip was more worried about the dubious look on\nthe commander’s face. Ironfist strode over and wordlessly examined the\nloose stitch.\n“Won’t take but a few minutes to sew that up,” Ironfist said.\nKip moved to speak, then stopped, embarrassed.\n“Oh, that’s how it is,” Ironfist said. “You want to destroy someone else’s\nproperty.”\n“No sir!” Kip said. “I mean… I suppose so, sir.” He scowled. “I hadn’t\nthought of it that way.”\n“Can you think of any good reason why I should let you do that?”\nReasons, yes. Good reasons? No. “Have you ever done it, sir?”"

Better to stitch it or patch it.”\n“So you have!”\nCommander Ironfist grunted.\n“How’d it feel?”\nA twitch of a smile, quickly smothered. “I’m going to repair that bag,\nGuile.”\nKip’s face fell. “Yes, sir.”\n“In six months.”\nWhy wait six—oh! “Thank you, sir!”\nA grunt. The commander walked over to his side table.\n“Sir? Should we talk about…?” He couldn’t quite say Lytos and\nBuskin’s names.\n“Oathbreakers and traitors are worth only whatever it takes to kill them,\nand nothing more.”\nHe was taking it personally, Kip could tell. The betrayal stung Ironfist as\na leader and as a friend. “Karris told you what Lytos said?” How he\nchanged his mind?\n“It changes nothing.” The commander picked up a book, signaling that\nthere would be no more about this.\nFor some reason, though, Kip had found Lytos’s last words, incomplete\nas they were, to be comforting. He’d said ‘luxiat,’ of that at least Kip was\nsure. That suggested the attempt really hadn’t been at Andross’s direction.\nThat some luxiat wanted to kill him was bad, but if Andross had wanted\nhim dead at this point… Honestly, Kip would probably be dead.\nThe commander was reading. Again. With how busy Kip knew he was.\nIt was strange.\nKip sidled over to see if he could see the book better.\nA flat stare met him. Commander Ironfist raised a hand and extended\nthree long fingers.\n“I’ll, uh, be going,” Kip said.\nHe got to the door and turned. “Good day, sir.”\nThe flat stare didn’t alter a whit. The commander lowered one finger.\nTwo.\nKip fumbled with the door, the luxin gloves making him clumsy. He\nchuckled awkwardly. “Gloves,” he said, dissolving them.\nThe flat stare of Your Colossal Pettiness bored through him. One.\n“Right. Sir.” Kip grinned weakly and got out.\nHe made his way to the public baths. Before he’d got into the\nBlackguard, he’d never wanted to come down here. He’d thought that\njoining the Blackguard would be the end of that problem. The Blackguards\nhad their own private baths.\nAs if bathing with the perfect-bodied athletes would be better than\nbathing with average strangers. One or two good-natured jibes about being\nchubby, and Kip was gone. He knew in his head that the nunks and\nBlackguards didn’t mean harm, that a rough sense of humor was necessary\nfor survival in what they did. But like Andross said, even an obvious, well-\ndefended target might still be vulnerable.

Even the robes were\ntoo much sharing for Kip. Once they were wet, they barely covered\nanything; they clung to every inglorious curve, and were thin enough that\nyou could soap your limbs through them. Kip had opted instead for sponge\nbaths and washing his head in his basin.\nThere were, however, extensive private baths. Some were reserved for\nnobility, but others were open to anyone who paid the small fee. Lords got\nin free, got free soap, got free towels, got access to any temperature bath\nthey wanted, and were given a share of the services of a bath slave, who\nwould bring refreshments or towels. Kip had heard that at other baths in the\ncity and through the satrapies, the bath slave was often a prostitute, but that\nwasn’t tolerated at the Chromeria. The bath slaves here were the same\ngenders as the bathers and definitely not picked for their looks.\n“Any of the hot baths unattended today?” Kip asked the head slave of\nthe men’s side, signing in as a noble. It was one privilege he was not shy\nabout claiming.\nAn older slave took him to a bath down a long hallway so humid that\nwater beaded on the walls and steam obscured vision. Privacy wasn’t\nguaranteed: even the small baths could hold half a dozen people at busy\ntimes before religious festivals or the Luxlords’ Ball. But most days, Kip\nwould either be alone or have to share with only one other person.\nThe man left Kip after making sure he had all he needed, putting Kip’s\nclothing and effects in a basket and leaving him alone with a robe and soap\nand a summons bell. It was an odd time of day to bathe—late morning—so\nKip hung the robe on one of the pegs provided so it would be dry when he\ngot out. Most of the students would be in classes now.\nClasses, there was a thought. How long had it been since Kip had gone\nto every one of his classes?\nHe got into the water quickly, despite its heat and the solitude. He\nreclined against the side.\nThe heat slowly worked its magic on the stiffness in his muscles, and\nwas beginning to unknot his mind, too. What was his problem? Clinging to\nKarris like that? He needed to grow up. He was basically an orphan, and it\nwas time to deal with that. Someone offers you friendship, and you ask\nthem to be family. For Orholam’s sake, Kip, you smother people. You’re so\nneedy. It’s disgusting.\nAnd this self-pity is sooo helpful. Maybe it’s time to break that habit, eh,\nBreaker?\nKip scrubbed his hands over his face. He sighed, eyes closed against all\nthe world, letting the steam melt him. When he opened his eyes, there was\nsomeone in the bath with him.\n“Aren’t you the bold one?” Tisis Malargos said. “What are you doing in\nthe ladies’ baths?”\nA bolt went through Kip.

He was stark naked. He was chubby and stark naked and\nutterly trapped. He swallowed. He looked around for identifying marks to\nshow that he was in the men’s baths, but the private baths didn’t have any.\nHad the old slave been senile and brought him here by accident? “I’m not—\nI’m not—I’m not in the ladies’ baths… am I?”\n“I’m afraid so.” She was definitely amused. Just letting him wallow in\nmisery.\nHe looked toward the door, and thought about making a break for it.\n“Don’t forget,” she said, “the baths are at the mesh point.”\n“The what what?”\n“The hallways and changing rooms are part of the island, while the baths\nare part of the interior of the Chromeria and rotate with all the structures\nabove. This time of day, if you’re not careful, you could end up heading\nright out in the main ladies’ bath.”\nKip blinked. No wonder he’d gotten lost down here before! With the\nrotation of all of the Chromeria as it followed the sun, depending what time\nof day you came down here, a hallway might line up with a different room\nthan it had last time you’d been here. He looked back down at the water. It\nwas pretty soapy, right? Pretty much opaque, right? He sat down. “I\nsuppose this is revenge?” he asked.\nA quick, puzzled scowl, then a grin. “Actually, no. I had no idea you’d\nbe modest. Especially not painfully so. Orholam knows the rest of the men\nin your family aren’t. I confess I meant to put you off balance. I thought\nyou’d be amused. You said you were always seeing me naked.”\nKip cleared his throat, realized he had nothing to say. It was true. If\nshe’d simply been trying to shame him, she wouldn’t have gotten into the\nbath herself. She simply would have stood or sat outside it, fully clothed.\nHis mind went back to his grandfather’s words about how if he played\nhis cards right, Tisis would make love with him. And now she was naked,\nnot two paces away. He licked lips that were miraculously dry, despite\nwater and steam and humidity and sweat.\nOh. Oh my.\n“You, uh, you paid the slave to divert me here?” he asked. She was in\nthe water up to her collarbones, and the water was mostly opaque, but it\nwas still inexplicably hard to look at her. And just as hard not to.\n“I wanted to speak with you privately,” she said.\nSpeak. He could speak. Right?\nTisis scooted closer until she was seated right next to him. He\nswallowed. She was sitting so close that it was too intense to look straight\ninto her hazel eyes, the color perfectly complemented by a thin halo-ring of\ngreen with tiny tips like wave caps into the hazel. He looked down—and\nrealized that it probably looked like he was trying to stare through the water\nat her full breasts—and then he realized that it would look like that because\nit was true.\nHe snapped his head forward."

It was a strange impulse of her, not\nto laugh at him outright when she could. Did she think he’d bolt if she\npushed him just that extra little bit, or was it actual kindness? He looked at\nher quickly.\n“I’m sorry, Kip,” she said. “I’ve been preparing myself to talk with you\nfor weeks now, trying to work myself up to it, and all the time I was\nreadying myself, I was readying myself to speak to a Guile, and I forgot that\nyou’re a sixteen-year-old, too.”\nThat’s me: underwhelming.\nHe had a sudden memory of telling his grandfather he liked to be\nunderestimated. And here was the opposite. “What do you want, Tisis?”\nShe raised her hands in mock surrender. The movement coincided with\nher sitting up straighter and rising perilously high in the water, her bare\nshoulders and chest confirming that she was not wearing a bathing robe.\n“Kip, we have good reason to hate each other,” she said. “Though I like to\nthink my reasons are more substantial than yours are. I know you think\nthere was some big conspiracy against you at your Threshing, but there\nwasn’t. We always try to scare people. And when you threw the rope out of\nthe hole, I really thought you weren’t allowed to, so I gave it back. It was an\ninnocent mistake. On the other hand, you killed my father.”\nWhen you put it that way… “Whatever that thing was, it stopped being\nyour father long ago,” Kip said.\n“Something it would have been nice to judge for myself, rather than\nassured that by the man who killed him. Besides, your father and uncle\ndestroyed half the world, I—”\n“And your family joined the wrong side to help do it!” Kip said. Man?\n“An error we corrected,” Tisis said, her chin drifting up.\n“You came out against Dazen? When? After he was killed at Sundered\nRock? Brave.”\n“I would think of all people, Kip, that you might not be the first to blame\na person for what their family did when they were young. You weren’t born\nyet; I was two. Should I blame you for what your mother did? Because I’ve\nheard stories—from people who heard them from you. So maybe we should\nfocus on where we are today, and not old fights that we had no part in.”\n“That sounds… remarkably sensible,” Kip admitted. It was easier to\nfocus when he was having to dissect her argument, but at the same time,\nshe’d leaned forward and up as her temper got going. He cleared his throat.\n“Could you, um…” He took his hand and gestured down a smidge.\nShe looked down, and saw that her nipples were right at the waterline,\nand the water wasn’t that soapy. “Oh!” She blushed, and with her pale skin,\nhe could tell immediately. She sat lower in the water. “Thanks,” she said.\nSomething touched his naked thigh, and he nearly shot out of the water."

I thought you’d tear my head\noff if I dared—and the second time!

Full-throated,\ndistinctive, it was the kind of laugh you could pick out of a crowd of\nthousands, the kind of laugh that snuck out of its cage infrequently and\nburned the town down when it did, ’cause, hell, it was just going back in the\ncage again anyway, right? And then she snorted.\nThey laughed harder, and she blushed and laughed and snorted so hard\nshe ended up trailing off in tears.\nThey drifted into a companionable silence as Tisis wiped her eyes. She\nended up cleaning off the kohl makeup dripping from around her eyes with\na little towel. When she was done, Kip stared at her quizzically. Without her\nmakeup on, she didn’t look twenty-five years old like she did with it on. She\ndidn’t look her actual nineteen years. She looked about seventeen. No\nwonder she wore the makeup.\nShe was just a teenager like him, and they were both very, very alone\nhere.\n“Kip,” she said, “the truth is, my family’s in a bad spot. The False\nPrism’s War wiped out the other branches of the family. Perversely, that\nstrengthened us, because with all the wealth and lands of our entire clan in\nmy uncle’s hands, we became a major family. I think that your grandfather\nthinks we’re a threat to him. We proposed that I marry your father Gavin to\nmake an alliance, and we thought your grandfather was going to accept.\nInstead, Gavin married Karris. It was a slap in our faces. Never explained,\nnever apologized for.”\nShe had been intending to marry Gavin? And she’d had to go from that\nto putting her hands under the blankets for my grandfather? Now there was\na turn of Fortune’s Wheel.\nBut Kip kept his features carefully blank.

If it were a will, my older\nsister Eirene got all the family intelligence, I got all the looks, and all the\ncharisma I should have gotten went to my little cousin Antonius instead.\nEirene will continue the family line if she absolutely must, but it would be\nhell for her, and I won’t do that to her if I can help it.”\n“What?” Kip asked. Sure, some women didn’t want to get stuck raising\nchildren, but a wealthy family would have slaves for that, wouldn’t they?\nA scowl. “I forget you’re not in the gossip circles,” Tisis said. “Her\ninterest in taking any man to bed is about equal to your interest in taking\nyour grandfather to bed.”\n“Oh,” Kip said, not understanding. Then, “Oh!”\n“My cousin Antonius was on his way here to bring orders from my\nsister. His ship was captured by pirates. They haven’t asked a ransom,\nwhich they would, if he were alive.” Her eyes went vacant, her voice an\necho of itself. She obviously loved him very much. “That leaves me,” she\nsaid. “Kip, our southern plantations and forests can be defended. But if they\naren’t… those are my people. More than fifty thousand of them. I grew up\nin those lands. I played banconn in their festival parades. I was taught\nfarming and husbandry and logging in those little towns. I played with little\nboys and girls there. Many of those little girls I played with have children of\ntheir own now. Life moves faster out on the farms. I will do anything to\nsave my people.”\nIncluding getting on your back for my grandfather.\n“Yes,” she said quietly, reading his mind. “Even that. My virginity for\ntheir lives? I’ll take that trade any day.”\nFor some reason, the statement made Kip deeply ashamed of himself.\nHe’d judged Tisis as if she were merely angling for the attention of the most\nimportant man in the room, willing to debase herself even with Andross\nGuile. Like she was a tramp or a prostitute.\nSome of the noble families had made their base on Big Jasper for so\nlong that they had little to no connection to their ancestral holdings. Perhaps\nthe lord or lady would make one trip a year to check how the stewards were\nkeeping things together, but their children were left vying with the children\nof other nobles for who could throw the most lavish party, who could\ngamble better or dance better or ride better, with constant talk of who’d\nbedded whom that morphed into who would marry whom, followed by\nmore gossip of who was carrying on affairs with whom. Or they used some\ntiny sliver of magical talent to get into the Chromeria, where they ended up\ndoing much the same, with a side of studying. Kip hadn’t been part of those\ncircles despite his pedigree, his time taken up entirely with studies or\ntraining.\nThat hadn’t been a mistake, he knew.

That, and Gavin’s realization that war was coming, and\nKip would need as much martial training as possible.\nKip had assumed that Tisis was part of those circles. After all, she was\nrich and highly talented with green and beautiful. She had to be petty and\nboring and gossip-mongering to make up for it, right?\nIt made Kip wonder how people judged Gavin Guile, who was\nfrustratingly Everything Good. Surely they must secretly hate him. Come to\nthink of it, what did people think of Kip, who’d swooped in out of nowhere\nand taken up the mantle of the foremost family in the Seven Satrapies?\nSuddenly, the Blackguard looked like a warm blanket that Kip didn’t\never want to leave. People judged him for himself there, mostly. Some of\nthem even liked him. No one had given him trouble for being Tyrean since\nhe became an inductee. What mattered in his unit was what you were doing\nto help the unit succeed. Kip hated being judged, but had barely noticed\nwhen the judgment of him stopped.\nAnd here was Tisis, ready to sell her body to save her people, and Kip\nwas judging her and calling her whore.\n“Orholam have mercy,” he muttered into the water. “Tisis, I’m so sorry\nfor, for everything. For how I treated you. For what I said. It was vile. I’m\nso, so sorry.”\nShe blinked rapidly, looked away. “I tried to go back to him, you know?\nAfter you left. He wouldn’t take me. Put me out of his room like a…”\nKip said, “He is… not a nice man.” A deep hatred started burning there.\nIt was one thing for Andross to debase Kip, then point out his debasement\nand laugh at him. It was quite another to see him do it to someone else.\n“No,” she laugh-cried. She dabbed an eye with a finger, getting control\nof herself. “No, he’s not that. You know, the only thing that really surprises\nme is that he didn’t bed me first. I mean, I already feel pretty gross about\nmyself—‘gross about myself’? Well, you know what I mean. I would have\nfelt a hundred times worse if he’d used me and then cast me off. It seems\nmore like his style. I mean, we’d barely gotten started—sorry, you don’t\nwant to know all that. Maybe he was afraid I’d get pregnant and then he’d\nhave a bastard to worry about.”\nNo, it wasn’t that. He was playing a different game.\nBut Kip didn’t say anything.\nHey, she hadn’t said ‘another bastard to worry about,’ so apparently she\nhad some tact.\nFor the next few minutes, as she recovered, Kip studied her openly.\nWithout the makeup she always wore, she was still intimidatingly beautiful,\nbut this natural beauty was softer, and of course younger, than that icy\nperfection.

How did that\nhappen so fast?\nAndross Guile, who pissed on everything, had said she would try to\nseduce Kip. Was that what this was? A very clever seduction? Was she\nsimply playing him?\nHe couldn’t see it.\nHell, if she was this good and this was all an act, he’d rather be on her\nside regardless, because if she was this good, no one else was going to stand\na chance.\n“So, uh, my skin’s getting all pruney,” Kip said. “How do we get out of\nhere gracefully? Ladies first? I mean, it doesn’t matter since I’ve already\nseen you naked, right?”\nShe sighed and let herself sink into the water until she was blowing\nbubbles in it. “So,” she said. She winced.\nKip waited. Nothing. “So?” he prompted.\nShe bobbed higher and he glanced down through the water, though he\ndidn’t think she noticed. Dammit! And he’d been so high-minded a few\nmoments ago. “So I didn’t just come here because I needed a bath, though I\nnotice you haven’t washed, pruney or not.”\n“Oh. Right.” Kip picked up the soap from the edge of the bath. He\nstarted soaping up his left shoulder awkwardly.\n“So I shared all about my family and the situation I’m in…” Tisis said.\nKip stopped soaping. She expected him to do the same? “Tisis, it’s been\nreally nice talking to you. I mean, really nice. A huge surprise, actually, but\na bunch of classes end right around now, and dozens or hundreds of people\nare going to be heading down here any minute. I don’t think we have time\nfor my whole history.”\nThey heard the banging of a distant door slamming, and both of them\nnearly bolted.\n“Right,” Tisis said. She licked her lips. “But you are isolated, too, right?\nI mean, I need friends, you need friends, right? Something solid.”\n“Sure, that’d be… nice. I don’t know if it’s possible. Sooner or later, I’m\ngoing to get kicked out of the Blackguard, or nicely promoted out of it. You\nsaw. My grandfather hates me. I’ve secured funding to keep on at the\nChromeria, but yes, you could say my position is… not strong.” He’d been\nso assiduously not thinking about it that thinking about it now slapped him\nin the face.\nShe exhaled a big breath again. “That’s pretty much what I thought. I\nhave a plan, and I don’t want you to answer now, but I want you to think\nabout it seriously. Come down to the baths next week, same time. The same\nslave will meet you and bring you back here.”\n“Now I’m curious,” Kip said.\nShe was blushing. “This is not exactly how I’d planned for this to\nhappen…” She took a deep breath, let it out. She bobbed under the water.\nScrunched her face as she emerged.\n“Why am I the one who feels awkward here?” Kip asked.\n“Marry me, Kip.”"

Oh, Kip’s throat.\nShe blushed harder. “Just think about it?”\n“What?!”\nThen she daintily dashed up the steps out of the bath, snatched Kip’s\nbathing robe from its hook, and ran tiptoe out of the room. Between her\nwords and her nudity, Kip was speechless.\n“Hey, wait!” he shouted finally. “I don’t know how to get out of here!\nThere’s only that one robe!”\nThen he realized he, a man, had just shouted—in the women’s baths.\nIdiot! He jumped out of the water and dashed in the opposite direction from\nwhere Tisis had disappeared. Naked turtle-bear coming through!\nChapter 71\nIn the closest thing to a corner she could find in a circular library, Teia was\nworking on her assignment for Murder Sharp. The man might be an utter\nhorror, but he was also a font of knowledge about paryl. And as far as Teia\nknew, with Marta Martaens having fled, he was the only source of\nknowledge about paryl available: there was nothing in even the forbidden\nlibraries about paryl. Damn luxors.\nBut Murder Sharp dropped the answers to her biggest questions like they\nwere nothing.\n“The other colors,” she’d ventured, “they have metaphysical effects.”\n“Meta-what?”\nOh, right. Murder Sharp hadn’t gotten his education in the Chromeria.\nBest not to make it look like she was trying to rub it in. “Like red makes\nyou more prone to anger, and superviolet makes you more logical over\ntime. What does paryl do?”\nHe’d chuckled. “Haven’t noticed, huh? Maybe you’re special, like me.\nI’m a bit of a curiosity among paryl drafters.”\nA curiosity. That was one way to put it. But she painted a carefully\nneutral but interested look on her face. He’d given in.\n“Paryl makes you a feeler. Think about it. It’s way down below sub-red,\nopposite to superviolet. Superviolet makes you more logical. Paryl makes\nyou empathetic. You get incredibly attuned to the emotions around you,\nwhether mundane or magical. I’m lucky. I’m just aware of them; they don’t\naffect me. Other paryl drafters—most of the few we got—aren’t so lucky.\nThey themselves feel what others are feeling. For some, to a horrifying\ndegree. ‘Weep with those who are weeping, rejoice with those who are\nrejoicing.’ It could have been written with a paryl in mind. That refined\nfeeling, though, is our greatest weakness and our greatest strength. It’s why\nwe feel light itself. First, we get good at feeling light’s effects. Then we\nsimply become aware of light itself. Then we can split it.”\n“All paryls are lightsplitters?” How could the Chromeria not know such\na thing?\n“One in ten, maybe. Which is about a thousand times more frequently\nthan other colors.”\nIt turned out that half of what Marta Martaens had taught her about paryl"

        "text": "a thing?\n“One in ten, maybe. Which is about a thousand times more frequently\nthan other colors.”\nIt turned out that half of what Marta Martaens had taught her about paryl\nwas worthless. Paryl made a gel, Marta had said. Master Sharp had\nadmitted that could be done, but wondered why you’d want to use it very\noften. “There’s a resonance point higher up that can be used to make a gel.\nWe only use it to mark targets, because it evaporates quickly. Other than\nthat? Good for paryl torches, I guess, but I just fling the light directly. So\nmaybe if you want to give paryl to someone else for some reason?” And\nthen he’d shown her another resonance point: it was a gas. It was also\nmuch, much easier to draft than paryl’s solid or gel forms.\nThen he’d given her the assignment she was working on now. She\ndrafted a shell of paryl in a bubble around her.\nIt was, of course, invisible. It was also so delicate that any touch\nshattered it. But delicate didn’t mean useless. With the bubble surrounding\nher, she drafted paryl gas to fill it. This, too, was invisible—which was why\nshe could practice in the library without worrying about being interrupted,\nso long as she flipped the page of the tome open in her lap every so often\nand didn’t let them see her eyes.\nBy drafting paryl, Teia was made more sensitive to the touch of colors.\nHaving paryl gas actually touching her skin seemed to enhance that\nsensitivity even further. Having it surround her also meant she was\nbreathing it, though it had no taste and only the faintest scent.\nThe paryl bubble not only acted as a good way to contain the paryl gas,\nbut it was also a lens. Just as a blue lens filtered out all colors except blue,\nor as a clear glass window still filtered out some superviolet light, so too did\nparyl have an effect on the light that passed through it. It was like a gentle\nsieve.\nA sieve of light? The idea had seemed impossible, but it was true. Paryl\nnudged every color closer to its true color—that spectrum at which it could\nbe drafted. Through even this much paryl, each color seemed more vibrant,\nbrighter. Master Sharp said this was evidence that paryl was the master\ncolor. Except he said it like it was capitalized. ‘Paryl is the Master Color,’\nhe’d said, his voice reverent.\nBut Teia had heard red magisters come up with reasons why red was the\nbest color. Blue magisters told their upper-level discipulae why blue was the\ntrue color—Orholam’s favorite shade, the color of sea and sky. Yellows\nmade the case for why yellow was Orholam’s favorite—the strong center of\nthe spectrum, whose solid heart was unbreakable gold. As far as Teia was\nconcerned, much as she would like paryl to be amazing and great—it was\nher only color, after all—paryl was just another color with some quirks.\nLike yellow could be liquid or frozen and was useful in each form.\nTeia had seen the tenth-year discipulae—those few permanent students\nwho were able to convince their sponsors that they could best serve them by\ndoing research—experiment with polarized lenses.

When one lens was\nplaced in a beam of light, nothing appeared to happen. When a second was\nplaced downstream in the same beam, still nothing happened—until either\nlens was rotated. Then the beam of light went dark.\nThis seemed to be something similar. Unless, of course, it was\nsomething totally different. She was forbidden to ask anyone about it.\nShe finished her assignments for her other lectures, maintaining the\nbubble as well as she could while doing so. It was impossible, and even\nwhen she did it right, she realized she soon ran out of air. For that matter,\nshe was inhaling an awful lot of paryl gas. Was that healthy?\nOn the scale of things likely to kill you, T, breathing paryl goes\nsomewhere below murderous heretics, insane assassins, conquering pagans,\nand plain stupidity.\nThat was one way to look on it.\nShe finished her work and headed back to her barracks. She tried to\nmaintain the bubble, drafting in quick gulps, averting her eyes from\npassersby, then returning them to normal, and glancing once again after\ntraversing only a few paces. But the bubble kept snapping from her uneven\nsupport of it—the rolling motion of walking itself broke the bubble at\nwhatever direct support beams she attached to it. Then when she was sure\nshe was supporting the bubble correctly, walking so lightly and fluidly and\nholding the bubble at so many points it shouldn’t break, she watched as the\nforce of the wind from her walking caved the front of the bubble in. It held\nform for one second, then cracked and split and dissolved into nothing.\nAgain.\n“Tsst.”\nThe whisper almost didn’t register. Teia walked right past the open door,\ntotally absorbed in her—oh hell!\nShe froze. Master Sharp! He was dressed in the embroidered linen and\nwide belt of a rich Ruthgari, with his petasos worn on his back, the ties\ninterwoven with gold threads. A part of her noted the clothing with\napproval: rich enough to allow free movement around most of the\nChromeria, but not so rich as to be memorable.\nHe beckoned her to step into the room he was in. It was an office of\nsome kind. He’d clearly broken in. She made sure no one was looking, and\nstepped in.\n“This will be quick,” Master Sharp said. He grinned at her, all perfect\nteeth. He closed the door behind her. “The time has come for you to prove\nyour loyalty. Sun Day is only three days away. The White is attending\nrehearsals, right now. You will go to a room two floors below her room. Out\nthe window, you’ll find a knotted rope. It will take you up one floor. Then\nyou’re to use these to climb to the next.” He handed her a bag of what felt\nlike rocks.\nShe took one out. It was a crescent roughly the size of her hand. The\nmouth of the crescent was almost flat. A tab of blue luxin stuck out from the\nmouth.\n“You wipe the wall as clean as you can get it. You peel the tab off, and"

You peel the tab off, and\nyou stick it immediately to the wall, hard. It’ll hold five times your weight.\nWhen you climb down, you pull this off the bottom.” He flipped out a ring.\n“It’s attached to a string. The string is coated with a solvent. You use the\nstring to pop the crescent off the wall. This is important. You’re to leave no\ntrace, understood? There may be a little luxin left on the wall. It’ll dissolve\nin minutes.”\n“What am I supposed to do when I get there?”\n“There will still be a Blackguard or two posted right outside the door.\nHer room slave has been dealt with.”\n“Killed?” Teia asked. He still hadn’t answered her question.\n“Sent on a task. We believe the shimmercloaks are in the bottom drawer\nof the White’s desk. That or in her slave’s dresser in the attached slave\nquarters.” So that was the goal. Shimmercloaks. Just like they’d guessed.\n“We expect you have half an hour. The door to the balcony has been left\nunlocked.”\n“You have a Blackguard in your employ,” Teia said. “Why not have him\nget it for you?”\nMaster Sharp looked at her like she was stupid.\nOh. Because they didn’t want to expose him. Or her. The Blackguards\nwould be the first people suspected—even though no one would want to\nsuspect them, who else could steal something from the White’s very\nchambers?\nThe further implication was that whichever Blackguard was the Order’s\nman, he would be somewhere with a good alibi during this job. Perhaps it\nwould be someone who was with the White right now. Regardless, it would\nalso have to be someone who could have gotten into the White’s room quite\nrecently in order to unlock the balcony door—which was kept locked at all\ntimes since the assassination attempt a few months ago. Between those two\nbits of information, surely Teia could limit the pool of possible traitors.\nLater.\n“What do the cloaks look like?” Teia asked.\nMurder Sharp bared his too-white teeth at her. Maybe it was a grin. He\nshowed her the inside of his cloak. It was a supple gray cloth, fine-woven.\nHe flipped the cloak over and showed her the pocket at the neckline, gave\nher a glimpse of the golden choker inside. “One of them is burned at the\nhem. There should be two. We know the burned one is there. If you bring\nboth, you will find great favor. If you bring only the burned one, they may\nstill not trust you.”\n“You’re telling me I could bring you a treasure as great as a\nshimmercloak and still not be trusted?” Teia demanded.\n“The room’s Prudence twenty-seven. Get moving,” Master Sharp said.\nHe scowled, as if he wished he hadn’t given away the part about the two\ncloaks. “Oh, and the trick with the paryl bubble is to support it with the gas\nitself. No hard points. If the gas is dense enough, you can hold an open\nconnection to it, and without your eyes black orbs of night.

My own master\nsaid that our ancient forebears could hold the cloud in formation around\nthem without a shell even as they moved, even in wind, or while sprinting\nor fighting.”\nThat was impressive, but… “Why would that help?” Teia asked.\n“The shimmercloaks help us lightsplitters attain invisibility. The\nmechanics of the cloaks are different, but the idea was based on something,\nyou know.”\n“You mean…?” Teia started. It was impossible.\n“The ancient masters were called mist walkers for a reason. They didn’t\nneed cloaks.”\nChapter 72\nThink of it this way, T: you hate waiting. For some insane reason, like every\nsoldier, you prefer the moments of terror to the monotony of boredom.\nTeia remembered leading the Blackguard up the cliff path to the fort on\nRuic Head. She’d led an assault by the best force in the entire world. Surely\nshe could climb a ladder. She’d climbed up the side of the fort with enemies\nshooting cannons mere feet away. This would be easy.\nTo distract herself as she walked, she tried to support the paryl bubble\nwith paryl gas alone. It worked, easily. If she left the bubble open at the\nbottom, a hands’ breadth above the ground, she could float along inside it\nand still breathe.\nShe rounded a corner and saw Kip coming out of the lift. She stopped\nsuddenly and ducked backward so he wouldn’t see her. She forgot to push\nthe bubble back as she did so it shattered when she moved back into it—but\nit shattered silently and invisibly. She waited. If Kip was coming her\ndirection, she’d see him any second.\nBut he didn’t come. He must have been headed to the library.\nShe made it to the lift unseen. She went up to the floor named Prudence\n—the luxiats’ name for one of the upper floors—and made it unseen. There\nwas no one in the hallways. She made it to room twenty-seven unseen.\nThe door was unlocked.\nNo one inside.\nShe checked the window. It was big enough. It opened easily, and the\nrope was hanging precisely where it was supposed to be. It was even\nknotted for easier climbing—which Teia appreciated greatly. She could\nmake it up an unknotted rope, but with difficulty. Her upper-body strength\nwasn’t what she wished.\nShe checked the door behind her, secured the bag she was carrying with\nthe climbing crescents, and prayed for about ten seconds. Don’t give\nyourself too much time. Too much thinking will stop you. You take long\nenough to prep your gear and gather your wits, but don’t take any time to\ngather your courage. Courage delayed is cowardice. Courage is action.\nBut I don’t want to die.\nMove, T.\nShe grabbed the rope, tugged on it. It felt solid. Of course, it would. If\nthey were trying to kill her, they—\nThey wouldn’t do it in the tower.\nShe was climbing before she knew what she was doing. Much better.\nShe avoided looking down and worked her way up, knot to knot to knot. It\nwas late afternoon, not exactly the time she would have picked.

At least she was climbing in the shadowed side of the Prism’s\nTower, so while the sun was descending, anyone looking her direction\nwould be dazzled by the sun beyond her.\nThank Orholam it was a cold spring day with a chilling wind: hardly\nanyone would be outside.\nThe tricky part was always making the transitions, from rope to balcony\nthis time. But Teia was a good climber. She hitched up a foot, swung the\nrope around it, locking the rope against one of its knots, and used that as a\nstep. With that and both hands on the balcony rail, she vaulted into the\nbalcony as if she did this every day.\nIt made her think about climbing the balconies at the Lucigari estate\nwith the little girl she’d been bought to be a playmate for, Sarai. Easy.\nShe checked the door, and found it was unlocked, as it was supposed to\nbe. She glanced inside. There was no one inside. It was a small, plain room,\nbut this high in the tower, it must be the room of a favored slave. Or a room\nreserved for such, but empty now. Teia’s curiosity was hot, but she didn’t\nhave time to poke around. She stepped back outside, closed the door gently,\nand examined the climb.\nShe wished she could use a grapnel, but she knew why she couldn’t. She\nwould descend by the same rope, and that would mean leaving the grapnel\nbehind as evidence. The whole point of this job was that the shimmercloak\nwould simply disappear.\nMercifully, she had plenty of the climbing crescents. She wasn’t going\nto have to make it a stretch to reach each one. She scrubbed the wall with a\nsleeve in an area not too high above the balcony railing off to the right,\npeeled off the blue luxin cap, and stuck the crescent there. She snapped the\nblue luxin cap in her hand, and it dissolved into dust.\nThe next crescent went higher, up to the left. Left foot onto railing, right\nfoot up onto the crescent, left hand reaching to the top one. And repeat. No\nhurry.\nThe climb wasn’t far, but Teia took her time. As she climbed, she angled\nto the left. If she fell now, she’d hit the balcony below. In two more steps,\nthere would be nothing below her but the great yard far, far below.\nThe clouds were thickening and it was getting darker rapidly,\nexacerbated by being on the shadow side of the tower. Teia had a thought,\nand drafted the paryl gas. With it floating above her head but still connected\nto her will, she could use it as a torch.\nSo the ‘ancient masters’ hadn’t only been thinking of invisibility. Having\nthe torch close, but above her instead of in her line of sight, made it much\nmore useful.\nThe wind gusted hard and she lost the paryl.

She squatted\nthere, low, with her hands in her armpits, bringing feeling back to them and\nresting her tired arms. If she opened that door and there was a Blackguard\nstanding right there, she was going to have to come out here and climb\ndown at breakneck speed.\nThinking of that, she stood and found the tabs on the two crescents she\ncould reach and popped them down. If she had to cut away the crescents to\nfrustrate pursuit, she was going to have to do it fast.\nShe paused one heartbeat more. She couldn’t use the paryl to look\nthrough the wood door; that only worked with thin, permeable materials\nlike clothing. Courage is action, T.\nShe tested the door handle, turning it slowly. It turned, unlocked, exactly\nas it was supposed to be. She hadn’t heard any creak from the mechanism,\nbut here on the outside with the wind, she wouldn’t. There was nothing for\nit. She completed turning the handle and opened the door a crack.\nWith the curtains drawn, the White’s chamber was dark. The difference\nin temperature between the chamber and the outside air meant Teia was\ncausing quite a draft. She ducked inside, keeping low, and closed the door\nbehind her. The curtains blew—and settled.\nWith a quick paryl torch in her hand, Teia scanned the room for hiding\nplaces. Had the wind rattled the outer door in its hinges? If it had, the\nBlackguard standing outside would check it immediately or not at all.\nHeart in her throat, she dashed on tiptoe toward the White’s desk as fast\nas she dared. She stumbled on the edge of a thick carpet and fell to her\nhands and knees, extinguishing her paryl torch. Because of the luxurious\nthickness of the carpet, however, the fall was neither loud nor painful.\nTeia almost burst out laughing from the ridiculousness and the tension.\nAnd then she remembered: laughing might mean death here.\nThe door didn’t open. The Blackguard outside didn’t check.\nTeia collected herself and drew in paryl. She thought for a second, and\ndrafted the shell again. She filled it with paryl gas to be a floating overhead\ntorch for her, and the room lit in her vision. Now that was more like it.\nOne of the mysteries of paryl was that it was so distinct. It was farther\ndown the spectrum from sub-red, and sub-red was indistinct. Teia had\nassumed that there was some qualitative property of light that made it finer\nat superviolet and less fine at sub-red. But something must happen between\nsub-red and paryl, because she could see perfectly.\nTeia glanced into the slave’s quarters. Empty. Easy.\nShe went to the desk—and immediately broke her paryl shell on the\nwood. The paryl gas inside, however, was inert. It didn’t go rushing"

It didn’t go rushing\nanywhere. With a little sigh—was this the time to be figuring out paryl?—\nshe reformed the shell. She moved forward, let it break, but held the rest of\nit so that only the part that physically was hit broke. With Murder Sharp’s\nrevelation that she could hold an open connection to the paryl through the\ngas, it was actually simple.\nWith great care, Teia went through the desk. How many lethal secrets sat\nhere? Papers and notes and ink and even a number of Nine Kings cards—\nfunny, Teia didn’t know the old lady played. In the bottom drawer, carefully\nfolded, there was a dark cloak. Teia shook it out, revealing a snarling fox\nstitched subtly gray on gray. The hem was burned short; a gold choker\nadorned the neck, and the material was thin, silky, but strong. Easy.\nToo easy? Teia licked her lips. She rolled the cloak, tucked it into the\npack on her back, secured it.\nThere was no other cloak.\nFor one moment, panic closed her throat. Then she thought, no, of\ncourse there isn’t. This is all a setup, but it’s not a setup for me.\nThis cloak is so short only a petite woman or a boy could wear it. How\nmany lightsplitters exist? How many of those were petite women or boys?\nOne. They couldn’t kill Teia if she was the only one who could make use of\nthis cloak for them.\nIt could be a lucky accident, but Teia saw the White’s hand in it. Or if\nnot the White’s, then Orholam’s own. Of course, by some accounts of how\nOrholam worked, this was his doing even if it was the White’s doing. So…\nThank you, sir. I’ll pray properly when I’m not, uh, risking my life. And\nI’ll stop skipping weekly worship.\nSo often.\nShe was finished. Even if the other cloak was in some other closet, she\nrealized now that it would be tempting death to bring it with her. Forget it.\nShe was walking toward the balcony when she heard a voice outside the\ndoor. The door opened and a Blackguard poked his head in. It was Baya\nNiel, a green who was a veteran of the Battle of Ru. He’d fought Atirat\nhimself alongside Kip and Karris and Gavin Guile. He was illuminated in\nthe pure yellow light of a lux torch.\nTeia froze. There was no cover. Nothing within a jump. Her heart\nstopped. Battle juice flooded her veins, but where every other of a thousand\ntimes it had thrown her into action, this time it failed her, or she it. She\ncouldn’t move. She knew what was going to happen next. Through the\nparyl cloud surrounding her, she saw something odd about the yellow light\nreflected off Baya Niel’s ghotra, his nose, his arm, which was turning,\nturning.\nIf it wasn’t her imagination, the yellow seemed to give Teia a strange\nclarity, a fast understanding beyond her own intelligence.

She could kill\nBaya Niel, the logic of it told her, she had the paryl in hand, and she knew\nhow to drop him limp to the floor in no time.\nBut she couldn’t kill a Blackguard. Not to save herself.\nA thought flitted through her head: I could have just asked the White for\nthe cloak, and she would have given it to me.\nWhen Baya Niel saw her, he would have already been briefed by the\nWhite on the plan and he would do nothing, or he would capture her, and\nTeia’s usefulness as a spy would be destroyed. There were ways out of this,\nbut none of them were acceptable—and that was the strength of yellow. It\nwasn’t the pure, detached logic of blue or the passion of the reds. It was\nlogic and emotion balanced. Teia surrendered to that implacable human\nlogic. She stood still, unthreatening, as Baya Niel swung the lux torch into\nview.\nTeia’s skin tingled like snowflakes teasing every nerve. Some\ndisembodied part of her felt like her skin was kneading dough, pulling apart\nand drawing back together.\nBaya Niel’s gaze passed right over her. He shot glances around the\nroom, searching. His eyes went right past her again, through her, beyond\nher, and again. She wasn’t six steps away. He wasn’t pretending not to see\nher. She saw his eyes. They didn’t even hesitate. There was no flicker of\nrefocusing. He wasn’t being clever; he was blind to her. And as he swung\nthe lux torch this way and that, Teia’s brain seemed to hiss and spit.\nAnd in that second, Teia knew. That lux torch. Her cloud of paryl. The\nlux torch gave off a single tight spectrum of yellow light. That, paired with\nthe paryl’s refocusing properties, meant that Teia’s light splitting had to deal\nonly with one single spectrum of light. It was a small enough challenge that\nshe was doing it—unknowing. This was what the ancients did, while\nmoving, with every spectrum of light at once. Teia was doing that, albeit\nwithout moving, and with only a fraction of yellow.\nBaya Niel swung his torch back out of the way and closed the door.\nTeia was off like a bolt. She ran to the door. As she opened it, gently, she\nheard Baya Niel’s voice. “You know,” he said, “I should check the locks out\nto the balcony. Those boys they’ve jumped up to full ’guards keep\nforgetting—”\nShe didn’t hear the rest. She slipped out of the door, shattering the paryl\nand losing it. She closed the door just as the other door opened. The\ndifference in air pressure was a quick hiss. She climbed over the railing and\nonto her climbing crescents. She pulled the tab of the first one, exposing the\nrazor string. She pulled the razor string in a quick circle, cutting the\nclimbing crescent off the wall.\nTeia took a quick step down as the door to the balcony opened and full-\nspectrum light flooded out.

Despite her prayers, there must have been\nmisting rain while she was inside, because the lower crescent was slick and\nher foot slid right off it. With one hand filled with a climbing crescent and\none foot flying into space, she grappled spasmodically to keep from flying\noff the tower.\nHer body swung and slapped against the tower. She lost the climbing\ncrescent in her free hand, scrambled, and held. She was low enough that her\nknee was almost in the foothold she’d missed. But that was no good. The\nspacing was for feet and hands. She pulled, her left arm trembling, her\nhamstring screaming, and pulled herself back up, got her right foot back\nwhere it belonged.\nThere was no time to pause. If he looked over this edge, he’d see her.\nShe pulled a tab, circled the razor wire, and retrieved the next crescent,\nputting it in her pack. Took a careful step down onto the next slick crescent,\nrepeat. She had barely disappeared under the balcony and taken a deep\nbreath when she heard a “Huh.”\nYellow light stabbed the darkness as Baya Niel held the lux torch out\nover the side where Teia had just been. Then it swung back.\nShe heard the door open and close.\nShe let her muscles recuperate for a few moments. They needed the rest,\nbut waiting too long would mean letting her cold fingers get stiff and\nclumsy.\nNonetheless, she was methodical, and she made it down to her balcony\nwith no problem. There was a heavily cloaked man inside the room sitting\nwith his back to her. The sight of him suddenly there almost made her faint.\nAt the sound of her coming in, he held up a note in gloved fingers, but\ndidn’t turn.\nIt read: “This one will stow the rope as soon as you’re done with it. Do\nnot speak to him. He is not to know your identity, nor you his. He is in\ndanger simply doing this. Leave nothing with him. You have one minute\nafter you give him the note back before he removes the ladder.”\nTeia checked that all her items were still securely stowed—minus the\none crescent she’d dropped. She handed the man the note, saw the quick\nflash of paper being consumed with fire, and slipped down the rope to the\nnext balcony. She rolled her shoulders. Easy.\nShe took the lift down to the level of the Blackguard barracks, and ran\nsmack into Kip.\n“Hey,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. I got something\nI really need to talk to you about. Why are you wet?”\nTeia did not want to talk to Kip while she was carrying a purloined\nshimmercloak and a dozen climbing crescents, especially because the most\nobvious places for Kip to take her would be either the Blackguard barracks\nor down to one of the training areas, where she would have to change\nclothes and endanger herself and her stolen goods.\n“Where are you going?” she asked, ignoring his questions.\n“I thought we’d go to my apartments. Like I said, I got a thing.”\n“So mysterious,” she said. She meant it to come out teasing, but her fuse"

She meant it to come out teasing, but her fuse\nwas a little short.\nHe dropped his hands as if she’d hit him somewhere sensitive. “Teia,”\nhe said. “Please. Please?”\nKip, being serious and contrite and vulnerable? Now there’s no way I\ncan not go with him.\nShe thought of the hug she hadn’t returned, and how she regretted it.\nKip, you have terrible timing. The worst.\n“Sure,” she said. You’re gonna get me killed.\nShe followed him. Halfway there, she thought she heard a scuff of a\nshoe on stone behind them. Glanced. Nothing.\nShe glanced again, this time in paryl, and saw that Murder Sharp was\ntrailing them, invisibly. He lifted a finger to his lips, forbidding her from\nsaying or doing anything. She wondered for a moment if she could shrug\noff the pack on her back and just drop it as they rounded a corner. Surely\nMaster Sharp would have no choice but to pick it up, and maybe leave her\nalone, right?\nBut what if she wasn’t terribly adroit? What if Kip saw her acting\nstrangely about her pack? He’d ask instantly, and then he’d get tenacious,\nand wouldn’t leave her alone until he knew what was inside. So curious all\nthe time, always wanted to know what was going on with everything. He\nwas like a bad cat.\nSo they walked, her dread growing, all the way to Kip’s room. In paryl,\nshe saw Master Sharp gesture, insistent. Hell no. But there was no\ndisobeying him, not now, not ever.\nShe left the door open, and Master Sharp stepped inside to join them\ninvisibly, intent to hear every secret word.\n“Finally,” Kip said. “Privacy.”\nChapter 73\n“Here’s the thing, Teia. Dammit, I keep saying here’s the thing.” He heaved\na sigh. “We both know I’m not going to be a Blackguard.”\n“What? No, we don’t,” she said.\n“Are you kidding?” Kip asked. Surely he’d been the only person blind.\n“What are you talking about? Our squad’s the best in the Blackguard.\nYour skills are improving all the time. Breaker, get over this. You’re always\nworrying. You’re—”\n“I’m not worried about that!” he said, like it was ridiculous. Which was\nunfair, of course, since he’d been worried about precisely that as long as\nhe’d known Teia.\n“You’ve been worried about it for as long as I’ve—”\n“Teia, I’m a Guile. There’s no way they’ll let me take final vows. Who\nwould they let a Guile guard? Who would they trust me with? I’ve only\nmade it this long because the war has everyone else looking the other way.\nBut when it comes time for vows? Probably my grandfather will spring\nother plans on me. But maybe the White. Maybe one of the other Colors.\nI’m my father’s son, and that means I have value to people I don’t even\nknow, people who hate my family. And those people aren’t moving yet,"

As soon as they realize I’m not under his\nprotection, or—” He cut off. Orholam’s mercy, he’d almost said ‘or once\nmy half brother Zymun shows up.’ He’d been that close to spilling it. “I’m\nfucked, Teia.”\n“Hey,” she said, “Blackguards guard their tongues.” She glanced off to\nthe side.\nKip rolled his eyes. “Exactly,” he said. “In other words, not me. I’m just\nthe acknowledged son who everybody knows is really a bastard, but if the\nGuiles want to pretend I’m a real son, well then, they’re Guiles. They get to.\nYet another reason to hate us. It was all a fantasy. In fact, I think my father\ngot me in just to teach me how to fight. That cold, shrewd—”\n“Maybe he did it so you could have friends,” Teia said. “Maybe you’re\nbeing unfair to a man who gave you everything.”\n“I’m starting to have my doubts about my sainted father,” Kip said. He\npushed his hair back with a hand. “Anyway. Anyway! So… I’m not going\nto be a Blackguard. Think about what that means.”\nHe thought she’d figure it out instantly. “Kip!” she complained. “I have\nno idea what you mean.”\nHe blanched, looked away, felt suddenly vulnerable, squirmed.\n“Blackguards can’t… Blackguards can’t be involved with other\nBlackguards.”\n“Right,” she said, like what he was saying was trivially true. Not.\nConnecting. The. Dots.\nDon’t make me say it, Teia.\n“But if I weren’t in the Blackguard, I could be involved with someone…\nwho is.”\n“Rrrright,” she said. Eyebrow rising like coaxing a small child: Use your\nwords, Kip. Then her hand flew up to her mouth. “Oh shit!”\nNot the reaction he’d been hoping for. But in for a danar, in for a quintar.\nHe stared at the wall. It felt like he was tearing his heart out and throwing it\nagainst that spot.\n“I’m about to run out of friends and allies here, Teia. I’ve angered my\ngrandfather to no end, and with a word, he can end my tenure with the\nBlackguards. And it’s not like you… you all will have your duties, which\nmay include stopping me from, you know, killing my grandfather.”\n“Kip, it’s not like we’re going to forget you.”\n“No, actually, it’s exactly like that. Or worse than that. The whole point\nof the Blackguard is that your loyalty is to the Blackguard and to whomever\nthe White tells you your loyalty needs to be to. With a promachos? Your job\nmay be to kill me, just like that.” He was angry, but he wasn’t angry at her.\nHe wasn’t being fair. He really had ambushed her. Maybe she hadn’t even\nthought of it.

What—”\n“Tisis?”\n“—I want to know from you is, is there one good reason I shouldn’t say\nyes to her offer?” Brusque.

Even a promachos can’t\ndissolve a marriage.”\n“Are you seriously—Kip, you’re sixteen!”\n“Seventeen in a few months. Ten. Ten months.”\n“Marriage, Kip. Marriage.

The tears came, and he couldn’t speak, and the tears spilled down\nhis cheeks.\nRejection. From Teia.\nShould have fucked her when you had the chance, Andross Guile said in\nthe back of Kip’s head. And Kip was ashamed.\n“I’m sorry,” he said, and his voice was level, somehow. Tight, oh so very\ntight and quiet, but level. “How embarrassing for both of us. I apologize. I\nwas unfair. Please…”\nTeia looked at him, totally stunned, speechless.\n“Please excuse me,” Kip said. It was his room, but he had to get out. He\ncouldn’t breathe in here, couldn’t face her for one more second. He\npractically fled into the hall. He went to the lifts, but there wasn’t one at this\nlevel. He flipped his green spectacles on—they hid his eyes—and drafted a\nhand brake. He’d never done this before, but he’d seen it done. And, to hell\nwith it.\nHe attached the brake directly to one of the anchor lines, grabbed the\ncrossbar in both hands, and jumped down the hole.\nSudden terror can apparently be quite bracing.\nBut the terror lasted only a second.

Kip threw his\nspectacles back into the hip case and slapped each of the color panels,\nflooding the room with colored light of seven spectra. Any drafting he\nwanted to do would be easy. He threw off his tunic and moved to the heavy\nbag. It took all of his discipline to warm up. Beating the hell out of the bag\nimmediately would just sprain his damn wrists.\nWhatever distance he’d gained in running from his weakness closed in\nas soon as he started punching the bag. Circling the swaying leather and\nsawdust wasn’t flight enough to get away from his stupidity. Whatever pain\nshot from fist to wrist to elbow to shoulder wasn’t enough agony to\noverwhelm the shame. What had he even been asking? How had he not seen\nthat she was dumbfounded? How had he not taken the quiet exits her blank,\nstunned looks had offered him?\nNo. Kip had bulled ahead. Like a dumb animal. All the grace of a turtle-\nbear.\nHis fists thumped, thumped the bag, and his wrists hurt, the connective\ntissue crying out as he hit the bag too hard. He wasn’t warmed up yet, but\nhe couldn’t help but hit until he crossed the threshold of pain. As if pain\nwould blot out all else.\nWhy had he backed Teia into that corner, where there was nothing she\ncould say? He’d wanted to lose her. It was the only explanation.\nHe tried to imagine what the right response would have been.\nAnd couldn’t.\nThis was all on him. Bastard and outcast, choosing to be bastard and\noutcast. He hit and hit, the thud of luxin glove on leather becoming his\nvoice. He could judge every punch by its sound, and soon he was making\ncorrections—tightening here through the gut to put more force into the hit,\nfoot landing just there to give him an anchor, aiming just there as the bag\nswung back.\nBut it was no escape. He’d let himself think he could have friends. That\nhere, at the Chromeria, at the very center of all things, he could be no\nlonger alone. But Gavin was gone, Karris was furious, Teia didn’t want\nhim, his friends would be taken away, and he could never trust them again.\nKip was to be alone, again, and this time, finally, fatally.\nAnd what are you going to do? Cry about it? Feel sorry for yourself?\nPoor little Kip of Rekton, poor little fat boy.\nHe closed his eyes and tried to hit the bag by feel. It had always been\nmore theoretically possible than actually possible: you knew how the bag\nwas shaped, you knew how it swung, you knew where it was hanging, you\nknew how hard and where you’d hit it, so you should be able to tell where it\nwas going to come back. Repeat. Right?\nOf course it wasn’t nearly so easy. Whatever else he was, Kip was\nleagues from being a blind fighter.\nFinally the tendons in his arms and every surface of his fists felt merely\nhot rather than in pain, and his muscles warm. He picked up the speed.\nElbows, knees, quick combos, face. He kicked the bag, reveling in the bass,\nmeaty thump of a perfectly executed kick."

He was really going to do it.\nShe had done exactly what his grandfather had warned him of: seduced\nhim into rescuing her, without ever having to resort to actual physical\nseduction.\nAnd there was that damned loose stitch on the heavy bag. Still just the\nsame amount of looseness in it there had been months ago. Dammit! Like\nhe’d accomplished nothing.\nHe focused on that side, chasing it when it turned, punching it with left\nhooks so it would turn right and then slamming a kick into it as hard as\npossible.\nAnd then he began streaming. That was the name the squad had come up\nwith for Kip’s little trick of shooting luxin while moving in order to move\nfaster. Streaming was, they all agreed, incredibly dangerous—and they all\ndid it as frequently as possible. If Kip streamed luxin out of his shoulder as\nhe punched, he could punch the bag almost twice as hard as a normal\npunch. Which was awesome, except that hitting something that hard would\nbreak his hand, and wrist, and probably his arm. Streaming didn’t make you\ntougher, it just moved you faster.\nThey’d had more pratfalls and collisions and collected more minor\ninjuries than any Blackguard squad in history.\nIt had given them some hilarious stories, though: watching Ferkudi\nstream while running in order to run faster—and jetting from his shoulders,\nwhich made him go really fast for a few moments, until he faceplanted.\nHe’d skidded, and was only losing the last scabs on his face now. Cruxer\nflipping into Daelos while trying to learn to leap high.\nKip had wondered aloud if you could coat your bones in solid yellow\n(provided you were able to draft a solid yellow) and make them\nunbreakable, so you could hit anything. Teia had pointed out that your\ntendons and skin still wouldn’t be unbreakable; Cruxer pointed out that it\nwould be incarnitive, and thus forbidden, with the penalty being death. It\nwas where all wights started, he said, tweaking their flesh just a bit for an\nadvantage here and there.\nNow he made a mistake by streaming red first. The advantage was that it\nhad significant mass, so the action-reaction combo of throwing red took less\ndrafting for an equal amount of streaming. But red wasn’t purely physical,\nas he should know well by now. The emotions poured through him, first\namong them fury.\nKick. Fury at looking a fool. Kick. Fury at Andross Guile. Kick. Fury at\nGavin Guile for leaving him here. Fury at Karris and Teia for rejecting him.\nFury at his own weakness.\nFury to rage to insanity.\nHe aimed a roundhouse kick right at that one loose, defiant stitch, and\nhis fury crested. Hit it. Nothing. Punched, punched, punched. The world\nfogged into pain and stubbornness and one loose damned stitch.

He became pure beast, pure\nhatred, a roar sounding from some place deep within him.\nHe roared, and as red luxin streamed out of his heel so too did sub-red,\nand the luxin ignited.

But the\nthrust of that fire-streamed kick delivered incredible force into the bag.\nThere were two cracks: one felt, one heard.\nKip didn’t see what else happened because he was swept off his feet. His\nplanted foot was expecting only so much force to rotate around it, and he\nhad doubled or trebled that. He went down, landing heavily on his side.\nHe wondered if he’d broken his leg.

The heavy bag was on\nthe ground. It had been torn loose of its chains and was lying on the floor.\nThe bag hadn’t burst.\nIt had just… Fuck.\nIt had just fallen over.\nIt lay there, mocking him. He stood up. Oh wow. That really hurt. He\nhobbled over to it. Nope, the heavy bag had definitely not burst. The same\nloose threads were still simply loose.\nMocking him.\nBut Kip had heard two cracks simultaneously. If one had been the torn\nleather hanger on top of the heavy bag, what was the other one? The heavy\nbag slapping onto the ground? No.\nThe second crack had come from inside the heavy bag. Kip was certain\nof it.\nWell, hell with it. He was already going to have to explain the broken\nbag to Commander Ironfist—come to think of it, he was already going to be\nkicked out of the Blackguard sooner or later—so what did he have to lose?\nHe looked over at the blue light and drafted a little blue knife. Sitting, he\npoised the knife over the stitching where the loose threads were.\nMonths of punching this thing, for one reason. All that time, trying to do\none stupid thing, failing to do one stupid thing, and now he was giving it\nup? I really wanted to punch this bag open. Ah, well.\nThe bag came open in moments, and revealed… sawdust. Kip sat cross-\nlegged on the floor and plunged his hand into the sawdust, making a mess\non the floor.

A box,\ndeep inside the middle and top of the heavy bag, where few of the strongest\nblows would land. Soon, he had it out.\nIt took his breath. He knew this card box. No, not a card box. The card\nbox. Olivewood and ivory, just large enough to hold one large deck. This\nwas Janus Borig’s card box, the one she’d hidden from the people who’d\nmurdered her. The box that he’d happily given to his father Gavin. The\nprecious wood was cracked, right in the middle, from Kip’s kick.\nOops.\nHe shook off the sawdust and, with trembling hands, opened the box.\nThe new cards were there. All the precious cards—a treasure beyond\nimagining, the hidden truths of kings and satraps and Colors and many of\nthe greatest women and men alive today and in the last two hundred years.\nThey were all here.\nGavin must have known that with how often he was gone, his things\nwould be searched. So he’d hidden it here, where it would only be found by\neither Kip or Ironfist. Which of course brought up the obvious problem.\nWhere could he hide such a treasure, when he’d shown how terrible he was\nat hiding anything and Andross Guile had shown how ready he was to\nviolate Kip’s privacy. Or should he turn over the cards, take Andross’s deal?\nTurning over the cards would mean Kip had given up on his father.\nBut that could wait.\nA chill passed over his sweat-damp forearms, tingled down the length of\nhis spine and up into his scalp. Kip stood, disrupting the heavy bag. More\nsawdust poured out onto the floor. He was going to pay for that mess. But it\nwasn’t just sawdust. There was another card box—one Kip had seen before,\nbriefly. Andross Guile’s own card box: the one he’d asked if Kip had stolen.\nGavin had stolen it.\nAnd now Kip had it.\nBut that could wait, too. He had the cards. Janus Borig’s life’s work. Her\nmasterpieces. Wonders of the world. Kip had scanned these cards once,\nwhen he hadn’t known anything. He was giddy, trembling. He opened the\nbroken box and lifted the entire deck out.\nA shot of joy, as intense and burning as straight brandy, went through\nhim.\nOdd. It didn’t quite feel like his joy. Kip looked around the room at the\nseven intense colored lights illuminating the room. How many of those was\nhe passively drafting? Maybe it wasn’t the best idea to be drafting and\nholding—\nThe deck in his hand was vibrating. It wasn’t his hand trembling, it was\nthe cards themselves, reacting to something.\nKip flipped the whole deck away from himself, but they escaped from\nhis grasp as he flicked his wrist and jumped toward him like iron filings to a\nmagnet, slapping to bare skin. The rest of the deck hit him in his bare chest,\nsnap-snap-snap, drawn inexorably to his skin. Seven colors—more—roared"

Seven colors—more—roared\nthrough Kip, seemed to explode beyond the boundaries of his body.\nEverything was burning and freezing and piercing.\nHe was staggering around in a circle, blind, the snap-snap-snap of cards\nsmacking onto the bare skin of his back. He tore at the cards across his\nchest, and they went tap-tap-tap-tap-tap, resonance points jumping to his\nfingers. As each card scraped off his hand, another jumped onto his fingers,\nand another. Too fast, too sticky, and then they weren’t just burning into his\nfingers. Every card seemed to bore into his skin at many points. He was\nscreaming.\nA luminescence bloomed in the room in front of him. A figure filled with\nglory like light, arresting, impossible to look away from. Rea Siluz, the\nlibrarian with the halo of brown hair and the full lips, the woman who’d\nsent Kip to Janus Borig in the first place. Except now he didn’t think\n‘woman’ was the right term for her.\nHe was falling—\nNo, he was jumping—no, he was fighting, blazing swords in each hand\n—no, he was cursing the woman he’d given his satrapy for—no, he was\nhearing a young Blackguard say, “It’s not incarnitive, sir.”\n“It’s real damn close.”\nFiner gave a jaunty salute, and leapt off the precipice. The magnificent\nbastard, he did a somersault on the way—\nKip hit the floor, the impact jarring him back to himself. Rea knelt\nbeside him. “Breaker, I can’t help you in this. Get out or you’ll die.”\nThe light was scouring flesh from bone, was whittling bone to slivers,\nwas grinding slivers into shavings, grinding shavings into dust.\nA wind made of light itself, Orholam’s breath, streamed across what\nonce was Kip and scattered him. Scattered to every corner of the Seven\nSatrapies, beyond. Scattered him from the present and into the past. Blew\nhim out of time, as Orholam was out of time.\nShe was becoming a wight, as all the luxiats had warned about for her\nwhole life. She’d broken the halo. She should commit suicide. It was the\nonly option. Else what might she do? The Color Prince was betting she\nwould join him, that she would lose her mind in exactly the way he wanted\nher to. She bit a tiny hole in her tent, letting through one tiny ray of light. If\nshe used the tiny sapphire her Purple Bear Usef had given her, she should—\nZee Oakenshield blinks to clear her eyes. There are enemy armies on\nboth sides of the Great River. She feels a pang at the sight. It isn’t fear.\nRegret. Should have tried harder. Shouldn’t have spit those witticisms in\nDarien Guile’s face. The flush of pleasure at besting one of the smartest\nmen in the world, the laughter of the nobles that day, will be paid for in the\nblood of common men today—"

I wonder, what would you do, if I\ntold you that to prove yourself, you’d have to kill him?”\n“Why don’t you order it, and find out?” Teia asked.\n“Oooh, iron in you. I like.” He smiled that odd, predatory smile where\nhe seemed to be trying to show all of his perfect teeth at once. “You have\nsomething for me?”\nTeia threw him the cloak, and handed him the climbing crescents, too.\n“Dropped one crescent,” she said. “Had to get out of the White’s\napartments fast.

It was a dispassionate violation, like being\nstripped naked by a man who preferred boys. It made it better, but not by\nmuch. He started with her scalp, jamming fingers through her hair roughly.\nIf she’d spent any time on her hair, she’d be furious, but Archers were too\npractical for elaborate hairstyles on any but feast days.\n“Can’t you do this with paryl?” Teia asked.\n“Not foolproof, as I’m sure you know.”\nShe did? Actually, she didn’t. Holy—\nMurder Sharp had just jabbed two fingers hard into her groin. In the\nfront side, and the back side. She was so surprised, so violated, that she\ndidn’t even do anything. And then it was over.\n“When I was in Ha—” Murder Sharp stopped. “When I was in prison,\nyou’d be amazed what people would put… where. Puffing haze that smells\nlike… midden? Could never make myself so desperate. Not even to fit in.\nThis one Tyrean hid knives up… well. They searched him rough, cut him all\nup inside. He didn’t live, but for the longest time, he was the… butt of our\njokes.”\nHilarious.\nHe released her and unrolled the cloak, far enough to check the fox sigil.\n“Just the one? Gebalyn’s burnt cloak?”\n“It was the only one there.”\n“Was it?”\n“Yes. But I have to wonder why you’d send me on such a job. Was it to\nsee how dumb I was? If I’d found both cloaks, would you have expected me\nto bring them to you? Why would I possibly make myself less valuable to\nyou, you who so casually kill?”\nA brief troubled look crossed Murder Sharp’s face. He really hadn’t\nthought it through. The question was, had whoever had given the orders?\n“Was this a test to see how smart I am?” she asked.\nA frown on that perpetually grinning face. “Perhaps it was. Regardless,\nwell done. You brought us a shimmercloak, and that’s better service than\nmany in the Order of the Broken Eye have done in a century. Even if it was\nhanded to you.”\nFor one moment, Teia’s heart stopped. He knew the White had helped!\nThen she realized Master Sharp meant that he had helped her so much\nthat the job was simple.\n“It was windy out there,” Teia said, just to say something.\n“Never liked heights much myself. But then, that’s why they pay us,\nisn’t it?” He folded the purloined cloak up with rapid motions.\n“You’re going to pay me?” Teia asked.\n“Of course not, how would you explain where you’d gotten the money?\nBut I do get paid on your behalf, and for that, thank you. Two cloaks would\nhave been better.” He looked at the cloak again. “I would let you keep this\nif I could,” he said. “I suspect it’s gonna get bloody here.

When I couldn’t respond?\nAnd how would I have responded, had he not been here?\nThe exact same way, probably.\nWhat was it about Kip that petrified her? When they trained, he was her\npartner, and it was easy. Everything flowed smoothly and easily, like they\nwere left and right hands, working together. He trusted her so implicitly that\nshe trusted herself more when he was around. He made her feel better about\nherself.\nWhat was scary about that?\nAnd how could this be a surprise? When he’d given her that hug that\nwasn’t just a hug, the alarm bells should have been ringing. She should\nhave acted then. If she simply wanted to be his partner, or his friend, she\nshould have said something afterward. Something clear, without being\nunduly embarrassing. Stringing it out was a cruelty of kindness. A friend\ndidn’t do that.\nNo, she’d wanted to bask in that little extra attention, but she’d wanted\nto freeze it there. She wanted no expectations of her, only his adoration.\nThat sounds like a great relationship. For me.\nWhy then did she feel that virulent rage shoot through her at the very\nthought of Tisis Malargos?\nSeems like a bit of an overreaction, huh?\nShe knew where he’d be now. He’d be trying to knock the sawdust out\nof that heavy bag. Boys, so uncomplicated.\nOne of these days, she was going to have to tell him that Ben-hadad had\nsecretly been repairing that one stitch since he’d noticed Kip trying to\nknock it open. Ben-hadad’s father had been a tailor, and Ben-hadad had left\nthat one stitch hanging loose on purpose, while tripling the bag’s strength at\nthat seam.\nThe prank gave all the squad a little smirk every time they saw Kip\nmercilessly pounding that bag.\nFunny to frustrate the Guile who’d had everything in life handed to him.\nSuddenly, that prank seemed impossibly petty and cruel.\nNo, now was probably not the time to tell him about the seam.\nShe looked at the door. She should go now, before Kip did something\nstupid.\nWhy do I have to be the adult?\nYou think you are being the adult, between you and Kip?\nOrholam damn it, I nearly fell off the side of the Prism’s Tower half an\nhour ago. I am not going to be afraid of talking to a boy.\nShe grabbed the door handle. Dropped it.\nFine, I’ll be afraid. It’s a different kind of fear altogether. But I’m not\nstopping.\nShe huffed. It felt empowering. Stupid boy.\nShe threw the door open and, glowering storms at everyone who crossed\nher path, made her way to the lift. It stopped down a few floors. Payam"

She rolled him onto his\nback, and for a moment, she had hope.\nIn his open eyes, colors were swirling: in Kip, every color of luxin was\nalive.\nBut Kip wasn’t.\nThere was no reaction in those eyes, just a palette of colors swirling\ndown an eternal drain, disappearing, disappearing.\n“Kip! Wake up! Kip, come back! Breaker!”\nShe shook him, but there was no response.\nThe cards were stuck to him like leeches, holding on. She began tearing\nthem off his skin. They were poison.

He stood up—that\nwas good. Good that he could move, right?—and found that he was in a\nlibrary.\nNo, maybe not a library, more like the Library. Shelves of a curious,\nluminous red wood marched in lines to the horizon. Leagues of shelves,\neach five or six times the height of a man. Kip’s eyes traced the lines of a\nnearby shelf loaded with the new pressed books up, and up. There were\nladders on rollers to reach the higher shelves, but there was no ceiling. The\nnight sky itself gleamed high above, undistorted, stars unwinking, clearer\nthan Kip had ever seen them.\nKip was no astrologer, but he didn’t see a single constellation that he\nrecognized. A sudden sense of vertigo swept him, as if he were going to go\nflying off the ground and out into that void. He slammed his eyes down to\nthe shelves again.\nAtasifusta. That was the wood. The wood that burned forever. Except\nhere, it was merely burnished to such a high sheen that it provided warm\nambient light for the whole library. Neat trick. Kip took a step forward and\nlooked down an aisle to see how wide it was.\nThere was no end.\nHe stepped back to his spot, as if to find safety.\nHe took a deep breath. Wait, was that the first breath he’d taken since\nhe’d been here? Did he have to breathe, being dead and all? Oh, he was\nbreathing. Odd that he wasn’t scared. Confused, certainly. Curious, of\ncourse. But not a crumb of cowardice.\nMaybe one crumb.\nIs a crumb the unit of measure for cowardice?\nHe tried stepping into the aisle again. Ah, it wasn’t endless, it was\nmerely so wide that it seemed so. Somewhere in an oceanic distance he\ncould see something that had to be a wall, and to the other side, the same.\nLooking so far and being made aware of the expanse inspired vertigo again.\nKip turned instead to look at what was near at hand.\nA flurry of activity burst forth, the moment of creation appearing to only\nbegin because he was there to observe it, the shelves near at hand filling"

The past might be finite, but it went farther back\nthan he could see, and the past was deeper than the future.\nI die and go to a library? Sure, it could be worse, but I’ve spent a lot of\ntime in libraries this year. Quite enough time, really. Do I have to stay\nforever? Where do I go pee?\nI suppose the dead don’t pee."

He landed with a sound like a rockslide, right in front of\nKip. Somehow, his landing gave the impression that he’d been falling\nforever, and that the landing wasn’t even a strain on his knees. Sort of like\nCruxer landing a jump. Even if Kip had lived to train in the Blackguard for\na hundred years, he was pretty certain making a landing look light and easy\nwas a skill he never would have mastered.\nThe man stood gracefully, fixed the cuffs of a shirt under a three-\nbuttoned black jacket of a cut and shiny fabric Kip had never seen. Over the\njacket, he wore a leather greatcoat, black on the outside, white on the inside,\nslim cut and hanging down to his pointed-toe leather boots. He took off a\nbrimmed hat similar to a petasos and shook back a cascade of platinum-\nwhite hair that didn’t quite touch his collar. His features were paler than\nanyone Kip had ever seen, exotic, unearthly, perfect. He smiled, a genuine\nsmile that touched his mirrored iridescent eyes, and his teeth were not quite\nwhite, but instead pearlescent, and the bit of dogtooth that Kip saw in that\nsmile seemed longer and sharper than usual.\nThis man was not, Kip decided, a man. A shiver of fear ran down his\nspine, despite the man’s apparent friendliness and beauty, but then Kip\nthought, I’m already dead. What’s he gonna do to me?\nGood thing fear is rational. Good thing you can talk yourself right out of\nit.\n“Hail, Godslayer,” the stranger said. With his pretty face and sharp beard\nand immaculate coiffure, Kip had expected a tenor, but instead the voice\nemanating from this being was a bass—crisp, perfectly enunciated, not\ngravelly or an indistinct rumble, but a bass that sounded too big to be\ncoming from this man-sized creature.\n“Hail, scary guy who fell out of the sky.”\nThe stranger’s eye twitched as if with irritation. He smiled to cover it\ninstantly, but not before a ragged crack shot from the corner of his eye\nwhere he’d twitched to his ear. It filled in as fast as it appeared, and left the\nsmile alone on his face. “Hail, Godslayer,” he said again, as if being very\npatient.\n“Hail… sir.” Puzzled. It was as if Kip was playing a game, and no one\nhad told him the stakes, let alone the rules. It had happened enough in the\nlast year that Kip should have been getting used to it. But this wasn’t the\nkind of thing you get used to. The man filled Kip with a quiet, nameless\ndread.\nAlready dead, can’t do anything to me. Oh, look at that. There may not\nbe peeing in the afterlife, but it turns out that the strong desire to pee is\nindeed possible.\nWhich, in itself, was kind of terrifying."

It wasn’t quite the attitude for a handshake or a wrist clasp,\nand Kip looked at it warily. Falling from the silent sky, something slapped\ninto the man’s open hand. A polished black wood cane.\n“You’ll excuse me the use of a cane, I hope,” the man said with a sound\nlike great gears grinding. He stepped forward, and Kip could see that the\nman’s ankles were broken, poorly mended. Perhaps that was the reason for\nthe stiff leather boots. “Under what name have you come here?”\nKip looked to the left and right. “Uh, is this a trick question?”\nThe man settled into place perhaps ten feet away from Kip, an odd\ndistance for interlocutors. He put his cane centered before him and leaned\non it with both hands like a three-legged stool. He waited.\n“I am whatever I am. I mean, I am what I ever am. Kip. Kip,” Kip said.\n“Is there a privy here?”\n“Kip? Kip. Not your birth name, is it? Kip, so puny, so insignificant.\nBarely worth three little letters. ‘Don’t look at me,’ it screams. ‘I’m just a\nbastard.’ Kip Delauria. Kip Guile. Lard Guile. Breaker. Godslayer. Perhaps\nDiakoptês? If you’re going to start collecting names in other languages and\nreligions, this is really going to get tedious. But what are you under the\nnames? Under your cloak of names, who are you?”\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n“I was known as a bit of a wearer of masks myself, you know. They\ncalled me… well, why ruin it? It became one of the first Black Cards,\nforbidden, for those who viewed it lost their minds. That, little Guile, from\nthe tiny fraction of my power that can fit inside a card. You’re dying, right\nnow. Oh, no worries, time is different here. We have all the time out of the\nworld to talk, but your body is dying. I can save you.”\n“Well, that solves that,” Kip said. “Here I didn’t know if you were a hero\nor a villain. Villain.”\n“Really? It’s so easy for you?” the immortal asked.\n“Not complicated,” Kip said. A million million books, and not one place\nto pee. “There’s a time for ratiocination, and a time for gut feelings. Gut\nwins, this time.” Ratiocination? Where did I even hear that word? Too much\ntime in the restricted library.\n“And if head and heart are equal, with which facility do you decide\nwhether to follow the one or the other?” The creature smiled. He leaned on\nthe cane with his left hand and propped his right hand on his hip. The move\npushed back his long leather coat and revealed a pistol hanging in a special\nholster made for it at his right hip. It was actually kind of brilliant.

This design would\nmake it far easier to draw quickly. It even had a tie at the bottom to keep the\nholster tight against the leg, so it wouldn’t flop around. Its wearer could\nalways be certain of the position of his pistol. Kip would have to remember\nthat.\nKip said, “You come across a dying man, and it’s in your power to help\nhim—and you don’t. That’s villain behavior.”\nAmused. Only a too-small ring of black pupil interrupted the eerie\nmirrored perfection of his eyes and showed where he was looking. “Ah, but\nyou’re not dead yet. So perhaps you’re too hasty to judge me.”\nKip scowled. He had the distinct impression that the longer he listened\nto this man—Man? God? Something in between?—the more convinced\nhe’d be. In that way, Kip’s tutelage under Gavin Guile was invaluable.\nGavin tended to do the same thing.\n“So I haven’t saved you. Yet. But neither has my enemy, now, has he?”\nEnemy? “Who are you?” Kip asked. There was something odd about the\nleather of that long coat. Dual-layered, supple, yet so thin.\n“Of course, he can’t save you. He doesn’t see. He doesn’t care. He\ndoesn’t know. He doesn’t save. He is dead, and this world is ours.”\n“Who are you?” Kip whispered. That was what it was about that coat. It\nwas the pale white of the Angari on the inside, and that black was Parian\nblack. Orholam have mercy, it was made of human skin.\n“I am the Bearer of Fire; I am the Opener of Eyes; I have been called a\ngod and a beast; I have been called angel and demon, and Slave of the Holy,\nand Breaker of Chains. I have been called jinn and monster and man. Those\nwho hate me have called me Defiler, Seducer, Corrupter—and Master, and\nKing. Wanderer, Outcast, Kinless, Unclean. I am the Right Hand of\nDarkness, the Voice of the Grave. I have slain kings and gods. I have come\nto bring true worship to the Seven Satrapies, to destroy what has been\nerringly wrought by human hands. The luxiats have shrouded my coming in\ndarkness, but some things cannot be hidden forever. You know who I am.”\nKip’s metaphysical heart came into perfect synchronicity with his\nphysical heart, and stopped. No.\n“Say it.”\n“You… you’re the Lightbringer.”\n“I am.” The Lightbringer rolled his neck, and then his shoulders, and\ngiant, glorious white wings unfurled from his back with a crack, emerging\nfrom long slits cut in the coat. His shirt tore, revealing a torso so white and\nflawless it could have been carved of living marble. He was larger than life,\nand more beautiful than any woman. It was more than simple beauty. It was\nraw presence, as if you magnified the melancholic yearning and pain of a\nperfect sunset a thousand times and stirred it with an animal lust to take and"

This\nis why man sees only his slim slice of the spectrum. To see more would be\nto be blinded. To see that for which his mind is not made was to be struck\ndumb.\nKip dropped to his knees, fell prostrate. He couldn’t help it. Had no\nstrength. No will.\nHis hands slapped in the dust, in a position of worship, barely keeping\nhis face from smacking the golden floor. The dust—dust? here? in this\nimmaculate library?—swirled up in clouds into his open eyes before he\ncould blink. In seconds, he was streaming tears, his tears turning humble\ndust to mud. The mud burned his eyes, but it wasn’t the burning of getting a\nspeck in your eye, it was the burning of a muscle fatigued, a muscle\ngrowing stronger. The burning faded to tingling.\nHe looked up—and through, his eyes made new, silently made strong.\nBeneath a façade of glory—a cloak of light—the wings were rotten; a\nstench of decaying flesh swept out in a putrid cloud; the skin was blackened\nand curling, split from flames, and something else, something utterly\ninhuman was beneath—all quickly covered. The immortal bared his fangs\nat the sky, and snarled in a language that Kip’s ears couldn’t parse into\nsyllables, nor his tongue ever hope to form. Here was an angel of light\nindeed, for light can also be used to dazzle, to blind, to misdirect and\ndeceive. Here was light bent to illusions and lies.\nThe masks slammed back in place, and the immortal said, “I am\nAbaddon, the King, one of the Two Hundred who marched out of the\nTyrant’s palaces and went to make our own way in this wilderness, and a\nthousand worlds like it. I am a lover of queens and a father of gods. I am the\nDay Star, ushered from the heavens in glory.”\nStand.\nKip couldn’t tell if the voice came from within his head or outside of it,\nbut his stubbornness agreed it was a good idea. He found strength, a little\nanyway, and stood slowly. “Marched out? Or were thrown out? So out of\ntwo hundred failures, I only rate you? What’s the fat son of a whore got to\ndo to get some respect?”\nThe immortal laughed. “Save yourself, Kip. He won’t. Though if you\ndo, He’ll take credit. Like always, sapping the achievements of the good\nand the great, making you doubt your own worth. If you’re strong enough\nto save yourself today, I’ll be back. When you’re ready. I have eternity. You\nhave… minutes, or fifteen years, or seventy years at the most. It’s all the\nsame to me. I will come again, in your hour of need, when your own\nstrength fails. If you live so long.”\nFor some reason, that seemed a little more menacing than, ‘Fare thee"

If you live so long.”\nFor some reason, that seemed a little more menacing than, ‘Fare thee\nwell, see thee anon!’ Kip cleared his throat. “Not sure I’m understanding. If\nI live so long?”\n“You man. Why do you think you’re here, in the Great Library where all\nthe knowledge of your race’s five ages is stored?”\nI’ve kind of been wondering that.\nAbaddon seemed incredulous that Kip still didn’t get it, even with what\nhe seemed to think was a generous hint. He shook his head. “Know this, O\nKip. Your being here involves a compromise. Your mind is not structured to\nunderstand timelessness. So instead of being outside of time, you are\ninstead carrying around with you a bubble of causality.”\n“Hammerfist centaur granite,” Kip said gravely.\nAncient eyes wrinkled, irritated. “What?”\n“I was, uh, trying to demonstrate how I could understand each of the\nthree words in a three-word phrase and still have no clue what they mean\ntogether.” Kip grinned weakly.\nMonster eyes flashed, and something seemed terribly wrong with that\nmouth as it spoke: “This library is outside of time, but your mind isn’t made\nto understand timelessness. So while you’re here, cause precedes effect.\nWhich means you’re not fully removed from time. Your body is dying right\nnow. You’re not breathing. Your heart has stopped. If you could go back\nnow, you’d be yourself when you arrived. If you don’t get back soon, you’ll\nbe alive, but a simpleton, perhaps with no control of your limbs, or your\nbowels, perhaps too gone to even care. You wait a few seconds more back\nin time, and you’ll simply be dead.”\nOh.\nOh, shit!\n“You think I’m being awfully helpful for a villain, don’t you?”\nActually, Kip hadn’t gotten that far yet. He was still a little hung up on\nthe bubble of causality part. But now that he mentioned it…\nAbaddon folded his wings. They slipped easily back into slits in the\nsides of his human-leather coat. There was something about the greatcoat\nthat drew the eye, more than simply its repulsive materials. It shimmered.\nEverything about this godling breathed extravagance, from the delicate\nivory lace at his cuffs to the subtle blue silk pinstriping in his straight-\nlegged trousers. He assumed his posture again, left hand on cane, right hand\non hip. He noticed Kip’s glance fall to his pistol.\n“There are rules here,” Abaddon said. “These very clothes come from\nhundreds of years in your future. It’s forbidden that I show a mortal things\nfrom after his time. Never was much for rules.”\n“What are you?” Kip asked instead.\n“In this form? A lone wanderer, an icon, a card from a deck not yet\npainted. Your descendants, like you, will believe that every excellence is\npraiseworthy. This figure is good at killing. Nothing more. Killing and\nmoving on, with impunity, as if above their petty laws, as if a god. And how\nthey will worship it. Indeed, they would worship you, O… Kip,” he said,"

Indeed, they would worship you, O… Kip,” he said,\nthe word like a popping bubble, as if he were delighted by the\ninsubstantiality of it. “By this time you’ve already killed a god and a king\nand fought a sea demon at the very walls of—oh, my, no, not that, not yet.”\nHe smiled, and Kip thought that was a trap, a little false prophecy that\nwould probably get him killed. If he made it that far.\n“You want to see it?” In a move faster than human thought, the pistol\nwas in Abaddon’s hand. “I made it with my own hands, sacrificing precious\ndays out of eternity to Make. It has been long and long since I have done\nsuch, and it will be millennia, I think, before I do so again. I named her\nComfort. Do you think that your chromaturgy is magic? What is the most\nirritating thing about a pistol?”\nThis wasn’t right. There was more going on here than Kip could grasp.\n“I don’t know. The inaccuracy. The black powder blinding and burning you\nafter you fire.”\n“I fixed those, too, but think bigger.”\nKip was fascinated, but this… this was a smokescreen, just like the\nblack powder. “I don’t care,” he lied. “Why are you doing this?”\n“Reloading. Reloading is the most irritating part of a pistol. Some two\nhundred years hence, they discover a reliable rotating cylinder to give\nmultiple shots before reloading is necessary. I copied the form so as to not\nstand out, but this pistol… no reloading. Ever. Reloads itself. That, that is\nmagic. Do you want to know how I did it? I came perilously close to\nviolating the basic laws of the universe to do so. A magic engine, within an\ninanimate object?”\n“So you infused an object with Will, so what?” This was all a trap, but\nKip couldn’t see what the trap was. And what the hell was an engine? He’d\nheard of siege engines, of course, but Abaddon was using the word as if it\nmeant something else.\n“It’s one thing to infuse an arrow’s feathers to seek a target that you lock\nin your mind. It’s something altogether different to make an item that uses\nmagic itself. It is an act of creation, one might say.”\nKip ignored the answer, searching, searching. If he made it out of this,\nhe could remember this conversation and comb through it to find out what\nmattered. But right now, he had to cast about, find the teeth of the trap.\n“What did you mean, precious days of your eternity? If you’re outside of\ntime, what does it matter how long you spend?”\n“Even as there are compromises when your kind comes here, carrying\nwith you cause and effect in rigid order, so too are there compromises when\nmy kind goes to your lands. Even I. We’re immortal, not omnipresent.”\nSuddenly Kip wished he hadn’t skipped his theology lectures so often.\n‘Attributes of Orholam’ had seemed a little outside of what would be useful\nin his life. If only he’d known. “I don’t follow,” he said."

If only he’d known. “I don’t follow,” he said.\n“We can enter your time at any point and place we wish.”\n“But you can’t be two places or more at the same time.”\n“So your mortal mind can slowly churn out the obvious.”\nKip suddenly got it. “So if you spent two weeks in the Angari\narchipelago this year, crafting your pistol, you couldn’t leave and come\nback to that same two weeks ever again. You could leave and come back to\nsome other place, either before or after, but you couldn’t inhabit the same\ntime. You have all eternity to visit as you please, but you can only visit it\nonce. That’s why you call them your ‘precious days of eternity.’ Eternity is\nlimitless, but our time is finite, and so, when you visit here, your time is\nfinite, too. Which means if you go to the wrong place at a certain time, you\ncan never fix what you did there. It means you can be fooled!” Kip laughed,\ndelighted. “That has to be a burr under the blanket, huh? All eternity to visit\nexcept for the bits where you need to go. You made a pistol, but you have to\nfear forever that those very two weeks you spent in our time were the two\nweeks you needed to be somewhere else. Ha ha ha!”\nA quick flash of rage rippled over that mask of a face, disturbing and\ncracking it, and filling in immediately, as before, but not before Kip saw\nsomething beneath it, green and black, the mouth all wrong, the eyes huge\nand alien.\n“So the fly taunts the spider about problems too late to fix? From my\nvery web?”\nOh, no. And there it was. The teeth of the trap.\nAbaddon said, “Truth is, the longer you stand here and listen to me, the\ncloser to death you are. Truth is, you’re dead already. You’re—”\n“Truth is, you’re still talking, which means lying, which means I’m still\na threat. Somehow. That must irk you. Me. Little fat Kip of Rekton. A\nthreat.” Kip chuckled involuntarily. Such a silly thought, and yet, why else\nwould he even be worth the attention of such a being? But that was beside\nthe point now, a distraction. Don’t pat yourself on the back while there’s a\ndagger in it.\nKip turned away, to where the invisible hands were writing, drawing,\netching, hammering. That was the crux, that was the present, that was where\nthe answer lay.\nA short inhuman roar, the size of the creature that the man disguised,\nsounded. Abaddon did not like being dismissed.\nKip flinched, and out of body, out of time, and all that he might be, he\nwas still surprised he didn’t wet himself at the noise. But he didn’t turn. If\nthat thing wanted to kill him, if it was allowed to do so by whatever murky\nrules governed this place, there was clearly nothing Kip could do to stop it.\n“Know this, Diakoptês, I may not be allowed to kill you here, but my"

I’m thinking.” Oh Ramir, I never thought I would have a reason\nto thank you for anything, but for this I thank you, you small-souled, small-\nhearted, small-town tough: I know how to needle a bully when he can’t get\nto me. For that, thank you.\nNow, why am I in the Great Library?\nIt’s the repository of all knowledge. So what does that—\nKip looked at the invisible hands again. They were drawing glyphs right\nnow. Pictures as words. Pictures as knowledge. Knowledge in every\nlanguage, in every medium.\nPerhaps even the knowledge in cards. Perhaps even the knowledge in\ncards inside careless young fools.\nI’m here because this place is the repository of all knowledge, and I’m\nhere until I get all this knowledge out.\nKip looked down at himself for the first time. He was absolutely covered\nin tattoos. On every exposed bit of skin, every place a card had stuck to\nhim, it had left its image. Perhaps they’d left more than their image, perhaps\nthey’d left their essence. It didn’t fully make sense to him. Why hadn’t the\ncards come here the moment of their creation? But maybe he was asking a\ntime-bound question—time that he was running out of.\nHe turned over his left wrist.\nGunner.\nThe crazed Ilytian was wearing a waistcoat, open over a naked torso,\nsailor’s loose pants, no shoes, and a huge grin. He was seated on a smoking\ncannon like he was riding it. It was bigger than any cannon Kip had ever\nseen. Gunner also had a blunderbuss in his left hand and a pistol with\nmultiple long barrels in his right hand. Like the first time Kip had seen him,\nthe man had woven burning slow matches into his long unruly hair and\nbeard and into his waistcoat to make himself look like he had come striding\nout of hell. Gunner? I’ve got to go be Gunner?\nFine, Gunner, let’s dance.\nKip bunched his fingers in the familiar pattern to touch the five jewels:\none at each corner, and the middle finger at the middle top. One at a time,\nhe pressed them onto the tattoo of Gunner, fully expecting nothing to happ\n—\n~Gunner~\nTap. Superviolet and blue. As his thumb touched, it was like someone had\nblown out a candle. The world went dark. Eyes useless. But then, a moment\nlater, there was sun, waves washing over him, blinking, bobbing. Seeing his\nperspective shift while he felt his body utterly motionless made him queasy.\nTap. Green solved that in a rush of embodiment, touch restored. He was\nswimming. A strong body, wiry, naked to the waist. The water is warm,\nstrewn with flotsam.\nTap. Yellow. Hearing restored, the shouts of men calling to each other,\nothers screaming in pain or terror.

Dodged all his cannon shots.\nEven when Gunner finally started shooting both at once. That little boat the\nPrism made moved at speeds he wouldn’t have believed if he’d heard\nanother telling the tale. Ceres is going to take this out on him. Damn Gavin\nGuile.\nBut this mind skips around. There’s something—\nTap. Orange. The smell of the sea and smoke and discharged powder,\nand he can sense the other men floating in the water, and below them,\naround them—Oh, by the hells. Sharks. Lots of sharks.\nHis finger is already descending. Tap. Red-and-sub-red-and-the-taste-of-\nblood-in-his-mouth-and-it’s-too—\nThe trick with sharks is the nose. Not so different from a man. You\nbloody a bully’s nose, and he goes looking elsewhere right quick. Easy,\nright? Easy.\nGunner ain’t no easy meat. The sea’s my mirror. Fickle as me. Crazy as\nme. Deep currents, and monsters rise from her depths, too. What others call\nsea spray, I call her spitting in my face, friendly like—\nKip tore his hand away as soon as it touched all the points—instantly—\nbut that instant was minutes long in the card. He’d not left until he’d—until\nGunner had killed a shipmate named Conner, who had the oars. Kip had\njust seen Gunner make himself a captain and get his first crew. The\nbenighted madman.\nFinding himself back in the Great Library, Kip looked down at his wrist.\nThe tattoo was faded, but not gone. Right in front of him, a hand had drawn\nhalf of the card, hanging in midair. And now it stopped.\nHe had to go back into the same one. There was something important\nabout Gunner. He had to find the right time. He had no idea what he was\ndoing, but he had to learn.\nKip’s fingers descended into a raid on an Angari ship, the murder of\nmen, the lopping of limbs, and a little singsong, ‘Rinky, sinky, dinky, do.’\nHe pulled his hand off again, unable to bear it.\nAnd the tattoo still wasn’t gone.\nTwice more he submerged himself into that ill-fitting skin, and emerged,\ngasping, weeping. But the card before him was being drawn, and split: one\ncopy flew to his hand, and one went winging to a shelf.\nTime out of joint, Kip stares at his wrist. The Gunner tattoo is\ndisappearing even as the hands finish drawing the card. But then his tattoos\nmove, shift, rearrange themselves, and there on his wrist sits Samila Sayeh,\nthe heroine from the Prisms’ War.\n“You’ll never make it,” Abaddon said. For some reason, his coat was\ngone, but he had a cloak of the same black and white leather spread in his\nhands. “Even if you could live every card in turn. Even if any human could"

There was no giving up.\n“Samila, let’s dance.” His hand came down.\nBut it didn’t end with Samila. It didn’t end with Helane Troas. It didn’t\nend with Viv Grayskin. It didn’t end with Aheyyad Brightwater or Usem the\nWild or Halo Breaker or the Fallen Prophet or Pleiad Poros or the Novist or\nOrlov Kunar or New Green Wight or Heresy.\nHe was dimly aware that after he finished each tattoo each card flew off\ninto the library, and at least once he saw Abaddon sweep the cloak out like a\nnet, trying to catch a card before it disappeared, but each card seemed to fly\nright through it, barely slowed. It was one too many things to worry about.\nKip went into card after card, sands running out.\nEvery time, when he felt for whatever reason that he’d seen enough, he\nremoved his hand. He barely had any awareness of himself, none, perhaps,\nuntil the moment came to take his hand away. Nor was there any processing\nof the memories. He had no idea who the majority of these people and\nthings were; he didn’t even connect Vox from the Shimmercloak card and\nfrom Janus Borig’s home until his hand was descending onto the next\ntattoo.\nThe integration of Kip to card was complete, but the disintegration that\nfollowed was ever incomplete: it wasn’t merely a melding of mind to mind,\nit was union. Spiritual. Emotional. And definitely physical. When he came\nback from a man who’d lost an arm, he felt the pain, not just after that card\nto be blotted out by the next card, but after that next card, too. The list of\ninjuries piled up, and even without them, he was seeing men and women at\nthe pivotal crises of their lives: terror was the norm, physical battle\ncommon, hatred and cowardice and heroism all piled together.\nAt first, he regathered his wits each time, reminded himself who he was,\nwiped away what blood he could from his bleeding nose, took a breath, then\ntapped the next. Then he merely took a breath, glaring at Abaddon, feeling\nwetness trickling from his ears. He died a hero’s death. He betrayed his\nclosest friends. He took his own life, screaming a spray of teeth as he fired\nthe blunderbuss pointed at his chin.\nHe found himself on his knees, weeping, blood and tears covering his\nwrist. But he didn’t stop. He wiped his forehead with an arm, giving himself\na single breath. His forearm came away bloody. He was sweating blood.\nThat couldn’t be good.\n“No,” Abaddon said, dismayed.\nHand down. The Technologist. What the hell? This was Ben-hadad. He\nwas some kind of genius. Never would have guessed.\n“I—”\nHand down. The Commander.

The agony sang inside him and found company in the agony he\nleft—lopping off hands and feet and leaving men to bleed, gut-wounding\nothers, slashing off jaws, eviscerating, crushing faces, and killing, killing,\nkilling. His palace became his charnel house. He returned to the maimed\nand sometimes found their women comforting them, and he killed their\nwomen before them, that their agony might pitch higher before they knew\nthe release of death.\nAnd it was not enough. The rage ran hot, the rage ran cold, the rage ran\nout, and still he was killing when the sun rose. And the sun showed that he\nhad not only killed enemies. His own slaves lay dead among their new\nmasters, the Tiru. He had no recollection of killing them, aside from some\nhalf-remembered screams, but the wounds matched the wounds he’d left in\nfive hundred others.\nHe staggers back to the upper court where his wife lies dead, almost\nunrecognizable from the beatings, raped to death by the invaders. He goes\nthere to end it.\nHe drops the double swords from gory hands. Pulls her into his arms as\nthe sun rises. Smears the blood away from her broken, battered face.\nRearranges her bloody torn dress into some pathetic semblance of decency.\nHolds her in his arms, draws his dagger.\nThis woman has a mole on her neck.\nThis woman isn’t Tazerwalt. This isn’t his wife. This is her handmaid,\nHada, dressed in her lady’s garments."

This is her handmaid,\nHada, dressed in her lady’s garments.\nHe stands, trembling, an image flashing through his head, a slave girl\nrushing him. A horrid intuition. A sickness unto death. A stone in his gullet.\nHe finds the room. Tazerwalt. His wife, disguised as a slave. She’d been\nalive, unharmed by the Tiru attackers, hidden, until he’d come. A slave girl\nhad rushed him. A slave girl, loyal to the Tiru, surely. Thinking it an attack,\nhe’d slashed her neck as she threw herself at him, and he’d moved on,\nheedless.\nHer eyes are open, questioning, and dead. So very dead.\nHe falls to his knees, screaming. Mind tearing, separating from himself.\nHe sees a man, caked in blood, screaming. His screams sound no different\nthan any of a hundred others he’s heard all night. His throat is tearing,\nunable to contain the force of his suffering.\nKip lifted his hand, convulsing. For some reason, his whole body was in\npain, as if all his muscles had cramped at once. He fell over, blinded, unable\nto breathe. The wave passed, leaving him gasping. He blinked his suddenly\nclouded eyes clear. Wiped at them. Looked at red fingers. Touched his\nforehead. No, no wounds to his scalp or forehead. He was bleeding from his\neyes.\nThat, Ferkudi would say, was a real flesh protuberance.\n“You’re too late. You’re dying,” Abaddon said, sweeping the cloak back\nup onto his shoulders. “All this suffering for nothing.”\nA sound escaped Kip’s lips, and for all the times he’d hated his body for\nits petty betrayals and awkwardness, this time, it did him proud: the sound\nwas far more growl than moan. Emboldened by his own flimsy façade of\ndefiance, Kip rolled to his knees.\n“You’re wrong,” he said, voice raspy, breath short. “See, I have a gift.”\n“A few.”\n“No, just the one.”\n“Pray tell.”\n“I’m fat. So I’m out of breath. Maybe dying. Hell, I’ve felt worse\nclimbing a flight of stairs.” I’m fat, he didn’t have the breath to say, but\nwhen everything’s hard for you, something being hard isn’t much deterrent\nto doing it anyway. I’m fat, and there’s only one person in this room who\ngets to make jokes about me.\nBut Abaddon was grinning. “You’ve already lost, Lard Guile. This\nwasn’t me visiting you in the Great Library. This was a raid. Your coming\nhere broke open a gap in our enemies’ defenses. You’re so predictable. By\nstalling you, I made you hurry. I could never have found all the new cards\nmyself. You brought them to me.” He spread the cloak open, and on the\nwhite inside, Kip saw images, like tattoos, of every single card. They hadn’t\nescaped Abaddon—he’d somehow copied them all.\nKip had no idea what it meant, but something Corvan had said once"

They hadn’t\nescaped Abaddon—he’d somehow copied them all.\nKip had no idea what it meant, but something Corvan had said once\nmade him react instinctively: ‘If your enemy wants it, deny it.’\nAndross Guile, you asshole, tell me that I’ve got something of you in\nme. Your every victory, your every taunt, every time you turned a loss into a\nvictory of another sort and soured the wine of winning to gall in my very\nmouth. Speak, O blood of Guile. Sing in me of the rage of the man skilled\nin all ways of contending. Sing of the blood of a beast and a god—\nBlood.\nKip scrapes the blood from his wrist, feeling lightheaded. Only two\nimages remain. He laughs, for the final two tattoos are the Lightbringer and\nthe Turtle-Bear. But these two sit side by side in his wrist.\nA choice. Kip has no doubt of it. There is only time to touch one. The\nimage of the Lightbringer looks holy, a beam of light from heaven\nilluminating his face, washing out his features so it’s impossible to discern\nthem.\nJanus Borig asked for her brushes when she was dying. Asked for them,\nbecause she knew who the Lightbringer was. Had she started that card and\nnever finished the face?\nNo. This tattoo isn’t unfinished.\nWhat it is, or what it can be, is a trap. A trap for Kip—and now Kip’s\ntrap.\nKip lifts his hand, bunches his fingers, using the periphery of his vision\nto see how Abaddon reacts. Fear that Kip will touch the Lightbringer. Good.\nKip moves.\n“No!” Abaddon shouts. “No!” He twists his cane and a blade flicks out\nfrom its heel. He stabs Kip’s arm in the tattoo of the Lightbringer. Power\narcs through Abaddon’s cane, and the tattoo bursts apart like a popped soap\nbubble. Too easily, as if it had been waiting for it.\nKip flips sideways from the force of the blow, his other hand slapping at\nAbaddon’s face as he falls.\nWhen he looks up, Abaddon looks confused. There’s a hole in the\nillusions hiding his face, his chin and beard plucked off entirely, the rest of\nthe mask shimmering—and dissolving.\nHe is no man under that projected beauty. His head a locust’s head. His\nmouth mandibles, stretching and snapping sideways. His eyes monstrous,\ninhuman. The wings barely protruding from his back are the clacking wings\nof an insect god. And the moment he touches Kip, there’s a change in the air\nof the Great Library. Even Kip, bent and broken, can feel the power\ngathering, a kind of magic beyond mortal ken.\nBy touching Kip, he’s entered Kip’s time, his bubble of causality. And if\nthere’s one thing fat kids understand, after getting beat down into a puddle\nof blubber and humiliation, it’s being overlooked and disregarded.\nBut blubber bounces back.\nShooting a look at something Kip couldn’t see, Abaddon roared, “What"

I am I! I am the Day Star! I am of the firstborn,\nand I. Will. Not. Be Moved!” His turn swept the hem of his cloak toward\nKip, almost brushing him with it.\nIf there’s one thing fat kids understand, it’s momentum.\nWith a roar, Kip leapt onto Abaddon’s back. Every Blackguard lesson\nforgotten, he was an animal, tearing at his prey. He was the fucking turtle-\nbear, ready to take punishment as long as he could give more punishment\nback. His weight nearly knocked Abaddon off his broken ankles, and\nAbaddon barely caught himself on his cane. Screaming, Kip scratched at his\neyes, tore at his neck, and lunged for that precious pistol.\nBut the move was a feint. With only one hand free, Abaddon grabbed on\nto his precious pistol. Instead, Kip tore the cloak off his neck and kicked\noff. Abaddon fell.\nHis masks down, Abaddon was all snarling, shrieking insect. He drew\nthe pistol from its holster smoothly, those great bulbous eyes unreadable.\nAt that moment, something seemed to resound through the entire library,\na great pulse, a great weight settling—and Abaddon was ejected, utterly,\ninstantly. Not physically, for he merely disappeared, but Kip had the very\ndistinct impression that the psychic shock of it had to be tremendous.\nIt was like a child addressing a tidal wave, saying, I will not be moved—\nand before the words are out of his mouth, all is ocean, leaving no sign; not\nonly no sign of the child, but no sign of his defiance, no sign that anything\nopposed the crushing sea in the least, no eddy, no swirl, no detritus, only\nsimple, plain, indisputable nothingness.\nFrom his back, exhausted, immobile, bloody, Kip looked up into those\nyawning foreign constellations. “So you are there,” he said. “Kind of take a\nsubtle approach, don’t you?”\nThe cloak lay shimmering in Kip’s hand. He sat on the ground holding\nit, wondering what would have happened if Abaddon had shot him here. If\nhe was practically dead anyway, what was the difference? Or was that\ncreature lying about the whole dying-out-in-his-real-body thing? Something\nfelt very wrong in Kip’s chest, so he thought not.\n“Subtle? He’s using you.”\nIt was Rea Siluz. She was wearing a green-and-black jalabiya with the\nhood down around her neck, her halo of black hair fairly glowing. But\nperhaps that was just the effect of her smile. Kip thought for a moment\nabout what she’d said, then grinned. “Rea. So, you’re some kind of\nlibrarian?” He stood, with difficulty.\nShe smiled again and shook her head. “Only when… time allows.”\n“You’re what he is… or was, or… something?”\n“I am not nearly what he was, but I am far more than he is. As are you.\nEvil is darkness. Darkness is the broken eye, the ever-blind unseeing."

Darkness is the broken eye, the ever-blind unseeing.\nDarkness is less substantial than smoke, and even a dim mirror is brighter\nthan the void.”\nThat seemed pretty deep, so naturally Kip said, “You’re not as flashy as\nhe was.”\nShe laughed. “Kip, do you know how beautiful you are? You understand\nthings with your heart. There’s a time to revel in and reveal glory earned\nand glory given. But vanity is show. In point of fact, I am quite well-known\nfor my love of spectacle. Which is probably why I was drawn to you.”\n“Me? I’m just a dim mirror. And I, I think I’m dying.” He thought\nsuddenly, if you’re addressing some kind of celestial immortal, and she’s\nactually answering you, you should probably ask some really good\nquestions: like about the cloak he was holding, or heck, if there really was a\nLightbringer, and if so who…\nHe fell over. Too late. He thought that if he got through all the cards,\nthere was supposed to be some way… out? Did he miss it? He tried to open\nhis eyes to look for it. Nothing. Maybe they were open. Ah well. He was\ndead at last, but he didn’t mind.\nChapter 76\nKip was dead.\nTeia staggered to her feet in disbelief. She felt like she’d been\nbludgeoned between the eyes with a brick. She felt like she was standing\nknee deep in the shallows of a mighty river, waters roaring through and past\nher. Kip lay like he’d been cast out of the current, his body sprawled, mind\nbroken, spark extinguished.\nKip is dead.\nIt didn’t look right. Kip, as meat. Without his animating spirit, Kip was a\nbrow hewn from granite, shoulders to shame draft horses, and staring eyes\nof many colors. This was a body; this wasn’t Kip.\nTeia could hear nothing but the cataclysmic wind gusts of her own heart,\npumping, pumping, as if blowing on a forest fire. Kip dead? It was\nimpossible. And it was.\nI didn’t hug him. Why didn’t I hug him? He staggered back from death’s\ndoor, and held me, and I didn’t hold him. I let him down. Why?\nI’m not a slave. I’m not a slave. I tell myself that every day. Why?\nBecause I don’t believe it. And despite all I feel for Kip—for all the\nKips I know him as—I can’t love him if I’m still a slave. He was my\nmaster. If only for a time. If only in word. Kip could think of me any way\nhe wanted to, but it didn’t matter, doesn’t matter, as long as I’m a slave in\nmy own eyes.\nMy lenses are bad. My eyes, broken.\nI hate being a slave, because I hate what it has made me, because it has\nchanged me, and I can’t change back in a day. I can’t say yes to Kip, though\nall my soul longs for it, because I haven’t taken my freedom. Not yet."

Ordered. Always, always\nsubordinate. And a part of me craves that.\nOrholam, what would it be like, to be whole?\nTeia blinked, hating and overcome with disappointment at who she’d\nbecome—and then she felt as if she were standing outside herself. For one\nheartbeat, she saw a vision of herself standing before her, as an adult. Only\na couple years older, maybe, but she looked totally other. She stood tall—\nwell, as tall as her slight frame could manage—but she stood free, there was\njoy in her eyes, pride in her stance, and mischief on her lips. And she was\nbeautiful. Not the beauty of curves and men’s desire, a brighter beauty than\nthat. She was a woman fully herself, a woman who had life, and had it in\nfull.\nAnd then the vision was gone. But Teia knew it was herself as she could\nbe.\nA tear tracked down her cheek.\nI realize this now? Now?!\nKip shall not be dead.\nAgain, Teia seemed to be standing in that great river, nearly sweeping\nher off her feet. She had such a strong, sudden conviction that it was some\ntitanic, immeasurable magic that she widened her eyes to paryl—and saw\nnothing, but she lost not her conviction that it was here, it was true. There\nwas a magic she knew not.\nNot yet.\nKip was dead, his eyes staring blankly into nothing.\nKip is dead; he’s left us all behind. I’ve learned from him, but too late.\nKip shall not be dead.\nHis hand was wet with blood from his torn knuckles.\nLife is in the blood.\nParyl is the master color. Paryl makes us feel all. Barely knowing what\nshe was doing, Teia drafted paryl from her hand to Kip’s blood. She could\nfeel it, and then she plunged the magic into his blood, going after the\nreceding luxin, the receding light, the receding life, like it was a rope\ntrailing out of her reach.\nAs soon as her luxin passed the barrier of Kip’s skin, she gasped. The\nChromeria didn’t even begin to teach Will magics until late in a discipula’s\ntenure because it was so dangerous, so prone to abuse. Kip had willjacked\nan opponent once, though, and it had been described to the Blackguard\nscrubs then. Luxin had no memory, and Will was where the technology of\nchromaturgy met the magic of the thing. Teia couldn’t draft any of the\ncolors Kip had inside him, but with paryl using Will to interact with one\ncolor was the same as using will to interact with any color—so long as the\nluxin was open.\nKip’s entire body was awash in every color of luxin.

She grabbed all\nthe luxin in and around his heart that she could feel. Without any control of\neach of those colors, it was like grabbing a handful of knots rather than\nplucking the appropriate threads.\nShe simply squeezed, hard.\nKip’s entire body jumped in her lap, and she almost lost hold of the\nmagic.\nKip was dead.\nWhat the hell am I doing? Orholam—\nAgain.\nShe did it, tears streaming down her face. His body leapt. It seemed a\ndesecration.\nKip is dead. Dammit, leave him alone. Stop this, stop this!\nAgain.\nShe jerked so hard, she thought she tore something inside herself. This\ntime, after his body leapt, he seemed to melt into her lap. He was dead. He\nwas really dead.\nTeia’s will drained away. All she’d done. It was for nothing. It was just\ndesecrating his corpse. She should be ashamed.\n“Orholam’s balls,” Kip said, pained. He moaned. His eyes flickered\nopen, and focused on Teia after a moment. “Teia!” he said, surprised. “I’m\nhere, right? I mean, I’m now? I mean…” His eyes lost focus for a moment,\nand he blinked, on the brink of passing out.\n“Kip?” she asked. She brushed back his wiry hair. Her whole body felt\nfull of light. Her eyes were full of tears, and the tears made the light streak\nand dance and glow and sing. Kip shall not be dead indeed.\nShe couldn’t stop grinning.\n“Teia, Teia, I have something to say.”\nShe leaned over him. “Yes?” Maybe it was all drafting, the nearly falling\nto her death, the escape from Murder Sharp, the fight with Kip, the saving\nhis life; maybe it was touching all the other luxin, maybe it had worked on\nher even as she’d worked with it, but she felt all warm and soft inside. He\nwas right here. She remembered kissing him, that night after they’d all been\nout drinking. It had been nice.\n“Teia, I have to tell you,” Kip said again.\n“Yes?” She should kiss him now. What was the harm?\n“You’ve got a booger.”\n“Uh-huh, I—what?! What?!”\nKip pulled away and sat up. “Sorry, you were all looming over me, I got\nclaustrophobic.”\n“Looming?” She punched his shoulder, while she fished in a pocket for a\nhandkerchief. “I don’t loom.” She started laughing. She couldn’t help it.\nShe deserved it, didn’t she? After leaving him standing there, hugless. It\nwasn’t like he was retaliating, it was like the universe was. A firm elbow\nfrom Orholam himself. She laughed, hard, maybe a little bit out of her\nmind."

He jumped to his\nfeet, staggering, awkward, but never taking his eyes off her face. An odd\nblack-and-white cloak unfurled from his hand, ignored. He tilted his head,\nstudying her. He blinked, like something else was standing in her shoes.\n“Kip?” she said.\n“T?” he asked.\nNo one called her T. She only called herself that.\n“Kip, are you… are you well?”\n“You’re sheering off in different colors, disappearing. You’re—no, it’s\ngoing.

You ever heard of\nthat?”\nHe’d never heard that term. Not from her. Not from anyone. That was an\nobscure tale.\nShe opened her mouth to lie to him. She heard Karris’s arguments in her\nmind that anyone who knew this secret only put them all in more danger.\nAnd she saw how right Karris had been. Teia hadn’t needed to know\nKarris’s identity. It had been helpful only emotionally—and hurtful in every\nother way possible. And yet still the lie wouldn’t come.\n“It’s what I hope to be,” Teia said. And she realized only as the words\npassed her lips that they were true.\n“Huh?” He was obviously still recovering from the pain in his head.\n“It’s what I’m doing for the White. I’m infiltrating the Order of the\nBroken Eye, Kip. I’ve already stolen a shimmercloak for them. My master\nwas in the room with us, upstairs, when you said.… It’s why I was…\nplaying dumb? I didn’t want him to have anything over me.”\nHe didn’t react. She wasn’t sure he heard her. “Mist Walker,” he\nrepeated. He squinted at her. Then he seemed aware of the cloak in his hand\nagain. She’d never seen it before. To himself, Kip said, “He broke the rules,\nso that meant I could, too. Doesn’t look like leather here, though.”\n“He?”\n“Mist Walker. Fuck.” Kip stared down at his left wrist, where there was\na smudge of color like a tattoo, but fading into his skin. “What the—”\n“Kip, Breaker, what are you—”\nHe winced, his mouth open in a silent cry as if she’d just kicked him in\nthe stones. “Oh, oh, don’t! Don’t call me that. No names. Please. You have\nno idea. Right now…” He blinked.\n“What’s—”\nHe slung the cloak out and around her shoulders.

It was the\nstrangest material she’d ever felt. Shimmery like satin, cool to the touch\nlike brass, light as air and as heavy as responsibility. It had a hood that\nlooked familiar.\nHe stepped back and squinted again. “Damn,” he said. “It’s perfect.” He\nlooked back down at his wrist, and rubbed it, but there was nothing there\nnow.\n“Kip, what is this?” Teia was suddenly afraid.\n“It’s a gift of light. It’s the Night’s Embrace. The Shadow’s Wing.\nPortable Darkness. A crutch until you learn to walk. To mist walk? I don’t…\nit’s all scrambling together.

This is—”\nShe stopped.\nThey both looked at the cloak.\n“Am I hallucinating again?” Kip asked.\nThe cloak had gone red. Red like passion, or a blush. And Teia knew it\nwas red, too. That was no green. It didn’t feel green. Not in the least.\nAnd now it shot through with blue, chased by orange, by pink, by a\nviolet tinge. Each wave started at the neckline and coursed down to the\nhem. Now yellow. Curiosity?\n“Oh,” Kip said.\n“Oh?”\n“It’s the cloak all the shimmercloaks were based on. Of course it’s the\nbest.” He rubbed his eyes. “You can probably make it turn any color you—\nOh no.”\nHe was staring at the cards scattered on the ground around them. He saw\nthat he was standing on one of the cards and he moved carefully, lifting his\nfoot as if the card might bite him. He bent down and grabbed the card as if\nit were made of rubies and gold, touching only the very edges. “Oh,\nOrholam, please. Please tell me I didn’t break any of… What the hell?”\nHe stared at the card as if it was offending him.\nHe grabbed another card.\n“No!” he breathed. His eyes widened.\nHe grabbed more and more. Stared at each. What was he doing?\n“No, no, no,” he said as he turned each over. “Teia, was this like this\nwhen you found me?”\n“Was what like what?”\n“Were the cards like this? No one came in and stole the real ones before\nyou found me?”\n“Kip, what are you talking about? They were all stuck to your skin. It\nwas like they were poisoning you.”\n“Oh, no no no no.

Janus Borig lived to make these cards,\nand she died protecting them, and now I’ve—” He took a few hurried steps\naway and retched noisily.\nShe came over and put a hand on his back. He was hunched over, hands\non his thighs. She’d just saved his life, and this was not exactly how she’d\nexpected him to react. Or at all how she’d expected him to react. Orholam,\nhad she been thinking of kissing him?\n“Is it really that bad?” she asked. No, T, he’s probably puking for fun.\n“It may be worse,” he said, wiping his mouth. “My grandfather believed\nI knew where the cards were all along, and he’s threatened to kill me if I\ndon’t turn them over. This? There’s no way he’ll believe this.”\n“What, uh, what’s this other box?”\nKip sighed. “That’s my grandfather’s favorite deck. My father must have\nstolen them to spite him. They’re worth a fortune, of course. But one-of-a-\nkind, of course, so I can’t sell them, can’t hide them, can’t give them back\nwithout him knowing that I must have found these others.”\n“Maybe this would make a good peace offering?”\nKip considered it, but then shook his head. “I don’t know why my father\nstole the cards. Maybe he has some purpose for them. When he comes back,\nI don’t want to have failed him doubly.”\n“Kip,” Teia said gently, “you really think he’s coming back?”\n“Yes!” he barked. “Yes,” he said more quietly. He winced and squinted.\nHe seemed woozy, nauseated.\nTeia went over and turned off all the lights except for the soothing blue.\n“Thanks.”\n“You’re still my partner, Kip. They haven’t taken that away. Not yet.\nNow, let’s clean this up.”\nThey began picking up the cards, and it was good.\nMoments of companionable silence passed as they simply worked\ntogether. With the cards and the cloak and everything she didn’t understand\nof what was happening, Teia found herself saying, “I, I thought you were\ndead.”\nKip looked very tired. “I think… I think I was.”\n“That would have been the worst thing that ever happened to me.” She’d\nwanted to say losing you would have been the worst thing that ever\nhappened, but it was too much. Kip could say whatever popped into his\nhead and get away with it, somehow. She couldn’t.\n“I promise to die in some way that’s convenient and non-messy,” Kip\nsaid.\n“That’s not what I’m—”\n“I’m joking.”\n“Oh.”\nHe took a deep breath. “Thank you, Teia. I wouldn’t have wanted\nanyone else to find me destroying priceless artifacts.”\nShe laughed. Ripples of color went scintillating down her cloak. Whoa,\nwhat the hell?"

        "text": "anyone else to find me destroying priceless artifacts.”\nShe laughed. Ripples of color went scintillating down her cloak. Whoa,\nwhat the hell?\n“You know, I think I like that cloak on you,” Kip said. “Makes you a lot\neasier to read.”\nShe scowled, but the scowl wasn’t reflected in the cloak, so he could see\nshe was faking, dammit. She shut her eyes and concentrated.\n“Ooh, nice,” Kip said. “But I don’t think I can look at that cloak for long\nright now.” He was wincing and rubbing his temples.\nShe looked. The cloak was a drab, boring gray. It looked exactly like a\nnormal Blackguard inductee’s cloak. “Kip, this is amazing!” It reacted\ndirectly to her will. She didn’t think the shimmercloaks changed their\nmundane form. Those only did one thing. This, this was something far\nmore.\nHe grumbled something, but before she could ask him to repeat himself,\nKarris White Oak opened the door.\nShe didn’t look particularly pleased to see either of them. Nor was she\npleased to see the mess of the punching bag down and sawdust spilled\neverywhere. She strode in purposefully, glanced at Teia, dismissed her.\n“You did this, Kip?” she asked, meaning knocking the bag down.\nHe nodded, hands in his pockets. He also had a card box in each pocket.\n“Show me your hands,” Karris demanded.\nKip pulled his hands out, carefully palm down, and Karris examined—\nhis hands. Teia blew out a relieved breath. She glanced at her cloak. It was\nstaying gray, like she wanted it to. Thank Orholam for that.\n“Beat your own knuckles bloody, while training. Now your hands will\nbe no good for days as you heal, and you’ll miss training. Does that strike\nyou as particularly productive?” Karris asked.\n“Learning to fight through pain is good training, yes,” Kip said. “And I\nwon’t miss anything.”\nTeia almost gasped at his tone, and Karris’s lips thinned. She was still\nholding Kip’s fist in her hand, and Teia wondered if she was thinking how\nfast she could turn her hold into an arm bar or a wrist lock and kick Kip’s\ndefiant ass. Instead she turned his right arm over and looked at his elbow.\nThen she pushed up his sleeve and looked at his shoulder. She found the\nwound there.\n“So you’ve discovered venting,” she said.\n“Venting?” Kip asked.\n“Shooting luxin is one way to make your punches or kicks faster.”\n“Streaming? You already knew about that?” Kip asked.\n“Why are you blinking? Do you have a hangover, Kip? Are you\nlightsick?”\n“I’m fine,” he said.\nShe sighed. “We wait until after final vows to teach it. Your whole\nsquad’s using this?”\nNeither Teia nor Kip answered.\n“Figures,” Karris said. “It’s a good way for people to burn through their\nhalo in a couple years. And so difficult to use well that most Blackguards\nuse it less than once a year.”\n“A mistake,” Kip said. “Would you have us only shoot muskets once a"

And so difficult to use well that most Blackguards\nuse it less than once a year.”\n“A mistake,” Kip said. “Would you have us only shoot muskets once a\nyear, because we use them so rarely in actual combat? The lack of practice\nreinforces—”\nHe saw the look on Karris’s face and finally shut up.\n“So the bag tore off its hanger,” Karris said. “And it split open?”\nTeia saw the problem. If the bag had torn off its leather hanger, that\nwould have taken care of the force of a mighty punch. Or if it had ripped\nopen at its loose thread, how would it then have torn off its hanger?\n“I’m Guile,” Kip said, still hostile. It was, despite the incredible\nrudeness, kind of a brilliant response. ‘I’m Guile’ meaning that he was so\nfar outside the norm that you could expect things far outside the norm to\nhappen regularly around him, or ‘I’m Guile’ meaning I’m a cheater, and go\nto hell if you don’t like it?\nSurprisingly enough, Karris didn’t slap Kip’s silly head off. And this\nwas a woman who’d been famous for her temper. It seemed she was\nchanging, mellowing with age. Of course, the open secret that the White\nhad forbidden her to draft might have had a little to do with it, too. As a\nred/green, it might have been the best thing anyone could have done to her.\nKarris’s face went still, her eyes hooded. “Don’t forget, Kip, I’m Guile\nnow, too.”\nOh. So maybe not mellowing with age.\nThe chagrin on Kip’s face was priceless. Orholam’s bony knuckles, but\nTeia kind of wanted to give a cheer for her handler.\n“Yes, ma’am,” Kip said.\nBefore Karris could say any more, though, the door creaked open once\nmore. They all turned, but Teia was watching Karris, and she saw the\nwoman’s face drain of color.\n“Samite!” she said. “What are you doing down here?”\n“The White said you might be here.”\n“Sami, what happened to you?”\nTeia saw the squat Blackguard give an apologetic grin. Her left hand\nwas wrapped in a thick bandage that despite its thickness couldn’t hide that\nwhat was bandaged was smaller than a full hand.\n“Retirement,” Samite said with forced cheeriness. “Or a post training the\nscrubs and the nunks here.” She lifted her chin at Kip and Teia.\nKarris had already covered the distance to her friend. She lifted her\nfriend’s arm carefully. Samite winced. “Samite. What happened?”\nSamite shrugged. “The promachos has been sending out squads to\nsearch for all the bane.”\n“Sure, sure,” Karris said.\n“Mine went after the yellow. Found it and destroyed it. Not many wights\nthere, but when yellows go wight, they figure out how to draft a solid\nyellow. All of them figure it out, it seems. Hell of a fight. Half the squad\nwas new kids, and I was the only casualty. Embarrassing, frankly.”"

Samite stood stoic for a moment, but then\nhugged Karris back.\n“Guess this is what I get for that other thing. With Lady Guile. The last\nLady Guile, I mean. Felia.”\n“No, no, no, don’t talk like that.”\nTeia was suddenly embarrassed at seeing this intimate expression\nbetween friends—and also intensely curious, though she could tell that this\nwas a secret she wasn’t going to be learning.\nSamite pushed back from Karris and looked at the heavy bag. “Kip, you\ndo this?”\nHe nodded.\nSamite continued, “Your father would be proud. He told me once to give\nyou a hard time if you hadn’t knocked the bag open by Sun Day.”\nWhich did two things to Teia. First, she was deeply ashamed that she’d\nbeen part of the prank to keep that stitch reinforced and the thread loose.\nSecond, it made her realize that Gavin had meant Kip to get those cards if\nhe didn’t come back.\n“But, I, uh, I’m not here about that, and I’m sorry to interrupt your\ntraining of these two, Lady Guile.” Samite took a deep breath. She glanced\nat Kip and Teia and shrugged. “It’s for your ears, but I guess they’ll know\nsoon enough. Lady Guile, I wouldn’t have come to interrupt you for just…\nmy… news. I came here to give you warning.”\n“Warning?” Karris asked.\nTeia was looking at Kip. He blanched. Teia had no idea what it was, but\nKip obviously already knew what Samite was going to say.\n“When we Blackguards landed on Big Jasper, there was another ship at\nthe docks. A young lord was debarking. He was quite… willful, trying to\nmake his way through the pilgrimage crowds. He said his name was\nZymun.”\nKip looked ill again, but in a very different way.\nKarris looked at her blankly. “And…?”\n“Karris,” Samite said, “Zymun says he’s your son. The White wishes\nyou to report to her, immediately.”\nChapter 77\nHer son. Here.\nKarris felt like she was watching her own body move from hall to hall to\nlift. She passed the Blackguard station and couldn’t even identify the men\non duty. Her chest was constricted; it was hard to breathe. She could only\nfocus on one thing at a time. Step, step, woman, dammit. Now knock. Her\nson.\nDear Orholam, it was all coming down.\nKnock, damn you.\nShe lifted a hand and knocked on the White’s door.\nThe oddest thing happened with that simple, irrevocable action: she felt\nrelief. It was all coming down, and somehow, no matter what that cost, no\nmatter what came next, the lies were finished.\nThe Blackguards at the door, Gill and Gavin Greyling, looked at each\nother over her head. “Lady Guile?” Gill asked. He opened the door for her.\n“Thank you.” She walked in, back straight, features clear. She had been"

She had been\ntaught by the best; she wasn’t going to disgrace them now. Here at the end\nof all things, she would be brave, and stoic, and take her punishment like a\nlady and a Blackguard.\nThe White was in her wheeled chair, and she looked stronger than she\nhad in years. She saw Karris and said, “Leave us.” Her attendants and\nsecretaries and Blackguards left immediately; there was a steel in her voice\nthat brooked no argument or delay.\nWhen the room was empty, she studied Karris.\nKarris moved to speak, but the White lifted a finger, silencing her, and\nstudied her more.\nThen, abruptly, the White said, “Look at this invention. One of the\nyoung Blackguard inductees, Ben-hadad, made it for me. At first I didn’t\nthink he quite realized what he’d stumbled upon, but now I’m pretty certain\nhe does.”\nShe put her hand down on the arm of her chair, and the barest tendril of\nblue luxin moved down the rice-paper-thin skin of her arm—and the chair\nturned, and then rolled out from behind her desk as if a ghost had turned\nand pushed it.\n“What the h—? Your pardon, High Mistress,” Karris said. “I’ve never\nseen such a thing. How…?”\n“Gears and pulleys, he told me. All made of luxin. His trick was to\ncompletely encapsulate some open luxin within a couple of the belts, he\nsaid. It being open, I can push it with Will alone. Because it’s encapsulated,\nit doesn’t evaporate. Were I younger, I’d be flipping this chair over right\nnow to understand exactly what he’s done. It can’t be as simple as he’s said,\nbut if it is, or if it’s even close…\n“We each tend to think of our time as the end product of all that has\ncome before, which is true, but we like to believe our time is therefore the\npinnacle, rather than another pearl on the string. This invention may remake\na thousand things, or it may remake only one or two, depending on how\nefficient it can be made, and over what distances and for how long it can\noperate, and across what color bands. I may be dying just before the most\ninteresting time in history. I may miss out on a revolution by this much. It’s\neither intolerable, or very hopeful. I can’t decide which.”\n“Come now,” Karris said, “you’re going to live forever.”\n“I’ll be dead by Sun Day,” the White said.\nSteel bands crushed Karris’s chest. “You mean Sun Day next, surely,”\nshe said, meaning more than a year away.\n“I said what I meant.” The way the White said it, it was obvious she\nmeant the Sun Day three days away. “And not another word about that. I’ve\nbeen gifted with a long life and a certainty about the date of my passing.\nDebate about a foregone conclusion is a waste of the little time I have left.”\nKarris swallowed the dozen contentions warring to get out of her throat."

        "text": "Debate about a foregone conclusion is a waste of the little time I have left.”\nKarris swallowed the dozen contentions warring to get out of her throat.\nNot only, if she was honest with herself, to try to convince the White and\nherself that the White would be around for a long time yet, but also to keep\nher from bringing up worse things. Sitting in the judgment seat beneath an\nauthority you can’t deny is no place of comfort.\n“It is almost sunset,” the White said. “Push my chair to your balcony,\nwould you? I could Will myself there now, I suppose, but I tire.”\nSo Karris pushed her down the hall to her and Gavin’s rooms. And out to\nthe balcony. The Blackguards insisted on being in the room, at least, with\ntheir recent bad experiences with balconies and assassins.\nKarris found a heavy cloak for herself and some blankets for the White.\n“Take my hand, dear,” the White said.\nThey watched the sun set together. And in flares of pink and orange and\nevery red, the sun went down to the sea, leaving flaming clouds as a\npromise of its return. And in the beauty of the sun and sea and clouds and\nthe iron grip of a frail hand that had protected and guided her in ways her\nown mother never had, Karris found her cheeks damp with tears for all the\nwoundedness in the world. And for her own.\n“Look upon the city, and tell me what you see,” the White said.\nWith the sun so close to the horizon, the city was being swallowed in\nsoft shadows, rising from the ground up. The gleaming domes of every\npossible color and metal and design shone bright against the whitewashed\nwalls, and the Thousand Stars sparkled, beaming their rays to and fro in\ntheir districts. The seven towers of the Chromeria were stunning in this\nlight, too, reaching like longing hands toward the heavens. “I see the most\nbeautiful city in the world,” Karris said. “I see a treasure worth protecting.”\n“The Thousand Stars, odd, aren’t they?”\nKarris shrugged. They were wonders; their oddness was undeniable, but\nalso unquestionable.\n“A vast expense to build such towers, merely to bring drafters a few\nextra minutes of light each morning and night, don’t you think?”\nThey were, of course, used for many other things than that: ceremonial,\ncelebratory, practical, but the White knew all that. She meant something\nelse.\nKarris turned a questioning glance to the White, but the old woman had\nturned away from the city to look over the sea as the disk of the sun\ndisappeared.\n“Will you tell me about the second time you saw the green flash?” she\nasked the White.\n“The second?! Did I tell you about the first?” the White asked, still\nlooking over the sea. But the sun was fully down; there would be no green\nflash tonight.\n“Gavin told me about the first. Said you saw it at a party and were so\nexcited you jumped—and broke your future husband’s nose as he leaned\npast you for his wineglass.”\nThe White’s face broke into a grin at the memory, but she didn’t turn\nfrom the sea. “You know, he snored after that.

        "text": "past you for his wineglass.”\nThe White’s face broke into a grin at the memory, but she didn’t turn\nfrom the sea. “You know, he snored after that. Nose didn’t heal right. I\nknew I couldn’t really complain about it, but I was young, and I did.” Her\nsmile was tugged down by that old sin, but rebounded. “I miss him so\nmuch. He told me I should remarry when he was gone. He never wanted me\nto be lonely, but I couldn’t find a man who compared to him. Problem with\nbeing exceptional, as you know. Perhaps great men are content with\nmarrying a woman who is not their equal, but we great women… Our\nequals are rare enough in the first place, and then most of those we do find\nhave married twits.”\n“We’re victims of our own refined tastes?” Karris asked.\n“If Gavin Guile is a refined taste. He’s a rare one, that’s for sure.”\nKarris couldn’t talk about Gavin now. Couldn’t begin to touch the well\nof sorrow that was beginning to turn to rage: how dare he leave her here,\nalone, to face all this? And the guilt that followed the rage: where was he?\nWhat was he suffering? He wouldn’t be away if he could help it, she knew.\nShe hoped she knew.\n“Look now,” the White said. The shadows like a rising tide had\nswallowed the walls of Big Jasper and rolled upward constantly, lights\nwinking out around the curvature of the land until only the tallest buildings\nand the Thousand Stars were alight. Then only the Thousand Stars. They\nburned day into night.\nIt had been a long, long time since Karris had really looked.\n“We drafters are those Thousand Stars, Karris. We have been turned to a\nhundred purposes, but at heart we have only one: to bring the light into\ndarkness. Each high-set mirror is special indeed, brilliantly crafted,\nmagically made, but in the end elevated not because of its innate\nspecialness but because only by being set high can it serve to bring light\nwhere there is darkness. We are elevated to serve.”\nFor a time, they watched the light reflected from those many mirrors\nplay over Big Jasper. Then the White said, “The second time I saw the\ngreen flash, what I call Orholam’s wink, was one of the hardest days of my\ntenure as White. I was on one of the lower balconies here, thinking about\nsomething I’d seen that had terrified me. I thought that if I did the wrong\nthing, the world would be plunged back into a war that it seemed had just\nended. I thought that if I didn’t do something, though, a blacker fate might\nbefall than even that.”\n“After the war? What was it?” Karris asked. She’d already run away by\nthen, but she wasn’t aware that there had been huge crises. Small ones,\ncertainly. Perhaps all the putting down of pirates and rebels and the\ndistribution of lands and pillage had been far more dangerous than she had\nthought, and they only seemed like small challenges because they had been\nso adeptly handled. Aside from the Tyrean solution, which, though immoral,\nhad kept Tyrea weak for nearly two decades.\n“It was the day Gavin came back from Sundered Rock.”"

Aside from the Tyrean solution, which, though immoral,\nhad kept Tyrea weak for nearly two decades.\n“It was the day Gavin came back from Sundered Rock.”\nKarris held her breath, and her pulse became thunder in her ears.\n“Because he was still drugged and didn’t seem himself?” she asked, lying\nalmost smoothly enough to do Lady Felia Guile proud.\n“No,” the White said. “Or, alternately, precisely.”\nShe said nothing more, and Karris didn’t want to insult her by filling the\nspace with words.\n“I saw a thing that terrified me, and in my panic, I almost did something\nrash because I thought I needed to do something. And then… Orholam’s\nwink. I took it as a message that he was with me. He knew. Power is any\naction that results in consequences. But real power is action that results in\nthe intended consequences. Real power is impossible if not guided by\nwisdom. I had the power to kill. But Orholam had another plan. That was\nthe second wink.”\nIt was like the words were in a foreign language, and Karris was\nstruggling to translate them. The White had seen Gavin—and?\nAnd she knew.\nJust like that? Instantly? Karris had been in love with the man. Had\nmade love with him. Had focused every fiber of her young soul on her\nforbidden love—and she hadn’t seen it, but the White had?!\nIt made her furious. It made her feel stupider than words.\nShe almost reached out to draft red, to get that affirmation and validation\nthat her rage was deserved. But then she realized she was comparing apples\nand oranges. The White had found Dazen while he was drugged and in the\nimmediate aftermath of killing his brother. Karris hadn’t spent much time\nwith him before fleeing to conceal her pregnancy. When she’d come back a\nyear later, Dazen had had time to practice being Gavin. They’d only gotten\nreacquainted when all around him treated him as Gavin. His clothing,\nspeech patterns, hair, and posture were all different.\nThe point was that the White had known. She’d known. And she hadn’t\nexposed Dazen.\nThe White said, “How much is a man’s soul worth? For what price will\nyou buy his redemption? Is your answer different if he leads a nation? What\nif he could affect all of history? What price would be too much? What\njustice or vengeance would you forgo, for your hope?” She closed her eyes\nand sighed. Then her lips twisted in a little, reluctant grin, and she opened\nher eyes again. “He did turn out to be a pretty damn good Prism. Go\nfigure.”\nKarris let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. This was\nsurreal. This just simply couldn’t be. “How did you keep it to yourself for\nso long?”\n“To be a White is to know secrets, Karris. But that the position requires\nspying and skulduggery doesn’t relieve me of the moral obligation for how\nI use what I know.”\nAnother breath. “And you’ve known about… me, too? How long?”\n“I’ve known about your son since the beginning. Other women I’ve\nknown who have given up children have been haunted by it ever since. So"

Other women I’ve\nknown who have given up children have been haunted by it ever since. So\nover the years, I gave you several assignments where, had you wished, you\ncould have extended your time to go looking for him without anyone being\nthe wiser. You never took those chances.”\nWoodenly, Karris said, “I was… afraid I’d lead spies right to him. Afraid\nof what I would do, of who he’d become, of what he thought of me.”\n“The darkness has not served you well. From what I learned today, I\nbelieve now that Andross Guile has known about him for years as well. Be\nwise as a serpent, child.”\nBut Karris couldn’t wrestle with her thoughts about her son. Zymun. She\nhadn’t even known his name. There was too much there, and she didn’t trust\nherself how she’d react in front of the White. Her chin drifted up, and she\npushed that open wound away. Just for the time being.\n“I wish… I wish I had the kind of certainty you have. That Orholam is\nguiding me. I wish I could see him give me a visible sign, like he did you.”\nThe White chuckled. “Yes, two green flashes, in fifty years. What are the\nodds? It turns out, if you watch the sunset almost every day, pretty good.\nKarris, what we see is not determined solely by what is in the world, but\nalso by what is in us. The lens is as important as the light. You think I\nhaven’t questioned those two occasions a thousand thousand times?\nBesides, Orholam speaks differently to each of his children. I only thought\nof the green flash as a message because my own grandmother always called\nit Orholam’s wink. Had you seen it, you would have thought it a curious\nphenomenon. Orholam may speak to you in ways more pedestrian: through\nhis holy writ, or through his followers’ words, related to you. Could you\naccept that?”\n“Of course.”\n“Then hear this word, which is his gift for you. Are you listening?”\n“I’m listening. Did Orholam just tell you this now, or have you\nsomehow steered me into this?”\n“Orholam has told me this for you a thousand times. In fifteen years, I\nhave never read these words without you filling my mind, but it has been\nmy lot to know and not to tell. Part of the price I pay for my own sins. Even\nthe forgiven must pay penance.”\nSins? What sins had the White committed? Did she think that not telling\nanyone about Gavin was a sin? Surely not. “What is the word?” Karris\nasked.\n“The Most High will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten.”\nLocusts hadn’t come to the Seven Satrapies since before Lucidonius, but\nKarris had a luxiat when she was a child who told stories that made the\nplague as real as a memory.

The mass was like a million chariots descending to\npillage the land, and the ancient Seer Jo’El spoke of them marching as in\nranks.\nDrafters of every stripe, even in that ancient, fractured time, had fought\nin their waves. Blues tried to draft domes over entire fields. Oranges had\ntried to manipulate the hordes and turn them to foreign lands. Reds and sub-\nreds had sprayed the skies with fire. And like candles thrown into the ocean\nthe drafters were extinguished, one by one by one by the thousands.\nAnd everywhere the locusts went, they devoured everything. Nothing\ngreen was left. They wiped out not only crops, but whole forests. Trees,\ndenuded of their leaves, simply died in their wake. Men went mad during\nthe assault, screaming, open mouths filled with locusts. Men went mad\nafter, as starvation’s scythe swung. The insect armies left nothing good and\ngreen and growing. Nothing but hollow-cheeked children with huge eyes\nand hunger-swollen bellies, walking on stick legs until they could no longer\nstand. They curled, not even waving the flies from their eyes. And they\ndied.\nAnd that had been Karris’s life, since the war. Even with Gavin’s\ncoming back, and marrying her, she couldn’t but think of those sixteen\nyears of her life, the flower of her youth, lost, blighted, devoured. And an\nimpotent rage smoldered there, an ever-burning fire that she hadn’t even\nknown was still aflame.\nThis was her slow suicide. This was her drafting red, so much red she\nwould die young, not precisely on purpose, but not precisely not.\nThe words themselves were a fist that punched through her stomach,\nripped off a dozen layers of ill-fitting plate, and gave her a warm, clean robe\nin their place.\n“Karris, you will be at your most formidable when you bear no sword\nand wear no armor,” the White said gently. “This is the power of the word.”\nKarris couldn’t move. She held herself rigid. I will repay you for the\nyears the locusts have eaten. That promise held everything she’d ever\nhoped to hear, and from Orholam. It felt like someone had picked her soul\nup out of her body and shaken it gently, and all the dirt and grime and\nhatred and rage had simply sloughed off and fallen, and he dropped her\nback into her own shoes. Everything was the same, but her eyes were\ndifferent, healing. She didn’t trust herself to speak.\nFinally, she said, “You have been the mother to me that my mother could\nnever be. You have been more. Thank you.” She knelt, and kissed the\nWhite’s hand.\nThe White held her cheek fondly, then patted her, signaling she should\nstand. “I must go now, my dear. I will pray for you, Karris, and I will pray\nthat Orholam gives you your own green flash when the time is right.”\n“I don’t want you to leave,” Karris said. “Not ever.”\nThe White smiled sadly. “Thank you, child.

She has done excellent service in harder\ncircumstances than you can know.”\nThe request, as reasonable as it was, reached nonetheless straight into\nthat hot core where the rage fire had burned. For what was that red-haired\nbeauty but a walking symbol of all Karris had lost in those sixteen years?\nShe, a slave, had had what Karris with her wealth and position could not\nhave. Not just a man—as if a man’s affections could be traded as one would\ntrade a cow—but a position, a purpose, a place that she fit perfectly.\n‘Blackguard’ had been a cloak that Karris had worn because she was\nexcellent enough at the attendant skills that she couldn’t be denied it, but\nshe hadn’t been Blackguard as Commander Ironfist was Blackguard. It was\nnot a task to him, but an identity. Thus Karris had always been given the\nodd assignments, as the White’s fetch-and-carry girl, as Gavin’s partner in\nhunting wights, as liaison here and there. She’d always been different, and\nnot just in the tone of her skin or background. Her Blackguard brothers had\naccepted her as you accept a sister with a limp: fiercely, because it was so\nobvious that she didn’t quite fit.\nMarissia had always fit. Her staff was invisible, because they served\nperfectly. And so too had she served excellently at a myriad other duties\nthat Karris was only seeing now. And of course, Gavin Guile’s longtime\nroom slave was accorded treatment no other slave in the Seven Satrapies\ngot. Not even Grinwoody was treated like Marissia. The younger, wilder\nGavin fresh from the war had made sure of it.\nA young lord Seaborn had gotten grabby and, when his advances were\nrebuffed, had blackened young Marissia’s eyes.\nGavin had melted his face and mounted his head over the Chromeria’s\nfront gate—briefly. The White had seen it taken down within hours.\nIt was enough of an insult that the family had sworn vengeance. But\nthrough mysterious circumstances that most of the Blackguards later\nattributed to the Red, the Seaborns quickly found themselves without allies.\nThe family had eventually sided with pirates attacking the Guiles and their\nretainers’ ships.\nThey’d all been hanged, and their lands seized and given to the Red’s\nfriends, including, incidentally, some of the Seaborns’ old allies who’d\nabandoned them.\nAnd Gavin showed not the least sorrow for it. He was a hard man, but\nthat made him a safe friend, and a fearsome foe. When he came to your\ndoor and gave you the choice which to be, such stories came to mind.\nThe White said, “I know you envy her, though truth be told, she envies\nyou more.”\n“She envies me? But she’s a slave.” A slave shouldn’t dare to envy her\nowners.\n“And yet a woman still.”\n“More’s the pity.”\nThe White folded her hands in her lap, her very silence a reproach."

And don’t wait\nuntil you feel like making it. You never will.”\nKarris took a deep breath and went back inside. The White followed her\nin.\n“Gill has a package for you. It’s your inheritance. Please don’t open it\nuntil you hear of my passing.”\nKarris swallowed. She opened the door and Gill handed her a package\ntied with red ribbon. It felt like nothing more than half a dozen pieces of\npaper. Seemed a small inheritance, but then, the White had treasured\ninformation above all, and who was to say what was written there. Thinking\nof that—“What am I supposed to do with the spies? I’ve spent all this\ntime…”\n“I’ve explained that in those papers. Maybe not to your full satisfaction,\nbut as well as I can. Please don’t let those fall into enemy hands.”\n“And burn them as soon as I’ve memorized them, which I should do\ninstantly. Yes, I’m familiar,” Karris said. They shared a grin.\n“One last thing,” the White said. “While you’re doing hard things. When\nthe time comes, please, forgive me, too.”\n“For what?”\n“For failing you a thousand ways, as every mother does. Know that you\nare loved, Karris. And remember this: even a small woman, if she stands\nnear a great light, casts a long shadow.”\n“A small woman? You’re a giant,” Karris said through damp eyes.\nThe White grinned, and it wasn’t until she and her Blackguards had\ndisappeared into the hall that Karris realized the White hadn’t meant\nherself; she’d meant Karris.\nChapter 78\nDays passed. Weeks.\nGavin was fed and given watered wine, but the guards who tended him\nnever said a word. Never answered a query. Avoided eye contact. When one\ndid accidentally meet his eyes, Gavin saw the worst thing possible: pity.\nThey thought Gavin was mad. Without his prismatic eyes, no one\nbelieved he was the Prism. Without his drafting, without his regalia, without\nhis Blackguard escort, his impish imperial imperiousness seemed the\nstruttings of insanity.\nWas what Gavin had woven in all those years of power so thin a veil? Is\na man no more than his magic?\nThen one day, the door opened and the Nuqaba came in, bracketed by\nher Tafok Amagez. She limped a little as she came to stand in front of him.\nShe waved the guards away. They hesitated, obviously mindful of what had\nhappened last time. Her jaw set, and they left.\n“You may be pleased to know we’ve come to an agreement,” she said.\n“We?”\n“Eirene and I. Your father and the two of us. We are going to sell you to\nhim. After you’ve faced justice.”\n“Justice?” Gavin asked. “So you’ve come to wash my feet and begin\nbegging to know how you might pay restitution.” Lies and illusions and\nbluster. But it was all he had."

Even after all he’d said.\nYou can’t barter with crazy.\n“Even you win,” she said. “With your eyes burned out, your father\ndoesn’t need to know you lost your power. Eirene wasn’t going to go along\nwith it, until I pointed out that your father might deny that you were you.\nAfter all, without your prismatic eyes, what are you? Useless, that’s what.\nUseless.”\nShe leaned close, but not close enough for him to snatch her haik and\npull her against the bars and brain her.\n“You’ll be gagged, of course, and in the very stadium where you killed\nso many, you will be publicly blinded. While people cheer. You always did\nso love a spectacle, didn’t you? On the ship home, you’ll be scrubbed and\nshaved and given a haircut and put back in clothes befitting your former\nrank. Your father has to accept receipt of you, of course. Has to accept that\nit’s you. But I want you to know something. On that ship with you, there\nwill be an assassin. A man loyal to me unto death. After you’ve been\naccepted, he will shout some nonsense about the Color Prince, and kill you.\nDo you know how hard it is to stop an assassin who doesn’t care if he\ndies?” She sighed. “Your death is necessary, I’m afraid. It’s my fault. I was\ncareless. I spoke too freely, earlier. I searched all our laws to see if I could\ncut out your tongue and remove all your fingers instead so that you\nwouldn’t be able to tell him what I said, but there’s no such punishment.\nBlinding will have to do.”\nHer tone was so light and joyous that Gavin thought she must be joking.\nShe wasn’t joking.\n“Do you know,” she said, “it used to be quite common? Blinding\ndrafters, that is. I think they had more drafters then. They said that if a man\nmisused the light Orholam gave him, he should be denied light altogether,\nthat perhaps he would repent and not lose his soul. Tell me, Gavin, don’t\nyou agree that you’ve misused the light that Orholam gave you?”\nYes. Yes, I have.\nHe said nothing.\n“There are instructions for how to do it—hear this—humanely.

We’ll do one eye at a time. I want you to think of\none thing, Gavin Guile.

This was the woman who it was\nrumored had tortured her husband for years. Suddenly, he believed it.\n“And know this, if you shout anything other than screams of pain, if you\nclaim to be Gavin Guile, we’ll shout you down and beat you for\nblaspheming and tear out your tongue. There aren’t instructions in my\nscrolls how to do that, but I don’t need them. I already know.”\nShe was a worse butcher than her brother ever was. “What happened to\nyou?” Gavin asked. She wasn’t like this, before, was she? Or had it been\nthere all along?\n“I refused to merely survive.”\n“You’re the Nuqaba; you’re sworn to Orholam.” Though as the words\ncame out, the irony wasn’t lost on Gavin that he should be the one speaking\nthem.\nShe glanced around for eavesdroppers, then the expression instantly\nmorphed from appalled to grimly amused. “A dead faith that keeps rolling\nonly from its own momentum. Men want to worship, and worshipping\nabstractions is hard. I give them something easier: me. As you used to.”\n“I never asked for men’s worship,” Gavin said. He’d lost faith, but he’d\ntaken it as his responsibility to safeguard the religion for those who did\nbelieve. Why destroy it for others, if it made them happy? Why destroy it, if\nthere was a slim chance that it was true?\n“Did you not?” She shook her head. “I don’t even need the seed crystal\nto tell me that you’re deceiving yourself.

Dear Orholam, his eyes.\nHis fucking eyes had been betraying him all his life.\nDuring the war, men and women, satrapahs and conns had believed in\nhim because of his prismatic eyes, he knew. His impossible eyes. His\nbrother had seen the onset of their prismatic glory. That had torn his\nbrother’s soul; Karris had only been the pebble that upended the cart. With\none glance, his eyes had proved to the world that what the Chromeria said\ncould never happen, had happened. Two Prisms in one generation. And if\none had to pick between brothers, it was hard not to choose whichever\nbrother who stood before you, threatening you, wasn’t it?\nYou are nothing more than your magic, Gavin Guile."

Gavin, the elder, had known everything. Or speculated with such\nconfidence that Dazen had never failed to be impressed. He’d worshipped\nGavin.\nHe still did.\nHe wondered how much of his persona as Prism was a projection of that\nwinsome, pretend perfection his big brother had embodied to Dazen as a\nchild. Gavin was the oak around which Dazen had grown, like ivy. The\nparasite vine climbed high and decorative, slowly choking the life out of\nthat which it embraced. No wonder Gavin had hated his little brother with\nthe boyish hatred of encumbrances.\nEven after the war, Dazen had grown round the great expanse that had\nbeen Gavin, draping his own foliage over the widespread branches and\ncalling himself an oak. Calling it life, when it was death. Blocking out the\nsun, light, and life intended for another.\nAnd now that Gavin was dead, and the oak rotted, what happened to the\nivy? On its own, it had no strength to stand.\nI haven’t mourned him. I put two bullets in his face, and I haven’t\nmourned him.\nI wonder what it smells like down there. I left his body to rot. I didn’t\neven have the decency to wrap him in funeral cloths. Didn’t want to get\nbloody.\nI didn’t want to get bloody?\nThere’s always something desperate requiring my attention, isn’t there?\nAs if I can blind myself with activity, with travel, or with war.\nHe thought of all the wights he’d killed over the years. The White had\nbeen right. There had never been any need for him to risk his own life\nhunting them down. Foolishness to risk a Prism to hunt a few wights.\nWights are merely once-men, running in fear, nearly always alone, usually\nin the wilderness because no one in the world would give a murdering\nmadman shelter. Take a tracker after them, figure out when they sleep, and\nhave half a dozen men fire muskets at the sleeper.\nInstead, Gavin had insisted on going after them himself. On facing them.\nKilling them when they were conscious. Giving them those phony last rites.\nTrying to purge himself, more than them. Steeped in blood, he sought blood\nto cleanse himself.\nHe sometimes still couldn’t believe the White had let him go hunting.\nBut she’d thought he’d kill himself if he didn’t have those trips. Perhaps\nshe’d been wiser than he knew.\nThe tiny window inset in the cellar’s door opened.\n“Tssssss.”\nAnd a woman’s laugh.\nIt chilled him. Staring there at the now shut window, and his grubby cell\nand his half a hand, and his dirty beard and his long dirty hair, Gavin felt his\nchest tightening up. Hard to breathe. Shooting pains.\nA thought that he’d batted away successfully a hundred times came back\nto him, and stood over him, and spat upon him: You’re not going to get out\nof this.

Putting on Gavin Guile hadn’t meant\nputting on a set of clothes, it had been putting on a new skin. He’d seen\nflayed men: his spies left for him by his brother. He could still hear their\nshrieking, and now he felt he was one of them, the Gavin-skin torn from\nhim.\nHe was going to lose his eyes.\nWell fuck his eyes.\n‘Orholam will give it to you plain,’ the prophet had told him. ‘You keep\nup your lies, and you’ll be stricken blind.’\nHe was already blind. What could they do to him but make all the world\nsee what he already knew? For months now, he’d been a husk. A man when\nhe had been nearly a god. That knife, that damned knife had stolen his\npower. But there was no getting it back.\nHe looked around the cellar, and could almost convince himself that he\nsaw brown dirt, brown wood, the silver of metal. But it was all gray. Shades\nshading into black. Into blindness.\nWho had he been deceiving, anyway, thinking he could make a\ncomeback? From this. He had built himself to be the perfect Prism since he\nwas seventeen years old. A seventeen-year-old’s projection of a perfect\nPrism, anyway. Robbed of the light of his youthful delusions, he was an\nempty mirror in a darkened room.\nAh, Karris, I’m only glad that you don’t have to see me like this. And if\nyou do see me before my end, I won’t see the disappointment, the horror, in\nyour face.\nIf I could do it again, would I do it all differently? Would I have stolen\nyour life, Gavin? Would I have come forward, at any point in all my years\nas Prism, having consolidated my power, and said of my own will, at my\nown time, ‘I am not he’? I was too great a coward to live in the light. Fitting\nthen that light be taken from me.\nHe sat, hollowed of feeling, for days. Morning and night, the window\nwould open. He would hear a light step. “Tsssss,” the Nuqaba would say.\nAnd she would laugh.\nHaruru was as much a legitimate Nuqaba as Gavin was a legitimate\nPrism. Hundreds of years ago, under Prism Karris Shadowblinder,\nimmediately in the aftermath of Lucidonius’s death, the Parians had been\ngiven extra leeway in how they kept the religion. Having been the\nbirthplace or fostering place of Lucidonius, they had demanded special\nconsideration. Prism Karris had allowed it in order to keep the empire\ntogether. Though attempts had been made since to keep the two parties\nmore in line theologically, there had been no success in bringing the\nNuqaba further under the Prism’s political control.\nMost Prisms tried, but war with Paria was something no one had the\nstomach for. And a succession of Nuqabas had played their hands\nbeautifully, strengthening key positions while giving up the inessential.

Their man had founded it. Their people had expanded\nit. To go to war with their own was unthinkable, so long as certain\nprerogatives were respected.\nThe Nuqaba was supposed to be a living saint. She was supposed to be\nmother to all the clans. She was supposed to be a model of patience and\nwisdom and firm love. She was supposed to look upon her people with the\neye of grace. Some had gone so far as to wear a patch over their left eye, the\noculus sinister, the evil eye. Not Haruru.\nIronfist and Tremblefist are going to be furious when I kill you.\nNo, that problem, that thought, that was the old Gavin. That was the\nGavin who had power. Who was power.\nShe came back, to speak to him, or to taunt him.\n“You’re going to make a deal with a pagan army?” Gavin asked\nsuddenly. “Your people will kill you for that.” Perhaps worship of Orholam\nhad slipped among the rich and powerful in Paria, perhaps they would be\nhappy to make a deal with a monster. But would the army? Would the\nvillages, and the fleets? Or would those faithful people rather die before\nthey would join with monsters, regardless of what their betters told them to\ndo?\n“Not me.”\nAnd then Gavin understood.\nShe’s a useful idiot, is what she is. One of her nearest advisers probably\nworks for the Color Prince.\nIt amazed Gavin how stupid ambition made smart people. Haruru\ncontrolled the Satrapah Tilleli Azmith totally, but hated having to publicly\ngive the appearance of obeying her—or perhaps of merely being her equal.\nThe Nuqaba wanted to be unfettered. So she’d join with the Color Prince,\nbelieving he would then turn toward the Chromeria and leave her alone\nuntil he’d dealt with them. Leave her alone. In what world would the man\nbe stupid enough to do that?\nThe Color Prince wasn’t an Angari pirate, coming to raid. He wanted to\nbe an emperor. He was building up Tyrea rather than plundering it.\nDoubtless he was doing the same with Idoss and Ru now. It was certainly\nwhy he’d stopped or at least slowed his advance. When you spent money to\nbuild, you ultimately got more out of the land you held, but it took more\ntime. If he was patient, it might be too late to stop him already. The caves\nabove Ru held millions of bats. The guano contained a key ingredient for\nmaking gunpowder—and the Atashians had held a stranglehold on that,\nmaking the Chromeria and everyone else pay dearly for what the Color\nPrince now had for free. And what else could you do with the cedars of\nBlood Forest but build a fleet?\nBoth of which took time. With the Chromeria’s navy shattered…\nThe Color Prince needed time, so he was using this time to divide his\nenemies.

The skimmers changed everything, and\nGavin was more adept at figuring out the implications of rapid changes than\nmost. The Blackguards could have found those harbors—if they existed—in\na few weeks. With the amount of lumber collected all in one place, it would\nhave taken only a single good red drafter and a spark.

Teia.\n“Go away,” Kip said. He sounded like a petulant child, and he hated\nhimself for it.\n“Breaker,” she said. “You need me.”\nBut when she said ‘Breaker’ again he heard ‘Diakoptês,’ the sense of\ntwo languages colliding, intertwining. Diakoptês: he who rends asunder. He\nheard a woman whisper it in his ear, sharing a secret. He heard an old man\nscreaming it in despair in the distance. He heard a crowd chanting it until it\nmelded with ‘Break-er, Break-er!’\n“Breaker, open the door,” Teia said, and Kip was aware of himself once\nagain, leaning against the doorframe, head down, heart racing. He opened\nthe door.\nTeia came in. “Decision time,” she said. “Your grandfather is going to\nknow about your half brother’s arrival any moment, if he doesn’t already.\nHe’ll send for Zymun, and then he’ll send for you. Right?”\n“I suppose,” Kip said.\n“What’ll happen?”\n“We tried to kill each other the last time we met, Teia, and Zymun’s not\nthe forgive-and-forget type.” But even as Kip said the name ‘Zymun,’ it\nechoed in his head. Zymun the Dancer. Forests flashed before his eyes, light\nstreaming through morning mist, rising in a meadow. A man he knew well,\nlying prone at my feet. Unconscious? No, dead. Dead, Kip was certain of it.\nAnd—\nGone. Only to be replaced by dazzling pain.\n“Breaker! Pay attention! ‘Who hesitates…’” she quoted. “Finish it.”\n“‘Is lost,’” Kip said.\n“So, you’ve got a choice. Wait until your grandfather summons you and\ndance to his tune again, or run.”\n“Run?” Kip asked. White and black spots were still slamming into each\nother companionably in front of his face.\n“Take a ship. Take it anywhere.”\n“I wouldn’t even know where to hire a—”\n“I do.”\n“Or how much to pay for pass—”\n“Two hundred danars.

They’d worked together long enough that he did it\nautomatically.\nThe plan is that I fling her up to the window ledge, and she’ll lie down,\nextend a hand for me to grab. I’m the heavier by far. It’s how we always do\nit.\nBut the fire is too intense. Nearly smokeless, intense. The reds are\npouring luxin into the manse. Overkill, but we’ve given them reason to fear\na team of Shimmercloaks.\nI fling Gebalyn skyward, the hem of her shimmercloak trailing fire.\nTeia sprang up and grabbed the coin sticks, and he caught her on the\nway down.\nDistracted by the vision of fire, his hands stayed on Teia’s hips just a\nmoment too long.\n“Kip,” she said. She thumped his wrist with a coin stick.\n“S-sorry,” he said. He’d be more embarrassed if he weren’t in so much\npain.\n“The captain’s name is Two Gun Ben. You don’t pay him a danar more\nthan two hundred, you understand? He’s already agreed. East docks, blue.\nNow move! We’ve probably—”\nA sharp knock at the door interrupted them. “Kip, it’s your grandfather.\nOpen the door. It’s urgent.”\nThe Master. Hands stained red with betrayal. Scribbling lines—he’d\nbeen writing to the Color Prince. He’d gone wight, and he didn’t know how\nto escape, so he was planning to ‘join’ the Color Prince. Eventually, he\nwould betray him, too. But joining the Color Prince would give him time,\nand that was a commodity the Master needed.\nKip blinked. His head was pounding.\nTeia was cursing silently. She was mouthing words to him: Don’t. Open.\nIt.\nFor a moment, he couldn’t think at all. Then all he could think about was\nall the cards in his pockets. Teia was already moving, throwing open his\nbureau. Kip handed her the card boxes, and she buried them all under some\nclothes and shut the bureau quietly."

Kip handed her the card boxes, and she buried them all under some\nclothes and shut the bureau quietly.\n“Hesitated,” Kip said. “I hesitated. Not like me at all.” Dammit. He\nopened the door.\nAndross Guile stepped inside, not waiting for an invitation. He looked at\nTeia, surprised, perhaps, to see her here. “Hmm, you’re filling out nicely,”\nhe said, staring Teia up and down. “So sad Kip won you away from me.”\nHe gave her a little charming grin. “If you wish to visit my chambers on a\nmore… open basis, though, please come by.”\nShe shrank from him. Kip realized what she did not: Andross Guile\nwasn’t serious. His tastes didn’t go so young. If he wasn’t interested in\nTisis, he certainly wouldn’t be interested in Teia. He was merely digging\ndeep enough into debasement to undercut her fundamental decency. He\nwanted to unnerve her. It worked.\n“You’re dismissed, caleen,” Andross said, turning his attention to Kip.\n“I’m a free—”\n“Dismissed,” he said. He was the promachos, and even without the\nweight of his new title, he was a man accustomed to being obeyed.\nTeia practically fled.\nAndross closed the door behind her. “Has she come to you?” he asked.\n“Pardon?” Kip asked.\n“Tisis. Has she come to you? My spies have reported a Malargos ship\nbeing quietly readied to sail this evening. A smuggler’s ship, fast, one they\ndon’t know I know they own. Has she come and proposed marriage, or\nnot?”\nA long silence. “Yes,” Kip admitted.\nAndross slapped his gloves into his other hand and smiled. “I so love it\nwhen I’m right. That prediction? That was a bit of genius, if I do say so\nmyself. New player, impulsive, trapped. Hard to predict. Did you bed her?”\nKip shook his head. Then was ashamed of himself. He should have told\nthe old bastard it was none of his business. Why did Kip defer to his\nenemy?\n“Well, you can lead a horse to a mare in heat, I suppose, but you can’t\nmake him mount her. Not usually a problem for us Guiles. My advice? Get\nrid of that fat. You might find a libido hiding under it.”\nKip opened his mouth—he wasn’t even sure what he was going to say,\nand he didn’t care, he was about to open the Blunderbuss and let fire—but\nAndross raised a finger.\n“But.” His eyes twinkled. “I didn’t come here to lecture you, dear boy. I\ncame to give you a choice. Few in this world get their life-defining choices\nhanded to them and labeled as such, but you are special, and I am feeling\ngenerous. Do you have them for me?”\n“Huh?”\n“The cards, Kip.”\n“You never sent me to look for my father. You broke your word.”\n“I broke nothing. We agreed I’d choose the time. I mean to send you to"

I mean to send you to\nbe part of the group that will free him. You are spending your time here\nprofitably. I don’t waste those who work for me. Now. Do you have my\ncards?”\nKip could feel his future slipping away. “No,” he said. He wasn’t sure, at\nthis moment, if he would have handed them over regardless.\nNo, that was a lie. He would have. He was that much of a coward.\nAndross Guile sighed. “Do you know that I really did want to make you\nPrism? I was ready to groom you, to give you, the bastard from a backwater\nvillage, seven years as one of the most powerful people in the world. I\nwould have made you, the fat little orphan, the most admired man in the\nworld. From there, you could have possibly extended your reign, were you\ncompetent enough. But you’re not much of a Guile. Not enough to hide\nyour ambition and take my orders for a short while. You’re too stupid to\nplay the game at its highest levels. I was going to give you a task next: you\nagainst your brother. Whoever won would be Prism.”\n“The promachos doesn’t name Prisms.” Kip was parroting Quentin,\nthough.\nAndross Guile merely smirked.\n“But you can orchestrate such things,” Kip said, heart sinking. I knew I\nwas right to be skeptical.\n“What do you think I’ve been doing the whole time Gavin’s been gone?\nWhat do you think I’ve been doing my whole life?”\nSetting things up. Destroying and sacrificing people as if they were\ncards, as if all that mattered was the game.\n“What was the task going to be?” Kip asked.\n“To destroy the green bane and bring me something from it.”\n“What?! I already destroyed the green bane!”\nA smile lit Andross’s lips. “Oh! You are learning. Look at that. An effort\nthat took thousands of people, and you easily inserted yourself into the story\nas the hero—as if you’d done it all alone. A noble’s trick, that. A dirty one,\nbut time-honored. Congratulations. Fact is, the green bane is reforming or\nhas reformed already. You botched the job. You need to take the seed crystal\nfrom it, or it simply grows again.”\nKip was gutted. “So all we did… the destruction of the whole navy. The\nwhole Battle of Ru. The capture of Ruic Head. The deaths… they were all\nfor nothing?”\n“It was a setback for our enemies. They had the seed crystal, the green\nbane, and an Atirat. They lost them all—but we didn’t gain them.”\nThe idea of going back to fight the green bane again was like being\nasked to voluntarily get back in a closet full of rats. “So that’s why you\nlooked so inept.”\n“Pardon?” No one applied the word ‘inept’ to the Guile.\n“You took the navy to Ru and did everything wrong—if you were trying\nto save the city. You didn’t care about the city,” said Kip."

You didn’t care about the city,” said Kip.\n“Had we saved the city, but lost the bane, we would have lost the war.\nAnd lost the city, too, within days.”\n“But you didn’t care that you lost it. That’s the difference.”\n“Yes, please. Given unlimited time and perfect hindsight, tell me how\nyou would have directed our forces so that all would have been well.\nRegardless. You dithered, and Sun Day is upon us. You won’t be the next\nPrism.”\nThe words echoed in Kip’s head: ‘You won’t be the Prism,’ Janus Borig\nhad told him. Plain as day. That wasn’t how prophecy usually worked, was\nit? It was usually all obfuscation. Smoke and mirrors and darkness and\nflashing lights to blind the unwary. When it was just stated, did that make it\nmore certain, or less?\nKip wasn’t certain how much to believe Andross Guile, though. Sure, it\nwas one thing to go hunting the bane, but why sacrifice your whole fleet to\ndo it? If you saw a trap, you sprang it with a few ships, not your whole fleet.\nHe may well have been hunting the bane, but that didn’t mean he had\ngodlike perspicacity. And he’d been a red wight at the time. That had to\nhave clouded his vision, made him impulsive. Perhaps he was only lying to\nhimself now, telling himself that the losses had all been part of the plan.\nKip opened his Blunderbuss to say so. Shut it.\nAndross Guile continued. “But now you have another choice: marry\nTisis, go with her tonight. I will provide a luxiat who will marry you in\nsecret because he believes love conquers all. Whatever you tell her at first, I\ndon’t care. But as time goes by, you will make her believe you’ve fallen in\nlove, and do your best to make her do the same. That’s vital, you\nunderstand? Then, you stay with her, reporting to me from time to time.\nEirene Malargos has big plans, and I’ve been unable to get a spy close in to\nlearn them. You serve them, pretending to hate me. Your half brother will\nbecome the Prism—but Prisms usually only last seven years. You can wait,\nright? You’ll have a beautiful wife; you’ll have riches; I could even allow\nyou to take your little friend Teia with you to guard your back, or your bed,\nwhichever.\n“At the very worst, Kip, it gets you out of Big Jasper alive. I know there\nhave been attempts on your life—and those haven’t come from me. I don’t\nbelieve the attempts will stop if you remain here. What you need is some\ntime to get away, to grow up, to marshal your powers and your skills.\nYou’re sixteen and you’re starting to see who you will be. But you’re not\nthat man yet, and there are challenges here to which you are not yet equal.\nIf you take care how much you draft, in a few years you can come back as\nthe head of the foremost Ruthgari house if not the head of the satrapy itself,\nand a full-spectrum polychrome."

Marriages are often made to make peace and cement alliances, and\nyours would do both, both in the short term and in the long.”\n“I just have to become your spy.”\n“Yes, yes, staying alive is such a dirty business, isn’t it? Perhaps you\nshould leave it to others,” Andross sneered. “You have to become my heir.\nYou’ll be serving the promachos and the satrapies, not just our family. Such\nis only right.”\n“Then why does it feel wrong?” Kip asked.\n“Because you’re young, and you haven’t learned the difference between\na twinge of conscience and a twinge of fear. In other words, ass from\nelbow.”\n“Oh, no,” Kip said. “In my time under your tutelage, I’ve become quite\nadept in recognizing an ass.”\n“Then you ought to do well when you meet Two Gun Ben.”\nGiven that Kip had only heard of the captain minutes ago, he was too\nshocked to keep it off his face.\n“Oh, yes, I know all about him. He’s not a transporter; he’s a slaver, and\ntoo cautious to ransom the slaves he takes back to their families. You go\nwith him, and he’ll clip your ear and put you on an oar. We’ve had quite\nenough of that in this family, don’t you think?”\n“I—”\n“Your friends aren’t as clever as you hope, Kip. Nor are you. Speaking\nof which, whatever you choose, before you go, I will have my cards. This is\nnot optional.”\nA jolt of real fear shot through Kip. “I already told you. I don’t have—”\nKip said.\n“Not optional. You must—” And to Kip, his face suddenly twisted,\nreplaced by a much younger Andross Guile, young and strong, standing in\nhis own manse, addressing his thirteen-year-old son. ‘You must do this,\nGavin. All our family, all our satrapy, all the world, and all of history rests\nupon you. In the blinding glare of his responsibilities, a Guile doesn’t\nblink.’\nThen Kip was back, and Andross’s face was tight, suspicious, and old.\n“Kip, show me what’s in your pockets.”\n“You won’t listen,” Kip said. He couldn’t even take joy in the fact that\nthe cards were in the bureau and not in his pockets. Small victory indeed.\n“I won’t listen to lies, boy. And I can tell you’re lying to me.”\nAnd a lie bloomed, and Kip saw a narrow hope. “Lying because I’ve\nbeen afraid of what you’ll do. Now I just don’t care anymore. I saved her\nlife, grandfather, if only for a few minutes.”\n“Her? Janus Borig?!

I came in while they were still\nrobbing the place, and I could see them in sub-red. They didn’t expect me to\nbe able to see them, and I got lucky. I killed them both, but we triggered\nsome of her traps, and the place caught fire. I tried to carry her body out,\nand she was still alive. She made me get the assassins’ cloaks, and then on\nour way out, she stopped me again. She grabbed this.” Kip wondered what\ninsanity had gotten into him, but it felt like the only way. He dug out Janus\nBorig’s card box.\nAndross Guile’s eyes lit with hungry fire. He reached for the box, but\nKip didn’t give it to him. “Why is it broken?”\nOf course he cared about the cards first, and not the woman. Kip said,\n“She died before I carried her two blocks away. I came and gave my father\nthe cloaks and—”\n“Cloaks? Plural?”\n“Yes,” Kip said. He couldn’t help it. His lies wouldn’t have the ring of\ntruth if he didn’t give his grandfather a whole lot of real intelligence. Of\ncourse, any of this could be a trap. Maybe his grandfather already knew all\nof this and was expecting the lie.\n“And I gave him the cards. I took a peek first, of course. There was\nname after name, so many it was overwhelming. But it was the very night\nGavin got back, and he found me, and took the cards. I didn’t see them\nagain—until today.”\n“You’re telling me you found these today?”\n“I swear it on my hope for light.”\n“Give them to me!”\nKip shook his head. “You don’t understand. I would have brought them\nto you. After looking at them, of course. After writing down all the names.\nMaybe after viewing a few of them. But maybe not even that. Janus told me\nshe put traps on the cards that would flay a man’s mind.” Kip blew out a\nbreath, and it wasn’t pretense. Whatever had happened to his mind, it had\nfelt like flaying. He didn’t think he’d seen the last of whatever it was that\nhad happened. “They were hidden in Gavin’s training room. When I found\nthem…” He handed over the box.\nAndross Guile’s brow furrowed. He hated not understanding things\nimmediately. He handled the box like it was an asp. He put it on the table,\npulled on his gloves, noted the box’s broken side, and opened it gingerly.\nWhen nothing happened, he examined the back of the top card minutely.\n“Definitely her work. I’d spot a counterfeit.” He looked up at Kip.\n“Congratulations, boy, perhaps you have some hope of being Prism after\nall.”\nKip just shook his head.\nAndross scowled. He flipped over the top card.

It was Gill\nGreyling and Baya Niel. “Out!” Andross ordered. “Out now!”\nThey sheathed weapons and left immediately. Andross Guile obviously\ntolerated no less. They didn’t even apologize for intruding, which Kip\nguessed was the price Andross Guile paid for always treating them so\npoorly.\nBefore the door had even closed, Andross said, “What have you done?\nThis isn’t what I demanded. This doesn’t make you Prism.”\n“I’m telling you,” Kip said. “I found them like this. After months of\nsearching, I find them like this. After all the threats you’ve thrown my way.\nI finally find them—and they’re blank. I knew you wouldn’t believe me.”\n“You destroyed them.”\n“I’m still scared of that old lady, and I saw her die. I didn’t dare mess\nwith them. She was crazy. I saw the traps she laid in her own home. Fire\ntraps, when there were barrels of black powder everywhere in her home.”\nDon’t go on too long, Kip. Let the hook stay in the water.\nAndross looked at Kip skeptically. “So either Gavin destroyed the cards,\naccidentally or on purpose, or someone found them since, and did the same,\naccidentally or on purpose. You found these where?”\n“In the middle of a heavy bag, in Gavin’s exercise room.”\nAndross thought. “So, unlikely that someone else would have hidden it\nthere, unless Ironfist is making a play. Of course, he’d be much more likely\nto trigger a trap. No. Gavin. That’s how he knew about…” Andross’s eyes\nlit suddenly, and Kip knew he’d swallowed it. It fit some narrative in his\nown mind, and he’d almost given Kip information by thinking aloud.\nThe weakness of a spider: it sees every dangling thread as part of a web.\n“Name every card you can remember, boy. It may be I can glean\nsomething from the very names or the inclusion of certain men or women.”\n“I saw them only briefly,” Kip pleaded. “Six months ago.” Oh, Orholam\nhave mercy, even saying the names might… might flay his mind. “Fine,\nfine. I remember a few.” He sat down and closed his eyes to make a show of\ntrying to remember, but really because he thought he might get dizzy again.\n“Shimmercloak.”\nHis vision swam and he was following Niah’s perfect ass down the dock\non his way to assassinate Janus Borig.

What did it look\nlike?”\n“I thought you weren’t interested in my inter—” Kip shut up at the look\nin Andross’s eyes. “I don’t remember what he was doing, but it was Zymun.\nIt was definitely Zymun.”\n“Damn you for turning the cards over to Gavin and not me,” Andross\nsaid.\n“You were trying to murder me at the time.”\n“Next! The Malargos girl will be coming anytime now, and I can’t be\nhere when that happens. Quickly.”\nIt was like choosing to plunge your hand into fire. How smart was Kip?\nHe had to give the list fast enough so that his grandfather wouldn’t think he\nwas sorting them, had to give enough of a list so that his grandfather would\nthink he was giving him all that he remembered, but not so long of a list\nthat he’d be suspicious why Kip would remember so many, and if they\nweren’t a good enough list of surprising and unsurprising cards, he would\nknow. He would know. And Kip had to do all this while his head split and\nhallucinations danced around him every time he spoke. Oh hells.\n“New Green Wight. Incipient Wight. Flintlock. Sea Demon Slayer,” Kip\nblurted. That last. That damned pirate. That was Gunner! “Shimmercloak.\nUh, sorry, said that already. Um, Dee Dee Falling Leaf. Usem the Wild.\nAheyyad Brightwater.

He stepped forward, as if\nto strike.\n“Of course I lie,” Kip said.

Clever,\nusing the Blackguard habit of nicknaming to take it, and to take a tertiary\ntranslation that might slip past the luxiats yet look so obvious in retrospect.\nBut clever isn’t enough, boy, not against me.”\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Kip said.

Breaker was the most pedestrian and vague of\ntranslations for Diakoptês.\n“Aha.” Andross looked triumphant; he’d seen the lie on Kip’s face.

Gavin’s been teaching me all the old-fashioned court rituals of the\nsatrapies.\n“Mother,” I say.\n“Dazen, greet our guest.”\n“Mother, your shawl, please.”\nI draw myself to what my tutor calls a proper little lordling’s pose. My\nmother hands me her shawl. I drape it over my shoulders, adjust it, and\nsweep into the old courtier’s bow of the Forest Court. One needs a cloak to\ndo it properly. “Lady Borig, may your roots grow deep, and the circular\nskies bring you sun and shade in perfect proportion. May your herds\nincrease, may your sons be unto you like a quiver full of arrows, may the\nsmall folk fear you, and may the tygre wolves hunt only your enemies.”\nWhew, almost forgot the last part.\nLady Janus Borig studies me silently.\n“His father’s memory, I’m afraid,” mother says.\n“And his mother’s charm. I seem to recall you stealing hearts when you\nwere his age, too.”\n“I spoil him,” my mother says. “I know it’s not good.”\n“But you continue because.” Lady Janus Borig waves her pipe vaguely.\nIn the direction of my father? I have no idea what she’s talking about.\n“Exactly.”\n“Please,” Lady Janus Borig says, “take your time with your son. The\nmatter between you and me can wait. Pretend I’m not here.”\nI look at her, then at my mother. This is all kinds of backwards. Adults\nnever want to wait while children speak first. I can’t imagine father saying\nsuch a thing, not even with Gavin. But she seems serious.\n“You were out with Magister Kyros?” my mother prompts.\n“After lessons, we were playing at the Great Fountain, and I was talking\nto some of the other boys, and they said they’d learned from their tutor\nabout other kinds of luxin that Magister Kyros won’t teach me about. They\nsaid it’s because I’m not smart enough. They said it’s too advanced. I asked\nhim about it, and he wouldn’t say anything. It’s true, isn’t it?”\nMy mother’s face darkens, and the whole world darkens with it. “Let me\nguess, the White Oak boys again? You know they’ll be looking for an\nexcuse to hurt you after your brother blackened Tavos’s eye last week.”\n“I know, mother, I wasn’t trying to be around—” Oh no.\n“So it was Gavin who hit him. Last week you said you had no idea what\nhappened.”\nI’ve let it out of the bag again. Gavin’s going to hit me for that.\n“Mother, you tricked me!”\n“Son, you lied to me.”\nQuick. “There’s so many of them, wherever my tutors take me, there’s\none of them there.”\n“Yes, son, and it behooves you to remember that.”\n“What, mother?”\n“There’s more of them than there are of us.”\nI sniff and raise my chin, just like father. “Ain’t afraid of nothing. I’m\nGuile.”"

She covers her mouth and smothers it, but\nher eyes are light again, and I know she won’t be mad at me anymore. “Oh,\nmy little man, you’re growing up fast, aren’t you?” She looks over at Lady\nJanus Borig. “You see?”\n“Indeed,” the old woman says. She doesn’t sound pleased.\n“Growing up fast enough to be told about the luxins?” I ask hopefully. I\nsee my opportunity slipping away.\nShe scowls and I do my best to look cute and harmless. She sighs.\n“Don’t tell your father?” she says.\n“Promise!”\nMy mother pauses, though. She turns. “Lady Borig?” she asks.\n“Somehow, I think your own knowledge of that might be just a bit larger\nthan my own.”\n“Indeed.” Lady Borig’s index finger suddenly glows hot, and she sticks\nit into the bowl of her pipe, reigniting the ashes. A sub-red drafter. She puffs\non the pipe for a time until she’s enveloped in a cloud. “How much do you\nwant me to tell him? For that matter, how much do you want me to tell you?\n’Tis the stuff of nightmares.”\n“You weren’t going to tell him about bla—”\n“Indeed I was,” Lady Janus Borig says. “Your son is not simply\nprecocious, Felia. He is terribly bright; he is handsome; he is charming; and\nyou have spoiled him horribly. In other words, he has all the makings of a\ntrue monster.”\nMy mother blinks. No one talks to her like this.\n“Though I wonder.” She takes a deep breath on her pipe, not merely\ndrawing the smoke into her mouth, but inhaling it. Mother doesn’t say a\nword, which tells me that she respects this terrible old lady immensely. “I\nsuppose his elder brother beats him from time to time?”\n“Best of friends one minute, fiercest enemies the next.”\n“Do you ever win those fights with Gavin?” the old woman asks me.\nI shake my head, glowering.\n“You think I don’t like you,” Lady Janus Borig says. “Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. I’m trying to save you.” She turns to my mother.\n“You should let those White Oak boys thrash him a few times.”\n“What?!”\n“You’re clever enough to pick one of the younger ones who won’t do\nreal damage. Perhaps a broken nose spoiling Dazen’s looks a bit would be\nthe best thing for him. And learning that he is not invincible, that would be\nbest for the world, I think.”\nMy mother lowers her voice. “Is this… is this your gift speaking?”\n“Pshh. This isn’t prophecy. I’m simply wiser than you, girl.”\nMy mother blinks, but accepts the rebuke. Suddenly she seems very\nyoung.\n“I’ll tell him of black luxin, but I’ll tell him true, or I’ll tell him nothing\nat all. I think it would be best for him. But you’re the one who will have to\nlive with the screaming in the night from the bad dreams.”"

He was himself once\nmore. Where was he? When was he?\nHe drafted sub-red and widened his eyes. It was his own room. Click?\nWhat had that been?\nHe strode to the door, opened it, peeked out. Andross Guile was barely\ndisappearing down the hallway.\nWhat in nine hells?\nThe card memory had taken almost no time at all. The click was the\nsettling of the latch.\nHe hadn’t been certain until this moment, but now he knew: he’d lied to\nTeia. He had bungled everything, but he hadn’t sprung a Janus Borig trap.\nHe hadn’t erased the cards. He’d absorbed them all—and he had a sudden,\nclear, sick conviction they were going to drive him mad.\nChapter 81\nTeia only pretended to flee. As soon as Andross Guile kicked her out to talk\nto Kip, she walked hurriedly past the Blackguards standing watch and\nheaded down the hall and out of sight. She summoned the lift, but didn’t get\non.\nInstead, she pulled up the hood of her cloak. She looked left and right,\nsaw no one, and willed herself to become invisible.\nNothing.\nShe felt up in the neckline and found the choker, a narrow band of metal\nthat was attached to the cloak at many points. She pulled it up against her\nneck. She trembled, a shudder of revulsion coursing through her.\nNo one collared their slaves on the Jaspers. It was considered gauche.\nBeatings and other discipline were to be carried out at home, not in public.\nTo need to discipline one’s slave in public reflected poorly on your own\nmastery. Slaves, of course, knew that any public defiance, however\nsatisfying, would be met with double punishment later.\nOther cities, and other men, were not so civilized—or perhaps not so\nhypocritical. This wasn’t the first time Teia had worn a collar, but it was the\nfirst time she’d done so voluntarily. The feeling of constriction around her\nneck was almost unbearable.\nThings to do, T. Not much time, T. Could come out any second. Still\nhave to figure out how to use the damned thing.\nShe moved the loose necklace that held the little vial of oil aside. Her\nhands held the choker’s clasp loosely. Unmoving. She was breathing\ndeeply, almost hyperventilating, and not clasping the damned clasp.\nChains. I’ve done everything in my life to get away from chains.\nPart of her argued with that. Some garbage about differences between\nslavery and a cloak that empowered her. It didn’t change the visceral\nrevulsion.\nThese are the chains I choose.\nThe chains I choose.\nShe cinched the choker tight and extended her will. Teeth shot out of the\nchoker and sank into either side of her neck. They hurt so bad she doubled\nover and almost screamed."

They hurt so bad she doubled\nover and almost screamed.\nAnd then her breath was taken for another reason. She could feel it. The\ncloak had a presence within it. It wasn’t a whole personality; instead—if the\nchirurgeons were correct, and cogitation took place in the human brain—it\nwas as if the cloak had all the parts of a person’s brain that dealt with light\nsplitting and magic sunk into it, with a whisper of personality there. To\nmake this cloak, someone had given her life—or had it taken from her. The\ncloak knew how to split light in the ways that Teia had barely glimpsed\nwhen she broke into the White’s office.\nIn all her life, Teia had had to struggle for every excellence. She could\nsing, but had seen other slaves remember every note in a tune in one or two\nhearings. She could fight, but she’d seen other Blackguards combine throws\nand punches and kicks into series as fluidly as if fighting were a language\nand they were constructing elaborate arguments. Her own style was terse,\nfast, but ultimately simple, without nuance. She could look at Cruxer or\nWinsen and see that they were already maturing into the best in the world,\ntheir skills growing by leaps and bounds. That was beyond her, and always\nwould be. Her speed would get no better. Her reach was terminally short. In\na continuum that began with Big Leo and Kip and Ironfist, she was not\nstrong. Her aim would improve, as would her knowledge of where and\nwhen to strike. Among the best, she would become mediocre, every scrap of\nher skill earned only by the most challenging labor.\nNor had she any excellence in her studies. Despite his difficulty reading,\nBen-hadad could extemporize, looking at the gears and pulleys and weights\nand strengths of each luxin and designing machines as if it were play to\nhim. Kip could memorize, and make great intuitive leaps. If study were\nscrivening, they wrote in a perfect hand, and illuminated their manuscripts\nfor fun while the dullards caught up to them. By contrast, Teia held the quill\nin her fist.\nAt the touch of whatever will was animating the cloak, Teia knew two\nthings immediately. First, light splitting at the level of the old mist walkers\nwas as difficult as any magical or mundane skill in the world. It was as\ndifficult as juggling and sprinting and singing at once. Blindfolded. Second\n—more importantly—it made sense to her.\nSimply using this cloak would teach her more than any master could.\nShe already saw how this cloak was superior to the other. None of the\ncloaks—not even this one—split light beyond the visible spectrum. Sub-red\nwas too long a wave to be diverted and reformed within the thin layer of\nfabric, and superviolet was too fine.\nEven among lightsplitters, the only people who had a chance to be fully\ninvisible to all spectra would be paryl drafters. A true mist walker might use\na shimmercloak to handle visible light while using a paryl mist to handle\nthe last two spectra herself.\nAnd then it was obvious: they were called mist walkers not because they"

It was quite possible that no one in the world understood this\nlike she did. For the first time in her life, she didn’t feel inferior. She would\nhave started crying if she hadn’t heard the door open around the corner\ndown the hall and Andross Guile grunt something to his Blackguards.\nDrafting even a thread of paryl was enough to activate the cloak. Teia\nthrew the hood up and reached to lace it up over her face. But there were no\nlaces. She fumbled, looking for some kind of fasteners, and when she drew\nthe edges close, they snapped shut firmly, as if lodestones were sewn into\nthem. Much faster than the other shimmercloaks. Even with this cloak,\nthough, she couldn’t cover her eyes completely unless she wanted to be\nblind: no light, no sight. It might be worth covering them in certain\nsituations, but it would also be terrifying. Instead, she would have to rely on\ntaking quick sidelong glances or creeping around at low levels where\nenemies wouldn’t be looking for eyes.\nBeing short helped the latter, of course, but she was going to have to\ntake care that she not get overconfident.\nThe approach of Andross and his guards presented an instant problem.\nHow much did she trust the cloak, really?\nShe took deep breaths as the three men approached and stood off to the\nside, sneaking only quick glances at them to keep her eyes hidden. They\npassed right by her.\nA thrill went through her body from head to toe. Invisible!\nAndross turned to his Blackguards as they waited for the lift and said,\n“I’ll be heading to my home. Immediately. Summon a squad of Lightguards\nto accompany us.”\nOf course, they were insulted by that, and of course, they said nothing,\ntaking it like the professionals they were. But what Teia thought was odd\nwas that she couldn’t remember Andross Guile ever going to his home on\nBig Jasper. Why would he be headed to his home now?\nThe lift appeared before Teia heard any response, if there was any.\nAndross Guile was going to his home on Big Jasper on the very day that\nhis lost grandson showed up at the docks? From how Samite told it, it\nsounded like the boy was announcing who he was to anyone who would\nlisten. Teia couldn’t imagine Andross Guile going home if the boy was\nheaded to the Chromeria. Andross Guile would go to where the center of\naction was—or have the action brought to him.\nWhich meant Andross Guile was having the boy taken to his home, to\nmeet him away from spying eyes.\nWell, other than Teia’s.\nShe suddenly grinned. She leaned out into the lift shaft to see where it\nstopped. Ground floor.\nAfter waiting half a minute, she stepped onto another ring of the lift\nmechanism and set the weights. She descended slowly."

Ground floor.\nAfter waiting half a minute, she stepped onto another ring of the lift\nmechanism and set the weights. She descended slowly.\nAt the ground floor, she had to dodge several old luxiats piling into the\nlift. But they moved slowly, and she made it out with little trouble before\nthey could observe that the weight settings of the lift seemed off.\nShe searched for Andross Guile then, and couldn’t see him anywhere.\nShe went to the great, open door, soon to be shut for the evening, and\nspotted him through a swirl of white and black cloaks. He was heading out\nof the Chromeria. She followed.\nThere was something totally empowering, even intoxicating, about\nwalking unseen. Here were the drafters of the world, the cream of the Seven\nSatrapies, and they couldn’t even see her. No wonder the Order’s assassins\nloved these cloaks, even without using them to their full potential. This was\namazing.\nIt was also surprisingly challenging. Teia was used to ducking and\ndodging through a crowd, but it was one thing to brush past someone who\nbarely saw you, and something altogether different to actually get run over\nby someone who didn’t see you at all. That, and the fact that the\nshimmercloak completely cut out her peripheral vision, made simply\nmoving at a walk almost exhausting. She was constantly turning her head,\nsneaking glimpses of everything, adjusting the paryl bubble as the evening\ncrowds head back across the bridge from Little Jasper to their homes on Big\nJasper.\nShe was lucky that Andross Guile hadn’t chosen to ride. As a Color,\nmuch less as promachos, it was his prerogative. He’d chosen instead to\nwalk, which she hoped meant that he wasn’t going far. She should know\nwhere his home was, but the truth was, she’d spent all her time in the wrong\nneighborhoods. Still, it was an odd thing for a man who just a year ago had\nseemed practically an invalid. That he walked also meant that he’d picked\nup four more Blackguards, and an equal number of Lightguards. Six\nBlackguards might seem overkill, but it was a time of war, and Andross was\nthe promachos. Teia barely counted the Lightguards, other than to note their\npresence. Pretenders.\nOnce they were in the open streets, following was much easier. They\ndidn’t go far, either, and soon Teia saw the Guile estate. Its dome was, of\ncourse, gold. The great doors were black oak, studded with garnets. The\ngreat crossbeams were black oak over forever-burning atasifusta wood,\nwhich had been set alight to announce the Lord Guile was in residence. The\ngarnets picked up the red glow and reflected it beautifully in the fading\nsunlight.\nThe Guile estate was so large it was home not only to one of the tallest\nof the Thousand Stars, it also had a small yard and garden—enormous\nluxuries on the overcrowded island.\nSentry boxes stood on either side of a thick, tall gate sheathed in iron.\nSome estates had simple wrought iron gates, presumably, Teia thought, to\nlet pedestrians see through them to show off their owners’ wealth.

But\nopen-iron gates were a terrible idea for a city full of drafters: stick your\nhands through the gaps and draft freely. The Guiles valued their privacy or\ntheir defense more.\nAnd here’s where it gets sticky.\nSuddenly, Teia had to ask herself just how much she wanted to follow\nAndross Guile. He might well simply go into his home and go to bed. All\nshe had was wild guesses and intuitions. She could be risking her life for\nsimple curiosity.\nThe Guile guards opened the gate for them. Two of the Blackguards\nslipped inside, weapons drawn, while two kept an eye on the guards, despite\nthat the men were older and must have served the Guiles for decades. The\nlast two waited with Promachos Guile, carefully scanning the crowds who\ngave them wide berth.\nTeia took a deep breath and started moving. How good was she at using\nthis cloak? If she did it wrong, this was going to be the shortest infiltration\nin history.\nTucking her fears into a pocket, she strode confidently. She drafted her\nbubble of paryl mist around her. Maybe it would help.\nSomeone jostled her, stepping into the seemingly empty space in the\ncrowds where she was walking. Her paryl bubble broke apart silently, but\nshe simply formed it again and kept moving. Andross went inside, one\nBlackguard in front of him, one right on his heels. The last two, Presser and\nEssel, nodded at each other, then Presser slipped inside while the\nLightguards stood around, shifting, not even professional enough to stand\nstill when at rest.\nTeia didn’t mind; it meant they took up more room, and gave her more\nspace to move.\nThe petite, curvy Essel would wait two seconds, scanning the crowd\nonce more, then come in and shut the door immediately. Teia pressed\nherself against the closed side of the gate and slipped through the crack\nright in front of the woman.\nAndross Guile was supposed to wait for his security detail to reform, but\nhe was halfway to the house.\nA young Blackguard with a shaven head, Asif, stood at the front door\nwith the Guile guards. He perked up at the sight of his compatriots.\nStanding guard all day with house guards who don’t welcome your\noversight of them was not a favorite posting for a Blackguard, especially\nwhen one had to do it alone.\nThen Teia got lucky. Andross Guile went inside and his slave\nGrinwoody stepped outside, blocking the door. “The High Lord bids you to\nhead to the back barracks, there to await his pleasure.”\n“The back?” Asif said. “But from there we can’t even see who comes\nthrough the gates, much less who’s in the house.”\n“The Lightguards will cover the front. You will remain in the back\nbarracks until you are called, or you will be dismissed,” Grinwoody said.\n“We might as well be dismissed if you aren’t going to let us do our job,”\nEssel said. “I can rest at home better than—”"

No wonder people\nhated him.\nThe Blackguards couldn’t believe it, but in that moment of grumbling\nand curses under their breath, Teia saw a gap open, and she slipped behind\nGrinwoody and into the house.\nFor some reason, it wasn’t until Teia was in Andross Guile’s very rooms,\nfollowing the sound of his voice and the footsteps of his chamber slaves,\nthat she realized just how frightening her new power was. She’d been\nscared by Murder Sharp—but for all sorts of reasons. Teia now, Teia\nherself, had infiltrated the home of the richest, most powerful man in the\nSeven Satrapies. She had walked into the house of the promachos himself\nwithout so much as an advance plan.\nShe could now kill him, unseen, even if other people were in the very\nroom, and without any more than a suspicion of foul play. A man his age,\nunder the stresses of war, dying suddenly? It would elicit comment, but no\nmore. There wouldn’t even be marks on his body.\nWhich, she hadn’t realized until this moment, made her scary. It made\nher a predator.\nThe thought more startled her than filled her with awe or even\ngratification. I’m scary. I’m scary? I am scary.\nSomehow, before, the notion of being invisible had meant to her that she\ncould hide really well.\nIt didn’t mean that. It meant that she could strike from shadows—no, not\neven the shadows—she could strike from anywhere, and simply disappear.\nShe could kill, and be at almost no risk of being killed.\nMurder Sharp hadn’t precisely shown her how to kill with paryl yet, but\nshe had seen him do it once, and she wasn’t stupid. He’d taught her how to\npinch nerves, how to move paryl through solid flesh. All you had to do was\nmake as many little crystals of paryl as you could and let them go to the\nbrain or the heart or the lungs. It might take Teia five crystals or ten rather\nthan a practiced assassin’s single try—but what did it matter if you were\ninvisible and no one would notice your failures?\nAndross was being attended by three attractive female room slaves of\nabout thirty years of age. They took his tunic and gave him a sponge bath,\nwith quick, practiced motions, wasting no effort and not getting his trousers\nwet. He was flabby over a powerful frame, sweaty from a mere brisk walk:\na fact he obviously noticed with displeasure. Teia guessed that was why he\nhad walked tonight. He was trying to recapture the vigor of his younger\nyears.\nAnd vigor it must have been, for he had the scars of a warrior-drafter on\nhis torso and arms. With her eyes downcast, the edge of the hood just high\nenough to let her see the women’s legs—and to therefore guess when they\nwould move—Teia slipped past them and took a place in a nook on the far\nside of his bed, well out of the way of any traffic she could imagine."

Clearly Andross wasn’t patient at\ndrawing forth reports from his slaves. “It’s the young Lord Zymun, sir. He’s\nterrible free with his hands. One of the younger girls slipped away from\nhim. He fell while chasing her. He shouted that he’d broke a rib and she’d\npay with her life. She’s been weeping since.

Slave girl, so no telling, my lord.”\n“The others he bothered. All blonde? All pretty? Short? What does he\nprefer?”\nThe slave Deleah chewed her lip, thinking. “Pretty, yes, my lord.\nThough Overseer Grinwoody makes sure all the girls who serve upstairs\nare. Not much preference otherwise, far as I can see, my lord.”\nGrinwoody came in the room. Andross motioned for his room slaves,\nwho’d been waiting silently, to leave. But as Deleah got to the door, he said,\n“Deleah. Right side, or left?”\nShe turned, blinking, then understood. “The ribs on his right side, my\nlord. A bruise, not a break.” She clearly wished it had been worse.\nAndross said, “Tell Leelee and the others it won’t happen again.” For\none moment, Teia thought perhaps this man wasn’t so bad. Surely the\ntreatment of those in his care is a good test of a man. Then he said, “I’ll not\nhave weeping slaves in this house.”\nThe room slave bobbed and disappeared.\nGrinwoody extended a tray with a crystal glass full of amber liquid to\nAndross Guile. “The vile one awaits in the red parlor, my lord.”\nAndross grinned. “Never liked our toothy guest, have you, Grinwoody?”\nHe sipped the liquor. His mouth twisted. “This is that Barrenmoor?”\n“My lord.”\n“You’re certain it’s coming into vogue?”\n“My lord,” Grinwoody said. It was, again, affirmation.\n“Hmm, that which is powerful and distasteful does have its place,\ndoesn’t it?”\nGrinwoody said, “Let us hope that hiring Sharp does not come into\nsimilar vogue.”\nAndross laughed aloud, and Grinwoody grinned. It was more\ndisconcerting than seeing Andross Guile half naked. These men were\nfriends. There was no falsity in that laugh or that grin. They might have\nvastly different stations, but both liked and respected the other. Grinwoody\nhad clearly been an instrumental part in Andross Guile’s rise. “Any new\nupdates about Eirene Malargos?” Andross asked.\n“None.”\n“I still worry about that.”"

But sending them too\nearly would allow her to turn on us later. Your way, she’ll be allied to us\nforever. It’s worth the gamble, my lord. We’ll know by tomorrow,\nregardless.”\n“You’ve got all in order to send her the news immediately? Good. To\nmatters closer at hand, then. Have that whore Mistress Aurellea make sure\nthe girl she sends tonight is blonde. Sixteen, seventeen. Slender.”\n“You still wish to reward Zymun?” Grinwoody asked, a tiny quiver of\ndoubt in his voice.\n“I don’t wish to, but time is short. And knowing what he likes in the\nbedchamber will be one more tool in hand. If he’s as charming as he thinks,\nonce he settles in at the Chromeria such information will be more difficult\nto acquire. Might as well do it now. Actually, take Zymun up to my solar.\nDinner can wait. Make sure he doesn’t see Sharp. And wait there with him.\nHe can cool his heels. Take some of the Barrenmoor. For yourself. Don’t\ngive him any. I want him off balance. You may lay hands on him if\nnecessary.”\n“With pleasure.” Grinwoody bowed and left.\nAndross Guile paused at the door. In his brocade and Abornean goat’s\nwool and cloth-of-gold and murex purple, he looked a king of old. He put\nhis hand on the doorframe, though, and bowed his head, taking a few deep\nbreaths.\nThen he turned on his heel, sharply, and walked back into the room.\nHe came around the bed and straight for the nook where Teia stood. Her\nheart jumped, and she almost bolted. Almost attacked. She looked to his\nleft, but the wall was too close; she would brush against him.\nThe only way open was up onto the bed. She jumped lightly onto the\nbedframe, one small foot on the side frame, one on the headboard, an arm\nstretched out to push off one of the bedposts to hold herself in place; if she\nstepped on the bed itself, she’d leave an unmistakable dent in the blankets\nand mattress. It was a brilliant bit of balance, especially given how\ndisconcerting it was to not see your own limbs. The only problem was that\nstretching out so far like this exposed one boot entirely on one side, and her\nhand and forearm on the other.\nBut Andross was already past her, bending down to pick up something\nthat had been placed in Teia’s nook. It was a painting of his late wife, Lady\nFelia Guile. The frame had been broken, and there was a tear through the\nmiddle of the canvas itself. He stood, holding it delicately.\nIf he turned counterclockwise, toward the room rather than the wall,\nTeia would be face-to-face with him. With how much of her was exposed,\nhe couldn’t miss her.

Teia tried to scoot her foot along the frame and the\ncover of her short cloak, but all her weight was on that foot. It wouldn’t\nslide.\nAndross turned in toward the room—disaster! But he was holding the\npainting up. It passed between Andross and Teia, blocking his view, the\nframe nearly cracking Teia’s nose.\nHe carried the painting back to his desk, and Teia, breathing once more,\nstepped silently back into the nook. Her heart was pounding so loud it was a\nmarvel she wasn’t shaking the entire house.\n“Fee,” Andross said quietly. “Forgive me for this.” He fingered the tear\nwhere he’d obviously punched through the canvas. “I was wrong. Like so\nmany other times we fought. You hurt me, leaving like that. It felt like\nbetrayal, but I’m sorry, too. I shouldn’t have forbidden you the Freeing this\nyear. Oh, but my dear, if you could only have stayed to see me now! One\nmore year! You could have held on one more year, could you not? But I\nwasn’t myself, stuck in that room. I know. I thought my light would fade\nbefore I could do all I promised you so many years ago. I need you, my\ndear one. What I must do with a sword, you could do with a smile.” He\ntraced the line of her cheek with a finger. “I shall never find your like\nagain.”\nThen he cleared his throat, and composed himself. He hurried from the\nroom as if he could leave tenderness behind.\nTeia didn’t know why, but that unexpected gentleness made her more\nfrightened of the promachos than any coldness she’d seen from him. She\nknew that if he found out that someone had seen him during that moment,\nhis vengeance would be terrible.\nAs if breaking into his house and spying on him would result in only a\nfirm talking to?\nThey can only kill me once.\nThe thought didn’t make her feel any better.\nChapter 82\nAfter giving Promachos Guile some time to get ahead of her, Teia followed.\nHe was at the bottom of the stairs by the time she reached the top of them,\nand she had to wait. Should have followed closer. Going down the steps\nwould expose her feet, especially if someone were below her. If she had\ninstead followed him closely, the angles would have made it much more\ndifficult for him to see her.\nSome invisibility.\nShe headed down the stairs carefully, putting as much of her weight as\nshe could on the handrail, skipping the steps she’d noticed creaked. Here, at\nleast, was one good thing about being small: she didn’t weigh much. She\nheard a bell ring from the room where Andross Guile had gone. She made it\nto the bottom of the stairs without any problem, and heard him speaking to\none of the attractive slaves who’d been upstairs.\n“There’s a damaged painting in my quarters.

There was a brief opportunity to slip into the\nroom, between the two Lightguards. But if one so much as shifted…\nShe hesitated, and Andross dismissed them.\nThe two Lightguards were both big men. Not the hard, professional\nwarriors that made up the Blackguard, and part of Teia couldn’t help but\nsneer at them. But they did look like they knew what to do with a cudgel.\nBoth had noses that had been broken multiple times and flab over big\nmuscles. The one on the left had the red nose of a drunkard. The one on the\nright walked with a slight limp. The most salient detail about them, though,\nwas that they took up the whole damned hallway as they walked side by\nside.\nTeia retreated down the wall, walking backward carefully, only stealing\nglances at the men’s feet so they wouldn’t see her eyes. Stairs or doorway?\nShe pressed herself into the recessed doorway.\nThey turned toward her door, trapping her.\nThe one on the left, closest to the door, put his hand on the high latch,\nright next to Teia’s face. She held her breath. “You thinking what I’m\nthinking?” he said to the other one. He turned his head to the other man as\nhe pulled the latch down. The handle brushed Teia’s shoulder as it turned,\nbut he didn’t notice. He didn’t push the door open, either. Still trapped.\n“You touch the brandy cabinet one more time, you’re gonna get us both\nwhipped,” the limper whispered. He looked around nervously. “He’ll smell\nit on your breath, Arrad!”\nThere was nowhere to go. If the man moved forward quickly, he’d run\ninto her before she could retreat. She couldn’t open the door herself and slip\naway; his hand was still on the latch. There was no space to slip between\nthem. They formed a perfect, closed crescent, with her between them and\nthe door.\nBefore she realized quite what she was doing, Teia was drafting. She\nwas already drafting paryl in order to keep the cloak functioning, and the\ninstantaneous thought shot through her: Is this what other drafters talk\nabout? Reds spoke of feeling their own passions twice as deeply, blues\nspoke of a cool logic, but Teia had never felt anything at all from paryl. This\nodd, unlikely creativity or awareness or…\nShe swept paryl through the second man’s leg. There was a mesh point\nwith paryl between a gas and a solid where you could shoot a stream but\nstill direct it. She’d tried this a hundred times and succeeded twice, both\ntimes when she didn’t think about it too much—which was maddening. But\nit worked again. She felt the knot in the limper’s bad knee, and seized it,\nsolidifying the paryl and pulling until the paryl broke.\nThe limping Lightguard’s leg folded, and he fell. He cursed as he hit the\nfloor.\nThe drunkard Arrad let go of the latch to see what had happened, and\nTeia pushed the door gently so it swung open slowly as if he’d pushed it a"

The Lightguard started laughing at his friend.\n“Here you were worried about me. You’re the one who looks drunk!\nThat dodgy knee again?” he asked.\nBut Teia didn’t wait to hear any more. She disappeared into the room.\nThe room was some kind of parlor, with a hallway opposite where Teia\nhad come in, heading toward another wing of the house, and another door\nvaguely in the right direction.\nTeia put her eye to the keyhole. In the room beyond was a staging area\nfor the slaves to bring up the food from the kitchens below and put it in\norder for presentation in the dining room that must be farther in. It was\nalmost dinnertime. That room was full of slaves, all moving quickly to and\nfro: the quick pace of a smoothly run household, but almost literally\nrunning. Impossible to get through there.\nFrom the hall Teia had escaped, she heard Grinwoody, raising his voice\nfrom the top of the stairs, summoning the Lightguards.\nShe went back into the hall as they disappeared upstairs and made her\nway—finally—back to the door where the promachos had gone. It was\nclosed.\nFor one heartbeat, she thought of going back around, through the slaves’\narea. She was quick, agile, small, and fucking invisible.\nThen she heard Murder Sharp’s voice, and her guts turned to water.\n“Kidnapping’s a two-man job,” he said.\nKidnapping?\n“Use Adrasteia. It will be a good test of her loyalty.”\n“I’m not worried about her loyalty. It’s her upper-body strength I’m\nconcerned about. If the mark gets difficult, I have to use the blackjack and\ncarry her.”\nTeia couldn’t even take pleasure in the thought that she’d truly fooled\nMurder Sharp. Instead, her mind was spinning: ‘Her’? Who were they\nplanning to kidnap?\n“Is she coming back?” Murder asked. “From wherever you take her?”\n“You don’t need to know,” Andross said.\n“I need to know whether she can see my face when I grab her. If you’re\ngoing to let her go afterward, it makes the job that much harder. People tend\nto remember me. My good looks and all.”\nA hesitation. Then, finally, Andross said, “No, she won’t be coming\nback. Do whatever you must to bring her to me. I need her uninjured. I’ll\ngive you a few days to ready your plans. Use whom you will. If it’s not\nAdrasteia, make sure whoever you use is disposable. And dispose of him.”\nTeia put her eye to the keyhole and saw a vision out of nightmare.\nMurder Sharp was wearing his cloak, but hadn’t laced up the mask. With\nhis body invisible, his head seemed to float in the air, his eyes dilated full\nparyl black, the whites pushed to oblivion. But as disconcerting as Teia still\nfound his eyes, the effect was heightened a hundredfold by his wide grin.\nMurder Sharp had swapped out his dentures of perfect white teeth for a set"

Thirty-two dogteeth, perfectly fit\ntogether, in Murder’s deliberately wide grin.\n“Gladly,” Murder said. He passed his tongue not so much over his lips\nas over his teeth, seeming to savor the touch. He shook his head like a dog\nshaking off water, and let himself shimmer back into visibility, his eyes\nnarrowing to human dimensions.\n“Now, about that matter at the Chromeria,” Andross said. His voice was\nall business, unmoved by the horror in front of him. Not pretending to be\nunafraid, Teia thought, but actually unafraid. This was his world, and he\nwas master of it and all the beasts within. The pure confidence struck fear\ninto Teia.\nCan only kill you once, the logical part of her said, but these people\nwere so far beyond her that the rationality was thin as an eggshell. If\nAndross Guile caught her, she would be less than a slave. He would turn her\ninto an animal.\n“It’s done,” Murder said. “She doesn’t know and never will. Trick I\nmade up myself. Bits of paryl all around her heart. She feels tired, and\nsimply… dies.”\nSome words that Teia couldn’t hear, then “—the most delicate of all\nluxin?”\n“Don’t matter. If they break up, she strokes out and dies anyway.”\n“But…” Some words Teia couldn’t hear followed. “… by morning?\nYou’re certain?”\n“Probably dead already.”\nWho are they talking about? Who does Andross Guile want dead?\nBut her thoughts were interrupted by their footsteps. She glanced\nthrough the keyhole, and saw they were walking toward her door.\nShe retreated to the steps, and then went up them as quickly as she\ncould, pressing hard on the handrail to take her weight. With her eyes stuck\nto the door, she almost forgot to skip the creaky steps, and stumbled. She\nrolled onto the hardwood floor at the top of the steps, and quickly threw the\ncloak over her exposed legs.\nShe tried to free slack in the cloak so it would drape over all of her, but\nshe was sitting on it, and the hands she put down to lift her butt also landed\non the cloak. She shifted, exposing her hands—and realized she was\ncovering herself with a visible cloak. She’d stopped drafting paryl.\nFor a moment, she was so frightened, she almost yelped. In her panic,\nshe locked up and couldn’t draft at all.\nThere were doors every direction from the top of the stairs. If anyone\ncame—\nTeia rolled to her feet despite the voluminous cloak, and drafted paryl.\nHer chest heaved. Orholam’s beard, a moment of inattention could mean\ndeath. Panic, T? You’re better than that. Knock it off.\nShe looked down the stairs where Promachos Guile was escorting\nMurder Sharp to the door.\nShe was careful to look in quick glances so as to hide her eyes, but then\nrealized that the cloak wouldn’t hide her from paryl vision.\nIn fact, she wasn’t sure that she could hide from paryl vision ever, even"

Everyone you taught became more\nthan a rival. It would mean deliberately creating threats to yourself, in a\nworld where a true mist walker had few.\nWith the faint tinkling of the bell hung over the lintel, the front door\nopened and closed without the men saying any farewell. Not the type, Teia\nsupposed. Then Andross Guile came up the steps. Teia guessed which way\nhe was going, and was right for once. He passed by without so much as a\nglance her way.\nWhat was she doing here? What had started as a lark had a very real\nchance of getting her killed. And for what? Because she was curious to see\nKip’s brother? He would surely be coming to the Chromeria eventually.\nWhy not wait?\nGood question to ask myself a while ago, but now I’m here.\nI didn’t come to see Kip’s brother; I came to see what Andross Guile is\nplanning, and there’s no way I’m going to leave before I do.\nAndross walked down a hallway, up another set of stairs, and into\nanother sitting room. This kind of space within a single house on an island\nwhere everyone lived cheek by jowl and rents were ruinous seemed\nobscene. One old man lived here, one. Actually, he didn’t even live here. He\nbarely visited. And yet he had this staff, in addition to the slaves who\nmaintained his apartments at the Chromeria—and his wife’s empty\napartments there. What other dead person got to keep apartments in the\nChromeria, where space was perpetually tight?\nTeia thought that she was going to have to decide if she was going to\nfollow Andross into a room to eavesdrop again, or if she was content\ncatching bits and pieces in the hallway, but it wasn’t much of a decision. As\nshe rounded the last corner, she saw that the Lightguards from before were\nstationed at the door, and Grinwoody was scuttling about like a cockroach.\n“Grandfather,” a young man said. He was astonishingly handsome, as\none might expect of the son of Gavin and Karris Guile. He had Atashian\ncaramel skin, with strong brows and an aquiline nose, and wore a fine gray\ntunic with slashes of color to match the many colors in his light blue eyes.\nShe knew him! He was the one who tried to kill her in the fort on Ruic\nHead. Tripped her, knocked her sprawling, took her pistol, and then ordered\nhis men to kill her. This, this was Kip’s brother?\nThe young man didn’t simply bow; he prostrated himself on the floor\nbefore the promachos.\nI’m going to hate myself for this.\nBut Teia couldn’t bear to miss this conversation.

I’m a deft hand with a pen.\nPenmanship, art, luxin designs, I excel at them all. And of course I know\nthe phrase you told me to say when we met: ‘Of red cunning, the youngest\nson, shall cleave father and father and father and son.’”\n“You don’t carry much family resemblance,” Andross said.\n“And Kip does?” Zymun shot back instantly. “He’s darker than Gavin!”\nTeia could see that Andross Guile didn’t much like being addressed as\nan equal. “How much do you know of Guile family history?” Andross\nasked.\n“I know we rule,” the young man said.\n“You know we rule?” Andross said, mocking. “And you presume to\ncorrect me?”\n“Not a correction, my lord, simply standing up for myself. I thought you\nwould appreciate—”\n“I would appreciate the respect I deserve. You grovel in one heartbeat\nand ‘correct’ me the next?”\nZymun looked aghast. “I’m terribly, terribly sorry, my lord. I know but\nlittle of the family history. The—folk—who raised me were not keen on\nteaching Guile history. I stand to learn.” He bowed his head, and if Teia\nweren’t already disposed to hate him, she would have believed him\nchastened.\n“Hmm,” Andross Guile said. He said nothing for a long time. It\nstretched to an uncomfortably long time. Grinwoody stood still as a statue.\nAndross drank his liquor slowly, and Zymun finally squirmed, but didn’t\nsay anything.\nFinally, Andross said, “Well then, we shall begin your education, and\nperhaps at the end have a little test, to see if you have the Guile mind. If you\nfail, you’re useless to me, even if you are what you say. A stupid Guile is no\nGuile at all.”\nTeia’s heart soared, while Zymun nodded with feigned confidence over\nfear.\nAndross said, “During the Blood War, some prominent families began\narranging marriages with an eye to war instead of to political alliances. The\nGuiles were the first of these. My great-great-great-grandmother Ataea was\nfrom a small noble family that supplied half of the horses for the chariot\nraces in Ruthgar and Blood Forest, and almost all the champions. Galatius\nGuile was a drunk who was bent on wagering away the family fortune at\nthose races. She rescued his fortune by telling him which horses to bet, and\nsoon stole his heart. She convinced him that marrying down—to marry her\n—would be the bravest act of his cowardly life. It turned out to also be the\nsmartest one.

Her husband, like every other noble she met or could learn\nabout, got a single line: ‘Galatius Guile: drunk, gambler, a bit dimwitted,\nblue eyes, no drafting, inspires loyalty in family and beyond.’ Later in her\nlife, her journals got more extensive, noting skin tone, musculature, bravery,\nheight, and relative fertility. It helped, of course, that she herself had\neighteen children and lived to be a hundred and five years old. She arranged\nmarriages that defied politics, bringing in the blood of the brilliant but\nimpoverished, the hale but unconnected. Where other families fought over\nwho would marry the beautiful or the rich, thus driving up the cost of\nacquiring those matches, she instead believed that having smart warrior-\ndrafters would result in riches and power both—in the long term. She even\nbirthed several bastards of her own from the great men of her day, and\nclearly noted the fathers in her book, with no apparent shame.\n“In that first generation, she was either very, very good; very, very\nlucky; or both, because almost every child born was a drafter. That she was\nsimilarly lucky with several other attributes wouldn’t become clear for a\nfew more generations. Which pleased her. After all, if other families are\nbecoming smarter and more magical, too, where’s your relative advantage\nover them? In fact, no one would have even known the logic behind her\nscheme if she hadn’t infuriated one of her grandsons by refusing to let him\nmarry a girl he loved. He rebelled and ran off to a Blood Forest family that\ngladly took his secrets, and later, when Ataea refused to pay his ransom, his\nlife.”\n“Nice people,” Zymun said.\nBut the sarcasm hit a wall. For a few moments, Teia almost took hope in\nhow much Andross Guile seemed to dislike Zymun. Then she realized he\ndidn’t much like anyone. Or maybe he’d just been so powerful for so long\nthat he never bothered to conceal it when someone displeased him.\nHe was the opposite of a slave, and yet his constant truths were no more\nwinsome than a slave’s constant lying smiles.\n“No one has kept that book as well as Ataea Guile did, and war has\nintervened again and again, killing men and women before they could\ncontribute their children to this family. Bastards have been brought in, and\ntheir patrimony concealed. But in eight generations of faithful record-\nkeeping—and sometimes nine and ten and twelve, for Ataea researched the\nfamily before her time back as far as she could—the Guiles have learned a\nfew things about what’s heritable, what’s highly heritable, and what seems\nto be a dice roll. Of course, I don’t believe in dice, but I understand that\nthere are systems whose workings I don’t understand. A lesson you might\ndo well to learn.”\nZymun looked appropriately chastened. “Yes, grandfather,” he said.\n“Grandfather? Haven’t connected it yet, have you?

Who takes their first interview with Andross Guile, with\ntheir entire fate in his hands, and doesn’t pay attention to the first thing he\nsays?\n“Do you think me stupid, boy?” Andross asked.\n“Of course not,” Zymun said breezily, but it sounded like a lie. Who\nspoke so fearlessly to Andross Guile?\nAndross Guile slapped Zymun across the face, hard.\nZymun’s fists balled and his whole arm tightened. Somehow, Grinwoody\nwent from standing off to the side with a serving tray to being right there,\nserving tray vanished, ready to intervene.\n“One of the things we’ve tried hard to breed out with every generation,”\nAndross Guile said. “Impulsivity. Those who can’t control themselves are\nalways failures. I see this is a weakness for you. Expect it to be tested again.\nSeems endemic with the Guile blood, but the best of us translate it to\nboldness, nimbleness, readiness to seize an opportunity. The rest simply\nchase the first thing to come along, and lose interest before they run it down\nand capture it.\n“The point is that I have a very good idea what traits are Guile traits, and\nwhat traits seem random. Blue eyes with dark skin? Very rare among most\npeoples. Not rare in my family. There’s a lot of Parian blood in the Guile\nline. My brother was darker than Kip. Our mother was Parian, as was my\ngrandmother. I was thought to be oddly light-skinned. If there is one of my\ngrandsons whom I suspect might not be a Guile, it’s not Kip.”\n“Kip? The bastard?”\n“I’ve declared Kip legitimate. Kip does what he’s told.”\nIn what world does Kip do what he’s told?\nBut lie though it might be, now, for the first time, Zymun seemed truly\naware that his position was tenuous. It was as if he’d made the cornerstone\nof his identity that he was, secretly, a Guile, that he had all seven satrapies\nwaiting for him, that he was destined. And now his own grandfather was\nthreatening that?\nBut Kip had told Teia about his own interactions with Andross Guile, so\nshe saw what was happening. Andross hated his new grandson’s arrogance,\nso he was doing to him exactly what he’d done to Kip, pretended that\nbelonging to the Guiles was something that had to be earned.\nIt was patently ridiculous to Teia. The Guiles had no children. To whom\nwould the old man give all this wealth? He’d gone on and on about\ngenealogy, but he’d failed to produce a large enough crop of his own to give\nhim the luxury of being picky. There remained only Kip and Zymun. Gavin\nwas gone, probably never to return, and even if he did, where did a\nmarriage to Karris fit into Andross’s book? The threat had to be hollow."

Everything\n—”\n“You think I’m punishing you? I haven’t even begun to punish you. This\nisn’t my punishment. This is reality’s punishment. I can’t make you the\nPrism tomorrow. We need the Knife for that, and… other things that you\ndon’t need to know about. Yet. Your incompetence may cost us—it may\ncost you everything. Had you either killed Gavin or joined him—either\nway!—if you had brought me the Blinder’s Knife, your own future, not to\nmention this family’s, not to mention all of the Seven Satrapies’, would be\nassured.\n“Someday, you cretin, you may lead this family and perhaps this world,\nif you aren’t too stupid to take what I hand to you. But that day is not today.\nFrom this day forth, you obey without question, and you prove yourself\nworthy of this family. I’m giving you one chance. You have a brother, and\nhowever much he pretends to oppose me, he and I have an understanding,\nand he serves me well. If he serves better than you do, I will not hesitate to\nmake him the Guile heir. From Ataea Guile’s time, we have only practiced\nprimogeniture when it suits us. The only way you will inherit is if you\nplease me. And so you know, in this family, the one heir gets everything.”\nThe ambition on Zymun’s face was as naked as the hatred, but Andross\nGuile didn’t seem to notice. Zymun said, after a pause that was only a little\ntoo long, “Of course, grandfather. How may I best serve?”\nAndross Guile stared at him and tossed back his liquor with a grimace.\n“Tomorrow we make you the Prism-elect.”\n“I thought the White had to acquiesce to any recommendation the\nSpectrum brought her for that. I was under the impression she wasn’t a\nfriend.”\n“She isn’t, but she’s doing me a big favor tonight.”\n“She’s signing off on it tonight?”\nAndross Guile gave a thin-lipped smile that was all victory. “In a\nmanner of speaking,” he said.\nHe didn’t explain any more to Zymun, seemingly pleased to deny a"

She\ncouldn’t believe she hadn’t put it together before now. A woman that\nAndross Guile wanted dead, and Murder Sharp being here—after being at\nthe Chromeria earlier.\nSharp wouldn’t go to the Chromeria simply to test Teia; the place was\ntoo dangerous for him. He’d come to scout, and he’d used Teia to scout the\nlast part, and used what she reported to help him kill the White. No doubt\nnow Sharp would make himself highly visible somewhere on the other side\nof Big Jasper for the entire night, just in case a drafter stumbled across\nsome paryl in the old woman’s body.\nMurder Sharp would have an alibi.\nFor a moment, blind rage flooded Teia. Who would hurt that kind old\nwoman? How dare he? Murder Sharp was an animal, but he was merely a\ntool. It was Andross Guile Teia wanted to kill. How could he stand so close\nto goodness for so long, and hate it? Such things—for sure they are not men\n—should not be allowed to be.\nShe could kill him. She could kill Zymun. She could kill Grinwoody.\nNo, not Grinwoody. Slaves shouldn’t be killed for the sins of their masters,\nno matter how much they seemed to enjoy facilitating them.\nWould it not be a service to the greater good to kill these detestable\nmen? Would it not be a fulfillment of the Blackguard’s oaths? She hadn’t\ntaken the final oaths, but she knew them, and had wanted to take them for as\nlong as she could remember.\nI swear upon my life and light and sacred honor to protect the White, the\nBlack, the Prism, and all the members of the Spectrum of the Seven\nSatrapies, and in the final exigency to protect the Seven Satrapies. I shall\nlive not as a woman free, but as a slave to my duties and after them to my\ncommanders. The final exigency was when a Prism went mad, and refused\nto lay down his powers, and had to be put down, but Teia supposed it also\napplied if a Color or even a promachos went mad and did the same.\nShe began filling herself with paryl, not simply the constant stream she\nneeded to keep the shimmercloak functioning, but enough to make\nweapons.\n‘Protect,’ Teia. The word is ‘protect.’ Not ‘avenge.’ You are not to be a\nblade in the darkness, you are a shield. You are not a woman alone, you are\na soldier under authority.\nIf I kill now, I’m an assassin, not a Blackguard.\nI am a special soldier, with uncommon skills and unique abilities, but I\nam a soldier under orders. If the White commands me to kill Andross Guile,\nI will kill with joy in my heart, and a conscience clean of murder, though\nguilty of rejoicing in it.\nThe world might be better if I were a law unto myself, if I killed these\nloathsome men.\nShe sat on that thought.

She’d killed a man in that alley, almost on\naccident, but he’d been a man who would have killed her or her team if she\nhadn’t. Aside from the heaviness of killing at all, when she looked at the\nsituation, she couldn’t see a moment when she would have acted differently.\nMore competently, sure. But she’d trained as hard as she could for as long\nas she could. Her skills at that point in time weren’t something she could\nchange. She would have done what she did again. This…\nDear Orholam, what harm will these men do that I might prevent?\nBut it wasn’t her place. Orholam had put her here, but he’d put her in the\nBlackguard, too, and he’d put a longing in her whole heart to be a\nBlackguard. She couldn’t betray all that. She was called to be a shield, and\nshield she would be.\nAnd like that, the cobwebs cleared and what she had to do was simple.\nThe White wasn’t dead. Not yet.\nTeia waited only until her chance came, and slipped out of the room. She\nmade her way downstairs, stilled the bell above a servants’ door to the\noutside, and went out. She slipped past the Blackguards, climbed the roof of\nthe stables in the back, and vaulted over the high fence. After a block, she\ndropped the invisibility and simply ran.\nShe was almost all the way back to the Chromeria before she realized\nthat both Andross and Zymun could see in the sub-red. If it had occurred to\neither man to look in sub-red while she was in the room, she would be in a\ndungeon or dead right now. The thought made her sweat run cold.\nLucky, T. Now let’s hope that luck holds.\nChapter 83\nGavin had expected some casual cruelty on his way to the hippodrome, like\nbeing forced to wear a hood, or locked in a carriage or palanquin with\nsomething disgusting so that his last sight before the cheering crowds would\nbe of filth. Instead, he was allowed to ride inside a normal carriage, albeit\nwith doors that locked from the outside, and windows too small to wiggle\nthrough.\nHe was also chained and tied up nearly as much as he would have tied\nup himself in this situation. But still, he could see, and by luck, he got the\nbetter window.\nHe wanted to think that knowing these were among the last things he\nwould see lent everything a certain poignancy, but the truth was that the\nGreat River Delta was always beautiful, and now, with Sun Day on the\nmorrow, it looked as vibrant as he’d ever seen a day in whites and grays\nlook.\nAs the carriage rumbled through the cobbled switchbacks down Jaks\nHill where the great families had their estates, Gavin could see the myriad\nfarms stretched out on the plain below. With the warmer weather and the\npassing of time, the floodwaters had deposited their yearly tribute of fertile\nsilt. Some fields were now dry. Others were muddy. Some few were still\nunder a bare thumb of water. Thousands of shorebirds filled land and sky."

Thousands of shorebirds filled land and sky.\nEgrets and herons and cranes and ducks and geese and red-winged\nblackbirds had arrived from their migrations or emerged from hiding.\nRushes and cattails and a thousand kinds of grass had sprung up in the lines\nbetween perfect fields. The land must be a debauched party of greens and\nbrowns and points of color like jeweled fingers flashing in torchlight.\nGavin’s monochromatic vision was a curse once again. This world had\nfaded to textures.\nHe sank back into his carriage seat.\nSome part of him still expected a crash at any moment, a violent stop,\nfighting—rescue.\nBut none came. The image of the baby black widow spiders rolling over\nhim in a wave changed. Now the eggs were grains of black powder, wadded\ndown the blossoming barrel of a blunderbuss. Gavin, the elder, watched: a\nhole in his forehead, a hole in his jaw, head bobbing like an old man with\nthe twitching sickness because the tendons supporting his head had been\nclipped by the passage of bullets and brains out the back of his skull. Dead\nGavin smiled around broken teeth, blood washing from the front of his head\nand his mouth and the back of his head, too, too much blood for a man to\nbleed when his brain had been stopped. Too much blood for a man to bleed,\nperiod. He cocked that blunderbuss, aimed it at his little brother’s stomach.\nHe fired.\nThe blunderbuss vomited black death through Dazen’s guts. He jerked,\nlooked down with trepidation. All his soft tissues were gone. He stood on\nhis spine alone. A writhing mass of black spiders fed on his guts, grew into\nadults in moments, and swarmed, devouring. They climbed his spine,\nwrapped under his hanging skin, and went inside his rib cage. They\ndevoured his lungs. He couldn’t breathe, feeling them from the inside,\ntaking life from his very core. And then they ate his heart. It seized, labored,\nthumped one last time, and stopped.\nHe fell. Opened his mouth to seek some forgiveness, but only spiders\nburst forth, burning his esophagus like bile, spewing over his tongue,\ncrawling out of his nose. He was covered with black spiders, a living\nstinging biting blanket, sticky as tar. His brother stood over him and\nlaughed. His eyes crinkled and he leaned forward—Dazen had forgotten\nhow Gavin did that, how he doubled forward, eyes shut when he laughed\nhard.\nNow Dead Gavin stood over him, laughing, and the sun shone through\nthe hole in his head like a third eye. The beam of light fell on Dazen just as\nthe spiders began crawling up his cheeks. They were going for his eyes! He\njerked, but his arms were useless, his mouth pried opened. And then the\nspiders began attacking his eyes, biting, poison squirting deep into those\norbs, filling his precious orisons with acid.\nGavin jerked awake. They were in the city proper now.

He gulped and\nblinked, the sun high above, cutting through the gap in the carriage’s\nwindow curtain. Not quite noon. He was sleeping through his last sights.\nBut still the dream clung to him. Would Gavin laugh at him like that,\ndoubling over, out of breath? Or would he have some compassion for him\nnow, at the end?\nHis guards chuckled. “Never seen a man who could sleep on his way to\ntorture. You got stones, friend.”\nGavin looked at the guard, searching him for some sign of humanity.\nWas this man part of his escape plan? No. No. Hope is the great deceiver.\nHope is the piper who leads us sleepy to our slaughter.\nI shouldn’t have killed you like that, brother. It wasn’t worthy of me. It\nwasn’t worthy of you. I don’t think you would have taken shriving from\nme, but I should have offered. Should have given you a chance to prepare\nyourself. Killing you without warning, that was for me. That was for my\nnerve, which I knew would fail me.\nBecause I still loved you. And love you still.\nA Guile’s love is a bullet through the brain.\nHe bowed his head even as the sounds of the hippodrome floated down\ninto the street. A race must have been under way. The streets were packed,\nand though carriages had the right of way that came with crushing power, it\nstill had to slow as they approached the enormous crowds around the\nhippodrome. The carriage added its tinny bell to the din: shouting voices of\nvendors, angry yells from other drivers, a distant yell decrying a thief, the\nthrobbing roar of the crowd inside the hippodrome swelling in time to their\nfavorite chariot coming round, the hoots and jeers of fans outside, the\nrattling of tuned bamboo wind chimes and more, cowbell and brass and\ndrums competing among the fans.\nBut the colors were mute. Gray on gray on dark gray on black. The\nsmell of cooking pork and curries and roasted nuts in caramel was far more\nvivacious. Gavin peered through his curtain and saw a little boy in rags,\nlean to the point of starvation, staring back at him.\nA lookout for the rescue?\nBut the boy merely watched him go by.\nThe carriage turned and went down a long ramp, accompanied by many\nshouts, and then was swallowed by darkness. A gate rattled shut behind\nthem. This area was off-limits to the public.\nAnd Gavin’s last ember of hope died. They didn’t know he was here.\nLike so many other things, his father had been able to keep it secret. Gavin\nwas going to lose his half-useless eyes, and then he was going to die. Funny\nhow he was more worried about his eyes than his life.\nThey have stolen light from me. What is life without light?\nThe carriage door opened. He was bundled out, hands bound behind his\nback, hobbled by his chains so that he had to take tiny shuffling steps. They\ndidn’t help him.

After walking hundreds of paces through winding corridors\nbeneath the very hippodrome itself—the roof rumbling with hoofbeats as\nthe chariots raced overhead, the roar of the crowd barely rising to\nperception—Gavin was put in an iron-barred cell. More a cage, really. It\nwas fitted with chains connected to gears, and high above, there was a panel\nthat slid back. This cage would take him directly up into the stadium floor.\n“On your knees,” a soldier said. He waited until Gavin complied before\nhe came into the cage himself, carrying a bucket full of black liquid. Or\ndark liquid, anyway. The soldier was careful, too. He didn’t keep the key,\nbut handed it off to another, outside the cell, and locked the door behind\nhimself.\n“Dunk your head. Not your skin, just your hair,” the soldier said. He\ndidn’t seem to relish the duty. Gavin looked up at him, not understanding\nwhat he wanted.\nThe man locked up suddenly, muscles clenching so obviously that his\nfriend called out, “Something wrong?”\n“No,” the soldier said, after a brief hesitation. “I got this. I’ll call for\nyou.”\nAnd then Gavin recognized him.\n“Captain Eutheos. Citation for Extraordinary Bravery at Blood Ridge,\nwasn’t it?” Gavin said. He remembered belatedly that that was his own\nmemory, pinning that ribbon on the man’s chest. He’d been Dazen then. As\nGavin, he should have no memory of Eutheos. Oops.\nAh well. What would have been a gigantic blunder at some other time\nnow seemed a bit trivial.\nThere was a gigantic clatter and roar of wheels and hoofbeats pounding\noverhead as the massed chariots passed, but it was obviously a familiar,\ninconsequential sound to the captain.\nThe sudden joy on the soldier’s face bloomed and died in an instant, an\nabortion of hope.\n“It can’t be,” he said. “They ordered me to dye your hair and eyebrows\nand make you look scruffy. I didn’t know why, but… High Lord Prism…\nDazen Guile?” the soldier whispered.\nA crushing weight settled on Gavin’s chest. There had been a time when\nhe would have tried to turn this man, when he would have blithely ordered\nthis man to do something that would cost him position, and reputation, and\nfamily, and probably life, all for the slimmest chance that Gavin might,\nmight, escape.\nBut he’d been young then. All his invincibility had been built on other\nmen’s bones.\n“It’s not your fault,” Gavin said. “It’s mine.”\n“I swore you my fealty, my lord, all those years ago, but… I swore them\nmy fealty, too, after the war.”\n“It’s not your fault,” Gavin said.\n“I, I, I gave him the key. If I, if I have to call him back, I’ll have to steal\nit from him, hurt him—he’s my brother-in-law, and devoted to this land\nsomething fierce. He wasn’t in the war. He doesn’t know what it was like.”\nThe captain looked around like a trapped animal. “Which oath does a man\nhold, when holding one means breaking the other, and he never saw it\ncoming?”"

They don’t want to chance\nanyone recognizing you like I done—as either Prism or as Dazen, I s’pose.\nBut how are you alive? What do I do?”\nGavin was still on his knees. “Eutheos,” he said. “Be still.”\nAnd the man was still. This, at least, Gavin still had. His voice was\nsometimes magic over other men.\n“Breathe.”\nAnd Eutheos breathed.\nChariots passed overhead again, but they seemed far, far away.\nThere was no escape from here. If Eutheos unlocked Gavin’s chains,\nGavin could go no more than a few hundred paces. He wasn’t strong\nenough to fight. He couldn’t draft. He couldn’t get out. And there was no\npoint ruining a man and his family for a futile gesture.\n“Captain, before I release you from your oaths, as your last duty to me,\ndye my hair, and black my eyebrows as you’ve been told. I ask only that\nyou keep the dye from my eyes. They will burn soon enough.”\nAnd so he did. He did his job thoroughly, and well, and silently, tears\nstreaming down his face. He dried Gavin’s hair with a cloth, and blacked\nhis eyebrows with coal, and then ground dirt and ash onto his ruddy skin to\nmake him look no more than a beggar.\nGavin said, “I’ve no more right to compel you, soldier, but as a man, as\na comrade who once took up arms with you, I ask a favor. Will you send a\nletter to Karris Guile at the Chromeria of my fate? And tell her that I will be\nmurdered by the Nuqaba’s assassin as I arrive in Big Jasper. Don’t put your\nown name on this letter, nor anything that can be traced to you. It will be\ndeath for you if it is intercepted.”\nFormer Captain Eutheos nodded and swallowed. “My lord. You made\nme feel part of something. It was the only time in my life that I—” He cut\noff, clearing his throat as his brother-in-law the soldier came back, this time\nnot alone. Eutheos said gruffly, “Let me outta here, would you? Got some\ndirt in my eyes.”\nHe was let out, and the other man unlocked and locked the door\ncarefully, as if the still-bound Gavin might attack at any moment. The\nwoman who was with that soldier, though, surprised Gavin. It was Eirene\nMalargos, not the Nuqaba. She dismissed them and they moved out of\nearshot.\nShe looked tired. “I didn’t want this,” she said. “You’ve done nothing\nhere that would exact such a penalty under Ruthgari law—but you also\nknow that I can’t let you attack my ally and do nothing. Were she forgiving,\nshe would let us handle this in our way. She’s not chosen that route. I see\nwhy she is feared.”\nGavin simply stared at her. He reckoned from her mood that Eirene"

He reckoned from her mood that Eirene\nMalargos would shut down instantly if she felt she were being manipulated.\nGavin’s golden tongue was suddenly worth what his eyes would be, soon.\nShe said, “I’ve been looking for any avenue that doesn’t lead to war?\nYou damned men, always trying to prove who’s bigger. I just want to live. I\nwant my people to live. I don’t know how to avert this. Do you know I tried\nto align us with the Guiles?”\nGavin’s eyebrows must have twitched, betraying his disbelief.\n“Even after the insult of you rejecting our proposal that you marry Tisis,\nI proposed your father marry her instead. A temporary alliance, perhaps,\ngiven that your father is probably too old to give her children, but a gamble\nworth making with so many lives at stake.”\nMy father? With Teats Tisis? Me with her?\nA thunderous clamoring resounded overhead as a mass of chariots\npassed all at once.\n“But he spurned her,” she said.\n“Outright?” Gavin asked. “That doesn’t sound like my father. Does he\nnot know how close you are to betraying him?”\n“I don’t know what he knows. I sent a ship with my diplomats and\ninstructions for my sister. It was intercepted by pirates. Perhaps you\nremember?”\nOh. In more ordinary times, that the ship Gavin had been rowing on had\nintercepted the very ship that his enemy was depending on for vital\ncommunications would have been a stroke of extraordinary luck. It still was\nextraordinary luck, he supposed, just not the good kind.\nA huge cheer went up, above. The race had a winner.\n“Believe me,” she said, “I’d prefer to wait until I hear more from the\nChromeria, but the Nuqaba is insistent. And I can’t split with her. If Blood\nForest falls—and it is falling, even now—I can’t stand against the Color\nPrince on my own. Even if the Chromeria finally decides to send enough\nhelp to change things, I’ll have trouble securing one border against the\nColor Prince. What if the Nuqaba attacks me from the east? We would be\nlost in little more than the time it takes her armies to march.”\n“Oh, I see what this is,” Gavin said. “You’re going to let her take my\neyes, and you still think I might be made an ally afterward.”\nHer lips thinned. “Your eyes are lost already, Gavin Guile. Put them in\nthe ledger with my dead father and forty thousand other dead Ruthgari\nfathers and mothers and sons and daughters. Then do your calculations. If\nyou want to save the Seven Satrapies, you need me.”\n“If you attack me, you’ve already attacked the Seven Satrapies. I am the\nSeven Satrapies, and treason is death.”\nAnother, last chariot clattered overhead.\nHer face steeled. “Look at yourself before you threaten me, Gavin Guile.\nYou are not that which once you were.

All you can do is try to save an empire that is no longer yours. That’s\nyour option, but know this, Gavin Guile, once-Prism: no one spurns the\nMalargos family thrice.”\nShe spat on him. No doubt she’d intended to spit in his face, but most of\nit hit his shoulder.\nStill, it communicated the feeling fairly clearly.\nShe walked out. “I’ll ring when it’s time,” she told the soldier. Then she\nwas gone.\nThe soldier said nothing.\nGavin said nothing. Eirene had been his last hope. He knew it. He knew,\nand yet he couldn’t believe. There had always been some way out for Gavin\nGuile. There had always been a door that his genius and his power had let\nhim open that no one else had even seen.\nThat was me.\nWas.\nSeveral minutes later, a bell rang. Gavin cracked his neck right and left.\nThe soldier went to a lever and pulled, and Gavin began his ascent. The\ngreat trapdoor overhead sank and slid aside in a shower of sand and sunlight\ninto his darkness.\nHe remembered, for one moment, that which he did not want to\nremember—he remembered emerging from the very bowels of darkness,\nbringing hell to earth at Sundered Rock, and climbing step by step out of it,\nthe darkness finally parting and light pouring in, but light weaker, light\nstricken, light sickened. The world was not what it had been, before his\nvictory, and he thought it not his eyes alone that had changed.\nUntil now. What I did was sixteen years in catching up to me. Why so\nlong?\nThe great murmurs of a crowd of fifty thousand souls hit him first,\nbefore he even emerged from the darkness. Layered atop that was the thin,\ncutting voice of Eirene Malargos, projecting as loudly as she could. She had\nnot the gift of orators and singers and generals, though. At the far points of\nthe hippodrome’s open floor, women who did have that gift listened intently\nand then repeated each line perfectly. It gave an odd, delayed response, but\nEirene had learned the art of keeping her speeches short and pointed. Some\nnonsense: this man attacked our guest; according to Parian law, this\nmalefactor will lose his eyes for his crime.\nWhat else was there to be said?\nAnd the crowd, Orholam forgive them, whipped up by their favorites’\nvictories or losses, roared with bloodlust. Gavin’s people, they had been.\nNow they roared for his eyes.\nAnd roared once again as he came level with the ground and they saw\nhim for the first time."

The rich families of\nRuthgar took turns sponsoring the games and races. Even the absent Guiles\ndid it, though not as lavishly as others. Gavin couldn’t see the Guile red on\nthe banners or on the tunics and ribbons worn by those—he assumed—few\nwho still favored his family here. But he could recognize his family’s crest\non the biggest flags. This was the Guiles’ race day. Gavin was going to be\nblinded at his own party.\nYou are one vindictive bitch, Haruru.\nHe was surrounded by soldiers and three drafters, each with their hands\nalready stained with color. He guessed blue, red, and green, though there\nwere too many scents in the air to tell for sure. That was where most people\nwent for offensive magic. They were serious. Gavin was unchained, forced\nto stand, and marched over the sand toward the spina, the center line of the\nhippodrome, which had a raised platform on it that would insure that\neveryone would be able to see his punishment.\nSame platform he’d stood on when he ended the Blood War.\nHe stumbled on his hobbles as he climbed the stairs, and laughter rang\nout.\nHis people. How he hated them.\nThen he saw the coal bucket, smoking. Two iron pokers rested in it, each\nwith a tip as narrow as a pupil. He looked around the hippodrome. Fifty\nthousand people, and not one friend. In the satrap’s box, he saw the Nuqaba\nlooking at him, smiling. She was mouthing something to him. She was too\nfar away for him to read her lips, but he could guess: ‘Useless.’ She was\nenjoying Gavin Guile impotent at least as much as she would enjoy seeing\nhim blinded. Then she and everything else became a blur. He saw people\nmoving, mouths moving, but he stopped hearing.\nHe remembered, strangely, as if cobwebs were being cleared from a hall\nof memory he’d not trod in decades, Lady Janus Borig visiting when he was\na child, treating his mother like no one treated his mother, and telling him,\n‘Black luxin is the scourge of history. It is madness in luxin form. It is the\nsoul poison. Once touched, it lives within a drafter forever, slowly eroding\nher from the inside. In every world, there is that which is haram, that which\nis forbidden, and in every world, that is the thing most desired, for there is\nthat in us which loves destruction. Here is a test for your wisdom, young\nGuile. It is the only test that matters. In this world, Orholam has given us\nsuch power as even the angels have not. It is the power of evil unfettered. It\nis the destruction of history itself. It is madness and death and being-not. It\nis void and darkness. It is the lack of light, the lack of God himself—the\nlack that men rightly call hell. It is black luxin, and that color—though\ncolor it is not—that color, Dazen Guile, is your color.’\nAnd he’d believed her. He’d known then he was the cursed brother, the"

And what she’d said had been true.\nAnd at the end of all things, when every color is gone, darkness remains.\nGavin could see only in shades of gray.\nAnd black.\nHow did I forget that? How did I, who remember all things, forget that\nday? Is that a real memory? Was it merely lost among all the myriad others?\nBut there was no time for that now. Not on this, his last walk.\nDrafting black luxin wasn’t something you could test. It was a cocked\nand loaded pistol. You pulled the trigger, or you didn’t. And if you were\nable to draft it, and you did…\nHell, hell on earth. The smoking ruins of Sundered Rock. The charnel\nhouse, the gore, the rage and madness and slaughter and vileness of poison\npoured onto the world as from a spigot as big as the sky itself.\nGavin looked around the hippodrome, and in shades of gray and black,\nhe saw not a single friend. They jeered and they hated and they knew him\nnot. They, whom he had saved from a war that would never end, they hated\nhim and wished pain and death upon him. For nothing more than their\namusement.\nThey were, in this moment of bloodlust and casual cruelty, an open\nwindow into hell.\nGavin could bring hell to them, and in so doing, save himself.\nIt was the only way to save himself.\nHe looked at the mutely roaring masses: the sounds might have been the\nsusurrus of the waves on the shore for all he heard them, and he realized\nthat if they had been threatening him with death, he wouldn’t do it. He\nwould die for these ingrates. Not happily, but willingly.\nBut to be blinded, to be made useless, to be disgraced, to be mocked, to\nbe impotent, to be pitied? To be shorn of sight and light and power was to\nbe made not–Gavin Guile. It was all he had built for his whole life. It was\nall his worth.\nOr he could draft the black once more, triumph once more, rise once\nmore, a shadow figure caked in the ashes of his enemies’ burnt flesh and\ndreams.\nTo be Guile is to have will titanic. It is to move the world according to\nmy pleasure. To be an Unmoved Mover, to be like unto God.\nTo be Guile is to kill without hesitation those who stand in your way.\nEven if it be a stadium full. Even if it be your brother.\nTo be Guile is to be great but not good.\nBut I’m not only Guile, not anymore. I’m a husband and a father now.\nI’m more than a conqueror. What if what I’m losing isn’t worth what I’ll\nlose to keep it?\nKarris, will you understand? Kip, will you someday see that this isn’t\nmy moment of weakness?\nThey seized him, and of all the acts of will in a life famed for them, it\nwas by far the greatest that he resisted them not.\nThey bound him to a table.

First, they put thick leather straps\non his feet and wrists. Then luxin locked even his head in place.\nHe was on his back, on sand, staring at the sky. Like he was afloat on the\nocean, lying in the skimmer, dangling his arms out to each side, looking at\nthe placid heavens. Either this was Orholam’s peace, or Gavin had finally\nlost his mind.\nA man came to stand over Gavin and pushed his eyelid down, making\nhim blink. Then luxin flowed around his eye and opened the eyelid. The\nluxin gelled, solidified, and held his left eye wide open. Bound to the table\nas he was, it left him looking directly at the noonday sun.\nYou can’t stare at the sun. You might go blind.\nGavin burst out laughing.\nHe was staring eye to eye with Orholam’s Eye, the sun. And he couldn’t\nlook away.\nWhat had that scurvied pirate said? You keep up your lies, and you’ll be\nstricken blind? What lie was I supposed to not tell? There were so many.\nWas it only telling the truth to Antonius Malargos? I am a fabric of\nshadows, Orholam. There is naught else to me.\nThe drafter spoke to him, but Gavin was beyond words now.\nStaring a challenge at the sun, but still I could draft the black. I could\ntake my noonday shadow, withered though it is, and cast it over all the\nworld.\nA woman in a chirurgeon’s coat stepped close, looming over Gavin. She\nwas plain, and pale, and paler than her usual pallor, Gavin guessed.\nBlanched white as only the pallid people at this arc of the satrapies could\nblanch. She wore two heavy leather gloves. He couldn’t hear her, but he\ncould read her lips. Though she didn’t know he was the Prism, she was\nbegging for his forgiveness. He’d seen those words pass lips in their\nthousands and thousands, every Sun Day.\nStill I could draft the black. Orholam, you do not show half the mercy I\ndo.\nKarris, I will miss seeing your smile.\nThe chirurgeon lifted the first white-hot metal poker from the barrel and\nscuffed the coal particles from the metal with quick strokes. She braced her\nhip against the table and brought the smoking hot point over his head,\nholding it in both hands, burning like a second sun. She moved carefully,\ncarefully.\nLast second. Last chance. This is it.\nThe glowing metal descended, the bright white point of that terrestrial\nsun blotting out the celestial one.\nHe’d been like this. Last time. At the point of death. And had refused to\ndie. Hands outstretched, like now, only facedown that time. Arms\noutstretched, and he’d reached out and embraced all hell.\nAnd it was there, beneath his fingers like a smothering blanket of black\nspiders, ready to be thrown over the face of the world, over the face of the\nsun.\nThe black luxin trailed under his fingertips like all the waters of the"

The sound of his sizzling eyeball was the first thing he heard as all\nsound came back.\nHe’d known it would hurt.\nHe’d had no idea.\nHe screamed his soul.\nChapter 84\n“Karris, you have to wake up. Right now.”\nKarris blinked to find Marissia shaking her. “Marissia, what are you\ndoing? It’s not even light out.”\n“It’s Gavin. One of my spies has just reported.”\nThat woke her instantly.\n“Gavin’s imprisoned in Rath, and he may be executed.”\n“When? How do we know? How good is the source? Where?” Karris\nmoved toward the bureau where she kept her blacks.\nMarissia stepped in her way, put a hand on her arm. “Today,” she said.\n“Today?! And we’re learning this now?!”\n“I have an idea,” Marissia said. “Mind you, not a good one.”\nAnd now here Karris was, agreeing with the last part more and more\nwith every windswept league. Gavin’s invention of the skimmers should\nchange everything. They might even save his life.\nShe’d grabbed all the Blackguards she knew could keep their silence and\nwhom she knew had a fair bit of drafting left until they broke their halos,\nbut she hadn’t told everyone. There hadn’t been time. She’d hadn’t looked\nfor Ironfist, certain that he would have seen this foolishness for what it was\nand tried to stop it.\nBut there he’d been, at the Luxlords’ dock at the back of the Chromeria,\nwaiting.\nShe took a deep breath and lifted her chin, gathering her thoughts. He\nwas as imposing as his arguments would be good. And that was if he even\nbothered to argue with her, rather than simply throw her over his shoulder\nand carry her away.\nHe scowled at her and she moved to speak. He spoke first. “You can go\nget yourself killed, but you’re not going to do it alone.”\n“You have to let me—What?”\nIronfist let her struggle under a glare that weighed more than she did.\nThen a little smile stole onto his face.\nShe jumped onto him and hugged him, hard.\n“Gah!” He caught her, startled, then pushed her away. “Karris, there’s\nno, there’s no hugging in the Blackguard!”\nShe smiled up at him. “You’re cute when you’re flustered.”\nKarris couldn’t count the emotions that passed over his face, but twice\nhis mouth opened to say things, and nothing came out. He stepped back\naway from her, then looked irritated that he’d retreated. He settled on a\nglower. “I brought baggage,” he said, gesturing over his shoulder.\n“I’m baggage?” the Blackguard inductee named Ben-hadad asked.\nBut Ironfist ignored him, noticing all the Blackguards looking at him,\ngrinning their fool faces off. “What is this?!” Ironfist barked at them. “Lives"

The whole point of the Blackguard, and you’re lolling\nabout? Skimmer! Now!”\nThey scattered like deer at a musket shot, and only then did a small,\nsatisfied smile steal over his face. He looked at Karris and sniffed. “The\nroom slave told me your plan. Terrible plan. This one here will make it\nwork, though.” He made a grudging motion to Ben-hadad.\n“I… what?” Ben-hadad asked. His hinged spectacles, with their multiple\nlenses sticking up, looked like alarmingly distended eyebrows.\n“The baggage.”\nBen-hadad looked nonplussed. Then, “Oh! Oh, the dress! What’s the\ndress for?” He pulled out of a bag the frilliest riot of a dress that Karris had\never seen.\n“Lady White Oak needs a maid,” Ironfist said. “The dress is for you.”\nBen-hadad’s mouth dropped open. He looked down at the dress in his\nhands. Dislodged by his movement, the lenses on one side of his spectacles\ndrooped.\n“He’s joking,” Karris told Ben-hadad.\n“He’s, he is?” Ben-hadad asked. Relief washed over his face.\nIronfist looked as close to smug as he got. “You do gears and whatnot.\nMachines?”\n“Yes, sir,” Ben-hadad said, confused. “But I’ve never—”\n“You’ll make one for Lady White Oak.” Ironfist seemed to stress ‘lady.’\n“While we ride.”\nSo they’d started, in those hours before dawn, burning a fortune’s worth\nof magnesium torches to do what drafting they could early. It was enough to\nget halfway through building the skimmer.\nUsually the Blackguards made sea chariots. With the difficulty of the\ndrafting and the expense in life lost to draft so much so quickly, their craft\nneeded to last more than a few voyages to be worth making. Thus they\nmade heavier, durable, and slower craft.\nNot this time.\nBut even with seven of them together, they couldn’t draft the craft as\nquickly as Gavin could have done it alone. The man could intuit the shape\nand density of luxins required, and, of course, didn’t need to communicate\nwhich luxin needed to go where to anyone else. He just did it.\nKarris spent all morning as they crossed the waves trying to come up\nwith a better plan. She had no doubt Commander Ironfist was doing the\nsame. From his silence, she guessed he had failed, too.\nFive exhausted Blackguards traipse into the middle of fifty thousand\nangry civilians whipped into a frenzy by the brutal chariot races and\nwhatever lies the Nuqaba had dreamed up and do… what, precisely?\nThere just weren’t good options. Not with time running out. What could\nKarris do? Threaten the Nuqaba? With what? Bribe her? With what? Say\nthat an army would avenge Gavin? Perhaps even true, but it would come\ntoo late for him.\nShe looked at Ironfist. “Could you…?” The woman was his sister. He"

He\nkept a picture of her in his room. She knew he thought about her often.\n“You don’t know the Nuqaba,” he said. He never called her his sister; he\nnever used her name. “If she even sees me, this only gets worse.”\nDawn was nearly six hours past now, the sun perilously near noon.\nAround the skimmer, the five drafters who’d come with her—two of the\nothers had exhausted themselves building the craft and stayed behind, not\nworth the weight they would add to the skimmer—were all bent against the\nwind, cutting up the Great River past galleys and galleasses. Everyone other\nthan Karris and Ben-hadad wore eye caps rather than spectacles, enduring\nthe glue and the discomfort in a trade for keeping them on and being able to\nsee even at these great speeds.\nEverywhere, they attracted stares. None of the people on shore had ever\nseen a ship move at such speed, and though they might have heard rumors\nof skimmers and sea chariots, seeing one was different.\nThey angled the skimmer up river channels. Karris and Commander\nIronfist both had been here before. The hippodrome was carved into\nRathcore Hill—the smaller twin to Jaks Hill in an otherwise flat plain. But\nwhile the hippodrome complex was elevated above the floodplain, a deep\ncanal had been dug to allow ferries to transport horses and goods directly to\nthe hippodrome’s basement.\nAs they approached the vast iron gate blocking river access, Commander\nIronfist looked at Karris. “New plan?” he asked.\nThey both looked at the defenses. The gate itself could be blasted open\nor opened by a guard at the counterweights. The soldiers guarding the gate\nand the hippodrome, ironically, were wearing Guile livery. The Guiles must\nbe sponsoring these races, so they were in charge of the expense and\nmanpower of securing the hippodrome during the race and clearing and\ncleaning it afterward.\nIt would have been a great stroke of luck if they’d had hours to call the\nGuile steward, convince him or her who Karris was, and enlist them to help.\nThere was no time for that.\nWe could just kill them. Tragic, but their lives against Gavin’s? Karris\nwas willing to make that trade.\nBut there were at least a dozen of them, most of them at the gate to the\nbasement itself, where someone was shouting up the results to the races to\nthem as they happened.\nThey could kill twelve, no problem. But how many more were around\nthe hippodrome, within a minute’s run? Karris and Ironfist could get in, but\nwhat if Gavin wasn’t there yet? Or what if he’d already been taken above?\n“The timing’s impossible,” Karris said.\nIronfist veered the skimmer into an open space between two riverboats.\nThey spilled out onto the dock, ignoring the stares of the merchants and\nsailors. “Ben-hadad, Essel, guard the boat. Ben-hadad, that spot there.” He\npointed out in the canal. “Make sure it stays clear. If it isn’t deep, make it\nso.”"

Hezik, with\nus.”\n“Ben-hadad, do whatever you’re going to do.”\nHe approached her warily. “This is not going to be comfortable,” he\nsaid. “Hold your left eye open. You can’t blink.”\nShe did and he lifted a tiny lens on delicate luxin fingers, swabbing the\nlens itself one last time to make sure it was free of dust—and then placed it\ndirectly on her eye. It was about as enjoyable as she’d guessed getting\npoked in the eye would be. She blinked.\n“No—you weren’t supposed to blink—” Ben-hadad said. “Is it still in?\nNext one.”\nThey repeated the process. It took two tries, and left her streaming tears.\nBut she looked up at him and Ben-hadad said, “I’m a genius.”\nCommander Ironfist grabbed her face in his meaty hands and turned her\ntoward him. It was so disconcerting when he touched her face.\nHe looked troubled, but said nothing, merely nodding.\nBen-hadad had not only made almost impossibly thin blue lenses that sat\ndirectly on her eyes, he had patterned them exactly to the luxin patterns\nalready on her retinas. To anything other than long study, Karris would\nappear to simply have blue eyes.\n“How long?” she asked.\n“A few hours. Try not to blink too hard.”\nIt would have been great, she’d joked, if she drafted blue. Ben-hadad\ntook the criticism to heart, and had incorporated a bit of red luxin—which\nsomeone else had needed to draft for him, on a speeding, windy skimmer—\ninto the lens itself, but only directly over the pupil. With the black pupil\nbehind that dot of red, it was unnoticeable. One lens red, one lens green.\nKarris wished she could try it out, but drafting at all risked destroying\nthe disguise. Cursed pale skin. She would undo the good months of\nabstaining from drafting had done.\n“Ready,” she said. She didn’t look a drafter at all.\nIronfist and Karris and Hezik ran up the steps from the docks, Karris\nespecially drawing stares with her dress that was all cleavage and a flood of\nwhite lace and blue satin and a pink ribbon on her right hip the size of a\ngreat ship. She hiked up skirts and petticoats and thanked Orholam that she\nhadn’t put on the elevated shoes, too.\nAs usual, Ironfist moved with purpose. He cut between stalls, heading\nstraight for the hippodrome’s wall. Karris’s wide skirts knocked over a rack\nof petosae, and she cursed the dress again, never mind that her life was\ngoing to depend on it in moments.\n“Sorry, sorry,” she said, shooting the biggest, stupidest smile she could\nat the old man who ran out to catch his hats.\nHe looked at her face, her dress—and then her cleavage—and seemed to\nforget his anger, at least long enough for her to escape.\nIronfist brought them to the wall.

All the entrances were packed with people and Guile soldiers. Twenty\nfeet above them here was a sentry box and a narrow walkway that\ndisappeared into the hippodrome: a lookout to spot supplies arriving.\nIronfist must have already given an order to Hezik while Karris was\nflirting with the merchant, because Hezik’s brown skin was already tinged\nblue. He moved instantly to the wall, put his back to it, and squatted\nslightly, putting his thigh at a good angle to step up on.\nWithout hesitation, Commander Ironfist approached at a slow jog. The\nrhythm was important, and as always with Ironfist, the rhythm was perfect.\nHe stepped on Hezik’s thigh, then up off his shoulder, then into the hand\nHezik had raised above his head. A small luxin platform sprang up out of\nHezik’s palm, shooting Ironfist into the air, his own jump magnified.\nThe jump was so perfect that Ironfist merely put his hands on the railing\nas his body went over it and into the walkway, as effortless as a farmboy\nvaulting a stone fence.\nAnd then it was Karris’s turn. In this damned dress.\nShe gathered up skirts in both hands, and took a deep breath against the\nrib-breaking bodice, nodded the tempo to Hezik and jogged. Step, step,\nstep.\nKarris wasn’t as tall or as strong as Ironfist, but she was a great deal\nlighter. Hezik overcompensated and launched her luxin platform too hard.\nShe flew up and off to the side, but Ironfist was there, dodging to the side\nfast enough to arrive in place and put out his hand and arm as stable targets.\nShe snagged his hand, and he swooped her up and into the walkway.\nIt worked perfectly except that the boned skirts smacked Ironfist in the\nface as she spun, poking him in the eye. He didn’t let it interfere with\nsetting Karris down in the walkway, but he was left blinking.\nKarris looked down in disgust. “This thing is hideous,” she said.\n“The very pinnacle of fashion is to wear the hideous with great\nconfidence.” Ironfist rubbed his eye, but he did it as he jogged over to the\ndoor. It was chained shut, and the door itself was stout old wood. The\nhinges were on the other side. Ironfist was in the lead, and he went right to\nthe barred window. Who the hell put a door that sturdy up here? Who\nbothered to chain it shut?\nShaking the door to test its hinges, Ironfist immediately got the attention\nof someone on the other side.\n“Would you open the door?” he asked smoothly. “My lady friend and I\nseem to have gotten locked out.” He smiled as if they’d been up to\nmischief.\n“Go to hell,” Karris heard from the other side.\nBrave words, when Ironfist was on the opposite side of a chained door.\nIronfist turned. “I saw a man on the spina. Being bound for punishment.\nIt’s not Gavin.” He hesitated, though."

Even emaciated and with his hair dyed,\nshe couldn’t mistake him. “Sir,” she said louder. “Please…?”\nThe man turned, frustrated. “Do I look like I have a key? I’m trying to\nwatch the show.”\nKarris nearly shot a spike of luxin through his head.\nThere had been some hope while they’d thought the chains might just be\nlooped around the other side. But locked, too?\nShe looked at Ironfist. They could break through the door, but it would\ntake time and noise. That would draw soldiers. And if Gavin was already on\nthe spina…\nIronfist looked up. There were no more walkways or sentry boxes above\nthem, but there were open spaces between the broad arches—twenty-five\nfeet up. Not only was it higher than their first jump, but it would mean\nrunning forward, jumping forward, and grabbing sideways. If they did\nanything wrong, Karris would be launched away from the hippodrome and\nwould land in the market below. Far below.\nIt was too dangerous.\n“Ladder?” Ironfist asked. It was possible, but it would take time to make\none that would bear even Karris’s weight over this kind of height.\n“Shh. The crowd just went silent,” Karris said.\nIronfist took his place instantly, squatting slightly, right hand over his\nshoulder, a flat blue platform already drafted in it. “If you need to, you\ncome out the way you went in,” Ironfist said. “They won’t expect it. Five\ncount. Gavin first. Plank out.”\n“You think you can?” Karris asked. She’d taken her position already.\nPlank, from up there? She paled. As if that was the insane part of this plan.\nBut before Ironfist could answer, the crowd in the hippodrome erupted\nin groans. Something terrible had happened. It was the same sound they\nmade when a chariot wrecked, or a man was dragged to death by his horses.\nThat was how it always went: a shared groan, then a cheer.\nThey cheered.\nKarris drafted green for the first time in half a year, carefully packing it\nin areas covered by the dress, and the wildness filled her. Her eyes lit. This,\nthis was life. She wasn’t too late. She couldn’t be too late. Not when she\nwas this close. “One, two, three, four,” she said, giving the tempo for the\njump.\nIronfist’s face was stone, the tight muscles in his jaw giving the only\nindication that he’d entered battle readiness, the whites of his eyes flooded\nwith blue.\nKarris jogged the few steps. With battle juice flowing and green luxin,\nshe rushed the tempo she’d set. But Ironfist had practiced with her, fought\nwith her. He knew; he adjusted."

The first step was fine, the\nstep to Ironfist’s shoulder was fine, but the skirt caught for a fraction of a\nheartbeat between her foot and Ironfist’s hand.\nIronfist threw her hard into the air, springing the platform high and hard\nto give her the maximum height. But that little hitch put her off balance.\nHer leg strained to take all the pressure and she flew up—but not high\nenough, and out into the empty air.\nSomething big and blunt smacked into her butt, adding to her fading\nmomentum, shooting her higher into the air. It was Ironfist. He’d noticed\nher jump was wrong and immediately tried to help her get higher. But the\nblue luxin scoop snapped immediately as he tried to use it to angle her in.\nWorse, the boost twisted her body so that she was facing the street. All\nthe green luxin she’d readied to extend in hooks was useless. Then some\nprimal part of her remembered something and acted before it could rise to\nthe level of thought. She snapped her hands out and streamed unfocused\ngreen luxin into the empty air.\nLike a tiny rudder steering a mighty ship, it didn’t take much. She threw\nluxin, and the luxin threw her back—toward the vast open arch. She started\nspinning, but too late. Her left leg hit stone, and she tumbled.\nIn.\nShe’d made it. Her butt had cleared the ledge, just barely.\nKarris hopped to her feet amid the standing crowd. No one had even\nnoticed her entrance except one little girl on her father’s shoulders. The girl\nwas patting his head, trying to get his attention. Karris straightened her\nskirts, brushed off the dirt, and pushed hair out of her eyes.\nNow, the hard part.\nChapter 85\nAliviana Danavis spotted the superviolet seed crystal after midnight. She\nand Phyros were camped just off the bare rock that made up the north\npeninsula of the Everdark Gates. The sailors they’d hired had refused to\nmake the climb, their fear so great that Liv had left her last remaining\ndrafters with them, to make sure the sailors didn’t abandon them here. For\nthree days, Liv and Phyros climbed alone, guided only by Liv’s intuition.\nShe hoped it was a sense of superviolet, but she wasn’t sure.\nUntil now.\nThey had found a campsite just below the final pitch, where windblown\ngrasses gave way to the bare rock of the cliffs of the Gate itself. The site\nhad obviously been used by every party ever to make the climb to stare out\nover the Gates and the sea.

She’d loaded the pistol herself, so it was\npossible she’d done it improperly and the ball had fallen out.\nBut on all four? The only question that remained was when it had been\ndone, and by whom. One of the drafters or sailors, back when they were on\nthe galley? Or by dear Phyros?\nShe took a deep breath, and that was when she saw the seed crystal. In\nthe air above and perfectly between the Everdark Gates, a winking,\nspinning crystal like a star hung low. Something about the moonlight made\nit glow cool in the visible spectrum.\nLiv rose and started walking, barely aware of herself. In the superviolet\nspectrum, the crystal looked entirely different. It was hard to get any idea of\nthe size of the thing. Light in the visible spectrum seemed unaffected by the\ncrystal, and indeed, overwhelmed it. In the superviolet spectrum, though,\nthe delicate light of a thousand stars bent toward that one point. When the\nmoon emerged from a cloud, its powerful light beat down, scattering the\nsuperviolet streams like iron filings in a wind. But the moon’s face was\nhidden once again, those delicate streams were sucked toward the seed\ncrystal as to a lodestone.\n“Aliviana!” Phyros said. “Where are you going?”\nDuring the day, it would be invisible even in the superviolet. The sledge\nof sunlight was too strong. This tiny point of light would be a mote in a\nstorm.\n“Eikona!” Phyros said.\nLiv made her way up the bare rock promontory, captivated. The\nEverdark Gates were more than twice as tall as the Prism’s Tower, and from\neach side it was a straight drop from promontory to frothy sea, hundreds of\npaces below. The waters of the Cerulean Sea warred with the waters of the\nocean outside, sometimes jetting through the narrow channel with\nincredible force one way, and at others, the opposite direction. Rocks lined\nthe channel like teeth of every size. Some were barely above the surface of\nthe water; others were taller than a galley’s mast. Liv couldn’t imagine how\nany ship could ever make it through the maelstroms.\nShe reached the top of the Gate, an unnaturally flat plain of bare rock\nseveral hundred paces wide. A road etched into the stone itself led out to the\nprecipice.\n“Eikona!”\nThe road was flanked by ancient statues, now broken down to nubs by\ntime and weather and vandals or invaders. Liv walked the road, transfixed\nby the shining crystal that would change everything. It was, she was certain\nnow, no larger than her fist. Maybe even smaller than that.\n“Eikona, that’s far enough,” Phyros said, grabbing her arm.\nShe stopped and stared hard up at him, as if shocked and disgusted he\nwould touch her.\nHe released her. “Liv, I’m sorry, but you are to go no farther unless you"

That is what our prince has ordered.”\nShe stepped back and pulled a pistol from her belt and pointed it at him,\nand then another.\n“You’re not going to shoot me,” he said.\n“Am I not? Look in my eyes and tell me I lack the will to do it,” Liv\nsaid.\n“It isn’t will you lack,” Phyros said.\n“So it was you.”\nHe looked confused. Then, briefly, frightened. If she knew her pistols\nhad been unloaded, did that mean she’d loaded them again?\nShe had thought to talk to him, to appeal to the loyalty she thought she’d\nbuilt in him, to offer him a choice, to appeal to logic. But he wasn’t a\nsuperviolet or a blue drafter; Phyros was a warrior. He attacked instantly,\nand was on top of her before she could think.\nHis gigantic hand was around her throat, squeezing, throwing her into\npanic. With his other hand he flung the pistols away from her hands,\ngrabbed the others from her belt, and tossed them away, too. The sword and\nknife at her belt followed, as the blackness closed in.\nPhyros carried Liv by her neck and her belt up the weatherbeaten stairs\nout to the very point of the promontory. She curled into a fetal position and\nkicked, kicked blindly. Then they reached the top.\nHis hand was still wrapped around her throat, though loosely now, and\nhe was pawing through her pockets. He found the necklace and pulled it\nout. He pushed her back until she was on the very edge of the cliff. The\nwind whipped them. She could barely breathe. There was no strength in her.\n“What’ll it be, lady, the black or the abyss?” He loosened his grip just\nenough for her to speak.\n“The blade.”\n“What?” he asked. Perhaps the wind had swallowed her words.\nShe rammed the hidden blade her father had given her deep into his\nchest, twisted hard, and pulled it back.\nHe pulled away instinctively, which was the only thing that saved her\nfrom falling off the cliff as he dropped her. She flung herself toward the\nground and rolled past him.\nHe roared wordlessly and drew his huge sword. He darted forward and\nstood over her. There was no escape. He lifted the sword, but then lowered\nit, the expression on his face softening. “You killed me. I guess I—” He fell\nover sideways, lifeless.\nLiv stood and walked past his corpse. Walked out onto the cliff. She\nglanced at the drop. It should have terrified her, but she was numb. She\nlooked up to the superviolet seed crystal, twinkling in the air. It floated at\nthe nexus of a thousand streams of superviolet light, some of it\nspontaneously shimmering into luxin in the presence of the crystal, lifting\nit. The crystal tumbled end over end, and each time it did, it sent a little\nflash of purple light in the visible spectrum.\nIt called directly to Liv’s heart.

The seed crystal called to Liv, and Liv raised\nher hand and called to it.\nAnd it came to her.\nChapter 86\nKarris ran down the broad steps of the hippodrome’s tiered seating, not\neven trying to be ladylike.\nWith the broadness of the steps, she couldn’t take her eyes off her\nfooting to see if Gavin still lived. But the audience still seemed transfixed,\nso she guessed he must. Maybe it was only torture.\nAs she descended the crowds got thicker, until she had to push through a\nmass of people standing at the chest-high fence that ringed the track. The\ntrack itself was fifteen feet below them. With her dress, Karris had to push\nthrough the crowd instead of dodging through it. But she wouldn’t be\ndenied.\nA man took umbrage at her shoving. He said, “Who the hell do you\nthink you—”\nSometimes being short was a blessing. She swung a hand up between his\nlegs, grabbed a fistful of cloth and his stones, and twisted, hard. He\ndropped, and she snatched his ghotra off his head as he fell.\nFrom the spina, she heard a man’s screams. She recognized the voice.\nNo, no, no.\nShe unwrapped the ghotra as she moved. Reaching the front, she vaulted\nover the worn stone handrail. She threw the ghotra into a knot around the\nrail and jumped, sliding down it until she ran out of cloth.\nShe dropped daintily onto the sand of the hippodrome floor and ran out\nonto the dirt racetrack before anyone could stop her.\nThere was a murmur from the half of the hippodrome that saw her\nimmediately. What was a noblewoman doing running out onto the track?\nBut the people on top of the spina—drafters and what looked like a\nchirurgeon—didn’t see her immediately. They were looking at Gavin,\nbound to a table. He was screaming, throwing himself against his bonds,\nobviously in agony, but he couldn’t move. The chirurgeon was lifting a red-\nhot poker in gloved hands. Karris had never seen him in such pain. Gavin,\nadmitting weakness, admitting pain? Gavin?!\nThey were blinding him. Dear Orholam, they’d already burned out one\neye.\nThe soldiers standing around the spina saw her. These were the\nNuqaba’s elite drafter soldiers, the Tafok Amagez. Bad luck. But then,\nIronfist had once said that Karris was the fastest drafter that he’d ever seen,\nand Ironfist didn’t flatter. Karris’s white skin was a disadvantage in full\nbattle. There was no way to draft vast amounts of luxin without it showing\nin her arms. But she’d learned a thing or two. There are advantages to\napparent disadvantages.\nThe hot poker descended toward Gavin’s face.\nGreen luxin uncurled down the underside of Karris’s arm to make a ball\nthat fit nicely in her fist.

Her feet danced through a progression, positions on\na clock, hips twisting like throwing a javelin, loading tension and snapping\nforward to impart it all into a projectile. It was faster than the Tafok\nAmagez could react. The green ball flew at the chirurgeon’s head.\nConnected.\nShe spun away hard enough that when she dropped the burning poker it\ndidn’t fall on Gavin’s face.\nKarris turned her odd steps into an awkward swaying dance, desperately\ntrying to clear her skin of any hint of green luxin. The projectile had been\nsmall enough and so fast as to be invisible. That, together with the sight of\nKarris moving strangely, might leave the crowd simply baffled. More\nimportantly, it might leave the Nuqaba baffled.\nPlay it to the hilt, Karris. Pretend you’ve got the confidence of Gavin.\nShe raised a hand, her index finger up. “Pardon me!” she shouted.\nAs she stepped forward, she remembered to alter her steps to a lady’s.\nHer sidesteps had triggered Ben-hadad’s other contraption. As subtly as she\ncould after having just demanded the attention of fifty thousand people, she\nreached a hand down to the ridiculous huge bow and pressed it firmly to her\nhip once more. It clicked. Wait, had she landed on that hip? Had she\ndestroyed the mechanism?\nNo, she’d landed on the other hip. Right?\nShe raised her other hand at the same time she checked the bow.\n“Pardon me?” she shouted again. She smiled, as if she were asking a man to\ncome to her bed.\nWhich confused the hell out of them, as intended.\nThere was brief chaos on the platform on the spina. The chirurgeon was\non her knees, in serious pain, but she wasn’t saying anything. An Amagez\ntried to pick up the poker. He was smart enough not to grab the glowing\nend, but not smart enough to realize iron didn’t need to be glowing in order\nto be hot.\nHe threw the hot iron away, cursing loudly, adding to the chaos.\nKarris made it to the steps before the Amagez tried to intercept her. She\nignored them, jutting her chin high and dismissive—and made it to the top\nbefore they brandished muskets and luxin to show her they were serious.\nAmateurs.\nShe stopped, now in full view of everyone in the hippodrome, as if\nshocked and put out that soldiers would threaten her. A young one stepped\nforward and started searching her.\nMoment of truth. Big stage, big body language to let everyone see it.\nHe had to push hard against the many petticoats to try to feel the inside\nof her legs. For a moment, she let him search as if stunned and violated. But\nshe had to let him search enough that he could be convinced to stop.\nShe stepped back, as if horribly insulted, flinging her arms wide. In her\nloudest battlefield voice, she projected, “Pardon you, sirrah! I no more have\na weapon between my legs than you do!”\nAnd she slapped him. Not hard, not with the correct body mechanics to\nput the poor fool on the ground, but sloppily, tossing her hair like a dimwit.\nThe audience roared with laughter, still wondering what the hell was"

Was this part of a show?\nShe held up her hand again, turning to face the Nuqaba’s box. She was\nsitting right at the front, beside Eirene Malargos.\nThe young guard moved toward Karris again, chagrined, but she\nboomed out, “Your Excellency!” toward the Nuqaba. “Move aside, young\nman,” she said in a withering whisper. “Your betters are speaking.”\nIt was enough to freeze the young Tafok Amagez. Accustomed to taking\nnonsense orders from an imperious woman who demanded his obedience\nwithout question, he felt suddenly bereft of authority.\nThis is how tyrants fall. By destroying their people, they destroy\nthemselves.\nBlackguards knew exactly what they were entitled to do, and they were\nauthorized to do it to whomever entered their sphere. A lord might\ncomplain, but not even a luxlord would go without being searched in an\narea where weapons were forbidden. No Prism or White or Black would\never reprimand a Blackguard for doing his duties thoroughly. The Nuqaba\nwas clearly not so rational.\nShe stood in her box, and motioned to the young Amagez to move back.\n“Who are you?” the Nuqaba demanded. “What is this?”\n“This man,” Karris projected, so that not only the Nuqaba, who was near\nenough to easily hear, but all the hippodrome could hear as well. “Is my\nhusband.” Karris turned, to shout it the other direction. “This man is my\nhusband!”\nWhat she hadn’t planned was to see him as she turned. He was strapped\ndown so he couldn’t turn his head. But he heard her. “Karris?” he shouted.\n“Dear Orholam, Karris, get out of here!”\nHis left side was to her, and blood trickled out of his eye, down his\ncheek, a stream of red tears from a wound that hadn’t been fully cauterized.\nHer stomach caught and she tried to stifle a sob. She hunched over, but\nset her jaw. Weeping and running to him would mean death for both of\nthem.\nPut it aside, Karris.\n“Your Excellency!” Karris snarled, whipping around to face the foul\nbitch who’d done this to Gavin. Her fear was gone, and her rage wasn’t red.\n“I declare my husband innocent of any wrong. By your own old traditions, I\ndemand trial by combat!”\n“I demand trial by combat,” she announced to the other half of the\nstadium. If only she had an orator’s voice that could be heard over fifty\nthousand murmuring souls. But most orators couldn’t pull off this dress,\neither.\nShe turned to the Nuqaba and lowered her voice, trying to project just\nenough for the woman and those privileged few in the front row to hear.\n“Or I tell everyone here our surname and rally those who are not traitors.”\nThe Nuqaba’s face gathered a storm. Eirene Malargos interjected some\nquestion. A quick volley of questions and responses between them,\nimpossible to hear. Both angry. Both insistent."

Both insistent.\nThere was no ancient Parian tradition of trial by combat. It was pure\nhorse shit.\nBut the fifty thousand bloodthirsty Ruthgari spectators in the\nhippodrome didn’t know that. And they loved the idea. Chariot races could\nbe bloody—crashes frequent, injuries common—but true blood sports had\nbeen banned and reinstated, banned and reinstated repeatedly for the last\nfour hundred years. They had been illegal for the last ninety or more. A licit\ntaste of an illicit activity? A taste of a vice that the audience could blame on\nParian barbarity rather than their own? It was irresistible.\nBut that pressure wasn’t enough. The Nuqaba didn’t mind angering fifty\nthousand of some other satrapy’s people. But the pressure wasn’t the bait.\nKarris looked closely as the Nuqaba and Eirene Malargos bickered. She\ncould lip-read ‘wife,’ and multiple curses. The Nuqaba nodded her head and\nsaid some words to a handsome, muscular Parian man who was still seated\nnext to her. Then she stepped forward and raised her hands. Eirene put a\nhand on her arm, but the Nuqaba shook her off, giving her a poisonous\nglance. Eirene surrendered, trying not to make a scene, but clearly furious.\nWhen Marissia had pitched the idea to Karris, she’d said, ‘I’ve studied\nHaruru for fifteen years. She’s hateful, petty, jealous, and vindictive—and\nshe was involved with Gavin once. If she can do anything to hurt him, she\nwill.’\nAnd now we find out just how competent Marissia really is.\nAnd then a sick thought punched Karris in the stomach: It’s not as if\nMarissia has an incentive to send me to my death.\nSudden fear shivered down Karris’s back.\nHer rival.\nOh, Orholam, what have I done? I thought I’d finally won her over. I\nthought we shared a love for Gavin that trumped the rest. I thought she was\nworking with me. I’ve taken everything from her, and this is her one chance\nto reclaim her work, if not her man, whom she knew was lost to her forever.\nThis is what you get for trusting a slave.\nIt had been a colossal blunder. The kind Karris never would have missed\nif she hadn’t been so pressed for time. How long had Marissia sat on that\ninformation, in order to make sure Karris was pressed for time? Marissia\ncould have known about Gavin’s imprisonment for weeks, and held it back\njust so Karris would rush off and get herself killed. Even the trial by combat\nhad been Marissia’s idea.\nBut the White trusts her. And she loves Gavin. She wouldn’t hold back\ninformation when he was in danger, would she?\nBut Gavin had pushed her aside without a thought when he’d married\nKarris. How would Karris react if a man had done that to her?\nOrholam have mercy.\nThe crowd quieted, and Karris waited for the word. She would be"

Alone, with no one to speak for her, all that\nneeded to happen was for the Nuqaba to say that Karris was a madwoman,\nand that a trial by combat was never part of Parian history. There would be\nthose in this vast crowd who knew that was true.\nIt was all falling apart.\n“It has been many, many years since the trial by combat has been\nrequested,” the Nuqaba said. And Karris’s heart soared. She had a chance.\n“As set down in our ancient laws, the trial by combat can only be requested\nonce, and must be fulfilled by the one who asked for it. No champions!”\nBait, swallowed.\nBefore the crowd could shout, enthralled by the idea of some\ninsubstantial little girl in a dress fighting in a trial by combat herself, the\nNuqaba continued. “There is no drafting allowed in trials by combat, and\nthe trial is to the death!”\nNow the crowd roared.\nSo Marissia didn’t betray me.\nBut this was almost worse. All Karris’s preparations to hide her drafting\nabilities were for nothing. Either the Nuqaba or Eirene Malargos had known\nwho Karris was and that she could draft. The Nuqaba was vicious, but she\nwasn’t stupid.\nShit.\nThe Nuqaba quieted the crowd again, and gestured to the man who’d\nbeen sitting to her left. As he stood, the Nuqaba said, “Do you, O common\nwoman, wish to face the hand of our justice, the Lord Commandant of the\nArmies of Paria, Enki Hammer?”\nOn his cue, the man, clearly the Nuqaba’s consort, came forward out\nfrom under their shade to stand full in the noon sun. He was tall, very tall,\nwith slim hips and shoulders but the reedy forearms that told a warrior like\nKarris that under his rich Parian cloak—his burnous—and his gold-\nbrocaded tunic that he was a soldier. He wore the ghotra, too, to cover his\nhead, but there was nothing of pious humility in him. Even his ghotra was\nwoven through with gold.\nHe shrugged off the white-and-black-striped burnous and pulled the\nlaces of his tunic open, dropping it to reveal impressive musculature. Karris\nwanted to hate him for his vanity, but she dabbled in vanity more than her\nfair share.\nOdd, she thought. That would have made me hate him twice as much not\ntoo long ago.\nOh, she was supposed to respond. Something gutsy but that didn’t hint\nto the crowd that she was a fighter. “I would rather die,” she shouted, “than\nlet you hurt my husband any more.”\nThe crowd cheered. The Nuqaba tried to whisper something to Enki, but\nhe shook his head. She tried again, but the crowd was too loud, too\nimpatient. He waved her off. Later.\nAs Enki jogged down the steps and across the sand toward the spina,\nlooking vexed, the Nuqaba waited for the cheer to die and then shouted,"

Later.\nAs Enki jogged down the steps and across the sand toward the spina,\nlooking vexed, the Nuqaba waited for the cheer to die and then shouted,\n“Then may your blood be on your own head!”\nThere was confusion on the spina as the soldiers tried to figure out what\nprecisely they were supposed to do during a trial the likes of which they’d\nnever heard of, much less trained for, all while under the watching eyes of\nfifty thousand people. The professional in Karris had some pity on them, but\nshe said nothing. Any hint she gave that she knew exactly what she was\ndoing could get her killed. This is why you strike fast—some part of the\nenemy force may have intelligence that will destroy you, but if they can’t\ncommunicate it in time, it doesn’t matter.\nShe bent her head and wiped at her cheeks defiantly, as if she were\nweeping uncontrollably but was angry about it. A fool wisp of a girl in a\nridiculous dress, that’s what she was, not at all a Blackguard.\nShe wanted to look at Gavin. She wanted to go to him. But she’d lose\nherself if she did.\nFinally, on quick orders from Enki himself, the Tafok Amagez set up a\nperimeter around the spina as he mounted the steps. An Amagez broke\nranks and came forward for the offering of weapons. He was probably\nthirty-five years old, ancient for a warrior-drafter. He lifted his scabbarded\nlongsword from his belt and offered it to Karris. Another Amagez joined\nhim a moment later and offered a stabbing spear. Then another, with a\nscorpion. Enki himself wore a long, thin-bladed scimitar, scabbard and hilt\nencrusted with mother-of-pearl and rubies.\nKarris looked at the weapons, and shook her head and waved her hand\nin denial, still making the motions large enough that they could be\ninterpreted even by the farmers in the highest seats. “Oh, no, I shan’t need\nanything there, I think. But thank you.”\nShe glanced at Gavin as murmurs rippled through the crowd again. No\nweapons? What insanity was this? Was she simply committing suicide?\nGavin was still twitching, still obviously in great pain, but he said\nnothing, didn’t cry out in his agony, didn’t call out to Karris. He couldn’t\nsee what was happening, and the not knowing would be driving him insane,\nbut he held his silence. She knew at once it was because he trusted her. He\nknew she had a plan, and he knew it was desperate, and he wasn’t going to\ndistract her from it.\nFor a man who’d been in control of everything, and been the driver of\nchange in most of the great moments in the Seven Satrapies for the last two\ndecades, to trust her that much moved her beyond words.\nNo time for that, dammit! She scrubbed a tear from her eye, a real one.\nUnwilling to let her dominate the crowd’s eyes, Enki had stepped\nforward and raised both hands to heaven. “Orholam!” he cried. “Look upon\nthe works of our hands! May your justice be done to traitors!”"

May your justice be done to traitors!”\nHe lowered his hands, and then took off his ghotra, as if this were\nconnected to drawing Orholam’s attention. His black hair was woven with\ngold wire into clumps that hung past his shoulders. In Parian tradition, that\nhair was his glory, and he gloried in it.\nThe gesture wasn’t lost on the Ruthgari, who didn’t wear the ghotra, but\nwere well aware of their neighbors’ beliefs about it. Nor were they immune\nto appreciating a handsome, athletic man who was six and a half feet tall.\nHe was like a smaller, vain version of Ironfist. Which was a bit\ndisturbing, when Karris thought about it. Who picked a lover who looked so\nmuch like her own brother?\nKarris walked up beside Enki and stood facing the Nuqaba’s box,\nwaiting for him.\nA flicker of doubt crossed his face. Karris was acting with such\nconviction that she could tell the big ignoramus thought that maybe these\ntrials really were a tradition. He stood beside her, but not too close.\nAround the spina in a circle, the Tafok Amagez drew in their colors. Any\ndrafting would mean death.\nKarris curtsied carefully to the Nuqaba and a steely-eyed Eirene\nMalargos. Beside her, Enki bowed deeply.\nThe crowd fell silent.\nThe Nuqaba waved a hand, signaling they could begin, but Karris\nignored it. She turned to Enki and curtsied, more elaborately, an old court\ncurtsy, with sweeping arms bringing her skirts wide, and her ankles crossed.\nEnki bowed to her, but carefully, keeping his eyes on her.\nAnd… nothing happened.\nBen-hadad! It wasn’t supposed to be like this!\nEnki lifted his sword and readied himself, while Karris stood on one\nfoot, her right ankle pushing against her left calf.\n“One moment,” Karris said. She held a finger up. “I have an itch.” She\nmoved her right foot up and down her calf.\nEnki looked at her, incredulous. Was she mad? And then he laughed.\nAnd it was as if Ben-hadad had made the catch to be activated by\nlaughter instead of by crossing her ankles, as they’d discussed. Karris felt\nthe catch give and the big ridiculous ribbon on her right hip popped out and\nthe luxin holding together layers of skirt and petticoats let go, swinging\nopen like a door over her thigh, giving Karris access to the quick-release\nscabbard that covered the length of the inside of her thigh.\nAt the same time the skirts popped open, the scabbard swiveled from the\ninner thigh where it had been hidden during her search to her outer thigh\nand hand.\nMost scabbards required a blade to be stabbed into them, and likewise,\ndrawn vertically out before it could be used: they took two motions. This\nwas a tension scabbard, holding the blade in a hug instead, letting the blade\ncome out horizontally, so that one could draw as one slashed.\nIt was only a fraction of a heartbeat faster than a normal draw, but a"

Onetwothree steps, the back of her left hand\nbatting his sword aside—\nAnd she buried the blade under his chin at the very instant he realized\nshe’d moved.

A man could still kill\nyou before he realized he was dead.\nAnd then she jumped back, out of reach, pulling the dagger free.\nEnki dropped to his knee, dropped flat on his face. Someone in the circle\nof Tafok Amagez shouted, but Karris barely heard it.\nShe stepped forward again, now that she saw he wouldn’t attack, and\nknelt at his body. She pulled back his braids and took the scimitar from his\ntwitching fingers. Taking a fistful of braids, she stood, lifting the body to put\npressure on the neck, and hacked with the dead man’s own scimitar. Once,\nand then twice, and a bit of quick sawing for the last of the skin, and Enki’s\nhead came free of his body.\nKarris held the head high in one hand and the scimitar high in the other,\nand suddenly, she could hear the crowd again, a vast roar of confusion and\nhorror and awe and disbelief and cheering all intermixed. “Orholam has\nseen! Orholam’s justice has been done!” she shouted. But her voice was\nprobably lost in the roar.\n“I am Karris Guile, and this man is Gavin Guile, your Prism. He is\nGavin Guile!” She was shouting at the top of her lungs, but it was lost in the\nclamor of fifty thousand voices. Only the nearest could hear. She could only\nhope it was enough.\nShe switched hands and swung the head back and forth as she drafted\noff the banners nearby. She flung the head and gave it a little extra push\nwith luxin as she threw it.\nKarris couldn’t have made the shot so perfectly if she’d tried it a\nhundred times. The head flew all the way into Eirene Malargos’s box and\nlanded in the Nuqaba’s lap.\nThe Nuqaba began shrieking, and Orholam forgive them, many in the\naudience laughed.\nKarris didn’t care. She moved to Gavin quickly and cut him free as the\nTafok Amagez stood around, baffled.\nOh, Orholam. Gavin’s face. His face!\n“Gavin,” she said, “we have to run. Can you—”\n“I won’t let you down,” he said, but when he stood, he almost collapsed.\nHe put his left hand up to his face, and two of his fingers were gone.

She had won a trial that their Nuqaba had\nestablished, so they should let her go, but then, she’d also thrown the head\nof one of their leaders into the Nuqaba’s lap, so, should they arrest her?\nCould they, after what she’d just done?\nThere was no point in waiting to find out what they decided.\nBut just then, one of the hippodrome guards ran to the steps of the spina.\n“It is Gavin Guile!” he shouted. “I recognize him from the old days! They\ndyed his hair and dirtied his face, but he is Gavin Guile!”\nKarris veritably pulled Gavin down the steps, and the soldier fell in with\nthem, desperately signaling to other Guile family troops to join them.\n“Kill them!” the Nuqaba shrieked suddenly. “Kill them both!” Karris\nshot a look over at her. She was covered with blood. More blood than you’d\nthink would leak out of a man’s severed head. She’d smeared it somehow\non her face.\n“No! Ignore that order!” Eirene Malargos shouted. “You’re not in your\nright mind, Haruru!”\n“Kill them!” the Nuqaba shouted. “Block the exits! That’s an order!”\n“That’s an act of war! I forbid it!” Eirene Malargos shouted.\nChaos.\n“This way!” the Guile soldier said.\nHe unlocked a door set at the level of the sand. They stepped through\nand he closed it behind them, locking it.\n“Captain Eutheos, you son of a bitch,” Gavin said. “I thought I ordered\nyou out of here.”\n“Wasn’t much good at orders at Blood Ridge either, my lord.”\nGavin laughed briefly at some shared memory, then cut off abruptly, as\nif anything that made his face move spawned such pain that it nearly felled\nhim.\n“I can get us to an exit, but they’ll get there faster,” the soldier said.\n“There has to be some kind of service exit,” Karris said.\n“First thing they’ll think of,” Gavin said. And he was right. Dammit.\n“Can you get us to the top tier, west side?” Karris asked.\n“Absolutely.”\nAnd he did. They dodged through corridors where only servants and\nslaves went, and crossed halls clogged with spectators eager to get out—the\nsight of men drawing swords and pistols and drafting and ready to kill\nanyone who opposed them did crazy things to people. Other people, who’d\nbeen outside the hippodrome and heard that amazing things were happening\nwithin were pushing to get in, creating vast snarls. One musket shot and this\nwas going to turn into a stampede.\nThe Guile soldiers manning the exits were shouting, trying to bring\norder, but they were confused themselves. Were the Tafok Amagez now the\nenemy? Or were they still friends who should be helped? What had\nhappened inside?\nGavin collapsed several times, apologizing each time.

He was shockingly light.\nBut in minutes they made it to the arch where Karris had entered. She\npoked her head out over the drop.\nOh my.\nBut there was Ironfist. At the sight of her, he grinned big.\nWhen Gavin poked his own head out, Ironfist’s grin slipped. Gavin’s eye\nwas still bleeding. But Gavin smiled, delighted to see the big man.\n“Are you going to make your own way down, Lord Prism?” Ironfist\nasked.\nGavin jerked back and turned. “Company coming,” he said.\nKarris saw five Tafok Amagez running up the stairs she’d run down not\nfifteen minutes ago. These upper decks had cleared out. They definitely saw\nthem.\n“Afraid not,” Gavin said, quickly poking his head back out. “What’s the\nplan? Quickly.” He looked out at the river. It was a long way away, and a\nlong way down. “Oh no, tell me that’s not the plan.”\n“That’s it,” Karris said. “Captain, thank you. Now get the hell out of\nhere. Five count, Gavin. Commander, I’ll come five after Gavin.”\nGavin had already backed up. He wobbled, but gathered himself.\nEutheos steadied him. “Go, Captain, and bless you.”\nKarris stood at the edge so both of them could see her. “One, two, three,\nfour, five.” And Gavin leapt, right in front of her.\nShe didn’t watch. Couldn’t and make it to her spot in time. The Tafok\nAmagez were charging up the stairs. Oh damn, a five count was too much.\nBy four she’d be dead.\nShe ran for the edge as metal cut the air. “Five, five, five!” she shouted.\nAnd dove into the air.\nFor a sickening heartbeat, she fell. She kept her body rigid, no time for a\nprayer or a curse.\nAnd a soft cloud of Ironfist’s open luxin caught her for half a moment,\nand then flung her hard.\nThe timing was off, and the throw was less than perfect: instead of\ncatching her at her chest and hips and throwing evenly, it was a little behind\nher. Being flung from that position spun her, hips over head, flipping. She\nwould land flat on her back in the river.\nFrom this height, it would break her.\nKarris twisted hard. First lesson of fighting, how to fall.\nBut she had also turned sideways—and her feet hit the water first, before\nshe was ready, and suddenly—black.\nThe next she was aware, she was underwater in billows of clinging skirts\nwith no idea which way was up, and no breath. She flailed, and the last of\nher breath escaped with the wave of pain that crashed over her. Her left arm\nfelt like someone had tried to tear it off, and her ribs and left breast had\nbeen crushed.\nAn unnatural hand—more hook than hand—grabbed her many\npetticoats and dragged her, upside down, to the surface.

It shot water up her\nnose, and as she hit the blessed air, she coughed and spat and fought to push\nthe blinding, suffocating layers of cloth away.\nBen-hadad dropped the open green luxin claw he’d used to grab her and\nextended a hand. Karris made the mistake of offering her left hand, and\nregretted it immediately when he hauled her up. Pain took what little breath\nshe had.\n“Ben!” Essel shouted. “Need you! Need you now!” She was standing\nover Gavin, who had also been pulled out of the water. He was wet and\nwhimpering and holding a hand to his bleeding eye. He would be no help.\nThe sparse crowd that had already filled the market when they arrived\nwas now a thick crowd with the events inside the hippodrome and the\nsudden spectacle of the insane people jumping all the way from the\nhippodrome into the river. Soldiers were trying to fight their way through to\nget to the river’s edge where the skimmer was docked.\nKarris couldn’t see whose soldiers they were, just the fighting in the\nseething crowd, and the bobbing points of muskets.\nShe fought to stand, and saw Hezik break through the crowd and run for\nthe stairs. He jumped halfway down the first flight. “Ironfist says go! Go!”\nHezik shouted.\nA musket shot rang out. Flesh and blood and cloth puffed from Hezik’s\nleft arm. He was already running down the second flight of steps and it\nthrew him off balance. He tumbled, rolled down the remaining steps.\nThe crowd bolted, and despite the clear visual marker of a big black\ncloud of smoke from the musket, people who’ve never been in combat do\nthe craziest things. They went all directions at once. Some were pushed off\nthe wall to fall onto the docks, shrieking, screaming, breaking legs and\nbacks and necks, grabbing on to those who pushed them to try to save\nthemselves.\nOthers pushed toward the soldiers, who turned their muskets and started\nbeating anyone close with the stocks. One must have had his musket\ngrabbed by someone in the crowd, because it discharged into the air.\nKarris fought to her feet. “Ignition!” she shouted at Ben-hadad, who\nlooked paralyzed.\n“What? I, I don’t—I don’t draft—”\nThe red lens had popped out of her eye somewhere. She tore into his\npack. Found the flint and steel and her red spectacles, the pain in her arm\nmaking black spots dance in her vision. Pulled the spectacles out and put\nthem on, and filled her left hand with red luxin.\nShe turned her eyes in time to see Hezik stand with effort—it looked\nlike one of the falling men had hit him. A soldier with a musket stepped to\nthe edge of the wall, and fired.\nHezik dropped, a splash of red jumping into the air from his head.\n“No!” Karris shouted.

With enough red feeding constantly into her left hand to keep a\nfire constantly burning low, she made a red luxin ball in her right, and\nhurled it through the fire at the satisfied young soldier. It hit high on his\nchest, in his beard, and splashed over him, liquid red luxin drenching him\nfor one heartbeat, then flames roaring over him the next.\nScreaming, he turned to his fellows. Panicked, one of them lashed out\nwith the already raised butt of his musket. The man on fire plunged off the\nwall, where he almost landed on a child.\n“We’ve orders to go!” Essel said. She threw a line from the cleat back\nonto the dock and pushed off.\n“We wait!” Karris said. “Out of my line!”\nShe braced her feet and brought the flaming luxin in her left hand up as\nif she were sighting down a musket.\n“Kill them!” a familiar voice shouted. Orholam damn her, it was the\nNuqaba herself.\nKarris shot a thin, continuous ribbon of red luxin through the air. It\nignited in a huge fan. She dragged it back and forth in front of the wall and\nthe soldiers there. All the luxin burned away before it hit the men standing\nthere, but a roiling wall of flame wasn’t something anyone wanted to\napproach. The heat itself would be a slap in their faces.\n“She can’t throw it far enough to hit you!” the Nuqaba shouted as soon\nas Karris let the first wash of flames die.\nFool doesn’t know the difference between mercy and a lack of will.\nBut the truth was, Karris killing one soldier could be overlooked, called\nan accident. Killing a dozen was a diplomatic incident, war. War in the\nmiddle of war. Against Paria, their ally; Paria, which the Chromeria needed.\nBut they needed Gavin more.\nKarris stopped, indecisive for the first time.\n“The commander said to go!” Essel shouted. “We don’t even know if\nhe’s leaving this way!”\n“Get on the reeds, and turn us,” Karris ordered Essel and Ben-hadad,\n“but wait for my word. I’ll defend. We wait for Ironfist!”\nThen a fireball arced through the air toward the skimmer and plopped\ninto the water with a hiss and a kick of steam. Drafters. The Nuqaba’s\nAmagez drafters were on their way through the crowd.\nOne arm near useless, drafters and soldiers closing in, muskets being\nfired at them, and all Karris could think was that her real problem was that\nshe was no longer a watch captain of the Blackguard and therefore was in\nno position to give orders at all, and that as soon as Essel realized it, the\nwoman would take charge.\nKarris threw another narrow stream of flame, hard. It was difficult to\ngauge the force needed as the distance changed, but luck smiled on her.\nMost of the red burned off in the air in a frightening display, but some little\nhit the massed musketeers across their muskets and chests.\nThe screams were immediate, but they were screams of surprise and"

With most of the flammability of the red exhausted, the\nmen weren’t consumed. Hands were burnt, muskets thrown away, tunics\nhurriedly stripped off, men fell over each other as even those in the second\nand third rows threw themselves backward, away from the billows of flame.\n“We have to go, now!” Essel said.\nKarris hesitated again.\n“He’s coming,” Gavin mumbled, from the deck where he was lying. He\nsounded delirious. “Don’t you see him? His angel’s fighting through the\ncrowd.”\nEssel said, “He’s not in his right mind. Karris, we have to—”\n“We stay!” Karris snarled, but even as the words crossed her lips, she\nknew they had more to do with the red she was still drafting to keep the\nflame alive in her left hand, and the green she was drawing in that refused\nto be told what to do, and her own fear at what she’d seen in Gavin’s good\neye.\nHis blue, unprismatic eye.\nBefore the smoke cleared in the gap where the musketeers had been,\nKarris saw a glow like a torch, lighting the dissipating smoke from within.\nAn instant later, four of the Nuqaba’s Tafok Amagez appeared. Warrior-\ndrafters. One had hands encased in red luxin, already aflame. He threw\nfireballs, right and left.\nThe right-hand shot was wide. A lefty then, or a feint. It gave Karris time\nto hurl a green projectile out to intercept the other fireball, batting it aside.\n“Go, go, go!” Karris shouted. It was one thing to wait for Ironfist; it was\nanother to commit suicide.\nThree of the four Tafok Amagez attacked, throwing blue missiles that\nexploded in shrapnel, and green spears, and red fire. The fourth tried to fire\na long musket, but it misfired and he was working to clear it. The Tafok\nAmagez were brute force drafters: if something didn’t yield when they hit\nit, they hit it harder.\nUnable to use their physical strength against her except to throw their\nluxin really hard and fast, and unable to use their numbers to surround her,\nthey kept doing more of the same. But Karris didn’t merely have to protect\nherself, she had to protect everyone on the skimmer and the skimmer itself.\nWith a weak left arm.\nShe dodged through the lux forms—the modified martial arts moves that\ncompensated for the balance shifts of throwing the weight of luxin—always\ngiving herself an anchor to throw shields left and projectiles right and\nabsorb and divert.\nNot having used luxin for so long gave her an unusual edge. Like\ndrinking several cups of kopi when you haven’t had any for a while, the\nluxin hit her hard. The wild energy of green roared past her injury, and the\nheat of red burned out the voice of her pain. But her long experience took\nthat energy and passion, and made it a blade."

But her long experience took\nthat energy and passion, and made it a blade.\nShe was fast, faster than she’d ever been. She was instinctive, shooting\nmissiles out of the air with missiles of her own, impossible shots,\nimpossible speeds. Left left left—as they realized her weakness—and right\nand high, and diverting a huge curtain of flame that the red tried to drop on\nthem from above.\nIt was only seconds, but the fury of the attacks made it seem an eternity.\nEssel and Ben-hadad were throwing luxin down the reeds, but the\nskimmer’s inertia was significant: its own weight, and the weight of four\npeople on its decks, and neither Essel or Ben-hadad were particularly\nstrong, physically or as drafters.\nAll it would take was one slip.\nMore Tafok Amagez joined the first ones, pausing only a moment to see\nwhat was happening. Half a dozen more.\nToo many, and the skimmer was still too close.\nAnd then the fourth stood, his musket cleared and reloaded. Karris saw\nhim, and dread filled her. A premonition that cut off air like drinking tar.\nShe couldn’t counterattack: the missiles and fire were coming in too\nthick. He leveled the musket, took aim.\nBut Karris heard a familiar roar, a man bellowing.\nA blue wedge, a V of shields as tall as a man, appeared behind the four\nTafok Amagez. They didn’t even see it coming. And then a huge figure\nappeared, holding that V like a battering ram, running full speed. The\nwedge split as Ironfist rammed through the Tafok Amagez.\nSweeping his massive arms wide, bellowing that legendary shout that\nhad melted the knees of enemies throughout the Seven Satrapies, holding\nthe blue luxin shields to either side as he came through the middle of a\ndozen Tafok Amagez, Ironfist leapt off the wall, blasting the shields out into\nthe Amagez and back, sending him flying with incredible speed.\nHe flipped in the air, and it looked for a moment like he was going to\nmake it all the way to the water, but instead he dropped from that great\nheight onto the end of the dock. Ironfist threw a gush of unfocused blue\ndown as he landed, but the shock was still enough to stagger him and\nsplinter wood.\nHis tunic had been torn half off, and blood was streaming from a cut on\nthe side of his head, but he gathered himself and refilled with blue.\nKarris had seen Ironfist run across the waves before. He drafted a\nnarrow platform of blue, half floating on the water. He could make it fifty\nfeet or more, and the skimmer wasn’t that far out yet. Her heart soared.\nThe Tafok Amagez were in chaos behind him. Several had been pushed\noff the wall.

Karris\nwas fast. Karris was accurate. But she wasn’t that fast or that accurate. She\nheard the shot, saw the sudden jerk and the smoke blossom from his musket\n—but he’d twitched off-aim at the last moment.\nKarris realized that the musket she’d heard was behind her. Almost\nbeneath her. The young marksman on the wall dropped his musket and\ntumbled down to the dock, dead.\nAnd then the skimmer was picking up speed and Ironfist leapt aboard,\nand in less than a minute they were safely skimming down to the river,\noutrunning any order that could arrive to tell anyone to stop them.\nKarris looked at Gavin, lying bloody on the deck, still holding the\nsmoking musket he’d fired to save Ironfist’s life.\nGavin was grinning fiercely. Blood from his ruined left eye had trickled\ninto his mouth, and it painted his teeth red. “Not quite useless. Not yet,” he\nsaid.\nThen he passed out.\nChapter 87\nA knock, and a familiar woman’s voice: “Kip?”\nKip didn’t know how long he stood in the darkness of his room. Did\ntime even have meaning anymore? He thought perhaps that the darkness\nwould bring back the black luxin card. He hadn’t seen the entirety of it.\nBut it didn’t come back. And he knew no way to call it forth\nconsciously. There were so many things that he needed to think about and\ndecide right now, this instant, immediately, that he was paralyzed. He\ncouldn’t think about anything. His life was about to turn irrevocably, and he\nwanted to look at some card?\nGranted, if he was right, and viewing—or living or remembering or\nwhatever the hell it was that he did with the cards—was nearly\ninstantaneous, then theoretically, he could live as many of them as he\nwanted, and not lose any time. But somehow he was pretty certain it didn’t\nwork that way. If he could even figure out how to call one up, he felt like it\nmight roast that tiny, underused pea between his ears.\nThe thought only served to remind him of his headache.\nA knock on the door. Again. Wait, this was the second knock, wasn’t it?\nHe hit the light control, and his knees almost buckled as the light seared\nhis eyes, burned like rock salt stomped into his open wound of a brain. He\nleaned against the doorframe, gasping, and opened the door.\n“Kip? Are you all right?”\nOh hells. It wasn’t Teia. Why had he thought it was Teia?\nBecause Teia’s the only girl who ever talks to you on purpose.\nIt was Tisis. “Are you hungover?” Tisis asked.\nI’m a giant, wakened from my bed by assassins.

They said you had a room slave that you never bedded, so I thought\nyou either didn’t have any interest at all either way or you liked boys.\nThat’s why I, um, tried to appeal to your better nature. Believe me, if I’d\nthought it would be as easy as flashing some cleavage at you, I’d have done\nit in a second.”\n“What? What? What?” Then Kip couldn’t help it; he started laughing.\nHis grandfather had been right—infuriatingly right—about Tisis. And\nhe’d been right for all the wrong reasons. He’d thought she would ask Kip\nto rescue her because she was subtle; she’d done it because she thought Kip\nwas homosexual.\n“I’m so sorry,” Tisis said. “You mean you’re not…”\n“No,” Kip said, still grinning. “I mean, I’m not homosexual and not, er,\nwell, I am asexual, I guess, but not by choice.

And my earlier\ndisinterested attraction to you—understandably dampened by the fact I\nthought you wanted to kill me—is strangely getting more intense and more\npersonal all the time.”\nHe could tell the convoluted compliment warmed her.

        "text": "thought you wanted to kill me—is strangely getting more intense and more\npersonal all the time.”\nHe could tell the convoluted compliment warmed her. She blushed\nfaintly, and looked at him with new eyes.\nBefore she could speak, Kip said, “But that attraction—whether it’s the\nsimple infatuation of the boy you seem to think I am, or something more\nrobust and worthy of consideration—is not the point. It’s moot.”\nHe could see her digesting that, and he could tell that she was impressed.\nBut her regard was not, now, the kind you’d have when you think a child is\nbeing mature for his age. In her eyes little green shoots of respect broke the\nground. “So,” she said, “if that’s not the point, what is?”\n“If I do this, I’m crossing my grandfather. He’s not just the Red\nanymore. He’s the promachos, and he was scary enough when he was only\nthe Red. He does not forgive insults. I’ll need your protection and your\nsister Eirene’s protection, at least for a few years.” It was partly true, but it\nwas mostly a lie, and Kip felt embarrassed at how easily it passed his lips.\nBut she mistook his embarrassment, thinking it was for needing the\nprotection of women. After the time Kip had spent with the White and with\nKarris, nothing could be further from his mind.\n“Kip, your grandfather’s not going to come after you during the war. If\nhe did, he’d risk losing not just my family, but all of Ruthgar. And after the\nwar… who even can think that far ahead?”\nIt was true. As a political marriage, the union was actually far better for\nthe Guiles than it was for the Malargos family. Though Tisis felt that her\nposition was tenuous—and Andross had deliberately isolated her so she\nwould feel it more keenly—he needed to know that Ruthgar was firmly on\nthe Chromeria’s side. War was here, and the bottomless coffers of the\nMalargos family would be necessary to fund the fight.\nAndross would strengthen his flank and get Kip away from the\nChromeria, where he might cause problems. If Kip betrayed him, Andross\nwould still achieve those things. If Kip obeyed him, on the other hand,\nAndross would put a spy directly into the heart of the Malargos family.\nWho could plan for what would happen after the war? Andross Guile.\nAnd what did Kip get for his participation? A wife set to inherit a\nfortune, a place next to power, and a reputation for defying his grandfather\n—which would be seen as being incredibly brave when he got away with it.\nAfter the war, they could ‘reconcile’ and all would be well. As far as\npolitical marriages went, Kip could do far worse.\nIn fact, he probably couldn’t do better.\nWith Zymun in play, Kip was expendable.\n“What are you thinking there, little storm cloud?” Tisis asked, teasing.\nThat there’s no way out.\nBut maybe that’s the wrong way to think about this. I want to defy my\ngrandfather because he’s an asshole, because he’s been cruel and insulted\nme, because he tried to have me killed.\nThat was before he knew me, though."

        "text": "grandfather because he’s an asshole, because he’s been cruel and insulted\nme, because he tried to have me killed.\nThat was before he knew me, though.\nHe tried to kill Gavin.\nNo, he tried to get the Knife. Gavin got in the way. As long as you\nunderstood that you couldn’t oppose him, Andross was remarkably logical.\nAndross Guile didn’t have friends. He had useful allies, and he had\nenemies.\nThen Kip had an insight into the man, an intuition stark and clear and\ntrue. Life was a game of Nine Kings to Andross. He had opponents, and he\nwould do all he could to destroy them. His opponents had cards, and he\nwould destroy or suborn them. But he himself was simply the Master. His\nown cards were to be preserved while they were of use, but destroyed\nwithout thought if that achieved his ends, and pursued with vengeance if\nthey attempted to play against him. It was that cold and that effective. Kip\nhad tried to figure out what the old man wanted. What motivated Andross\nGuile to work so hard, to plan so deeply? It didn’t seem to be money,\nthough he had plenty of that. It didn’t seem to be women, though he had\nroom slaves. It didn’t seem to be homeland, or Orholam, or even power as\nothers understood it. A man motivated by lust for power would surely want\nto be seen as the master of others. Andross Guile had simply been one of\nthe Spectrum, for many years.\nPerhaps to Andross it was subtler but also simpler: he wanted to win. He\ndidn’t care if everyone knew about his winning; those who mattered would\nknow. He didn’t care about anyone else: who is flattered by the praise of\ninsects? Becoming an emperor in name was unnecessary. If one can wield\nimperial power, if one can make one’s name synonymous with emperor,\nwas that not the greater achievement?\nAnd when Kip thought of it that way, at least one more fact bared its\nteeth: Kip’s status as an apparent enemy of Andross Guile wouldn’t\nnecessarily in the fullness of time be discarded. If, after seven years,\nAndross had other cards better than Kip to play, he might destroy Kip rather\nthan reward him.\nAnd that is the deal for me. Take it or reject it. Eyes open.\nAnd yet… doing what Andross Guile wanted? Everything in Kip\nrebelled against that.\nBut whereas Kip might have blithely risked destroying himself in the\npast, now his actions would affect people he cared about. This wasn’t a\nmatter of right and wrong, but of smart and stupid.\nThere was nothing to gain by defying Andross Guile, and no way to win\nif Kip did so. Why then was it so hard?\n“Just thinking about my grandfather,” Kip said, finally answering Tisis.\n“He’s not a good man to make an enemy.”\n“But he’s not a good friend, either, is he?” Tisis asked.\n“He doesn’t have friends.”\n“I know,” she said. “I’ve been caught in his schemes twice, and each\ntime, I’ve come away hating myself almost as much as I hate him.”\n“He has that effect,” Kip said. “But… how do I know that putting"

Andross may\nbe here, but so are my friends, what few of them I have, anyway.”\n“My sister will know I made the best move in a bad situation—but even\nif she doesn’t, she’s my sister. She loves me, and she’d never turn her back\non me.”\nMust be nice.\nKip had that kind of friendship, with the squad. But it was already\nslipping away. Whatever he did, they were passing inexorably from his life.\nThe one good thing I have is fading already.\n“Let’s do it,” Kip said. He looked at her, looked down at his shoes,\nlooked back up at her. “Uh, how do we do it?”\n“It’s too late in the day now. It’ll have to be done at dawn. We’ll meet a\nluxiat I know at the little temple across from the Crossroads. You know it?”\n“I know the Crossroads. It was the old Tyrean embassy. It’ll be enough\nto find the temple. Wouldn’t it make more sense to go now, and have the\nship captain marry us?”\n“Yes, but no,” she said. “I need the marriage on the books, official, here,\nwith witnesses, by a luxiat in good standing, otherwise your grandfather\nmight have it annulled.”\n“Smart,” Kip said. And it was. Maybe she was smarter than he’d\nthought.\nWhat a terrible thing to think about your future wife.\nShe brightened. “Thank you.”\n“It—”\n“No, really. Thank you. To have my intelligence praised by a Guile?\nThat’s not something we mere mortals often get. I mean, I saw you standing\nthere, thinking, when I asked you that question. You were probably seven\nforks down a winding road in your mind, weren’t you?”\n“Uh. Yes?” Kip asked. He wasn’t sure why it came out as a question.\nProbably because he was receiving the admiration of a woman. Not used to\nthat. Wow, she was pretty.\nTisis said, “I’ve spent weeks thinking about all this—and trying not to\nthink about it—and I tell you, and you figure it out in minutes. It’d be\nvexing if it weren’t so impressive. And not only impressive. It’s almost as\nattractive as these are.” She stepped forward and reached out to lay gentle\nhands on each of his shoulders. “Can I say that? Or do you think me too\nforward?”\nHe knew his shoulders were wide—that was just a function of his bone\nstructure, right? He came from a line of broad-shouldered men. But he\nhadn’t really thought of them as ‘broad’ in the way that people say ‘a broad-\nshouldered man’ and mean it as a compliment. Kip was just big. Right? But\nto have her hands on his shoulders, he couldn’t not be aware of the muscles\nthere, and that she thought he did have broad shoulders in the way that\npeople referred to broad-shouldered men and meant it as a compliment.

Wait, she thought\nhis shoulders were attractive?\nHe hadn’t thought of his shoulders more than three times in his life,\nmaybe. And those had been when he was trying to share a bench in chapel\nand there wasn’t room to sit next to the other wide-shouldered Blackguard\ninitiates. She thought his shoulders were attractive?\nShe was standing right in front of him. This close. His mind wasn’t\nworking—shoulders? shoulders?!—and wow, her lips were close, and full,\nand her eyes were wide and emerald green on green and terrifically\ndistracting, and her eyelashes were long, and her cheeks were pink, but\nmaybe they were always pink, or maybe it was cosmetics? And why\ncouldn’t he, with his Guile memory, remember if they had been pink before\nthis moment? and Orholam have mercy, blood was flooding his cheeks, and,\nand, and, he was supposed to do something, wasn’t he? Yes. Yes, he was.\nHe was supposed to kiss her. Oh shit.\nHe was supposed to kiss her, right now, before the moment passed. But\nwhat if she didn’t want him to kiss her? What if he was misinterpreting the\nsignals? He’d never been signaled before. He could well think she wanted\nhim to kiss her, but maybe she’s signaling something completely different.\nOrholam have mercy, if she did want him to, and he missed the signal,\nshe’d think he was a complete idiot. He was young, younger than her, and\nshe’d think of him as a child again, and then he’d be set back in her regard\nforever. Maybe she’d cancel the wedding.\nWait, she’d asked him a question, hadn’t she? But what—how was he\nforgetting everything?!\nHis ears were hot, and his shoulders were taut as drums beneath her\nhands. She removed a hand from one shoulder, and he nearly leapt, nervous\ntension thrumming through him. Embarrassed, he looked down at his feet,\nunable to bear the eye contact. He’d totally botched it.\nShit shit shit!\nAnd looking down, he saw not his feet, but straight down the front of\nher dress. Orholam’s—breasts. He froze. Now there was a sacrilegious\nthought. Not that he’d ever worried too much about sacrilege when he said\n‘Orholam’s balls,’ and surely Orholam made balls and breasts both, right?\nAnd then, he was aware he’d frozen, looking at her breasts—no, no, not\nlooking. Looking implied that you just looked. This had gone on and on,\nthis was a stare, at least. He’d have a gray beard by the time he tore his eyes\naway. Maybe that made it a leer. But a leer kind of implies some intent. It\nmakes it seem creepy, and he wasn’t being—it was—\nOrholam’s breasts. It had been too long. She couldn’t fail to notice. He\nlooked up at her, wincing.\n“Anything I say is only going to make this worse, isn’t it?” he asked.\n“Shhh,” she said, smiling sympathetically. “Relax.” She picked up one"

There’s no\nway to say ‘adorable’ without pitching your voice up, as if speaking to an\ninfant, Oh, that’s adorable. And then you pinch a cheek.\nShe took his other hand and placed it on the back of her own neck. She\nsidled in close, pressing her body against his.\nI’ve just been emasculated. By my own stupidity and social ineptitude.\nAdorable. Dammit, Kip, there was your chance and you—what is she—?\nAnd then she pulled his head down and kissed him gently on the lips.\nKip… lost a few moments in the sweet smell of her breath—who has\nsweet-smelling breath? Isn’t breath, at best, a neutral o—And the sweet soft\nmoistness of her lips, and the sweet soft pressure of her body molding itself\nto his.\nOh. Oh my.\nShe released him, and, nerveless, he let her slip away.\n“Kip, I know we barely know each other, but I find your quirky mix of\ninnocence and strength… intoxicating.”\nKip swallowed. “Guess it’s a good thing I’m already blushing from, uh,\nthe other thing.”\n“And why’s that a good thing?”\nBecause otherwise my blood would be getting confused which end of\nme to rush to. “So I don’t have to go to the effort of blushing anew,” he\nsaid.\nShe laughed, and he stole a glance at her cleavage. And then felt weird.\nNow that they were basically betrothed—they were betrothed now, weren’t\nthey?—was he supposed to stare at her boldly? Or was it leering?\nOrholam, I don’t know anything!\nHe glanced at the door.\n“What are you doing?” she asked.\n“Honestly?” he asked.\n“Honestly.”\n“I was kind of hoping bad people would break down the door, and I’d\nhave to fight them. I actually know how to deal with that kind of thing.”\n“The virgin thing, huh?” she said.\nHe groaned. “Er, kind of hoped I’d buried that in all the words after it.”\nShe pursed her lips, eyes twinkling. “There might have been another hint\nor two.”\nKip covered his face with his hands. “Orholam take me now. I’m\nridiculous.”\n“I told you already: you’re adorable.”\n“A woman doesn’t want to take a man to bed because he’s adorable.” It\njust came out.\n“This one does.” Just as fast.\nAnd suddenly Kip’s mouth was very dry.\n“We’re going to take care of your little problem,” she said.\n“My… huh?” It was like she was speaking another language.

Surely the word ‘virgin’ must draw ears more than any\nexpletive. “Yes, yes, of course,” Kip said. “I mean, yes! I would really like\nthat.” He hitched his backpack up on his shoulder. “Believe me, I’m looking\nforward to nothing more.”\n“Now.” She locked the door, glanced at his bed, smiled. And though her\nwords were bold, there was something shy about that smile, and certainly\nabout the flushed cheeks that accompanied it. Pinker than before. Definitely\npinker.\nBut Kip the Lip had absolutely nothing to say.\n“After all,” she said, “boat’s not going to leave without me, right? Now\nget naked.”\nThe sound that came out of Kip’s mouth was not a squeak. Dammit.\nKip looked at the door again, longingly. Naked? Here? In full light? He\nwasn’t as fat as he used to be, he knew that… but he’d seen Tisis naked.\nAmazing how keen the memory can be for such things. She was gorgeous,\nand he was… he was the fucking turtle-bear.\nMaybe ‘fucking’ is an inapt modifier.\nAnd that made him think of a turtle-bear, copulating.\nAh!\nI can’t stop thinking. I’m with a beautiful woman who wants to make\nlove, and I’m standing here like a complete non-copulating turtle-bear,\nthinking.\nMaybe if she kissed him again his head would go all gooey and thought\nwould cease in the pink happy cloud of being wrapped up in her, but, ‘Get\nnaked’?\n“Wait, wait,” she said. “You’re right. I can tell you’re thinking it\nthrough, and you don’t want to reject me, but just in case something goes\nwrong before we get on the ship tomorrow. We shouldn’t. My sister would\nkill me, anyway. Not that she’s been chaste—the hypocrite.” She threw the\ninsult out like only someone who’s very close to their sister could. A\nrecognition, but not a condemnation. “But she’s always meant to sell me\ndear, she says, ‘You don’t hand over the goods until they hand over the\ngold,’ and I’m sure she’ll ask, even if everything turns out perfectly. And\nshe can always tell when I’m lying. I can wait one more day. You can wait,\nright? I didn’t mean to tease.”\n“Huh? Huh?” Kip said. I’m right?\n“Blame me. I’m capricious. Sorry. Tomorrow. Either we’ll rent a room at\nthe Crossroads, or we’ll just have to make do with the captain’s cabin on\nour ship. In some ways, a big room is a waste, anyway, don’t you think?

This\nwas that. A thousand times that.\n“Oh,” she said, “definitely interested.”\nThe thing that made it ridiculously charming was that she was blushing\nfuriously as she did it, like she was being terribly naughty and couldn’t\nbelieve her own brazenness. But she also hadn’t taken her hand off.\n“Kip, I know we didn’t get the best start, and that’s my fault, but—”\nThere was a knock on his door.\nTisis snatched her hand back guiltily, but quickly recovered. She cocked\nan eyebrow at him. “Now, see what I saved us? That could have been\nawkward,” she whispered.\nKip was still speechless, still blinking bleary-eyed as if he’d been\ndunked in a big sudsy tub of I-can’t-believe-this-actually-happening and\nsome soap of I-am-actually-going-to-have-sex was still in his eyes.\nBut some wiser part of him was detached. We’re children, both of us,\nplaying at being adults, putting on shoes that are too big for us, and being\nsurprised when we stumble.\nTisis whispered again, and this time she was simply herself, earnest and\na little scared. “Kip, whoever it is, don’t let them know I’m here.” She\nmoved into the lee of the door.\nKip’s mouth worked silently, but he had nothing to say. He went to the\ndoor and opened it a bit, not so little as to cause suspicion, but not inviting\nanyone to step right in, either.\n“Oh, Kip! Thank Orholam you’re here!” Teia said.\nChapter 88\nIt wasn’t yet dawn of Sun Day when Karris and Commander Ironfist and\ntheir squad rowed into sight of Big Jasper. Exhausted from skimming all the\nway to Rath, and then fighting, they hadn’t been able to get all the way back\nbefore they ran out of daylight, even on the eve of the longest day of the\nyear. It was only because of Ben-hadad, young genius, that they’d been able\nto navigate the rest of the way home with the stars.\nHe’d drafted a perfectly working mariner’s astrolabe from memory,\ncalculated their latitude, estimated their rowing speed, remembered the\nlatitude of Big Jasper, told them they could make it by dawn if they rowed\nall night, and kept them on course.\nMostly. Karris had thought that the enormous spires of the Chromeria\nwould be impossible to miss, but late in the night, a low mist kicked up, and\nthough they could still take their bearing by the stars still visible overhead,\nthey found themselves west of Big Jasper, having overshot Little Jasper\nentirely.\n“It’s just as well,” Ironfist said quietly. He and Karris had this last shift\non the oars. The others were still asleep. It was almost time to wake them,\nthough. “There will be Lightguards at the Chromeria’s dock.

They’d made a fortune treating nobles and Colors for two\ndecades, but then had freed their slaves and taken a religious oath to treat\nthe poor of Big Jasper.\n“Karris,” Ironfist said after a few more long sweeps, “it’s Sun Day. If we\ndon’t bring Gavin to the Spectrum today… They’re not going to stop\nnaming a new Prism on our word alone.”\n“You saw his eyes,” Karris said. Eye. She felt dead inside.\nA pause. “Blue.”\n“Then you know. Hope is dead. We’ve lost.”\nGavin knew it, too. When night had fallen and they could draft no\nlonger, he had insisted that he help row. It was one thing he was good at,\nhe’d said. But soon he’d passed out, overcome by his wounds and long\nprivation.\nKarris looked at him now, still asleep on the deck, his gouged-out eye\nbandaged as well as they could. She had wanted to see her husband and\nsimply rejoice that he was alive, that he was hers once again. But the first\nthing she noticed—and it had overwhelmed her love and her relief and her\nhope—wasn’t the dirt or the bloody grin or the ruined hand or the burnt-out\neye or the black hair dye or the long beard or his indomitable spirit; it was\nhis good eye, his blue eye, his icy-bright intelligent natural blue eye.\nThey’d come to rescue a Prism. Instead they’d rescued a man.\nThey’d done the impossible, five of them rescuing a man from fifty\nthousand, and it was for nothing.\n“This isn’t how Prisms die,” Ironfist said, keeping his voice barely\nabove a whisper. “When I was named commander of the Blackguard, they\ntold me what to look out for. Nothing about Gavin Guile has been normal.”\n“What is?” Karris asked.\n“I’m not supposed to say. Last thing we need is every Blackguard\nplaying chirurgeon, wondering if she should obey her Prism, or if he’s\ngoing mad.” He looked away and said, “It’s not the first sign, but\neventually, they get color in their irises, and eventually, they break the halo.\nJust like the rest of us.”\n“But…” Karris said. Obviously, that wasn’t what was happening here,\nnot at all.\n“That’s not all. There’s a ceremony, every seven years. I don’t know\nwhat happens, but the first time I had the distinct feeling that Gavin hadn’t\nmade enough friends, and he wasn’t going to be Prism afterward. But an\nodd thing happened: they never had the ceremony, and Gavin kept being\nPrism. After that, everything changed.

The Blue left immediately after Sun Day\nand was killed in a shipwreck, possibly while fleeing pirates. The Green\nretired and since has died. The Yellow was called home to Abornea and died\nmonths later after being thrown from a horse. The Sub-red withdrew to his\nestate on Big Jasper and didn’t leave until his death two years later,\nsupposedly of drink and lotus eating. Delara Orange’s mother somehow\nemerged from what had been called ruinous debts; she’d been gone for\nmuch of the previous few years, missing meetings while she tried to beg,\nborrow, or steal money to keep her house together, but was suddenly\npresent for every meeting. Only the Superviolet and Red seemed\nunchanged. It was spread out over so much time, and the news of some of\nthese didn’t come for six or eight months later, that everyone was already\nengaged in maneuvering over who would take those seats. And Gavin and\nthe White and the Red and the High Luxiats and the satraps and everyone\nelse who was anyone jumped into those fights. No one party emerged as a\ntotal victor. I’m certain of that. I’ve kept tally of the close votes, especially\nthe close votes Andross has won. He didn’t buy or suborn all the new\nColors. It’s been nine and ten years or more now. It would have been clear\nby now if he had them all under his thumb. Which is probably the other\nreason everyone wrote off the changes as coincidence. Who would overturn\na Color if they didn’t have a plan to put in a friendlier face?\n“But I watched again, three years ago now, at the fourteen-year mark.\nNo one was nervous. No one moved their families around, arranged visits,\nor wills, or escapes. There were no contenders to be the next Prism. And the\nday passed in peace. I don’t know what happened. I’ve searched the\nlibraries and every history I can find, but there are no mentions of how a\nPrism is named. None. Not even speculation. Which tells me the lack is\ndeliberate. This is not the work of one man expunging some records, like I\nthought at first. It must be the work of generations of men doing that. Think\neven of the oral histories, which can’t be stopped: even they speak only of\nparties and gathering of the Spectrum and satraps and luxiats, with a whiff\nof the usual politicking, and at the end, always, always, total unity and\nagreement, with ‘Orholam having spoken.’ I know these men, and Orholam\ncould show up in a pillar of fire in the middle of the room and turn half the\ncouncilors into goats, and the other half would still not be in total\nagreement and unity afterward. And I can tell when Gavin is ready for a\nchallenge or a fight or even a game. He doesn’t contain his excitement. He\ndoesn’t even try.\n“And he’s not been excited. Because he doesn’t know. I’ve never been\nsure whether I should be glad the Prism isn’t part of this conspiracy, or\nterrified because of that. But this, his eyes, they prove to me that we’re\nfacing something unprecedented.”"

He hadn’t known what secret alliances\nGavin might have made, and he hadn’t known or probably had any way to\nfind out about the ceremony without exposing his real identity. And perhaps\nno one had bothered trying to enlist his aid for their schemes because they\nthought he would be dead when they carried them out.\nGavin had been absent half the time, hunting down wights with Karris\nand others in every arc of the Seven Satrapies.

There were layers upon layers of secrets, and at the\nbottom of any you might happen to excavate, you might find that it had all\nbeen a plot to marry this daughter to that son of a higher class, or to\ndisplace another family that had valuable shipping contracts, or a bastard\nson, or a gambling habit.\nOn the other hand, feeling in good health, Gavin might have never even\nrealized that others were plotting what to do when he suddenly died. And\nthen he hadn’t suddenly died. Who would tell him that they had been\nplanning how to take advantage of his sudden death?\nOf course, if he hadn’t thought it all beneath him, if he’d turned his mind\nfully to controlling the Spectrum, he would have noticed. But Gavin was no\nAndross. And Gavin had always his own secret to protect. How much had\nthat hobbled him? If someone made a veiled comment that they expected\nthe real Gavin to understand, would Gavin have demanded they explain, or\nwould he have shied away instead?\nShied away. Every time. He’d hated talking about the war, though he\nmust have practiced those lies to perfection. Hated talking about the past,\nperiod. And he’d done everything he could to make none of it matter:\ndisrupting old alliances, forging new ones, destroying powers and\ndispensing justice where he could, regardless of where those receiving it\nhad stood in the war. It had made him a great Prism, but it had also made\nhim blind to the knives at his back.\nWhich was fine, as long as he was so powerful that no one dared use\nthose knives.\nThere was more there. Something she was missing. A piece she’d been\nhanded. But Karris was tired from rowing half the night, and worrying, and\nyesterday’s fighting had left her bruised and battered. And they weren’t\nhome yet.\n“You’ve got a secret,” Ironfist said. “Something I said made you realize\nsomething.”\n“Yes,” Karris said. She wanted to explain it all to her commander, her\nold friend who’d saved her life on a number of occasions, whom she trusted\nperhaps more than Gavin himself. But she said nothing but, “I’m sorry.”\nHe nodded. “She said you’d say that.”\n“Huh?”"

Exclude me from\nyour counsels. She said you’d apologize for it. She said that would be the\nmoment when you were finally a Blackguard no more. And that it wasn’t a\nbad thing, but it would hurt. And that it was her fault, not yours.”\nKarris shook her head. “You ever think what a pain it is to work with\npeople who are smarter than you?”\n“No, never,” Ironfist said. Simple statement of fact. Because he didn’t?\nBut when she shot him a look, he was smirking.\nShe couldn’t help but grin back. For an instant.\n“Dammit,” she said. “Hezik, that asshole.” That dead asshole, their\ncolleague.\n“He was intolerable,” Ironfist agreed.\n“Heard he tried to claim that miracle shot you made at Ru,” Karris said.\n“Asshole,” Ironfist said.\nAnd they chuckled. They knew when you had to laugh, as warriors\nknow.\n“So what do we do?” she asked.\n“The White said once you cut the strings that you’d be ready to start\ngiving orders. Your command, Lady Guile.”\nIt was true. She knew what needed to be done. Karris woke the others,\nexcepting only Gavin, who needed the sleep to heal. She gestured to the\nlightening sky. “The commander and I need to get back to the Chromeria.\nWe’re already going to be too late for the dawn rituals. Essel, you and Ben-\nhadad are going to take the Lord Prism to Amalu and Adini’s. You know\nit?” Essel nodded. “If you have to refer to him by name, you call him\nHezik, you understand? It won’t bear scrutiny, but perhaps Hezik will\nprotect the Prism in death as he did in life. We’ll send any backup we can.\nDon’t hand him over to the Lightguard no matter what.”\nWith Gavin’s hair dyed dark, and his beard grown in, and so much of his\nskin wrapped in bandages and with all the weight he’d lost, he certainly\ndidn’t look like the Prism of old.\nShe saw by the end of her orders that Gavin was awake.\nHe stood and took Ironfist’s cloak, swaddling himself in the big garment\nand throwing the hood on. Soon it would be too warm for such, and cause\nmore questions than it staved off, but for the moment it was the right move.\nHe looked up at her, and the movement must have broken a scab because\nshe saw him wince and wince again and a dribble of fresh blood escaped\nfrom under his bandage and coursed down his cheek. He steadied himself\non Essel’s shoulder.\n“Just when I think I have your measure, dear Karris,” he said, his voice\nlow but steady in spite of the pain. “You exceed my expectations all over\nagain. I am blessed and honored above all deserving to have you as my\nbride. But you’re right. You must go. My father will have planned mischief\nand worse for this day. You can’t help them heal me, and you can’t stop him"

Go, my love, go.”\nChapter 89\nTeia didn’t wait at the door. Instead, she threw herself at Kip and gave him\na fierce hug.\nOh no. As she froze in his arms, Kip wished for the first time that he was\nstill as fat as he used to be. With his belly protruding, he might have had a\nchance. As it was, the difference in their heights meant their first point of\ncontact was below Kip’s belt… and right in the middle of Teia’s stomach.\nThere was no way to ignore it. She’d hugged Kip, and there was no way she\ncouldn’t notice.\nShe stepped back and looked down, to confirm what didn’t need\nconfirmation. Kip folded his hands in front of himself, which was pretty\nmuch closing the barn door after the cows were already out.\n“Kip, what the hell?” she said. “Is that for—”\nFor you? Hey, they come on fast, but not that fast.\nThe words were out before Kip realized he’d said them aloud. Oh shit.\n“Oh, you were—I’m so sorry!”\n“No! I was—sometimes they just happen. You know, just out of\nnowhere. You know, to young men.”\nTeia cocked her head, her lips pursed and one eyebrow lifted. She folded\nher arms, nonplussed. Not Kip’s best evasion ever.\nWithout turning her head, Teia swung the door shut behind her with a\nfoot, exposing Tisis.\nTeia’s expression went carefully blank. It did that when she was furious.\n“Constant as an oak, aren’t you, Kip?”\n“I, I—this isn’t, this isn’t… this is probably exactly what it looks like.”\nKip looked plaintively. “Teia—”\n“I don’t care. I don’t have time for this. I need you. Right now.”\n“Pardon?” Tisis said, coming out of the corner as if she’d simply been\ninspecting the drapes, haughty and put-upon, chin lifting.\nOh hells.\n“Shut it, bauble, or eat fist,” Teia said. She didn’t turn her head, but her\npupils flared as she looked at Kip—flared, in an instant, so wide that the\nirises were reduced to the tiniest rings, and then those pushed back so far\nthat the whites of her eyes disappeared altogether. Her eyes became perfect\nblack orbs. Kip knew she was gathering paryl, but with her set jaw and\nsneer, Teia’s suddenly inhuman eyes made Kip want to wet himself.\nTisis shut it. Teia ignored her, going straight to Kip’s bureau and rifling\nthrough it.\n“Kip, you’re a great gushing shit sphincter, but I’ve got more important\nthings to worry about. There’s—” She glanced distrustfully at Tisis, and\nstopped. She went back to digging and quickly pulled out Kip’s lens belt\nand tossed it to him. She looked at Kip. “You have any other weapons here?"

The White’s in danger. I may be the only one who can\nsave her.”\nTisis said, “I’m sure a color-blind drafter is exactly what the\nBlackguards need to do their—”\nTeia pointed a finger at Tisis’s nose, getting right in the older girl’s face.\n“One more word, poppet. Give me the excuse. Breaker, now!”\nThe other thing? Oh, she meant the cards. Kip wedged his fingers behind\nhis bureau and pulled it away from the wall. In the space underneath, he\ngrabbed the card box.\nTeia looked unimpressed. “I really need to show you better hiding\nplaces.”\nKip strapped on the lens holster. “Tisis,” he said, “go to the docks. I’ll\nmeet you there as soon as I can.”\nTeia turned and pointed. “Tisis, there are coin sticks on that rafter.”\n“What?” Tisis said.\n“Use green, moron! Knock them down with luxin and take them with\nyou as you go. We can’t carry anything extra. Orholam’s balls you’re\ndumb.”\nThey left her standing there, fuming, and ran to the lift.\nAs they got in, Teia pulled out the gray cloak and fingered the twin\nblack-and-white disks stitched on the back. “Kip, where’d you get this\ncloak?” she asked.\n“I stole it from a god or a demon or something. Something bad.”\nTeia looked at him, exasperated. “Asshole.”\n“Teia, listen to me. I’m going to marry Tisis—”\n“I don’t care. We need to talk about our strategy upstairs.”\n“Teia! My grandfather has commanded—”\n“So you are working for him. What was all this, part of a ruse?”\n“What was all what? Ruse? What are you talking about? Teia, you of all\npeople should understand!”\n“Of all people? And why’s that?”\n“You were a slave!”\n“Oh, I’d forgotten about that. Perhaps you—”\n“You should understand what it is to have to obey orders you—”\n“—have forgotten that you’re free. Don’t you dare tell me you know\nwhat it’s like!”\n“I’m doing it for the squad, Teia.”\n“I could tell. Had your horn up for us, did you? Funny how the things\nyou do for others end up benefiting you most of all. You’re a Guile, Kip.\nThrough and through, and all Guiles are the same.”\nKip dropped his hands. She was past reason. And the lift was here.\nThey got on. Kip shifted the counterweights. He remembered it\nrequiring more weight the last time he and Teia had taken the lift with just\nthe two of them. Teia said, “An assassin of the Broken Eye took a contract\nfrom your grandfather to kill the White. He put a paryl trap around the\nWhite’s heart. She may already be dead. If she’s not, I’ll need to work on it.\nIf we’re discovered, I need you and the squad to hold the door while I work."

Not a problem for me alone,\nbut like I said, I may need you once we get in the room.”\nKip absorbed it in silence. “The squad?” he asked finally.\n“Should be meeting us up there. At least some of them. I sent Marissia\nto find them.”\nAll Guiles are the same, huh? “Fine, I got a plan.”\n“Which is?” Teia asked, as they started ascending.\nKip said nothing.\n“Breaker, I’m serious. What’s the plan?”\nKip turned a contemptuous look on her, then looked away, dismissing\nher. He could practically feel the air chill. It wasn’t fair of him. Dammit. He\nshould open that Lip and apologize immediately.\nBut he didn’t. And just as he was reconsidering, the lift stopped at an\nearlier level. Caelia Green stepped on with her distinctive swinging gait,\nfollowed by her Blackguards, men Kip didn’t know well. She looked up at\nKip, then at Teia.\n“I think it’s past time we get to know each other, Kip Guile,” she said. “I\nam Tyrea’s Color after all, and truth is, I don’t know my people all that\nwell, and there are far too few Tyreans here at the Chromeria. You do\nconsider yourself a Tyrean?”\n“Of course,” Kip said. This? Now?\n“Ah. Just didn’t know if you thought you’d outgrown that somehow,”\nshe said. “We should talk.”\nAnd then she got off at one of the upper levels. Kip and Teia continued\non, but there was no way to apologize before they arrived at the top level of\nthe Prism’s Tower.\nThe rest of the squad was standing there waiting for them in the\nreception area. All of them were wearing their grays. All of them were\narmed, but there was no tension in the air. They were curious why they’d\nbeen summoned.\n“Hey, Breaker!” Ferkudi said. “What’s happening? What’s the game?\nWhere’s Teia?”\nCruxer, though, saw the look on Kip’s face immediately. He stepped\nclose. “The Guile room slave sent us here. Told us to be armed. Said that\nyou and Teia would meet us. What’s—”\nKip glanced around. Teia was gone.\nOh, not gone. Just not visible. Keeping her presence secret. Fair enough.\n“No time,” he said, walking past Cruxer.\nThree Lightguards stood at the usual Blackguard post. They were\nstanding side by side, fully blocking the hall. Ten paces behind them, the\nBlackguards waited, looking peeved about having been evicted, but clearly\nunder orders not to do anything about it.\nKip stood up on tiptoe briefly as he walked toward the checkpoint to see\nwhich Blackguards were on duty. He squinted and drew his green\nspectacles smoothly from his hip case. “Gav Greyling? Is that you?”\nBig Leo whispered behind him, “Boom.”"

Is that you?”\nBig Leo whispered behind him, “Boom.”\n“Ayup!” Gavin Greyling said.\n“What’s your orders?” Kip said, again bobbing up on tiptoe like a little\nkid to look past the Lightguards.\n“Son, you’re going to have to hold up,” one of the Lightguards said.\n“Not to interfere with the Lightguards. Not in any way,” Gav\nannounced.\n“Boom?” Ferkudi asked, confused.\n“Son, I mean—”\n“Oh,” Kip said to Gavin Greyling, “that’s—” He was close enough.\nAmateurs.\nForearm strike to the neck. Kip caught the man on the left so hard, right\nunder his jawline, that the man was launched into the wall. Kip used the\nfollow-through to build torsion through his core. He whipped back to smash\nhis elbow into the noseguard of the middle guard’s helmet. The man hadn’t\nbothered to tie his chinstrap, so his noseguard became the metal vanguard\nof Kip’s attack. The man flopped into the third guard, already unconscious.\nHis collision knocked the spear from the third man’s grasp. The\nLightguard went for a belt knife. It was a cross-body grab, and Kip blocked\nhim from drawing it, first grabbing the man’s wrist, and then wrapping\ngreen luxin around the man’s wrist, hand, and belt, chaining them together.\nThe man tugged frantically, fighting his own belt. Kip was already\ngrabbing him by the throat in one hand. He brought up his other fist and\nmade thorny spikes sprout from it. But didn’t punch.\nAll the fight went out of the last Lightguard.\n“Lie down and pretend to be unconscious,” Kip said.\nThe man nodded quickly, wide-eyed.\nKip let go of him, and the man knelt and awkwardly lowered himself\nonto the ground with only one hand.\n“Oh!” Ferkudi exclaimed, getting it. “Boom!”\n“Hanging hairies, Ferkudi,” Big Leo said, “sometimes I think you have\ngot to be faking it.”\n“Faking what?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Hold the hall,” Kip told Cruxer.\n“We got it,” Cruxer said.\nThe squad rapidly gathered the Lightguards’ weapons. The full\nBlackguards, Gavin Greyling and the shaven-headed Asif, were grinning at\nhow Kip had dispatched the Lightguard, but they still barred the way.\n“I’ve no doubt you’re going to pay for that, nunk, but it sure was fun to\nwatch,” Gavin said.\n“The White’s in danger,” Kip said. “Something only… something only I\ncan see.”\nAnd like that, the men were on alert. They went straight past the guards\nat the door. Kip stopped at the White’s door for a moment and looked back,\nas if pensive, to give Teia a chance to sneak in.\nWinsen crouched over the third Lightguard. “Hey, friend,” he said. “No\nneed to pretend.”\n“Huh?” the guard asked, opening his eyes.\nWinsen’s fist cracked across his jaw.

He grinned, but there was\nalways something a little cool about even his friendliness. He enjoyed this,\nand he liked Kip, but he didn’t quite like people the way other people did.\nKip nodded to him and went in.\n“Hold the door,” Kip said to the Blackguards, “and please don’t look?”\nThey pursed their lips, but Gavin Greyling nodded. Kip pulled a curtain\nas he approached.\nTeia was already standing at the foot of the White’s bed, her eyes black\norbs in the low light of the room. It was dark outside, and Kip could see\nonly pinpricks of light out her windows, the lamps of the rich people’s\nhomes and the lamps of the rich people’s streets, tapering off into darkness\non the poorer north side.\n“I’m too late,” Teia said. “I can’t… It’s like he made this hoping I’d try\nto disrupt it. If I touch them, she’ll die. But if I don’t touch them, she’ll die\nanyway. It’s somehow starving her heart. Her heart is dying. But if she so\nmuch as coughs… Kip, what do I do?”\n“Shhh, child,” the White said.\nKip started. He didn’t even know she was awake. Didn’t know she could\nwake. Two Blackguards had stayed, but others had fled to get help.\n“Wake my room slave, Kip, and say nothing more for the moment.\nAdrasteia, get behind the curtain, please.”\nKip walked to the slave’s closet and knocked. No response. He opened\nthe door, and saw the old woman, snoring in her chair. “Caleen,” he said.\n“Caleen!”\nShe snorted and opened her eyes, then followed him blearily. And\nslowly. Damn she was old. But by the time they got back, Teia had hidden.\nThe White said, “It’s my time, Bilhah. Summon High Luxiat Selene.\nAsk no one else to come in. I don’t wish my end to be all a clamor and\npanic.”\nBilhah shuffled out past the Blackguards, slowly.\nWhen the door closed behind her, Teia came out from behind the curtain.\nShe asked, “Why did I have to hide? I mean, why’d I have to hide from\nher?”\n“So you wouldn’t have to kill her,” the White said. “She’s been reporting\nto Andross Guile for ten years now. She has a grandson she loves.”\n“And Andross used it against her,” Kip said bitterly. He didn’t know\nwhy it was hard to believe his grandfather had hired an assassin—the old\nmonster had done it before. But still. Kip had played games with Andross.\nAndross was even charming sometimes. And a murderer. Killing people\nlike they were cards to be cleared from the play surface.\n“Why didn’t you sell her?” Teia asked. “She betrayed you.”\n“Hers was a sin of weakness, not one of malice.

She’s—\nOh.”\nIf the Broken Eye found out Teia had tried to foil the murder of the\nWhite, they’d know she was betraying them. They might figure it out\nanyway.\nThe White said, “You have my permission to tell Kip everything, Teia.\nBut I don’t release you from your mission.”\n“Where’s everyone else?” Kip asked. “It’s not right we should be the\nonly ones here.”\nThe White simply breathed for a few long moments, as if her previous\nspeech had worn her out. “The Spectrum is meeting, appointing Zymun\nPrism-elect. All my friends? Off, away, obeying orders,” she said. “Dying is\na task I can accomplish alone. Adrasteia, stop. That’s enough. If not this\nnight, I’ll die tomorrow.

Go now, go.”\nThey turned and went to the door, but she said, “Kip, not… not you.”\nTeia pulled her hood closed and disappeared, and the White beckoned\nKip closer. “Desk. Card. Take it. And one last puzzle for you, O blood of\nGuile: Not only Prisms fly.”\nKip went to her desk and found the Nine Kings card held between panes\nof glass. The White, much younger: Unbreakable. He tucked it in a pocket.\n“Open the curtains,” the White said. “I would… look upon the light.”\nKip drew the curtains all the way open. It was gray out, not quite dawn.\n“Orholam shine upon you, High Lady,” he said.\nShe didn’t respond. The Blackguards, who’d overheard the last, came to\nstand at her side. Keeping one last watch. Tears were streaking down Gavin\nGreyling’s cheeks.\nKip stepped out into the hall. He couldn’t mourn now. He pushed it off.\nHad to think.\nAlmost dawn on Sun Day, and Zymun was going to be named Prism-\nelect? They’d do it at dawn, or even before, so he could perform the\nmorning ceremonies.

They piled into the lift and set the counterweights. Made it, thank\nOrholam.\nCruxer threw the lever, and they dropped—one level.\nThe lift jerked to a stop so hard it nearly knocked them all off their feet.\n“What are you doing, Captain?” Ferkudi asked Cruxer.\nCruxer said, “It wasn’t me.” He flipped the lever back and forth to show\nthem.\nThey were at the Spectrum’s level. Kip turned to see a smug Grinwoody.\nApparently the lever in his hand was some kind of override. “Ah, hello,\nsirs,” he said. “Promachos Guile demands you come with me. Now.”\nHis triumphant grin told Kip just how much trouble they were in.\nChapter 90\nFor one mad moment, Kip thought about beating the hell out of Grinwoody\nand making a run for it. It was, of course, a terrible plan, but that grossly\ngrinning face made it so tempting.\nInstead, Kip and the squad followed Grinwoody to the Lightguard\ncheckpoint, heart like a stone. There was no general Blackguard checkpoint\nhere: their numbers were too depleted now. They were only stationed\ndirectly outside the council chamber, down the hall.\nBut as they got closer to the four Lightguards, a young Lightguard\nofficer stood up with difficulty from the chair where he’d been resting. He\nlifted himself with the help of a boar spear. The crossbar was designed to\nstop the penetration of the spear into a boar’s flesh so it couldn’t gore you,\nbut he was using it as a crutch.\nKip could feel the ripple of recognition pass through the squad, like\nwolves with their hackles rising.\nAram. He had a splint around the knee that Cruxer had destroyed. In the\nyear since he’d been crippled, the young man had obviously been sucking at\nthe teat of bitterness, for his face was twisted more than his leg. But\nwhatever else it had done to him, his injury hadn’t stunted his physical\ngrowth. Aram had filled out. His arms and shoulders were huge even as his\ncrippled leg had withered, and Kip had no doubt that the young man was far\nmore proficient with that boar spear than anyone would guess.\nThere was a flash of something in Aram’s lidded eyes as the squad\napproached, hastily hidden. But Kip recognized it. All the hatred and\nresentment in the world—and Aram’s eyes held his share and more—\ncouldn’t hide that emotion. Not from Kip. It was grief.\nIt was being excluded from a club that you wanted to be part of more\nthan anything. It was not-belonging.\nIt was only in seeing that feeling so perfectly mirrored in Aram’s eyes\nthat Kip realized the void of it in his own heart. When had that ache\ndisappeared? Kip had been an outsider for all his life. The fat boy. The\ndrunkard’s boy. The whore’s son. The Tyrean. The bastard. The unfairly\nfavored. The boy who didn’t deserve to be in the Blackguard.

For all his\nlife, Kip had felt excluded.\nAram was feeling that. He’d lost the Blackguard. Kip was going to lose\nit himself. How could he look at Aram and not feel compassion?\nTechnical ability wasn’t what made a Blackguard, though it was part of\nit. The essence of a Blackguard was sacrifice. They lived and died for each\nother, and that, the unquestioned devotion of the whole corps, made the\nwhole greater than the sum of its parts. A Blackguard could be told to go to\nhis death, and he would, because he loved his fellows and he trusted that his\ncommander wouldn’t waste him. Orders might come down that made no\nsense that you could see, but they did make sense. Mistakes happened, men\nand commanders failed, but not—in this one tiny, precious corner of the\nworld—from malice or selfishness.\nThat was a treasure beyond words, and it was what made the\nBlackguards the best in all the world. That was what Aram lacked. His\nselfishness was poison to the heart of the one most valuable thing the\nBlackguard had.\nBut he couldn’t see it, and that wasn’t reason to hate him. It was reason\nto pity him.\n“Aram,” Kip said. He saw the insignia on the young man’s lapel.\n“Lieutenant.” Respectful, but not deferring.\nAnd the grief was gone. There was only hatred there, but Kip was\nunmoved by it, even as the squad bristled at Aram’s open sneer.\nAram said, “Search them. No one may go armed with the Spectrum\nmeeting on this level.”\nA Lightguard came forward to search and disarm Kip, and Kip was\nsuddenly tired. They were really going to play this? Again?\n“Uh-uh,” he said. He pushed the Lightguard’s hand aside.\nWith a voice equally tired, bored, and exasperated, Kip said, “I’m a full-\nspectrum polychrome. This is the best squad among the Blackguard\ninitiates. We are weapons. There’s no such thing as disarming us. And we,\nfor our part, are compelled as Blackguards not to let ourselves be disarmed\nwithin the Chromeria itself. It goes to the very heart of who we are. We are\nthose who are trusted with weapons here. We make ourselves slaves to earn\nthat trust. So what you’re asking is both pointless for you and impossible\nfor us.” Kip said the words to the man who was approaching him, but they\nwere for Aram, and more than that, for Grinwoody.\n“Grinwoody,” Kip said, still bored, not turning his head to look at the\nslave, and still deliberately using his name in order to offend. “Use that\nunctuous voice of yours and the authority my grandfather has so\nmysteriously granted you, and clear this rabble.”\nThe sour look on Grinwoody’s face was worth a thousand nights in hell.\nHe waved the Lightguards away, and together, the squad walked past.\nBut then Grinwoody stopped before they got to the council chambers."

He didn’t\nwait for Kip to acquiesce. He kept talking. “Your grandfather will berate\nyou and accuse you of something. You will protest loudly—shouting is\ngood, but not for too long. We need a spectacle, not a fight. And then he will\nbanish you.\n“You will then have one hour until the promachos publicly changes his\nmind and orders you brought in for questioning. Don’t be captured. The girl\nand a luxiat will meet you at red dock five, where her ship is anchored. Get\nthe wedding taken care of before you leave the island. You understand? It\nmust be done here, publicly, or the deal’s off.”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said, worried, “what is this?”\n“It’s survival.”\nThe squad said nothing. Kip didn’t look back. Blackguards got used to\nfollowing those they thought were making mistakes or endangering\nthemselves recklessly, and though the squad hadn’t yet taken final vows,\nthey’d still seen the attitude modeled enough times that they could emulate\nit.\n“We go where you go,” Cruxer said. Anyone who didn’t know Cruxer as\nwell as Kip did would have missed the sorrow in his tone. Dear Orholam, it\nwas going to be hard to say goodbye. Maybe it was best this way, though.\nOne farewell at the docks rather than slowly watching the void grow\nbetween them and Kip as their duties pulled them inexorably away.\nThe first Blackguard at the door was Gill Greyling. He’d watched Kip’s\ninteraction with the Lightguards, and he seemed immensely pleased. He\ngave Kip the kind of salute that was supposed to be reserved for senior\nofficers, then said, “Oops,” unapologetically.\n“You’re supposed to go right in,” the other Blackguard said. Kip didn’t\nknow him well. Parian named Kalif, if he remembered right.\nKip thought they were headed for the Spectrum’s council chamber, but\ninstead, this was the Spectrum’s audience chamber. The Blackguards\nopened the double doors, and Kip found himself staring at several hundred\npeople from the side entrance, with many of them staring back.\nOne of the High Luxiats was speaking at the front of the room.\nEveryone was dressed in their best attire for Sun Day, and all the High\nLuxiats except Selene were in attendance, in ceremonial robes of a\nparticular color or of many. Some high nobles were seated, too, with sons\nand daughters at the front, in places of honor of some kind. The doors\ncreaked loudly as they opened, and the High Luxiat seemed thrown off his\nsermon.\nFrom a seat on the dais, Andross Guile stood and hurried toward Kip. He\nkept his head down as if he were trying not to interrupt, but he moved fast\nenough that he drew every eye.\nAs the luxiat began speaking again, Andross reached Kip and motioned"

Kip tried to back up, but with\nthe whole squad and the Blackguards behind him, he didn’t get all the way\nout into the hall before Andross began. “How dare you show your face\nhere?!” Andross hissed. “I heard what you’ve done!”\n“What are you talking about?” Kip demanded.\n“Is it that you’re guilty of so many things, you want me to tell you\nwhich one I found out about?” Andross said, voice rising. He kept his back\ncarefully to the audience chamber, to maintain the illusion that he didn’t\nknow everyone could overhear them.\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about!” Kip said, matching his\ngrandfather in volume. “I haven’t done—”\n“You and your squad killed a man! We found him. We found witnesses!”\n“What man?” Kip asked.\n“In the Six Corners district.”\nKip put a hand to his mouth. Suddenly this wasn’t a game. That was\nwhere Teia killed the man who’d been tracking them. He’d thought Andross\nwas going to make something up out of a whole cloth, not convict them of\nsomething they really had done.\n“There was no evidence that the man was a spy. None!” Andross\nshouted now. The luxiat in the room behind him had stopped even trying to\npreach. “Orholam help you, Kip. At best you’re a vigilante, at worst, a\nmurderer.”\n“I—”\n“What did you think? That I’d shield you because you’re my grandson?\nNo. And I’ve heard what you’ve done with this squad of yours. I don’t\nknow how you turned the best of the Blackguard recruits, but I won’t\ntolerate anyone making a private army on my watch. What is it you call\nyourselves? The Mighty?”\nOf course they called themselves no such thing. Kip’s head was\nspinning.\n“I didn’t… I wasn’t…” he started to protest.\n“Hold!” a voice shouted from the door at the back of the audience\nchamber. It was Commander Ironfist. It was like watching the axle rattle\nloose on a carriage. There was nothing Kip could do to stop it. There was\nno way the commander knew this was prearranged.\nThe commander was sweating freely, his chest heaving as if he’d run\nleagues to get here. “Kip was under my authority at all times. High Lord\nPromachos, there was no—”\n“Yes!” Andross Guile interjected, cutting him off. A hint of a grin curled\nthe side of his mouth but disappeared before he turned back toward the\nchamber, and Kip’s heart sank.\nHe’d seen that look before. That look was the look Andross gave when\nKip had made a mistake playing Nine Kings. It was the look of a child\nbeing given an unexpected gift, as if the world stunned him at times with its\nsheer stupidity. Andross hadn’t planned that Commander Ironfist be here,\nbut he knew what to do now that he was."

You have served long and hard, and I am loath to hold your\nfailures against you, Commander, but you have done your term of service\nhonorably, if poorly in this last year. Commander Ironfist, you are hereby\nrelieved of your command and your commission. You will retire with full\nhonors and stipend, effective immediately.”\nKip felt like he’d been hit in the face with a shovel. One part of him saw\nthe art in the lies, the questions spawned by Andross’s words. People were\nsuddenly wondering, in what ways had Commander Ironfist failed? Many\nof them knew that Ironfist and Andross Guile hadn’t gotten along, but\nAndross’s apparent grief at having to relieve Ironfist of command, and the\nway he seemingly honored the man even as he kicked him out—his very\ngrace in victory made it seem obvious that whatever the conflict had been, it\nhad been Ironfist’s fault.\nIronfist looked gutted. He seemed like he didn’t even know where to\nlook, glancing from Andross Guile to Kip, even at Grinwoody.\nKip wanted to throw up. He wanted to kill Andross Guile.\n“And you, Kip,” Andross said. He turned, as if suddenly aware of how\npublic this had become. “Everyone, I’m terribly sorry you had to see this.\nKip, I will not shield you because you are family. The evidence, though far\nfrom certain, is quite suggestive. Kip, you’re expelled from the Chromeria,\nexpelled from the Blackguard, and exiled from the Jaspers. Effective\nimmediately. If any of your Mighty go with you, they, too, are expelled and\nexiled. Begone, grandson.”\n“I—”\n“Begone! Before I change my mind! Out!” he roared.\nKip trembled with rage. Not for himself, but that he’d let Ironfist get\ncaught up in this. And suddenly, Gill Greyling and Kalif were very close\nbehind him.\nTo protect Andross Guile against him.\nNo, no. Not like this.\nIn a daze, Kip went out. The squad and even Commander Ironfist went\nout with him. The double doors closed, but before anyone could say\nanything, they opened once more, and Andross poked his head out.\n“Commander,” he said quietly. “I know how your Blackguards love you. If\nyou lead a rebellion, I bet half would join you. So it’s your decision: is that\nwhat you want for either half of the Blackguard? Afterward, I’ll disband\nthem. You’ll have ended your precious Blackguard.”\nThen Andross disappeared back into the room. The doors closed after\nhim.\nKip looked at Ironfist’s face, and was afraid. The huge warrior trembled\nwith rage, his fists clenched hard at his sides. Kip never precisely forgot that\nIronfist was huge and tall and perhaps the best fighter he would ever meet,"

He heard\nIronfist breathing: in on a four count, hold for a four count, out for a four\ncount, empty for a four count. It was the very calming technique he’d taught\nthem to moderate the battle juice or to steady rage.\nThe commander turned to Kip. “So she’s dead, then?” His voice was\ncontrolled. He meant the White.\n“By now. We saw her not ten minutes ago. She was passing quickly.”\nKip wanted to say more, but the other Blackguards were still in the hall.\nIronfist started walking toward the lift, and they fell in behind him\nnaturally.\n“Well, who looks like whipped puppies?” Aram said as they passed the\nLightguard checkpoint. He laughed noisily.\nFollowing Ironfist’s example, Kip did nothing. Aram would expect him\nto attack. Kip did nothing, and Aram turned, laughing at him.\nAfter Kip was past him, he heard the clong of helmet on stone, and the\nlaughter abruptly stopped.\nKip glanced back, but the squad hadn’t even broken stride. Aram was\ntottering, eyes unfocused, his helmet pushed forward over his eyebrows.\nThe wall behind his head was scratched, as if from a helmet striking it. He\nsat heavily. His Lightguard compatriots were looking at him, puzzled. Kip\nlooked forward, so as not to draw more attention.\nThey got to the lift, and Ironfist, who had never turned, said, “Thank\nyou, Big Leo.”\nKip looked up at his squadmate, but the hulking young man kept looking\nforward, a slight, smug grin on his face.\nThey had to wait for the lift to arrive, and when it did, Karris was on it\nwith two slaves. She was dabbing her flushed face with a handkerchief as if\nshe, too, had been running, as one of the slaves tried to wrestle her long\ndark hair into some order, and the other, scandalized, was still lacing up the\nback of Karris’s dress.\nKarris and her slaves stepped off the lift. “What happened?” Karris\nasked. “Do they know?”\n“No,” Ironfist said. “The promachos just stripped me of my\ncommission.”\n“What?!” Karris asked. “We were only apart for—”\n“You need to go in there. Learn what you can,” Ironfist said. “Tell them\nwhen it’s time. It’s what the White would have wanted.”\n“So she’s dead.” Karris’s face twisted with grief, rapidly pushed down.\n“Don’t let it make you stupid. Go. We’ll meet later,” Ironfist said.\nKarris looked around as if there was more she wanted to say, but that she\nthought spies would overhear. “Tell Kip,” she said. Then she looked at Kip,\nbut didn’t seem to know what to say. She reached a hand out and touched\nKip’s shoulder awkwardly, as if trying to apologize for their last encounter.\nBut there wasn’t time.

Aram was still seated, holding his head. The other Lightguards\nlooked unnerved.\n“You’re not going to touch me,” Karris announced, looking right past\nthem, head held high, the force of her personality preceding her small figure\nlike a wave. “You’re not even going to speak to me.”\nThey didn’t.\nChapter 91\nZymun was seated with his grandfather on the dais, where he belonged. For\nnow. The crown of the Prism-elect on his forehead was a welcome weight.\nBut he’d hoped for more. Prism-elect? Why was he not simply the Prism?\nIt was his grandfather’s work, of course. The old man was keeping a\nleash on him. Zymun would make him pay, eventually. He was already\nirritated that the High Luxiat was the center of attention, droning on and on.\nZymun had feigned respectful deference for some interminable length of\ntime, but the luxiat simply wouldn’t shut up. So now Zymun was looking\nout at the assorted nobles and deciding which women he would bed.\nWomen afforded such drama; he loved it. The hunt was a thing of\nbeauty. An avalanche of words and your full attention, watching always to\nsee what flattery worked best, feeling out the weak points, returning to them\noften. Unrelenting attention, pretending she was the center of your world.\nThen the lovemaking. First sweet and passionate, animal desire and total\nfocus. And then, once you had them, indifference interspersed with total\nfocus. Apologies, little gifts, confusion, and more lovemaking, degrading\nnow.\nThat was, perhaps, the sweetest part. To watch a woman fall in love and\nto see in her eyes that she knew she shouldn’t and yet she was.\nFrom there, it was merely a matter of completing the destruction.\nFighting, making up, slapping, apologizing, cheating, first stealthily and\nthen getting caught on purpose, apologizing, degrading, stealing and blame\nshifting, then acquiring whatever blackmail you needed to make sure that\nwhen you cast her off she stayed gone. Sometimes with whole weeks of\nsweetness mixed in. And when they were wrung out, poor, humiliated, self-\nhating, and ruined, he would move on, perhaps to her friends.\nMarried women were the best. Sometimes harder to seduce initially, but\nwith more access to money and secrets, and less likely to cling when you\ncut them loose, and while he was still young, it was easier to make them\ntake the blame. After all, he was just a boy. That they had husbands also\nmeant that they had a harder time keeping tabs on him, so he could seek out\nother excitement at the same time.\nLiv Danavis was the only one who’d really escaped him. In his defense,\nshe’d been the side excitement while Zymun was involved with a general’s\nwife. There’d been so much else going on, too. It was a failure, but not one"

It was a failure, but not one\nfor which he could blame himself. He was young, after all, and he hadn’t\nperfected his technique.\nHe was drifting, though. There were plenty of handsome women here,\nbut he wouldn’t pick one only for her looks. Not with his new position.\nMaybe on the side. But he’d have to learn who was who before he\ncommitted time and energy. His grandfather had kept him in the dark about\nthe nobility, and his own plans.\nIt meant Andross feared him. Zymun didn’t know whether to be more\nflattered—an equal!—or irritated. It made things ever so much more\ndifficult. Especially since Zymun needed his grandfather. He couldn’t move\nagainst the old man without destroying his own power. Not until he was\nPrism. Prism-elect could be undone.\nClever old goat.\nBut what had Andross been doing with Kip just now? Kicking him out?\nZymun thought that Andross was going to keep Kip around to guarantee\nZymun’s good behavior. Had he simply let his anger get the best of him? He\nwas the Red after all, and old. Stupid.\nThis morning, in the nauseatingly early hours before dawn when they’d\nwoken to come to the Chromeria, Zymun had done his best to eavesdrop on\nhis grandfather, who was giving orders to his slave, that old wrinkled prune,\nwhatever-his-name-was.\nSomething about tell him he gets an hour. Him?\nThat slave had come into the hall with Kip.\nAndross was giving Kip an hour to run away. Why would Andross do\nsuch a thing?\nSo Kip would get away. Whatever the plan was, Andross wanted the\npursuit to look real, and Kip had an hour.\nZymun fidgeted in his seat and leaned over to his grandfather, who\nappeared to be listening to the High Luxiat’s sermon intently. “I need to use\nthe latrine,” he said.\nAndross said nothing. Eventually he turned a baleful glare on Zymun.\n“What are you, a child? Hold it.”\nZymun was about to go anyway when the side double doors opened\nonce again. It was a rude way to enter the audience hall when there was\nanother, more subtle entrance at the back, and the hinges creaked loudly.\nSome slave or discipula would be beaten for that, Zymun hoped.\nA woman stepped in, petite, early thirties, skinny, oddly muscular, dark\nhair. Her dress was rich enough that it was clear she must be of the high\nnobility. Who would be brash enough to interrupt this ceremony? She was\nbeautiful, though. Rich enough. At her age, certainly married. Maybe she\nwould be a good target for his next seduction. She looked familiar for some\nreason.\nOh, she saw him now, and she looked transfixed. Zymun was\nuncommonly handsome. And he was Prism now. Women love a powerful\nman.\nPrism-elect. Damn.\nShe tore her eyes away from him and looked to the slave at her elbow\nwho was supposed to usher her to a seat. The man seemed flustered; there"

The man seemed flustered; there\nwere no seats up front, where her position obviously demanded she be\nseated.\nThen a noble got up from the very first row. He walked confidently\ndown the center aisle, as the preaching luxiat faltered briefly and then went\non about sacrifice and the light of truth or whatever. Zymun felt more than\nsaw Andross cock his head.\nThe noble waved the slave off and escorted the woman forward. Odd.\nThere were literally no places at the front, and the way the benches were\npacked, they couldn’t simply make room for her.\nBut the noble brought the woman, who looked alternately confused and\nstill captivated by Zymun, up to where he’d been seated himself. The noble\nseated her in his own seat, shot a single inscrutable look at Andross Guile,\nand then left by the side aisle. Zymun watched him go to the back and take\na seat with the low nobles. How odd.\nZymun had a sense that something important had happened, so he\nlooked at Andross Guile, but could read nothing there.\nHe wasn’t always good at reading emotions, though.\nHe shifted in his seat again, and said, “Grandfather, I’m going to leave a\npuddle if I don’t go. Pardon me.”\nWithout waiting for a response, Zymun went out, head bowed and\nconsternation writ on his face so it was clear he was not trying to cause an\ninterruption. He left by a side exit near the dais.\nBlackguards stood at the door both inside and out. After the doors closed\nbehind him, Zymun headed toward the lift.\n“Latrines are that way,” a Blackguard offered, pointing the opposite\ndirection.\nZymun ignored him and walked briskly until he came to the Lightguard\ncheckpoint. “Name?” he demanded of the limping commander.\n“Lieutenant Aram, sir,” the man said. There was a bit of fear in his face,\nbut he was muscular and sour-looking. Zymun knew how to deal with his\ntype. Not much different than the scurvy-ridden pirates he’d just spent\nmonths with.\n“My grandfather has changed his mind about his disowned grandson\nKip,” Zymun said. “Lieutenant, are you capable of taking decisive action\nand delicate orders?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“And your men here? They know how to keep their mouths shut when\ngiven a vital assignment?”\n“Yes, sir!” they said.\nZymun said, “Promachos Guile wants you to capture Kip and any one of\nhis squad who try to stop you. You may use all of the Lightguard.” Zymun\nlowered his voice. “And lieutenant… by capture, the promachos means kill.\nMake it look like you had no choice. You must never breathe a word of this,\nnot even aloud to the promachos. Our enemies have spies everywhere. I\npromise you great rewards if you show you can be trusted. Perhaps even\nadvancement. I am now the Prism-elect. I can be a good friend to you. Do\nyou understand?”"

We can cover those, too.”\n“Don’t come report until he’s dead. Or don’t come at all.”\nThey rushed off, the lieutenant at an odd hobbling gait aided by his boar\nspear. Zymun went to the latrine. It was only as he was pissing that he\nrealized who the woman in the front row must be and why she’d looked\nfamiliar. He’d seen her from afar once in King Garadul’s camp. It was his\nmother, Karris!\nHe laughed aloud. How perfect! Was he good enough to seduce his own\nlong-lost mother? Now that, that would be a challenge. But who better to\nuse to get all the money and information he could ever need to use against\nAndross Guile?\nWas he that good? Yes, he thought, of course he was.\nHe laced up his trousers, readjusted the gold crown on his head, and\nwalked back into the audience hall with a big, big smile on his face.\nChapter 92\n“How long do we have?” Ironfist asked Kip.\n“An hour.” Kip had told Ironfist only that there was a deal with Andross\n—and that relieving Ironfist of his position hadn’t been part of it.\nIronfist nodded, not wasting words on the obvious. They had to move\nfast.\nThey walked quickly into the Blackguard barracks. Teia met them at the\ndoor, playing it off to the squad like she’d just arrived from downstairs.\nAlmost all the Blackguards were on shift today. There was so much work to\ndo on a Sun Day that even the nunks had been pressed into crowd patrol\nand guard duty and overwatch. There were only four or five Blackguards in\nthe barracks, and those were napping for a half hour or grabbing a quick\nmeal before heading out for more shifts.\nMost surprising though, was seeing Ben-hadad. “Oh, thank Orholam,”\nhe said. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you all. What is all this stuff?\nCoin sticks? Weapons? Writs of—”\n“Shut it, Ben-hadad,” Kip said. “Not now.”\n“I can’t wait to tell you where I’ve been! I was—” Ben-hadad started."

It’s for the good of my squad and the\nsatrapies.”\n“Sounds right to me, then.”\n“Will you come with me?” Kip asked. “Even just as far as the docks?”\nIronfist paused. There was a small bag sitting on his desk. He picked it\nup, looked inside. “Andross. That old fox.” He breathed out again, then he\nwalked over to the painting he kept of a young Parian woman. Took out his\nknife and slit down the canvas next to the frame. He reached in and pulled\nout a ceramic tube. He smashed it on his desk. Inside was a slip of paper.\n“What’s that?” Kip asked.\n“Orders,” Ironfist said. He read them. “From the White. One in the event\nof her natural death, one in case of her murder. But, no, Kip, I can’t go with\nyou. If I do, whoever it is your grandfather is trying to fool won’t believe it\nfor a second. He has a falling-out with you, and with me at the same time,\nand I go wherever you go and protect you?

He would never\nguess that I would want to protect you if there wasn’t something in it for\nme, the old fool.”\nKip’s eyebrows raised. He’d never heard Ironfist speak ill of any of the\nColors, even when he clearly thought it.\n“Not a Blackguard anymore,” Ironfist said, winking. But the strain on\nhis face was clear. “I can’t go with you. Not after what’s happened.”\n“You don’t mean what happened upstairs, do you?” Kip asked,\nconfused.\n“Kip.

Another oath failed. Just like he’d\nfailed to find damning information on Klytos Blue, as his father had asked,\nwhat? A year ago?\nThere were too many things happening at once. Too many thoughts and\ntoo much pressure. “Where was he? How’d you find him?” Kip asked. “I\ndidn’t even realize you were gone.”\n“We saved him from my sister. The Nuqaba. She was having him\nblinded.”\n“Your sister? I didn’t even know you had a—” Kip looked at the\npainting. It was of a pretty young woman, hair strung with jewels and piled\nhigh, vibrant brown eyes lit with orange halos. “The Nuqaba’s your\nsister?!”\nBut Ironfist ignored that. He said, “And Andross is right, many or most\nof the Blackguards would join me if I went with you—even as far as the\ndocks. Think of what happens if you split the Blackguard. What would\nvictory be? If our half killed the others, what would we do then? Murder\nAndross and then what? Lay down our arms and be executed? Seize\ncontrol? Rule the Chromeria ourselves? That isn’t who we are.”\n“So what do we do? Just let him win?” Kip was furious. He was doing\nexactly what that murdering spider wanted him to do, but there didn’t seem\nto be any way out. He couldn’t even go to the one man who might be a\nmatch for Andross Guile. His father was finally here—and Kip had to\nleave? Now? Before he even saw him?\nKip said, “He planned this! He’s doing it on Sun Day on purpose. What\neveryone will be talking about will be Sun Day and this year’s party, and\nthe new Prism-elect and what does anyone know about him, and there’ll be\ntributes to the White who everyone loved and speculation on who’ll replace\nher. Normally it would be a huge scandal that he stripped your commission,\nbut this… That you and me got kicked out… Anything else that happens\ntoday will just be buried under the other news, right?”\n“If you’re looking for justice, look not to earth, Breaker.” Ironfist looked\nup suddenly to the crystal embedded in the wall.

It was only normally used for initiation day to announce the\ncolors of new drafters coming through the Threshing—and for emergencies.\nOnly the higher luxiats and Blackguards were supposed to have access to\nthem.\n“That’s not one of our codes,” Ironfist said.\n“What?” Kip asked, but Ironfist was already on his way out of the room.\n“Who’s going with Breaker?” Ironfist asked. “Quick! I can’t. My path is\ndifferent.”\nSlight Daelos seemed to be gathering his courage, and he spoke quickly.\n“My parents would die if I left, Breaker. This is all they’ve ever wanted for\nme. It’s all I’ve ever wanted for myself. Sorry.”\n“I’m not blaming you, Daelos, but he only meant getting me to the\ndocks—” Kip started.\n“No, that’s not what I meant,” Ironfist said. “You go with Breaker,\nyou’re out of the Blackguard. Permanently. The promachos has spoken.”\n“I’ll go,” Cruxer said. His voice was steady, but he looked like he was\ndying.\n“Cut the stitching on the side of your insignia,” Ironfist said.\n“Wait. What?!” Kip said. “Cruxer, what are you saying?”\n“I’ll go,” Ferkudi said.\n“In,” Big Leo rumbled.\n“Wait, what is this?” Kip said.\n“Same here,” Goss said.\n“Wouldn’t be anywhere else,” Teia said.\nWinsen shrugged. “Sounds fun. I’m in.”\n“No time!” Ironfist said. “Line up now. You each found a paper in your\npack. Sign it.”\n“Stop it!” Kip shouted. “What are you doing? You’ve worked your\nentire lives to be Blackguards. You’re this close. I have to go, but me going\nmeans you can stay. Me going means I won’t ever have to fight you.”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said. “Don’t you understand? We’re all good enough\nto be Blackguards. The commander has offered promotions to every last\none of us. But we wanted to be Blackguards not because we wanted to have\nthe clothes and the admiration—”\n“I thought the clothes and the admiration were pretty great,” Teia said.\n“I like the clothes and admiration,” Ferkudi said.\n“Ferkudi!” Cruxer said.\n“Wha—she just said the same—ow! Ben, what’d you elbow me for?”\n“All the trappings are wonderful,” Cruxer said. “But we all wanted to be\nBlackguards because we wanted to serve a high purpose.”\n“But what if I’m not the—” Kip said.\n“It doesn’t have to do with that,” Cruxer said, but Kip wasn’t sure the\nrest of the squad agreed. “What purpose is there in us serving evil men?”\nBen-hadad asked, “What good are the trappings of honor if the honor\nitself is dead?”\n“I still like the trappings,” Ferkudi murmured. He was mournfully"

He was mournfully\nturning his gold inductees’ fight token over in his hand.\n“Breaker,” Teia said. “We love it here. We don’t want to go. But we\nwant to go with you.”\nJust when he thought he was going to lose it all. Kip felt warmth\nsuffusing him, like his body was filling with light.\n“You’ll find two pairs of blacks in your bags,” Ironfist said. “I heard\nsome of you only joined up in the first place because you wanted the\nclothes.” But no one laughed. The blacks were not just a gift rich beyond\nimagining, stretchy-soft and comfortable, luxurious and useful, they were\nthe ultimate symbol of the elite Blackguard and what the squad was giving\nup. That their commander gave them the blacks anyway told them that he\nthought they were worthy of the honor and the brotherhood they were\nchoosing to sacrifice. Ironfist growled, “What, am I gonna have to\nrequisition handkerchiefs? Line up!”\nKip could barely see through his brimming eyes. But the squad lined up\nimmediately, and he took his place at the end.\n“You’re Blackguards no more,” Ironfist said. He walked down the line,\ntook each signed release, and ripped the Blackguard insignia and rank off\ntheir sleeves. Kip was the last. It felt as if Ironfist tore his heart out.\n“Lem,” Ironfist said. “Take these papers down to the secretaries’ desk\nand have them copied in triplicate and put on file.” He handed over the\npapers and simple Lem disappeared.\nIronfist dug into a bag. “You can call yourselves whatever you want\nnow. Make your own patches if you don’t like these. The promachos called\nyou the Mighty.” Ironfist went down the line again and slapped an insignia\non each person’s left shoulder. It was of a powerful man in black silhouetted\non a red field, standing with feet planted, head bowed, arms straight out to\neither side, and force radiating from each hand. It reminded Kip of his time\nin the jungle, when he’d expelled the leeches.\nIronfist said, “Now go, go with Orholam, and may I see you again. If not\non these mortal fields, then in paradise.”\nThey went to the door, and Kip turned as the rest of them went into the\nhall. “Commander, if I may, where’d you get the patches?”\n“Andross Guile had them made.”\n“That many?” Kip asked.\nIronfist nodded. “And the weapons. And the supplies. Minus the blacks.”\nUnbelievable. Just when Kip felt comfortable hating that old murderer,\nAndross had given him his squad back. Andross had not only given them\nweapons and gear, he’d arranged the writs of release so they wouldn’t have\nto pay back the signing monies that all of them had spent or given to their\nfamilies or previous owners. Andross Guile, generous?\n“Sir,” Kip said, “where are you going?”\n“A different front of the same war.”"

Andross Guile, generous?\n“Sir,” Kip said, “where are you going?”\n“A different front of the same war.”\n“Halt!” an unfamiliar voice shouted from the hall where the rest of the\nsquad was. “Which one of you is Kip?”\n“That’s me,” Goss said loudly. “What’s it to you?”\nA musket shot rang out.\nChapter 93\nKip’s first shameful instinct was to run away from the sound of musket fire.\nBut that passed as soon as he saw Ironfist’s face. Ironfist was restraining his\nfirst instinct, too. Except his first instinct was to run toward the sound.\nBut Ironfist didn’t see the fear in Kip’s face. “I can’t,” he said. “Even if\nit means—Go, Breaker, go.” He pushed Kip toward the lift, and ran the\nopposite direction himself.\nIn the very act of moving, Kip was broken out of his indecision. He ran\ntoward the lift, but by the time he got there, not ten seconds after the musket\nshot, all four of the Lightguards were down. Two were screaming, one was\ncrawling away with a torn-out throat, bleeding in gushes, slickening the\nstone floor.\nAll of the squad were still standing. Winsen and Big Leo went to the two\nscreaming, dying Lightguards and opened their jugulars. The crawler\ncollapsed. All four were twitching.\n“Oh, shit,” Ferkudi said. “Goss, are you hurt? I thought—”\nGoss was blinking. “I, Orholam’s balls,” he said. “I don’t know how he\nmissed. Musket ball must have fallen out before he fired or something. Bad\njob packing the—” He collapsed.\nCruxer barely caught him in time, easing him to the bloody stones. But\nGoss was dead. There was a hole right in the center of his chest.\n“They came to murder us,” Cruxer said. He closed Goss’s eyes. “No\nwarning. That was no attempt at capture.”\n“We gotta move,” Teia said.\nBut as she said it, they heard loud thunks from the lift shaft. Big Leo\nignored it. He picked up Goss’s body. “I can’t just leave him here. I’ll catch\nup.”\nThe thunks continued, and Kip arrived at the lift shaft in time to see\nhuge iron doors slam into place over the shaft at each level.\n“It’s part of each tower’s defenses,” Cruxer said. “Parents told me about\nit. They’re hinged one way, so soldiers can be sent up the lifts, but no one\ncan get down.”\n“Surely we could draft levers and pulleys or something,” Ben-hadad\nsaid.\nCruxer said, “They estimate five minutes per floor for drafters to break\nthrough. We gotta go down the slaves’ stairs. The exits may be barred, but\nwe can break through. Follow me!”\nBen-hadad grimaced. He clearly thought he could break through each\nlevel in far less than five minutes. But he followed orders.\nThey reached the stairs, and found the doors bolted. Ben-hadad moved\nto the front, locating the mechanism and studying it."

Ben-hadad moved\nto the front, locating the mechanism and studying it.\n“Move,” a voice said behind them. It was Daelos. He was carrying two\nblunderbusses. He handed one to Cruxer as Big Leo returned.\n“Big Leo?” Daelos said, lifting the matchlock.\nBig Leo drafted sub-red to his fingers and touched each slow match,\nlighting it.\n“Daelos, I thought you said you weren’t coming—” Kip started.\nDaelos pointed his blunderbuss at where the hinges would be on the\nother side of the door. He fired.\n“They killed Goss,” he said. “I’m coming.”\nCruxer’s matchlock misfired, and they all waited, tensely, while he\ncleared it. “What are you, rookies?” Cruxer demanded. “Defensive\nperimeter! Teia, get us two more from the barracks.”\nChastened, they did. Kip immediately saw a few curious heads poking\nout of doorways. Not everyone got out of the tower by dawn, not even on\nSun Day. “Get back in your rooms!” Kip shouted. “Look out for the\nLightguard. They just killed our friend.”\nTwo of the three ducked back immediately. But one just kept looking.\nAnd then Kip recognized him. Magister Jens Galden. He was the asshole\nwho’d punched Kip the very day he had first arrived at the Chromeria.\nThe man obviously hadn’t forgotten Kip, either.\n“I know a passage out,” Jens Galden said loudly. “I could save you all.”\nHe smiled unpleasantly.\n“Let’s go!” Big Leo said. He turned to the squad. “Stop shooting the\ndoor, we can go this way. This magister has—”\nSeveral of the squad members started jogging over.\nJens Galden waited until he saw they were coming, then announced,\n“But Kip is with you, and I’d rather you all die.” He slammed his door shut.\nThey heard a bar being slid into place on the other side.\nBig Leo stared in disbelief.\nA young woman poked her head out in the hall to see what was\nhappening.\n“Back in your room!” Big Leo roared.\nThe young woman’s eyes went wide, and she said something, but it was\nlost in the roar of the blunderbuss behind them.\nKip flinched hard, though he should have been expecting it. Cruxer\nwasn’t one to waste time cursing about a plan that didn’t work out.\nCruxer and Ben-hadad and Winsen grabbed and pulled the shattered\ndoor. The central bar was still in place on the opposite side of the door, but\nit was only anchored on one side, and they were able to rip the door open\nand slip through.\nTeia came jogging back up. “Both loaded,” she said. She tossed one\nblunderbuss to Big Leo, and the other to Ferkudi.\nThey all squeezed through the door.\n“I’d rather—” Ferkudi said.\n“Shhhh!” Cruxer said. He’d been holding his hand up for silence.

In some ways, Kip thought, talented rookies were\nstill very much rookies.\nBut they quieted immediately now.\nThen they all heard it. From far below, the sound of many footsteps\ncoming up the stairs toward them. The stairs were not quite three paces\nwide, curling around one of the great lightwells, lit dimly by a few small\nwindows into the lightwell itself. Whatever resistance they encountered\nwould be hidden by the curvature of the stairs until they were right on top\nof it.\nIf the Lightguards were smart and disciplined enough to set up a spear\nwall or a few ranks of musketeers arranged so they could fire a volley into\nthe squad, the squad would die.\nThey all looked at each other.\n“If we can hear them coming up, they’ll hear us coming down,” Ben-\nhadad said. Surprise was impossible.\nA chunk of wood from the door they’d just pushed through shot out into\nthe stairwell as a musket shot rang out. The wood hit Big Leo. He yelped in\nsurprise.\n“Down one,” Cruxer ordered. Better to only face attacks from two\ndirections than from three. Kip emptied himself of green luxin, reinforcing\nthe door. It wouldn’t stop pursuit, but it would slow it.\nHe caught up to the rest of them on the next landing, not running into\nany opposition. The door here was locked, too. Big Leo was patting his\nbody, searching to see if he had a wound from the musket ball.\n“Light’s weak in here, everyone fill up now,” Cruxer said.\nBut even as he said the words, the slaves’ stair dimmed. Kip looked at\none of the windows into the lightwell in time to see it slide shut, plunging\nthem into utter darkness.\n“Oh hell,” Ferkudi said.\n“Winsen?” Cruxer said.\nA yellow luxin light bathed them weakly. “I can keep this light for thirty\nseconds at the most, Captain.”\n“We’ve got to get out of the stairwell,” Big Leo said.\n“The stairs are our only way out,” Kip said. “If we leave the stairs, we\njust give them more time to surround us.”\nOne flight down, someone knocked loudly on the door. The doors had all\nbeen barred, but they were barred on the squad’s side. Kip froze.\nMuffled by the wood and the distance, he heard someone say, “Kip?\nBen-hadad? Adrasteia?” Kip wasn’t certain, but the voice sounded familiar.\n“Nothing to lose by going down one more flight,” Cruxer said.\nThey ran down the steps and took up defensive positions as they\nunbarred and unlocked the door. They threw it open.\nA woman was standing on the other side, alone. At the sight of the\nsquad’s raised weapons, she threw her hands up. “I’m here to help!” she\nsqueaked.\nFor another moment, Kip didn’t recognize her.

She was in her mid-\nthirties and had bad posture, and still wore her green spectacles on a gold\nchain around her neck, but her wiry black hair had been combed out and\noiled glossy, and she was smiling.\n“Magister Kadah?” Kip said, disbelieving.\n“I read their code in the room crystals. Not even a code, really. It’s an\nold maritime mirror signal. They think you’re on one of the upper floors,\nand they’ve got only one squad double-checking that every door to the\nslaves’ stairs is locked. But it’s the only way out. I knew you’d be coming.”\n“Magister Kadah?” Kip repeated. This woman couldn’t be the same one\nwho’d hated and humiliated him.\n“Not a magister, not anymore. I’m doing research now, as I’ve always\nwanted.” She smiled, and looked ten years younger than Kip had ever seen\nher look. “I brought you these. They were all I could find.” She handed him\na bag. It had half a dozen mag torches in it. “Now go. There are people on\nthis floor who would betray you.”\n“Is there no other way out?” Cruxer asked, as Teia grabbed the bag from\nKip and distributed the mag torches.\n“Rumors only. None that I know,” Kadah said.\n“Use ’em,” Cruxer ordered the squad. “Fill up now!” The squad\ninstantly began popping the mag torches.\n“Magis—I mean, Kadah, why? Why are you helping us?” Kip asked.\nShe looked at him curiously. “Kip, you saved my life. I was planning to\nsuicide. I’d even picked the day. And then the White summoned me. I’ve\nspent the last five months trying to figure out how to thank you.”\nKip hadn’t even thought of Magister Kadah since he’d left her class—\nwell, except to think how glad he was that he wasn’t still there.\n“No time!” Cruxer said. “Thank you! But we have to go!”\n“He’s right,” Kadah said. “Go! And Orholam defend you!”\nThey barred the door. The squad had already taken up positions on the\nlanding, each one full to bursting with luxin.\n“Breaker,” Ben-hadad said, “GBBBoDs?” He said it ‘G-bods.’\n“What?” Teia said.\n“Great Big Bouncy Balls of Doom,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Or Green Bouncy Ball of Doom,” Kip said. “It’s less cumbersome than\nBGBBoDs, Big Green Bouncy Balls of Doom,” Kip said, distracted. He\nwas already soaking up green.\nWinsen was using yellow, filling himself so he could throw flashbombs,\nand he held it out so Kip could fill himself with that color, too. Despite\nMistress Phoebe’s best efforts, Kip wasn’t nearly proficient enough at\nmaking solid yellows to draft anything instantaneously in combat, but\npreparing a weapon beforehand was possible.\nKip soaked up some yellow and flung his hand down, drafting, trying to\nmake a yellow sword as he’d practiced a thousand times."

The yellow sword broke apart near the hilt, and, unsealed, it all\nsplashed into light.\nHe cursed. Why had Andross Guile sent men after them now? It was far\ntoo early. Had he betrayed Kip, or had something gone wrong?\nAndross had expended so much effort making this plan that Kip didn’t\nthink he’d try to have him killed. Maybe the Lightguards had jumped early,\nhoping to curry favor with Andross by killing his ‘enemy.’ Or maybe it was\njust another betrayal from the man who specialized in them.\nCruxer offered him a blue mag torch and a green. “Spikes and shield?”\nhe asked.\nBut Kip’s eye was caught by the insignia of the Mighty: a man with\nhands outstretched, power radiating in circular waves from his hands. “I\nhave a better idea.”\nHe drafted green from the mag torch like it was water gushing from a\nwell. “All of you, you’re going to have to run after me as fast as you can.\nPick me up. As in, right now.”\nWhile Ben-hadad and Cruxer each got under a shoulder, Kip drafted a\ndisk under his own feet.\n“Oh no, I need a bit of orange. But those things cost a fort—”\nTeia snapped open an orange mag torch. “Life and death, Breaker.”\nHe didn’t object. He drafted a green platform, then orange lubricant\nbelow that, then green again, starting a curve.\n“Oh! I’ve heard of these!” Ben-hadad said. “The ancients called them\nwater balls? Drafted them out of blue so they could see out. Then they’d go\nout on rivers and lakes—”\n“Footsteps. Above and below!” Big Leo said.\nOne of the squad fired a blunderbuss up the stairs above them. Kip heard\nthe clatter of a man falling to the ground. The other blunderbuss fired.\nCurses and swearing and screams. Kip tried to filter it out, though with the\ngreen roaring in him, he wanted to smash them, shut them up. In moments,\nhe’d drafted the bubble. He sprayed orange around the inside of the bubble\nbefore he finally closed it. He sealed it on the inside, putting the nexus of\nthe knot close to the surface so he would be able to get out.\nHe was inside a vaguely translucent green bubble. His idea was to stand,\nletting his feet slide on the lubricative orange so that he stayed upright. He\ncould tell immediately that it wasn’t going to work.\n“I just realized that I don’t need to be inside the ball,” Kip said. “And\nactually it might be a really bad idea.” But with the bubble closed, the\nsound was muted. They didn’t hear him.\nKip waved to Cruxer, who took it as readiness.\nCruxer and Ben-hadad heaved the ball toward the stairs.\nKip fell immediately. Orange. Slippery."

Slippery.\nHe thought he saw Cruxer try to grab the ball to stop him, but Ben-\nhadad, thinking this was the plan, pushed harder on the Great Green\nBouncy Ball o’ Doomed Kip.\nAnd Kip bounced. The ball rolled down the stairs, slowly at first,\nskipping and bouncing, and then it hit the next landing and sproinged\nairborne. He rolled along the outside curve of the spiraling staircase—and\nflew at face level into a group of ten or twelve Lightguards running up the\nstairs. The ball was six feet wide, and the stairs nine or ten. Kip shouldn’t\nhave blasted into all of them, but he did.\nKip was spun around and right side up for one moment, and he saw the\nsquad following hot behind him, slashing at the scattered, fallen\nLightguards, trying not to stumble over the bodies themselves, but trying to\nkeep the men from following them. And then Kip was knocked off his feet\nagain on the next bounce.\nHe didn’t even see the next group of Lightguards, just felt the shock of\ncollision. And now he had such speed built up that there was no way the\nsquad would be able to keep up. He landed upside down on the next\nbounce, only the curvature of the ball keeping him from breaking his damn\nfool neck. Another collision—this one so hard that it rattled Kip’s teeth—\nsent the ball bouncing back the opposite direction.\nFinding himself flat on his back, Kip squinted through the barely\ntranslucent ball, wondering how many Lightguards he must have killed with\nthat collision.\nNone. He’d caught the edge of the recessed doorway at one of the\nlandings. His ball, now having ricocheted back into the stairs above, was\nrolling slowly back toward the edge of the descending stairs once more.\nThrough the distortion of the green luxin, Kip saw a young face coming\nup the stairs from below. A Lightguard, baffled at a boy in a ball. The ugly\nman had a musket in hand, but he stopped. In a heartbeat, half a dozen more\nLightguards joined him. They, too, stopped, bewildered.\nKip waved to them, friendly. It had worked that one time out on the\nriver.\nBut none of them waved back.\nThen something else occurred to him. He hadn’t made any holes in the\nball. It was getting hard to breathe. He couldn’t hear what they were saying,\nbut it didn’t sound friendly.\nAn officer joined the men. “Shoot it!” he yelled.\nKip heard that.\nThe men raised their muskets. Kip had stopped musket balls with green\nluxin, once. But that had been open luxin, with all the power of insane Will\nbehind it. He was still flat on his back, and the luxin of the ball wasn’t thick\nenough to stop bullets.\nWhy didn’t I make it thick enough to stop bullets?\nThinking was the wrong thing to do. Thinking took time.\nA roar resounded through even the walls of his ball, and Kip saw the\nbriefest flash of Big Leo, running down the stairs faster than you can run"

Big Leo lowered a shoulder and flung his massive mass into\nthe ball.\nThe Ball o’ Kip shot into the Lightguards’ faces amid musket fire.\nSometime in between that collision and the bouncing and the lack of air,\nthe world went red and black and he lost everything.\nSome time later, he regained consciousness with a gasp. Teia was\nstanding over him with a knife in her hand, and he was covered with the\ndust of broken green luxin. It took him a few heaving, deep breaths to\nregain his wits. He’d passed out.\nTeia had cut the seal of the green luxin. The squad were speaking to him,\nbut he had nothing for them. Couldn’t understand.\nThey pulled him to his feet.\n“Where’s Daelos?” Kip asked. Everyone else appeared to be here.\nWherever here was. At the bottom of the slaves’ stairs, maybe? Ben-hadad\nand Ferkudi were reloading the blunderbusses, preparing to breach a door.\n“Broke an ankle jumping over some bodies,” Cruxer said. “We had to\nleave him.”\n“You left him?” Kip demanded.\n“We gave him a Lightguard cloak and tunic. The chirurgeons will help\nhim and he can get away. The Blackguards will help him, Kip,” Cruxer\nsaid. He was defensive. He hated leaving someone behind, too.\nOrholam damn it. We’re children. Even Cruxer.\n“It was the right thing,” Teia said. “Now shut up and let’s go.”\n“Fire in three!” Ben-hadad announced.\nFerkudi fired before any of them could cover their ears.\n“Sorry, I heard fire,” he said.\nBen-hadad fired right behind him, and he winced at the deafening sound.\n“Deserved that,” he said.\n“Reload,” Cruxer said. “Everyone, ready luxin.”\nKip took a step to take a defensive position at the stairs, and almost fell\nagain as his orange-luxin-coated foot shot out from under him. Ugh, he had\norange luxin goop everywhere, even in his hair. Someone handed him the lit\norange mag torch. He drafted a wad of orange luxin into his hand, and then\nused that to suck the open orange luxin off his body and out of his hair.\nMostly.\nHe checked himself quickly.

Provided he had the luxury of\nseeing tomorrow.\n“Main floor,” Ben-hadad said. “Main hall should be that third door on\nthe left.”\n“How do you know that?” Kip asked.\n“I don’t really get lost,” Ben-hadad said. “I was eight years old before I\nrealized a person could.”\n“Where did Ironfist go?” Kip asked. “I mean, he was leaving, too,\nright?”\n“No time,” Cruxer said. “Let’s go.”\nKip followed, but he couldn’t shake the thought. Ironfist was getting out\nof here, too. He hadn’t gone toward the lift.\nSo Ironfist had some other way out.\nBut Kip didn’t know that for sure. Maybe Ironfist had stopped on one of\nthe other floors, grabbing some personal items, and got stuck on the wrong\nside. Maybe he planned to make his escape later. Maybe he’d bluffed his\nway through the Lightguards.\nThey ran through the empty halls, fanned out, weapons drawn. Everyone\nbut Kip was a bloody mess. Big Leo had his left arm in a makeshift sling,\nhalf cloth, half luxin, and the skin was bulging in his forearm. Nasty break,\nbut he didn’t seem to be feeling it yet.\nCruxer’s nose was bloodied, and he had a cut down his forehead,\nseeping blood into his mouth. Ferkudi had drafted what looked like a\nfighting glove around his left hand. Probably had broken some bones\npunching someone. Winsen was grinning broadly. He looked insane. He\nwas carrying a short bow with bodkin arrow nocked. Teia had wiped blood\noff her face, but she was careful to wipe it onto her grays, not on the\nshimmercloak. It was a steely, metallic gray now, not the dull gray of an\ninductee’s cloak. Maybe this was its true color, if it had such a thing. On the\nback of the cloak Kip noticed barely touching circles, one white, one black,\nwith the black over the white a little, like an eclipse of the moon.\n“They know about the cloak,” Teia said. “At least, they know enough. I\ntold them while you were out.”\n“I wouldn’t say we know enough,” Ben-hadad said. “I have got a hell of\na lot of—”\n“We know enough for now,” Cruxer said. “Enough to use her. Teia, take\npoint.” She did. As they moved down the hall, people’s mag torches began\nsputtering out. “Fill up,” Cruxer whispered.\nBut they’d all been drafting long enough that the order was unnecessary.\nEach of them drew in as much luxin as they could before the torches burned\nout.\nAs they reached another door, Teia made the hand motion to Cruxer:\nscout? He nodded permission, and she put her hand to the crack in the\ndouble doors, lowering her head, her eyes flaring wide.\nShe stood there for perhaps a full minute. Then she came back. “Fifteen,"

Semicircle of musketeers around this door. It’s a death trap.”\nKip’s heart dropped, and he could tell that all of them were thinking the\nsame thing. They hadn’t run fast enough. If the Lightguards at the base of\nthe Prism’s Tower knew that they were coming, this wasn’t the only choke\npoint available. The Lightguards could also cut them off at the Lily’s Stem.\nWith enough men and muskets in narrow places, the squad’s skills would be\nbeside the point.\n“I could go green golem,” Kip said. “I’ve done it before. I stopped\nbullets once.”\n“Can you do it reliably?” Ben-hadad asked. “Can you differentiate\nbetween friend and foe when you’re golem?”\n“No,” Kip admitted reluctantly.\n“There’s some other way out,” Ferkudi said. “My parents mentioned it\nonce. I overheard. Some way to get to Cannon Island directly. No boats.”\n“Where?” Cruxer asked.\n“I don’t know,” Ferkudi said. “It’s hidden, that’s all I know.”\n“Well that doesn’t help us, does it?” snapped Big Leo. It looked like the\npain was starting to come through his initial shock from his messily broken\narm. He was rarely irritable.\n“Breaker?” Teia prompted.\n“I know another way out exists,” Kip said. “My father told me that. He\ndidn’t say where it was. But it’d have to be in one of the lower levels if it\ngoes out under the bay?”\n“If we want to go to the lower levels, we’ve still got to cross the great\nhall,” Cruxer said. “The slaves’ stairs don’t go down there. The only access\nis on the other side.”\n“Well, that’s a stupid design,” Ben-hadad said. “Why don’t the slaves’\nstairs go all the way down?”\n“It’s for defense,” Cruxer said, “and as you can see, it’s working.”\n“Breaker, that wasn’t what I meant,” Teia said, giving him a significant\nlook.\n“Huh?” Kip asked.\n“You know,” she said, nodding her head.\n“No. What?”\n“I pulled a thing. You know?”\n“A thing?”\n“Off your—”\n“This is getting intriguing,” Winsen said.\n“Skin, Winsen! Off his skin!”\n“Oh!” Kip said. The cards. She was asking if he’d seen anything in the\ncards that showed an escape route. Given that the cards were of the most\npowerful people in the world, it made sense that any number of them would\nhave known about an escape route. “I don’t… I don’t remember anything\nhelpful.”\nHe hadn’t been having the flashbacks—flash-sidewayses? flash-\ncardwises?—for the last half hour. Not that he missed them. He still had the\nheadache, though it was less acute now. It had seemed the cards had been\ntriggered by words, right?\nEscape, he thought. Tower. Prism’s Tower. Cannon Island. Flee. Run\nAway.\nNothing."

Maybe we can go\naround to the stairs down or to the outside. Now, go! Not you, Breaker. You\nthink.”\nThey ran off in all directions except through the double doors. Kip tried\nto think. He’d absorbed those cards. All those cards. Something should\ncome to him. One of them surely must have known this secret. Any of the\nBlackguards would know, right?\nBut none came to mind. No matter what he thought. He couldn’t just call\nthem up.\nWhat the hell?! What use were the bloody cards if they didn’t come to\nmind when he needed them? Right after he’d come out of the Great Library,\nthe cards had been leaping into his brain so fast he couldn’t stop them.\nThey’d been triggered by every little thing.\nI’m a Guile, I’m supposed to remember everything!\nBut he couldn’t remember any of the cards. Except the one he hadn’t\nlived yet. The White’s card. The puzzle card. Which was perfect. As if Kip\nneeded puzzles now, with every passing second bringing the Lightguard\ncloser. What had she said? ‘Not only Prisms fly’? Right. That was it. But\nwhat the hell did that mean? That she’d known about Gavin’s flying\nmachine, his condor? Karris had flown in the condor, too. Maybe Karris had\nreported it. But even if the White had known about it, so what? Gavin was\nthe only person in the world who knew the proper design of the condor or\ncould draft enough to make it work, and after a full year of work and\npractice, he’d still found it incredibly difficult and dangerous. Someone\ncould give Kip a condor, and it still wouldn’t do him any good.\n‘Not only Prisms fly.’ What could it—\nOh, not fly fly. Fly like flee.\nDumbass! The White knows the secret exit! Of course she does!\nIt’s got to be in her card!\n“Barricaded!” Big Leo shouted as he ran back to them.\n“My way, too!” Teia said.\n“Men coming down the stairs. Fast!” Ferkudi said.\n“All of them are locked,” Cruxer said. “Kip, what you got?”\n“I need light, full-spectrum light!” Kip said.\n“Stairs are no good,” Ferkudi said. “Only way to get natural light is to\nget out.”\n“Surely we’ve got a white mag torch,” Leo said. “That’d work, right?”\n“Teia?”\nShe was already looking in the bag, as if looking would change things.\n“Gone. They’re all gone,” she said.\n“We could go up the stairs one floor and get full light from one of the\nbalconies there,” Big Leo said.\n“There is no way I’m going up the tower,” Cruxer said. “We’re trying to\nget out, and the exits are all down. We go up and we have to fight through\nthe Lightguards twice more.”\nBen-hadad came back at last. He was huffing. “I got, I got, far as the lift."

Out the main gate\nat the Lily’s Stem, there’s, there’s an ambush. Forty, fifty Lightguards.\nMusketeers.”\n“We go up,” Kip said.\nThey looked at him like he was mad. And he was. Even if they got to the\nlift, they’d be exposed to fire from the main hall until they could go up.\n“Breaker. Up?” Cruxer said.\nWinsen drew his arrow and let fly. A man forty paces back stumbled and\nfell as he burst through the door to the slaves’ stairs. Winsen already had\nanother arrow nocked, and released.\n“Let’s go!” Cruxer said.\nWinsen sent four more arrows down the hall in rapid succession while\nthey ran, then reached into his quiver and found no more.\nBen-hadad led them through a small door where he’d knocked a huge\nbureau over to be able to get in. “Not by strength,” he said. “Application of\na lever.”\nThey pushed through tiny, connected rooms, all empty. Past another\nnarrow hall. Ben-hadad pointed. “Leads back to the barricaded door you\ntried, Captain.” Another: “Leads to the kitchens, there’s a door to the\noutside, but it’s a wall this time of day. Problems of a rotating tower,” Ben-\nhadad said. “Designing doors in the island mantle—which doesn’t rotate—\nthat can be used all day long. The designer solved the problem a few years\nlater, but the Prism’s Tower had already had its base constructed by then.\nInefficient, I agree.” Kip knew what he meant—he’d experienced the same\nthing down in the baths—but he could tell no else did. Not that now was the\ntime to ask questions about things that didn’t pertain to their immediate\nsurvival.\nBen-hadad said, “That hall leads to more slaves’ housing and then to a\ndoor off to the side of the ambush. We’d have some surprise. If we want to\ntry our luck?”\n“I say we do it,” Teia said. “I’ll use my little trick and cause a\ndistraction. They’re musketeers. If I can get them to fire a volley wildly,\nthey’ll be vulnerable. They attack me on the opposite side and then, you all\nfall on them from behind.”\n“Twenty men? The seven of us?” Ben-hadad asked. “We’re good, Teia,\nbut I don’t know if we’re that good.”\n“Why are we discussing this?” Winsen said. “We’ve got a command\nstructure.”\n“Do we?” asked Big Leo. “We’re out of the Blackguard, Win. Maybe we\nshould all have a voice.”\n“Enough,” Cruxer said. “Breaker, you sure?”\n“If we have to wait until we’re sure to decide, we’re fucked.”\n“Damn it, Kip!” Teia said. “Now is not the time to be un—”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer corrected.\n“Breaker,” Teia said. “I saw what those things did to you. It might kill"

It has to be near her apartments.”\n“You want us to go all the way up?” Ferkudi asked.\n“I’m telling you, get me light, and—” Kip started.\n“Enough!” Cruxer said. “Enough! Kip, Breaker, we’re with you because\nwe believe in you. Anyone who doesn’t, get the hell out. Make your\nchoice.”\n“I’m with you,” Teia said, but it was softly. It was surrender. To death.\nShe would die to prove her loyalty, but she knew Kip was wrong. Everyone\nelse was in.\n“Was just a question,” Ferkudi muttered.\n“Then let’s go,” Cruxer said. “And, Breaker, next time I ask if you’re\nsure? Lie.”\nKip took a deep breath. They were placing a great deal of faith in his\nintuition. If he was wrong…\nIf he was wrong, they would all die, instead of most or all of them\ndying, which was what would happen if they charged the main hall.\nThey arrived at yet another hall. “This way to the lift,” Ben-hadad said.\nHe pointed down the other direction. “That way goes to a wall that will\nbecome an open door in half an hour. It should rotate open far enough for us\nto slip through in… maybe ten, fifteen minutes. It would put us behind the\nPrism’s Tower, but we’d still have to make it past the Lightguards in the\nyard.”\n“How many of these bastards are there?” Teia asked.\n“Five hundred eighty-two,” Ferkudi said.\nThey looked at him. It had been a rhetorical question.\nFerkudi said, “As of last week, anyway. What? Like I’m the only one\nwho looks at the kitchen manifests?” His voice dripped sarcasm.\n“Holy shit, Ferkudi,” Big Leo said.\n“What? I wanted to know if there would be any Tyrean oranges at the\nSun Day parties.”\nKip didn’t know whether to be more amazed that it had never occurred\nto Ferkudi that the Tyrean orange groves were held by the enemy—along\nwith the rest of Tyrea—or that the big clod had somehow done the\narithmetic to figure out how much food meant exactly five hundred eighty-\ntwo Lightguards, and then had remembered it.\n“Trying to hold a hall against musketeers for fifteen minutes is suicide,”\nCruxer said. “We go up.”\nChapter 94\n“Everyone ready?” Cruxer whispered. They were behind and to the side of\nthe lift, but they would be exposed to the musket fire from the Lightguards\nas they ran to get into it.\n“Maybe the light’s good enough for Breaker to try here?” Teia asked.\n“Teia, are you serious with this?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“Sorry,” she said.\n“We’re ready,” Kip told Cruxer. “Teia, maybe you could… could you"

The face shimmered and disappeared, leaving what looked a hole,\nonly her eyes floating against blackness.\nTeia turned her back and Kip saw the two disks moving across the cloak.\nThe black passed in front of the white disk like an eclipse. White light\nflared briefly around the black disk, and then the entire cloak shimmered\nand Teia disappeared.\nThe entire squad muttered curses.\n“If we get out of this alive, I really want to study that cloak,” Ben-hadad\nsaid.\nThe natural light that usually suffused this chamber was cut off, the\nwindows covered. Clearly, the Lightguards were trying to minimize their\nhandicaps against the Mighty.\nThe Mighty? Is that really what we’re going to call ourselves?\nThe light was weak, but it was full-spectrum. With his spectacles, Kip\ncould draft whatever he wanted. But more choices in a limited time didn’t\nmean you could do everything—it meant that you could do anything, so you\nprobably did nothing, frozen with indecision. How long would it take the\nLightguards following them from the stairs to find their way through all the\nhalls and catch up?\nSo Kip fell back to the old standbys, albeit with far greater proficiency\nand less waste than he would have before all his training with Karris. He\ndrafted the equivalent of a tower shield of green onto his left arm, and drew\nstill more green, weakly, through his green spectacles. It was slow, but it\nwould have to do.\nAnd suddenly, despite the green he was drafting, he was a coward. He\ndidn’t want to move. Didn’t want to be a target to dozens of men with\nmuskets.\nWhat the hell? Green had always made him invincible, had always made\nfear foreign.\nThis is what it is to grow up. It is to live beyond the blind rush of\npassion, or hate, or green luxin, or battle juice. It is to see what must be\ndone, and to do it, without feeling a great desire or a great hatred or a great\nlove. It is to confront fear, naked. No armor of bombast or machismo. Just\nduty, and love for one’s fellows. Not love felt, not the love that compelled\naction without thought, but love chosen deliberately. I am the best person to\ndo this thing, it said, though I may die doing it.\nI will go, it said, with clear eyes and no passion, but it was love, love,\nlove all the same.\nThe drug that was green luxin had no hold on Kip, but he took a deep\nbreath, and ran.\nHe ran, on tiptoe. He ran, without screaming defiance. He ran as silently\nas possible. And running in such a way, he ran without being detected,\nalmost all the way to the lift."

There was white stone\nhere, lit from the mirrors above, and it gave him green sluggishly, even as\nhe lay down and raised the shield, sideways, making an embankment of\ngreen luxin.\nThe rest of the squad was hot on his heels. Winsen threw a yellow\nflashbomb, and it hit right in front of the turning Lightguards. Perfect throw,\nperfect flashbomb. Several of the Lightguards, scared out of their minds,\nclenched fingers on their triggers. The roar of matchlocks in their ears and\nresounding magnified off the stone walls only doubled the confusion of the\nLightguards, who’d only turned in time to be blinded.\nOnly one or two of all of them got shots off even vaguely in the\ndirection of the squad. The whine of ricochets sounded off the far walls.\nCruxer leapt over Kip’s shield and threw the counterweights, ignoring\nthe danger, and was about to throw the release to fling them upward when\nKip cried, “Cruxer, no! Ben!”\nBen-hadad had gone sprawling. He picked himself up immediately, but\nfell again. His knee was red, and when he stepped again, it turned a\ndirection a knee shouldn’t turn.\nFerkudi was up in an instant. He hopped up over Kip’s wide shield and\nran out. Shots rattled into Kip’s shield, and Kip was frozen. The shield\nembankment was open luxin, if he let it go, they’d all be vulnerable. They\ncould all die.\nThis was his part. This, now, in this moment, was the totality of what he\ncould do. If he tried to be a hero, his friends would die. As they might die\nanyway.\nHe shook as the Lightguards recovered and more brought their weapons\nto bear, some aiming at Kip and the others in the lift, and some aiming at\nFerkudi leaping out of the lift and Ben-hadad on the floor.\nA blunderbuss seemed to appear out of midair, to the side of the crescent\nof Lightguards. Hammer slapped down, and sparks and fire and molten\ndeath shot out, raking across the front line. It could only be Teia. Kip’s eyes\nwidened to sub-red in an instant, and the inane thought floated into his\nmind: I couldn’t have widened my eyes that fast six months ago. Progress!\nHe saw Teia flinging the spent blunderbuss into the still-standing\nLightguards. Then she hefted the other blunderbuss that she’d balanced\nagainst her left leg, and shot the second rank of Lightguards.\nOne or two shot vaguely in her direction before she discharged that shot,\nthen she was off, legs briefly visible as her cloak swung free of her legs. But\nnone of the Lightguards saw it. The attack from midair was too surprising,\ntoo disorienting. They almost broke.\nKip saw the moment yawn open.

It fell back to the ground.\nThere were shouts of alarm, pain, injury, weakness, and rage going up\nfrom the Lightguards. Kip stood up, dropping the green shield, as Cruxer\nwrestled to put on more counterweights.\nA man was rushing them. Kip drafted a green spike and stabbed him in\nthe face. The Lightguard fell into him, still alive, still fighting. Kip elbowed\nhim across the nose, and he went down. Saw another man rushing them, a\nblunderbuss in one hand.\nKip shot another green spike but missed as the man slipped on a pool of\nblood.\nThe man slid almost into their feet. He didn’t try to stand; instead, he\ngrabbed for the blunderbuss. At this range, he might take out half the squad.\nWinsen was on him with a knife in an instant.\nThe knife went in and out and in and out of the man’s belly, like a tailor\nrapidly drawing a stitch.\nIn and out and in and out and in and out and in and out, Winsen wasn’t\nstopping, and it was cold and it was hot and it was bloody and wet and slick\nand dirty and gruesome and necessary. The man was still fighting, drawing\nthe end of his blunderbuss down to point at Winsen’s face.\nFerkudi leapt onto the pile and pointed the barrel out toward more\ncharging Lightguards. Winsen yanked the trigger and the blunderbuss fired,\nand the Lightguards were peppered with whatever had been in the barrel,\nbut were too far away to be killed.\nWith his one good hand, Big Leo hauled the man off the pile and threw\nhim off the lift. But another Lightguard was already coming, face bloodied\nbut not stopping. Kip shot a hammerfist of green and blew a shower of teeth\nand blood across himself. The Lightguard fell across the gap, halfway\nbetween being in the lift and not in it as Cruxer threw the lever again.\nThey flew upward, and the Lightguard flew up with them into the lift\nshaft. He screamed as his body blocked the lift’s ascent, pinched between\nthe floor of the lift and the sides of the lift shaft.\nBut he only screamed for a moment, as muscle and bone and mail tore.\nHalf a man was left as they flew skyward, and then as they rammed through\nthe one-way doors at each level, and the body got trapped and scraped off at\neach successive level, less and less. Half, a third, a head and an arm, a\nhelmet with a head in it, and then nothing at all—of what had been a man,\nten seconds ago.\nKip fell backward onto his ass, staring horrified, as a man disappeared\ninto the maw of war.\nThey clanged through level after level.

With how much counterweight\nCruxer had set, they never paused long. Several times, they saw astounded\nguards, who never so much as fired their muskets.\nAnd then the squad hit the top level.\nNone of them had reloaded on the trip up. Inexperience, or trauma, or\nplain horror overwhelming their training. Kip hadn’t drawn in any more\nluxin.\nThere was no Lightguard checkpoint, and the Blackguards recognized\nthem and came running. Cruxer kept his cool, and it was a blessing from\nOrholam himself, because out of the others, only Winsen kept his, too.\nTogether, they pulled everyone off the lift.\n“Lightguards,” Cruxer said to the Blackguards stationed there. “They’re\nafter us. You can’t fight them or you’ll start a war. But please, please, help.”\n“Oh, shit!” Kip said. “Where’s Teia?”\nShe spoke behind him. “I’m right here. Cruxer waited for me to get in\nthe lift.”\nThe Blackguards on duty were baffled. The woman, Nerra, went\nimmediately to Ben-hadad, though, and started examining his leg.\n“What are you talking about?” Little Piper asked. “What’s happening?\nWe’ve seen the wall crystals going crazy, but they aren’t any of our codes,\nand we couldn’t leave our posts. The commander hasn’t answered any of\nour queries.”\n“Commander Ironfist’s been kicked out of the Blackguard,” Kip said. It\noccurred to him that he should lie, that lying would make it easier to get\nthese two on their side.\n“Orholam, Ben-hadad, what have they done to you?” Nerra said. “Who’s\nbehind this?”\n“My grandfather,” Kip said. “He set the Lightguard after us, and he’s the\none who relieved Ironfist of his position.”\n“What? What?!” Little Piper demanded. He wasn’t a tall man, but he\nwas wide, with a shaved head and intense brown eyes under half-halos of\nyellow and orange.\n“The commander agreed to go quietly. He didn’t want to cause war\nbetween the Blackguard and the Lightguard. Said the promachos would\ntake the excuse to eliminate the Blackguard altogether.”\n“To hell with that!” Little Piper said. “I’ll, I’ll—”\n“Shut up,” Nerra said. “We’ll delay them, young ones. What are you\ndoing?”\n“We need to go to the White’s room. Can we?” Kip asked.\nThey could stop them.\nThe two Blackguards looked at each other. Some silent understanding\nwent between them. They were in love, Kip saw, some intuitive part of him\nseeing it from how they understood each other.\n“I’m sure I don’t need to say this, but I need to say this,” Little Piper\nsaid. “The White’s in there still. She’s dead. You won’t disturb her.”\n“Of course,” Cruxer said. “Is Ben-hadad fit to travel? Ben, do you still\nwant to come with us?”"

It felt like a thousand years since dawn.\nHe rummaged through his pack, looking for the card he’d tucked away\nnot half an hour ago. He glanced at the White’s bed, where her corpse lay.\nHe kissed thumb and two fingers and flung a quick blessing at her.\nHe found the card in his breast pocket. It had been preserved between\nplates of glass. Kip had nicely broken those in his tumble down the stairs,\nbut the card was undamaged. He drew it out and, while rapidly switching\nbetween spectacles and sheathing each as he was done with it in order to\ndraw in all seven colors at once, said, “I have no idea how long this will\ntake me. Just… just defend me. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”\n“We’ll hold,” Ferkudi said, and he spoke for them all.\nKip felt, in that moment, an overwhelming love for these people.\nHe wouldn’t fail them.\nHolding the card in his left hand, he drew the colors into his right and\ntouched the five points. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.\n“Got it,” he said.\nHe looked up, wondering if any of them would still be alive, if he had\ndone it in time.\n“Huh?” Ferkudi asked.\nKip was looking down at his left wrist. The tattoo was back, but it was\nalready fading, as if its colors were connected to the colors he drafted. He\nlooked up. “What do you mean, ‘Huh’?”\n“Uh, you didn’t do anything,” Cruxer said.\n“What did you see?” Teia asked.\n“I… I… I can’t remember,” Kip said.\n“What?!” Ben-hadad said. “You mean that was it working? And you\ndon’t remember what it did?”\n“Ben, I love you to death, but shut the hell up,” Cruxer said. “Breaker,\nwhat do we do?”\n“I can’t remember anything—” Kip said.\n“We came up here so you could remember nothing?!” Big Leo\ndemanded. He was kind of an asshole when he was in pain."

He was kind of an asshole when he was in pain.\n“It’s outside of time, Big Leo,” Kip said. “It’s—I can’t remember\nanything right now. But I’ll remember it in the future, I think. Except,\nexcept one thing. We have to go upstairs.”\n“There is no upstairs. Except the roof,” Cruxer said. “Oh. In for a den, in\nfor a danar. Up to the roof!”\nWith Ferkudi and Cruxer helping Ben-hadad, they piled out of the room,\npast the Blackguards, who looked after them, wondering. They went out the\ndoor to the stairs up to the rooftop.\n“Well, at least those Lightguards are gone,” Big Leo said. “Of course,\nthere’s nothing else up here, either.”\n“Big Leo, Winsen, Ferkudi, you guard the door,” Cruxer said. “Kip?\nPlease, please, please tell me you’ve got something.”\n“It’s…” Kip squeezed his eyes shut. There had been something. It was\nabout this space. He could almost taste the memories. He knew, somehow,\nthat he had seen all of the White’s life, every decision, every regret, every\nmaneuver, and yet… he couldn’t grab on to it.\nOh, come on! What’s the point in having powers if they don’t come\nthrough when you need them?\n“Teia,” Kip said. “There’s something here. I’m sure of it.”\n“Something? Like, what? Like the entrance to her secret escape tunnel?”\nTeia asked. “Kip, I don’t think there’s room up here for a tunnel entrance.”\n“Teia, I don’t know!”\n“It was a tunnel,” Ferkudi said, suddenly excited. “That my parents\ntalked about. I mean, it was a tunnel under the sea. Out to Cannon Island.\nTunnel.” He pointed down, as if they weren’t grasping an obvious point.\n“But, but, I don’t think you’d start a tunnel from up here. Maybe in the\nbasement?”\n“Ferk, did you miss the whole convers—You know what? Never mind,”\nKip said.\nTeia was holding a hand up against the sun, trying to shield her eyes as\nshe flared them open to paryl width, blinking from the intensity of the light.\nThere was a shout from inside. It was the Blackguards, but Kip knew\nthey were simply doing their best to give Kip and the Mighty a warning.\n“Does the door lock?” Cruxer asked.\nWinsen shook his head. “Only from the inside. Anyone have arrows?\nShit. Anyone know how to draft arrows?”\nNo one said anything.\nBig Leo, arm still in a brace, leaned his weight against the door. “Please\ntell me they don’t have muskets,” he said. Still in pain from his broken arm,\nbut resigned now.\nResigned to die well. This is what I’ve brought my friends to.\n“Breaker,” Teia said. “Your spectacles. Try them.

They were still a wonder, overlaying\nall the detail of sub-red without making him sacrifice the visible spectrum.\nPossibly the handiwork of Lucidonius himself. But not helpful. He flipped\nthem back into their case and drew the superviolet, again, more helpful than\nnarrowing his eyes to superviolet himself because he could see the spectra\noverlaid simultaneously. He looked around, not knowing what he was\nlooking for.\nThe door rattled and jumped as someone tried to fling it open.\nThey hadn’t expected resistance. They tried again.\n“Ignore that!” Teia said. “What about over here?”\nAt the door, Big Leo crouched down, still keeping his shoulder braced\nagainst the door, but as low as he could.\nTwo shots rang out, and wood splintered at head and shoulder level. If\nLeo hadn’t moved, he would have been dead.\nWinsen pushed a tiny flashbomb through the hole the musket balls had\ntorn.\n“Kip!” Teia said. “I see something!”\nKip looked at the spot she was pointing out. There was something there,\nbarely visible in superviolet. It was the shape of a key. Kip pressed it, hard,\nand it sank.\nText appeared, burning white in the floor at the very edge of the tower. It\nwas in some language Kip didn’t know. “Uh… anyone read this? What is\nit?” Kip asked the squad.\nCruxer glanced over. “That’s archaic Parian. It says, um, it’s a formal\ncase, um, something like ‘Would ye fly, o White?’” Another key appeared,\nlarger.\n“Yes!” Kip said. “That’s it!” There was another key next to the text. He\npushed it down with his whole hand.\nA panel slid back, and a long lever appeared. Kip looked at Teia,\nexcited.\nWood exploded within a breath of Big Leo’s face. Shrapnel tore his\ncheek. “What are you waiting for?” he bellowed.\nKip heaved on the lever. He pulled it all the way back until it touched\nstone. They heard something grate and grind. They all looked around,\nexpecting a hole to appear.\n“Where’s the entrance? You think it’s some kind of chute?” Teia asked.\n“Uh, there’s a whaddaythingit over here,” Ferkudi said, pointing.\nOn the inside of one of the crenellations, a bolt had appeared. Wrapped\naround the eye bolt was woven a steel cable that disappeared into the stones\nat their feet, which were glowing.\n“Don’t stand on it!” Teia said.\n“It… it ratchets, the lever,” Ben-hadad said.\n“What?” Teia asked.\nBut Kip got it. He threw the lever forward and pulled it back again.\n“Not much time left!” Big Leo shouted.\n“Not acceptable!” Cruxer yelled. “Light ’em up!”\nWho yells, ‘Not acceptable’?\nWith each throw of the lever, more steel cable popped out of the ground,\nslowly crossing the entire diameter of the tower. “What is it doing?” Kip"

There’s got to be some kind of chute,\nright?”\nHe heard the sounds of luxin being flung and shouts and musket fire and\nthe wood door disintegrating, but he had time for none of it. His world had\nshrunk to this duty, this place. The steel cable finally popped fully free of\nthe floor and wrapped over what looked like a pulley on a post at the edge\nof the tower.\nKip pulled it again and this time it stopped. He pushed the lever and\npulled back with no resistance. It was finished, whatever it was. “That’s it!”\nhe said. “What do we got?”\n“That’s no chute,” Ferkudi said, looking off the edge.\n“Captain! Can you hold the door without Ferkudi? I need him!” Ben-\nhadad said.\n“Yes! Go!” Cruxer said. He had his spectacles on and was throwing\nluxin through the holes in the door. The door was barely hanging by its\nhinges, splintered and torn by musket balls.\nSuddenly, there was a lull.\n“Ferkudi, carry me over there,” Ben-hadad said.\nFerkudi did it immediately, joining Kip, who was standing at the edge.\nThe steel cable had been freed not just from the top of the tower, but from\nthe sides of it as well, buried under mortar and stone for hundreds of years.\nIt had only been freed from the top ten paces or so of the tower.\n“Orholam have mercy. It’s broken,” Teia said. “Look.”\nThe stones at her feet, directly under the post, had some text in archaic\nParian.\n“What’s it say?” Kip asked. “Anyone? Cruxer’s busy.”\n“Says, ‘The Isle’ or ‘The Island.’ Actually I’m not really sure of the\ndifference between those,” Ferkudi said.\nOf course Ferkudi knew archaic Parian. Of course he did.\nThey looked out to Cannon Island, which was almost a straight shot\nwest out into the sea from here. “There’s a post all the way over there.”\nHe was right. A perfectly matching post had popped up on Cannon\nIsland. It, too, appeared to have steel cable wrapped over it, pointed toward\nthem.\n“What’s the point?” Kip asked. “Is it supposed to be an anchor for\nmagic? Who can draft over that kind of distance?”\n“No, no, no,” Ben-hadad said. “They’re supposed to connect by steel\ncable. But that would require a vast counterweight to take up all the slack\nand keep the cables taut.”\n“Need some help over here!” Cruxer shouted. The battle had resumed.\nCruxer was doing his best to reinforce the door with luxin, but it was a\nlosing battle. The blue just shattered or dissolved when hit with musket\nballs. Big Leo’s red and sub-red weren’t any help at all.\n“I’ll go,” Ferkudi said. He pulled two powder horns out of his pack and\nran over to join them."

Look!” He pointed to the side where another\ncrenellation had popped open to reveal a compartment filled with some\nmachines of pulleys and belts. “You snap one of those onto the cable, and\nride the cable all the way to Cannon Island.”\n“The cable doesn’t go to Cannon Island!” Kip said. “It doesn’t go\nanywhere!”\n“Something’s wrong, then. We have to release the counterweight.”\nThey were interrupted by Cruxer shouting, “We need shot for the\nblunderbuss! Anyone have anything we can use?”\nUsually, you could put nearly anything into a blunderbuss: rocks, nails,\nmusket balls, whatever. But the top of the tower was bare. Any luxin short\nof perfectly crafted solid yellow wouldn’t survive the shot, so that was out.\n“Coins,” Kip said. “Our pay! Can’t spend it dead.”\nThey all looked at him for one moment like he was insane. And then\nthey all tossed their coin sticks to Big Leo, who was sitting on the ground,\nback braced against the door. He popped the danars and quintars off the\ncoin sticks and into the barrel.\nThe top third of the door was gone.\n“They’re about to rush us,” Cruxer said, peeking through a hole. “Hurry,\nplease.”\n“Hurrying!” Big Leo said, stuffing pieces of a torn handkerchief as\nwadding down the barrel.\nKip ran back to the lever and pulled it again. Twisted, pulled, turned,\nand there! It grabbed and he heaved on it.\nHe could feel something give within the tower, and suddenly the steel\ncable was zipping down. He turned his head and saw that the entire\ncrenellation, a huge slab of rock, had broken away from the side of the\ntower and tumbled off. Suspended on another post just feet away from the\nwall, the counterweight plunged downward, pulling the cable taut with\nincredible force.\nKip ran to the island side of the Prism’s Tower to see his handiwork.\nBen-hadad was downcast. “And this,” he said, “is why engineers have to\nthink of everything.”\nThe steel cable had pulled perfectly out of its hidden places along the\nside of the Prism’s Tower, and along the top of the walkway in the air\nbetween the Prism’s Tower, and the sub-red tower and the tiny strip of land\nbefore it came to the water. But then, instead of connecting straight to the\nfar post on Cannon Island far away, the line went straight into the water of\nthe bay.\n“They laid that line along the sea floor hundreds of years ago,” Ben-\nhadad said. “But since then, it’s grown over with coral and Orholam knows\nwhat. The entire sea floor could have shifted. The counterweight isn’t heavy\nenough now.”\nKip looked at the angle of the line.

The drop was too steep. They wouldn’t survive it.\nThey heard the roar of the blunderbuss as Cruxer fired, but couldn’t see\nanything beyond the broken door and the black smoke.\n“We could… maybe draft brakes onto the mechanisms,” Ben-hadad\noffered. “But those of us who are injured… Breaker, there’s no way I can\nmake that swim.”\n“I hate to criticize when we’re on the verge of death and all,” Teia said,\n“but what good does it do us to get to Cannon Island?”\n“It keeps us alive for another half hour?” Kip said. He scowled.\n“They’re withdrawing!” Cruxer shouted.\n“The ship is on the other side of Big Jasper,” Teia said. “You think we\ncan make it down the line, row from there, get to Big Jasper, and run all the\nway to the docks before any of five hundred eighty-two Lightguards can\nintercept us?”\n“It would be less than five hundred eighty-two now,” Ferkudi said.\n“We’ve killed at least—”\n“They’ll catch us easily, and without a choke point like the door here to\nhold them off, we’re dead.”\n“Teia, not helping!” Kip said. “Wait! Teia! You’re a genius!”\n“I am?”\n“Teia, get over here!” Kip said. He was flipping through his spectacles,\none at a time, searching. “Paryl!”\n“They’re coming! They’ve got some kind of shield wall!” Winsen said.\n“What are we looking for, Breaker?” Teia asked.\n“The script, it says, ‘To the Island,’” Kip said. “Why label a destination\nif there’s only one destination?”\n“I could kiss you!” Teia said.\nThey looked at each other, and both looked away.\nWinsen fired a musket. “Got one! But it’s not enough. They’ve got\nreinforcements!”\n“There,” Teia said. She ran over, pushed a second key, and script and\nanother key appeared. Kip pushed it, not worrying about the translation.\nThey were running out of time. Pulled open the compartment and started\nratcheting the lever.\n“Faster!” Cruxer said.\n“No, wait!” Ben-hadad said.\nKip stopped.\nBen-hadad said hurriedly, “This wire goes all the way to the southeast\nside of Big Jasper. It’s got to go right along a bunch of streets that are\npacked with people today! If this cable comes ripping up out of the streets\nwith all this weight behind it, we could kill dozens. You have to give them\ntime to get out of the way.”\n“This is the Lightbringer’s life we’re saving!” Cruxer shouted. “Do it!\nThat’s an order!” He was reloading the blunderbuss as fast as he could.\nKip heaved, and the crenellation-counterweight split off the side of the\nbuilding and fell.

He\nwondered if he’d just killed people. But before he could get to the edge to\nsee, he had to make it past the line of fire of the wheeled shield wall that the\nLightguards were pushing forward. In moments, they would have it all the\nway to the door, and their field of fire would expand to encompass most of\nthe top of the tower.\nFlipping on his red spectacles as he ran to take a position next to Cruxer,\nKip drew red in and in, until he wanted to combust. He threw his hand\nforward and shot red out in a stream, as hard and concentrated as he could\nmanage.\nThe stream splattered over and under and around the wheeled shield\nwall and deep into the hallway.\nThe Lightguards knew what red luxin meant. Five of the men who’d\nbeen pushing the shield wall forward panicked and bolted.\nPanic is contagious, but not all are susceptible. A big man stepped up,\nsmearing some of the pyrejelly off his face. He lifted his matchlock—but\nnever got the shot off. When the burning slow match was brought close, the\nred luxin on his face ignited.\nHe shot the musket into the ceiling and the sound of a ricochet whine\npreceded the sound of rapidly spreading fire. He screamed.\nKip ran past the door and flames and found Ben-hadad fitting the wheel\nmechanisms over the steel cable.\n“The line didn’t kill anyone,” he said. “It came off the top of the city\nwalls. Ingenious. Who’s first?”\n“I’ll go,” Kip said.\n“Breaker’s not going first,” Cruxer said. “Thing may not work. I go first.\nWinsen, you’re second. Give me a ten count. Might need to fight at the\nother end. Then Ferkudi. Then the wounded: Big Leo, you first, then Ben-\nhadad. Then Kip. Teia, you bring up the rear.”\n“Anything special I need to do?” Cruxer asked Ben-hadad.\n“Just hold on,” Ben-hadad said. He snapped the mechanism onto the\nline. Cruxer stepped quickly onto the iron sides of the inverted T and\ngripped the post in his hand. “But I think—”\nCruxer hopped off the side of the Prism’s Tower and flew down the line.\nHe just kept going faster and faster. The first section was nearly a free fall.\nIn ten seconds, he was nearly beyond the sea and over Big Jasper.\n“I was going to say,” Ben-hadad said, “that it would be about ten times\nsafer to sit on the crossbar. Straddle it.”\nWinsen did, sitting right on the edge. “If this racks my stones,” he\nstarted, but he didn’t get to complete the threat, because Big Leo pushed\nhim off.\nFerkudi went next, and then Big Leo, who handed Kip a pistol. “Won’t"

He didn’t want to\nunderstand.\n“There was a hole in the compartment.

They fell and fell—and then swooshed out over the Chromeria’s\nwall, and out over the sea, together.\nShe looked up, stunned. Kip had drafted a simple loop of solid yellow\nluxin over the cable, and doubled the bar they were sitting on. He swapped\nspectacles and drafted a steady stream of orange for lubrication where\nyellow luxin scraped over steel cable. They were emitting a constant stream\nof yellow sparks, but it would hold. It would hold long enough.\nTeia looked at Kip, wide-eyed. Then she squeezed him hard again, but\nthis time with glee. In the perfect light of early morning, they flew over the\nsea and shoreline. They flew over Sapphire Bay. They flew over the\nmorning parades and luxin fireworks. Teia waved to the bewildered crowds,\nand many waved back, laughing.\nWhites fly, too, indeed.\nThe cable passed over the east side of Big Jasper, high over houses and\nwarehouses and ships and the wall.\nTeia looked at Kip, and he looked at her.

And he wanted to know nothing more than this, and he wanted this\nmoment to freeze forever and thought to cease.\nHe kissed her. And she kissed him. And it was infatuation, and it was\nhunger, and it was longing to be loved, and it was an all-consuming fire so\nhot it devoured worry and loneliness and fear and time and being and\nthought itself.

And he knew at last the difference between love and necessity.\nChapter 95\n“This convocation is now in session,” High Luxiat Amazzal said. “None\nmay enter. None may leave.” Karris wondered if, out of all the High\nLuxiats, they’d chosen Amazzal solely for his voice. He had a great\nbooming, deep, powerful voice. Maybe the voice and the beard. He had a\nbraided beard in the Atashian style. It was enormous and perfectly white,\nwoven with white silk thread and pearl beads.\nWith a gravitas that imbued even simple actions with meaning, he held\nup the end of a thick iron chain. Half a dozen young luxiats were holding\ncoils and coils of the stuff. It was a single, long chain. Unhurriedly, he\nwalked to the main doors and wrapped the chain around the handles,\nrattling and clanking. There was some sound there that set off Karris’s\nBlackguard senses. But maybe it was just thinking of Gavin being in such\nchains. Gavin, here. Home again. Gavin, her love, perhaps broken.\nA young assistant brought High Luxiat Amazzal an enormous lock, and\nhe snapped it on. He repeated this at each of the doors, unwinding the chain\nfrom each relieved young luxiat’s arms, walking to each, taking his time,\nand winding the chain securely. By the time he reached the last door, the\nlast assistant was trembling with fatigue. He was sweating, clearly terrified\nhe would shame himself by dropping the chain.\nFinally, they came back up the side aisle, fully encircling the nobles and\ndrafters seated in the audience hall.\nKarris realized she was supposed to be praying. She was off kilter still.\nSeeing her son—her son?—had been more of a shock than she’d thought it\nwould be. He was staring at her, too.\nBut he wasn’t only staring. He was wearing a crown. Her son had been\nmade Prism-elect. Karris hadn’t imagined that Andross Guile would\ndemand that a new Prism-elect be named, not while his own son was Prism.\nThat would have meant a loss of power for his family. Unthinkable. Or at\nleast it should have meant a loss of power for the Guiles. Karris knew\nAndross wouldn’t have given such power to Kip. Andross didn’t hold Kip,\ndidn’t control him. Not yet, though no doubt he was working on that.\nBut this was altogether unforeseen. A failure of intelligence, in both\nsenses of the term.\nAndross had another Guile in play: Zymun. And he’d kept him out of\nsight until the moment came to play him. Karris hadn’t even known that\nAndross knew she had a son. He hadn’t only known it; he’d insinuated\nhimself into Zymun’s life somehow. The only thing worse than having to\nface her abandoned son was to face him after Andross had picked him up"

The only thing worse than having to\nface her abandoned son was to face him after Andross had picked him up\nlike an abandoned toy and taken ownership of him.\nShe couldn’t think about this now. She didn’t even recognize this\nceremony, and somehow she was sitting in the front row.\nDamn, her whole side hurt from that idiotic dive into the water.\nTomorrow she wasn’t going to be able to get out of bed, she was sure of it.\nBut sitting here in front, she couldn’t even try to massage her shoulder.\nIf only Lord Bran Spreading Oak didn’t like her so much. He was old now,\nbut still perfectly genteel. She’d known the Spreading Oaks since she was a\ngirl. Back then they’d had six sons. One had become a Prism, briefly. All\nwere dead now: raiders, fever, the wars. When she was twelve and thirteen\nyears old, Lord Bran had hoped she’d marry his youngest, Gracchos. He’d\nbeen a kind boy, more poet than warrior.\nHe’d died a hero’s death that had accomplished nothing in a battle that\nhadn’t settled anything.\nKarris looked back to Zymun. She couldn’t help it. Was there something\nabout him that drew the eye like iron to lodestone or was it only her? No,\nno. He was very handsome. He was Prism-elect. Everyone was at least\nglancing at him frequently. But only Karris stared with her gut churning.\nShe looked away, to the other Colors sitting on the platform with him.\nDelara Orange looked sober for the first time in months that Karris could\nremember. Karris’s eye was drawn to the two she didn’t know: Caelia\nGreen and Cathán Sub-red. The dwarf Caelia Green of new Tyrea seemed\nlike she could be a natural ally. Gavin would need those in the days to\ncome. Karris should have already made her acquaintance. Cathán Golden\nBriar was the newest Color, stepping into Arys Sub-red’s place after she had\ndied in childbirth. Cathán was a cousin of both Arys Greenveil and Ela\nJorvis, and therefore to Ana Jorvis, whom Gavin had thrown off his\nbalcony, albeit accidentally.\nIf Karris had been looking for someone to look at who would set her\nmind at ease, she was looking in the wrong place. She looked back at\nZymun, and away again. Dear Orholam.\nOne time when she and Gavin had been hunting a sub-red wight, they’d\ncome upon a family that had fought the wight briefly and chased it away.\nThrough dinner, the father had acted strangely, but denied he was hurt. The\nnext morning, he stood up and screamed. He’d taken a flame crystal in the\ngroin. It had unmanned him, and ashamed, he’d hidden the injury. The\nflame crystal had cauterized the wound closed—until infection made the\nskin burst apart when he stood, spurting blood and pus everywhere. He’d\ndied, of course. They wouldn’t have been able to save him even if they’d\nknown.\nLooking at Zymun, she felt like that. Stomach diseased, like a grotesque\npregnancy. Sixteen years of shame and failure had distended her belly, filled\nher with poison."

Sixteen years of shame and failure had distended her belly, filled\nher with poison.\nIs not the one test of a mother how well she cares for her child? Karris\nhad abandoned this boy. She’d not taken him once to her breast. Hadn’t\neven looked at him, as if he were a monster, or worse, as if in looking at\nhim, she would love him.\nAnd now, she was looking at him, and it was too late. Her heart was\ndead.\nSuccess, Karris. Your fears were unfounded. You are colder and harder\nthan you knew.\nBut the ache in her stomach only got worse. She couldn’t look at\nZymun. She needed her head in this, and it wasn’t.\nShe knew it was kind for Lord Spreading Oak to give her his seat, but\nshe wished he hadn’t. She felt exposed up here. People were looking at her\nas if they expected her to do something. They didn’t know about Zymun,\ndid they?\n“Child,” High Luxiat Amazzal repeated. He was looking at Karris.\nNow everyone was looking at Karris.\n“Yes?” she asked.\n“Please come forward.”\nShe blinked, trying to remember what he’d been preaching about. She\nhad no idea. Surely he didn’t know, did he? Was he going to shame her\npublicly? For simply not paying attention? Surely not.\nShe stood and moved forward with all the grace she could muster.\nThe High Luxiat gestured her to stand in a place off to his left, but as\nKarris was walking, she saw a muscle twitch in Andross Guile’s jaw. A\nwave of relief swept over her. She didn’t know what was happening, but if\nAndross was angry about it, she wasn’t about to be shamed. She took her\nspot, and finally, finally started thinking.\n“Ismene Crassos,” the High Luxiat said. A middle-aged noblewoman\nstood from one of the other front seats and walked up to a place beside\nKarris. From the row behind her, her horse-faced cousin Aglaia beamed\nwith pride.\nOne by one, the High Luxiat said the names of those seated in the front\nrow, and each came to stand in line. “Eva Golden Briar. Naftalie Delara.”\nNext would be Jason Jorvis, then Akensis Azmith, and Croesos Ptolos\nlast.\nKarris knew them all. Some from her time as a discipula, others only by\nreputation. All were drafters. Each was from either a prominent family or a\nformerly prominent one. Even she counted as the latter, she supposed. But\nshe shouldn’t be here with these people.\nAnd before the last name was even announced, Karris knew why they\nwere here. She almost gasped aloud, though if she’d been paying attention\nto the ceremony, it would have been obvious. But what was she doing here?\nIf she had been putting together the lists, every seat was acceptable but\nhers. Drafters from the most important families among the satrapies that\nwere still standing, with a special concentration on Ruthgar and Paria."

Drafters from the most important families among the satrapies that\nwere still standing, with a special concentration on Ruthgar and Paria.\nKarris’s seat should have been held by a Malargos, but with Tisis gone, it\nhad reverted to Lord Spreading Oak, who was as weak a blue drafter as one\ncould be and still pass the test. It was why he’d survived into old age—he\nnever drafted. Didn’t see the need.\nThey weren’t here for a sermon.\n“Lords and ladies,” High Luxiat Amazzal said, “I present you with the\ncream of the Seven Satrapies. I present you with your finest, the seven\ncandidates from whom Orholam will choose a new White.”\nThe room broke out into applause, but it was a fierce, competitive\napplause. There were factions here.\nThey were here to select a new White. The pool was selected by the\nHigh Luxiats, but the White was selected by Orholam himself, in a casting\nof lots.\nBut Karris? What—\n‘There isn’t always a grand design,’ the White had said. It was exactly\nthe kind of wordplay she loved. It seemed a denial, but it wasn’t one, was\nit? That there isn’t always a grand design doesn’t mean that there isn’t a\ngrand design this time.\nThe White had been a discipula with Bran Spreading Oak, ages and ages\nago. They were good friends. Bran deserved a seat at the front but could be\noverlooked because he was so old. If he were made the White, he would\nonly last a year or two, surely. Thus he became a nullity in Andross Guile’s\nplan, whatever that plan was. But by Bran’s waiting until the ceremony was\nunder way to vacate his seat and give it to Karris, there was nothing\nAndross Guile could do about it.\nThen, moments later, they’d been locked in here. Not even slaves were\nallowed to come or go.\nThe White had arranged for Karris to be here.\nAll her tutelage was for this. The dozens of minor missions in years past.\nThe possible suicide mission in Tyrea. The slow takeover of the White’s spy\nnetwork. Those tests that Karris had seen as so harsh, so unnecessary, were\nharsh and unnecessary—for any position less than the White. Which meant\nthat the White had wanted Karris to be her successor—no, that thought was\ntoo grandiose, too arrogant, too presumptuous.\nAnd yet here she stood.\nThe White had wanted Karris to be the next White.\nPerhaps Karris wasn’t the White’s only choice, though. Five of the seven\nstanding here might be the White.\nBut as Karris looked around, she was pretty sure that wasn’t the case.\nThat was Andross Guile’s kind of strategy: buy everyone, so whoever wins,\nyou win. The White gambled differently; she put all her money on the long\nodds. Orea Pullawr had wanted Karris to be the next White.\nKarris’s eyes started leaking. She couldn’t stop it.

And\nKarris had never seen it? That didn’t bode well for how good of a White she\nwould be, did it?\nWe all have our blind spots, but pity her whose blind spot is a person.\nKarris had had two—the White, whom she’d underestimated but loved, and\nGavin, whom she’d underestimated and come to love when she stopped\nunderestimating him. It was by Orholam’s grace alone that both of her blind\nspots had been good to her.\nKarris had only one chance in seven to fulfill the White’s wishes. And\nsuddenly, she wanted it with half her heart.\nNo one sane could want to be the White. But Karris could want Andross\nGuile’s puppet not to be the White. If she was the only stumbling block in\nhis way, so be it.\nIf it be your will, Orholam, use me.\nBut how could she do it? Had the White been trusting Orholam to take\nKarris the rest of the way?\nAnd there it was again. A distant sound that made Karris’s ears perk up.\nThe first had been louder, but it had been buried under the rattling of the\nchains. A musket shot. There were multiple shots, muffled by the thick\ndoors and thick stone, coming from another floor, perhaps? Or was she\nhearing the shots through the window? Was someone out on a balcony\nseveral floors down celebrating Sun Day?\nIt was, of course, forbidden to celebrate in such a way, but that didn’t\nstop many people on Big Jasper. It did, however, usually stop people within\nthe Chromeria itself. Karris looked over at the Black, who was seated in the\nsecond row, but Carver Black didn’t appear to have heard the shots, or he\nwas a better pretender than she’d ever guessed.\nAndross on the other hand… Andross was the ultimate in pretense, in\nmisdirection. Karris stared at him, though he shared the dais with her, and\nstaring was obvious. What did she care? It wasn’t like they could take away\nher candidacy because she was socially awkward.\nAnd then she saw it. She didn’t know why this should be the first time.\nShe’d seen Gavin operate a thousand times a thousand—but Gavin had\nalways been a special case. Now she saw power for what it meant to her. To\nher, it meant not just operating outside the social norms—she always had—\nit meant flouting them. It meant staring at a man past the time it was\nacceptable to stare, and instead of feeling awkward, making everyone else\nfeel it. That mastery, that freedom at the expense of others, was\nintoxicating.\nFor one who had always had an affinity for the blue virtues of order and\nharmony and setting a plate exactly according to some point-book written\nby some long-dead prince of the punctilious pompacio, power was a\nrevelation. Power, not for others, but for her.\nAnd the heart of intoxication is toxic.\nAndross Guile looked back at her calmly. He didn’t seem angry.

He had an air of\nexpectation. And an expectation, for Andross Guile, was an expectation of\nvictory. He was patient because he was going to win.\nKarris smiled at him, smiled like she knew the game, like she loved that\nhe thought he was going to win, smiled like she was better than he was. He\nblinked, then, the barest flicker of doubt. She ducked her head demurely and\nsmiled on sweet secrets.\nHe had a plan. Damn. Andross Guile wasn’t a man to leave anything to\nchance. He wasn’t going to take a chance, not even a six-to-one chance.\nEven if he owned all of the other six, he would have a favorite.\nBut how would he cheat? The ceremony must surely be designed to\nmaking cheating impossible.\nBut Andross Guile knew exactly what those safeguards were. Or who.\nKarris looked at the High Luxiat Amazzal. Was he part of it?\n“Orholam, all-mighty Lord of Lords,” he said. “Look upon us. Highest\nLord and Highest God, thee we beseech. Look upon our efforts and bless\nthem with thy light, thy life, thy favor. This day, Orholam, Lord and High\nKing, Emperor of Emperors, Balancer of Scales, Mighty and Just,\nHonorable and Pure, Awesome in Power, Wholesome in Mercy, we seek\nyour will and not our own. We seek this day your White, your light, your\nantidote to night. We, your satrapies, ask your hand to rest lightly on us,\nlightly on obedient hearts that need only prompting, not compulsion, only\nguidance, for it is thy purpose which we seek to serve, and not our own. We\npraise thee, Lord of Luxlords, Light of Nations, Voice in the Stillness,\nGuide to the Blind, and Path of Mercy to the Benighted. See and move, O\nGod.” Each time he said ‘God’ he gave it the traditional moment of\nhesitation, of respect. It was a measure of his piety or simply his experience\nthat he made the traditional seem vibrant, like he himself thought even this\nmeasure of respect was perhaps too little.\n“Candidates,” he said, “come forward. From this time forward, drafting\nis forbidden. Drafting is an imposition of our will upon the world. Any who\ndraft or who accept another’s drafting on their behalf will be disqualified\nand executed as a heretic. Understood? If so, repeat, ‘Under the Un-\ndeceivable Eye of Orholam, I understand and I agree.’”\nThey did so, in unison. Then they followed him to a circle on the floor.\nYoung luxiats carried folding screens out for each of them and set them up\nquickly. Karris’s luxiat was a pimply, blushing young man of no more than\neighteen.\nThe High Luxiat spoke now only for their ears. “The ceremony must be\nunimpeachable.

No strips of cloth in your color. Nothing. Even your\nhair will be covered. In order to assure all that you are obeying these\ninjunctions, you will strip, be searched, and be given identical garments,\nrandomly assigned, all under the eyes of the Blackguards, luxiats, and each\nother. No exceptions. Even a White submits. If you object to these rules,\nyou may remove yourself from consideration now. If you don’t object now,\nand are found violating the rules, you’ll be executed by Orholam’s Glare.\nYou understand?”\nThey did.\n“If you think you see some malfeasance on the part of any other, bring it\nto the attention of the luxiats. A new Blackguard and luxiat will be assigned\nto her or him, and she shall be searched again. Appropriate punishments\nwill follow, by which I mean death for the heretic and the Blackguard who\nallowed the heresy both.”\nHe left, and Karris stripped down. Her blushing luxiat was far more\nembarrassed than she was. Then he saw the bruising. Flopping into the river\nflat on her side had made the left side of her body look like she’d been dead\nand lividity had set in. His mouth moved, but he was obviously forbidden to\nspeak. Karris ignored it. Years with the Blackguard had stripped necessary\nnudity of its shame. Besides, feelings about her body would distract her\nfrom the game Andross was playing, and you couldn’t play Andross and\nhave any hope of victory if you didn’t give it your full attention.\nThe High Luxiat was facing seven Blackguards. Each drew a number\nfrom a bowl and moved to one of the disrobing lords or ladies. Trainer Fisk\n—Watch Captain Fisk now—moved to Karris. He gave her a shrug that\nbarely moved his muscle-bound shoulders. “It was supposed to be women\nto search the women, and men for the men, but with our numbers so low,\nthey said—Orholam’s beard, what happened to your—”\n“Just do it,” Karris said.\nHe did. Not that there was much searching to do. Her hair took the most\ntime, despite that it would be covered. Then he examined both of her hands,\nher eyes, her armpits, her back, her butt crack, the soles of her feet.\nContraband was obviously the first target, but luxin-packing was the\nsecond. Fisk was professional and moved quickly, his face a mask.\nSeven more Blackguards watched the searchers, and the luxiats, making\nsure nothing was passed between any of them. The randomness—assuming\nit was random—of the choice of guards seemed like it would defeat any\nplan Andross might try to orchestrate. Karris watched the others.\nShe saw nothing other than their obvious discomfort. She wondered,\nwould someone being passed a—a what, precisely? A colored lens. A\ndrafter could never go wrong with a lens. It would be small, inconspicuous,\nand allow lethal action.\nBut she saw nothing untoward.\nLuxiats brought out stacks of robes, and at least two Blackguards"

The High Luxiat himself distributed them then, also\nseemingly at random. The robes weren’t even different sizes, meaning\nKarris was swimming in hers while Jason Jorvis could barely close the\nrobe.\nThe High Luxiat came to each of them while they dressed, holding a\nplain wooden bowl. “This is the order you’ll draw,” he said.\n“We draw for the order we draw?” Karris asked, deadpan.\nHe sighed. “Would it shock you that there have been problems about\nprecedence in the past? One goes first, seven goes last.”\nKarris shrugged and drew. Six.\nShe was secretly glad to be going so late. By then, the choices would be\nconstricted.\n“There will be seven stones presented. Listen for Orholam’s voice. He\nwill guide you. You each may bring no more than one stone back. Just to\nwarn you, each has multiple layers of paint on it, and there is no way to tell\nhow deep is the true one. You bring it back and plunge it into the bowl full\nof solvent. Whoever has the White’s stone will be revealed.”\n“What do you mean we bring it back?” Karris asked. “Where are we\ngoing?”\n“That’s it?” Jason Jorvis asked. “No other rules?”\n“You really don’t remember?” Ismene Crassos asked.\n“My family weren’t on the Jaspers last time.”\n“And you didn’t hear the stories?”\n“I’m just trying to get the rules clear,” he said.\nAll Karris could remember from the time Orea Pullawr was selected as\nWhite was a boy named Amestan Niel who’d stayed at a neighboring estate\nfor the summer. She’d barely said two words to him in the whole time. Her\nbest friend, whom Karris had told all about her crush on him, all summer\nlong, had kissed him the night before he left. It had been a devastating\nbetrayal at the time. Last Karris had heard, Amestan Niel was now the third\nlargest exporter of wool in Paria.\nSomewhere in the tower, something rumbled. Something big.\nThey all looked at each other.\n“Was that part of… this?” Karris asked. But from the startled look on the\nHigh Luxiat’s face, she knew it wasn’t.\n“We’ll proceed,” he said.\nThe luxiats carried away the screens, and the candidates were brought to\nstand in a circle.\n“Brace yourselves,” the High Luxiat told the audience. “There is often a\ngreat deal of wind.”\nWind?\nAt some signal Karris didn’t see, all the windows in the room slid down\ninto slots, even as the windows in Gavin’s room one floor above did. There\nwas a cold wind, but there wasn’t much of it after the initial gust. The\nmorning was still and warm.\nThen the floor shifted. Karris instantly dropped her center and stood\nwide in a fighting stance. It was the floor beneath her and the other\ncandidates. Ismene looked at her and grinned as if to say, Isn’t this exciting?\nThe five-pace-wide circle on which they stood rose out of the floor."

They slid out ten,\nthen twenty paces from the side of the tower, and the great windows of the\naudience chamber rattled shut.\nOh. Karris understood. Everyone was to see what happened, but no one\nwas to be able to draft to affect the outcome. The nobles were craning their\nnecks to see more clearly, but Karris’s eyes were suddenly drawn up.\nAtop the Prism’s Tower, one of the massive crenellations had split off\nand fallen several stories. That had been the rumbling sound she’d heard.\nThe huge chunk of stone was dangling, suspended by a woven steel cable.\nKarris had been atop that tower a hundred times. There were no steel cables\nand massive bolts in the crenellations. And the precision of the break made\nit look purposeful. She was trying to see more of it—where did that cable\ngo?—when her platform shuddered again. Seven additional smaller circular\nplatforms unfolded from beneath the larger platform. The seven circles sank\ngeared teeth into the edge of the larger platform and began wheeling slowly\naround them.\nNow, on each of the smaller circles sat a narrow pedestal, and on the\npedestal, in teak and velvet, a white ball. They were identical. After they\ncircled all of them once, they stopped.\nNaftalie Delara had drawn number one. She said, “No point in delaying,\nI suppose.” She looked heavenward. “Orholam guide me. Orholam bless\nmy choice.” She went to one of the pedestals and took the white ball there.\nOut on balconies of each of the seven towers, a Blackguard and a luxiat\nstood as a team, watching each other, watching the other teams, and\nwatching that no one would come out onto their balconies to interfere with\nthe ceremony.\nBut whatever cheat Andross had arranged was doubtless already done.\nHe’d arranged who would pick, and somehow told them beforehand which\nstone was the one. The mechanics of the cheating would never be visible,\nand in picking sixth, her choice would likely be moot anyway—a choice\nbetween two stones of which surely neither was the correct one. Pointless\nand barren, like so many years of her life.\nEva Golden Briar took longer, but settled on one in short order.\nThe White had sacrificed Orholam only knew what to get Karris here,\nand they’d lost.

White, round, small enough to fit\ncomfortably in her palm—for whatever reason, it didn’t feel right.\nNow that was odd. She approached the second, studying it closely, and\nfelt a strong urge to take it in her hand immediately.\nShe crossed her arms. She’d claimed to the White that she wanted\nOrholam to speak to her in a way that was obvious, but here it was, and it\nwas obvious, and she didn’t like it.

It hit the ground and\nplunged through it as if the ground been designed to let it through, and it\nfell into the great underground yard, under vast tension. At the same time,\nthe steel cable unspooled out, away from the tower. It sprang free of the\nwater between Big Jasper and Little Jasper; it tore right out of the top of the\nwalls ringing Big Jasper’s east side and then stood, straining, tight, making\na straight line from the top of the Chromeria almost to the docks.\n‘Would I give you a stone?’ Karris burst out laughing. And then, as she\nturned—everyone was watching the great cable—she saw a flash of green at\nthe corner of her eye. What? She looked at the horizon, but she knew—she\nknew—that the green flash only came at sunset. And then it hit her again.\nShe looked toward Big Jasper.\nThe star towers were spinning their mirrors, lighting up the crowds,\nfestive, playful. One had caught the green tower and reflected it briefly to\nKarris.\nKarris laughed. She shook her head at Orholam—and then watched,\nstunned, as a young man went flying down the cable from the top of the\ntower. She thought she recognized him, but he was moving too fast.\nCruxer?\nShe went back to the stones. Her choice mattered. She knew now.\nOrholam had not led her to a place where her choice was pointless. She\nlooked at each in turn, and again, felt drawn to one and repelled by the\nother. But she didn’t touch either. Instead, she knelt by the pedestal on\nwhich one of them sat. She couldn’t see anything there. She scratched a\nfingernail across it—and the tiniest shell of solid orange luxin cracked and\ndissolved.\nAnd just like that, her feeling of desire to pick up this ball was gone. A\nhex. Magic forbidden with the sentence of death by Orholam’s Glare. But\nthen, interfering with the choice of the White carried the same sentence, so\nthere wasn’t much added deterrent there.\nAndross—if it were Andross—had found an immensely talented orange\ndrafter trained in forbidden arts, and had somehow defeated whatever\nsecurity the luxiats had, and whatever checks were in place to make sure\nhexes were never placed here.\nBut that was a problem for another day.\nKarris walked to the other ball, scratched her fingernail across the hex\nthere, and waggled a finger toward the window beyond which Andross\nGuile sat. Naughty, naughty. She picked up the ball.\nSome sixth sense warned her—maybe the step of a running man beneath\nthe sound of the wind and the musket fire still ringing out from the roof.\nKarris pivoted and dodged as Jason Jorvis closed on her. She was only\nsaved because he went for the ball in her hand rather than simply trying to\nshove her off the tower.\nShe spun with him, using his momentum against him to send him on"

The green in Karris hated to be\nbound. With one hand she whipped her belt rope from its two simple\nanchors at either side of her waist, while with the other she played out\nenough rope that Jason was tipping over the edge, totally dependent on the\nrope for balance.\nShe heard more steps. The backup plan to the backup plan. Of course.\nEveryone inside could see this, but there were no rules. Whoever came back\nwith the correct ball was the White, and there would be no prosecution for\nmurder.\nA fist went right through where Karris’s head had been a moment before.\nAnother punch—but this one she blocked with the white stone itself. As\nAkensis stood frozen with the pain in his shattered fist, Karris tossed the\nstone into the air. With her hand now free, she looped the rope into an open\nknot, and flipped it over Akensis’s hand as he watched the flying stone.\nFeeling the rope drape over his hand, he jerked away from her, pulling the\nknot tight.\nKarris dove, dropping the rope, and rolled to her feet. She caught the\nstone.\nAkensis hadn’t taken up the slack immediately, and so Jason Jorvis fell\nparallel to the platform they were on. But he kept his feet planted on the\nedge. It was an uncommonly smart move. Most people, falling, will panic\nand flail. Keeping his body tight, he gave himself a chance.\nAkensis pulled against the rope to save himself, screaming as the knot\ntightened on his wrist. He grabbed the rope with both hands, and stood\nbalanced precariously.\nFor a moment, Karris thought about bringing them in. They were big\nmen, though, heavy and strong. She was still forbidden to draft; it was the\nonly rule. If she pulled them up, they would work together to kill her. With\nher left side injured, there was no way she could bring them both in. Would\nthe others intervene? And if so, on whose side? How many would die to\nsave these two traitors?\nThere is a time for Orholam’s gentle gaze, and a time for his glare.\nWith a yell that was both dirge for her old life and rage that men would\nbetray Orholam himself and swelling pride that she knew all of her pain and\ntraining and even her waywardness was being redeemed, Karris delivered\nthe slippery side kick that was the pinnacle of Blackguard perfection. With\nsuch a kick, a small woman moving masterfully could launch a man into the\nair. And she did.\nBoth men flew off the platform, and plunged to their deaths.\nEveryone, silent, stared at Karris.\nThe windows opened and the disk slid back into its place inside.

They’ve got a big house they use as a\nbarracks. And they’ve signaled with mirrors that they want you dead. And\neveryone on both islands knows exactly where you landed.”\n“How do they know that?” Ferkudi asked.\n“The big steel cable pointing right to us?” Leo said.\n“Oh. Right.”\n“You know their codes?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“Please tell me that’s all the bad news,” Cruxer said.\n“It is.”\n“And the good?”\n“I don’t like Lightguards.” And then Tremblefist grinned, and somehow,\nKip thought they were going to be all right.\n“Tremblefist, sir,” Cruxer said. “Before we go: we’re not Blackguards\nanymore. We’ve been kicked out, exiled.”\nTremblefist looked at him. “Let’s move,” he said.\nAnd move they did. Kip would have died after about two blocks of this\npace six months ago, much less a year ago. Ben-hadad couldn’t run with his\nknee busted up, so Kip and Big Leo—who was injured himself—carried\nhim. And ran.\nThey ate distance in huge gulps, trading off who was helping carry Ben-\nhadad. They were aided by the fact that most people were already thronging\nto the main streets, so the side streets were free of the usual early morning\ntraffic. But then they came across a knot of four running Lightguards.\nThe squad tore them apart before the Lightguards got off a single shot.\nThen they were at the wall. Two blocks of running along the jagged\nedifice and they came to a small gate, barely big enough for one person to\nget through. The streets were laid out according to the light beams from the\nstar towers, but the walls were laid out to conform to the shape of Big\nJasper. It made for some odd nooks and crannies.\n“Throw fire in the air,” Tremblefist said. “Make noise. We want to draw\nthem here.”\nKip donned his red spectacles and threw luxin skyward and lit it. The\nothers threw other colors into the air, too.\nOn any normal day, it would have drawn a thousand spectators in\nmoments, but today was no normal day. On Sun Day, drafters who\nspecialized in such things came here from all over the Seven Satrapies."

On Sun Day, drafters who\nspecialized in such things came here from all over the Seven Satrapies.\nMost of those, however, were lining the parade route, hitting up the crowds\nfor thrown coins.\nTremblefist produced a key and opened the little gate. “Breaker, put\nslow-burning pyrejelly on the lock. Make it look like we burned through.”\nKip did it.\nWhile he was doing so, Tremblefist said, “Narrow path out there, along\nthe cliff face. Used to go down to the water, but the path fell into the sea\nlong ago. It’s a dead end. Any who go that way won’t be on us.”\nThen, instead of going through the gate, they sprinted once more along\nthe wall. In another few blocks, they found another gate. Tremblefist\nproduced another key. They ducked through, and he locked it behind them.\nAfter a few hundred paces, this path dead-ended, too, and Tremblefist\ntook them through a gate to get back onto the streets. In only a few minutes,\nthey reached the docks and finally had to slow. The area was crowded with\npeople arriving late for Sun Day and hundreds of merchants offloading and\nselling every kind of good imaginable—it would quiet at noon, but not until\nthen. More importantly, it looked like no Lightguards were here.\nBefore they got to the red dock, they saw a luxiat standing, shifting from\nfoot to foot, and Tisis Malargos, beautifully made up and looking like she\nhad been waiting.\n“You made it!” she said. “Was that you?” She pointed to sky cable, and\nKip just grinned.\nBut he felt Teia shrinking back.\nTisis looked at Teia, and then at Kip; she didn’t look pleased. “So,” Tisis\nsaid. “Are we going to do this?”\n“What do we need to do?” Kip asked.\n“Sign three copies of the contract and say the words in front of the\nluxiat. That’s it. He knows he needs to boil it down to the essentials.”\n“Give me the contract,” Ben-hadad said. “One of the copies. Quick!”\n“You’re not seriously going to read it?” she asked. “Now?”\n“Well, no, I’m not. But only because I’m shit at reading. Big Leo, read it\nto me. Over here.”\n“It’s a typical Ruthgari wedding contract,” the luxiat said. But he handed\nover a copy, and Leo began reading it aloud to Ben-hadad.\n“Do we really have time for this?” Winsen asked. He and the others\nwere eyeing the crowd, trying not to look threatening and conspicuous and\nfailing.\n“What’s the saying,” Cruxer asked. “‘Marry in haste, repent at leisure’?”\n“Hmm,” Teia said.\n“Surely this doesn’t count as haste,” Tremblefist said. It was hard to tell\nwhether he was being sarcastic or droll.\n“Look, this is my deal,” Kip said.\n“Deal?” Big Leo asked, breaking off from his low, murmured reading.\n“Was part of that deal Andross trying to kill us all?”"

Aram had to be working against what\nAndross wanted. I think. But he said, “My deal isn’t with Andross.” Which\nwas a lie, but Tisis was standing right here. “My deal’s with the only people\nwho can protect me from him: Tisis and the Malargos family.”\n“Leo, keep reading!” Ben-hadad said.\n“Kip,” Teia said. “Breaker.”\n“Oh, shit,” Tremblefist said.\n“What?” Kip and Cruxer said at the same time, Kip to Teia and Cruxer\nto Tremblefist.\n“You’re really going to do this?” Teia said.\n“This this, or this, getting the hell off the island?” Kip asked.\n“Either. Both.”\n“It’s the signal,” Tremblefist said to Cruxer. “The Lightguards have\ncontrol of the cannon emplacement at the mouth of the harbor. If we try to\nsail out of here, they’re to sink us.”\n“Yes, I am,” Kip told Teia.\nThere was a moment of hurt, and she smoothed it down, but it didn’t\ndisappear. “I’m staying,” she said. “I’ll help you get away, but I’m staying.”\n“Is this because of—” Kip gestured to the cable they’d come down\ntogether.\n“What do we do?” Cruxer asked.\n“What are the parameters of your mission?” Tremblefist asked Cruxer.\nCruxer looked surprised that Tremblefist was giving him command.\n“Save Breaker,” he said quickly. “Nothing else matters.”\n“No, it’s not about that,” Teia said. “You heard… Her. She didn’t release\nme.” She meant the White. She didn’t want to say it, not even in front of the\nsquad. It was that kind of secret. “I have a mission. A purpose that’s bigger\nthan what I want, and a task that only I can do.”\n“What? What task?” Ben-hadad asked, interrupting.\nThey both stared at him.\n“Sorry. By the way, contract’s fine. Bit archaic, ‘enemy of your enemy’\nand the like, but.… Sorry!”\n“Teia, you don’t have to do this,” Kip said.\n“No,” she said. “I don’t have to. But I choose to.” She tugged out the\nnecklace she always wore, a little vial of olive oil. She’d always avoided\nquestions about it. Now she broke the string, dropped the vial, and crushed\nit under her heel.\n“Breaker,” Tremblefist barked.\n“Sir,” Kip said, turning away from luxiats and women and—fuck! Did\neverything always have to happen at once? “Yes, sir?”\nTremblefist locked his gaze. “Thank you.” His mouth twitched a grin.\nThe family resemblance to Ironfist was never more clear. But Tremblefist\nseemed free, his spirit open and joyful.\n“Thank you? For what?” Kip asked."

Maybe.”\nKip turned back toward the luxiat, who’d gone pale. Someone put a pen\nin Kip’s fingers and presented the contracts, braced on a board. Kip signed,\nsigned, signed.\n“We have everything?” Tisis asked.\n“Yes,” the luxiat said. “Hands.”\n“Defensive positions, people!” Cruxer said.\nKip and Tisis presented their hands and the luxiat lifted a pitcher and\nwashed them of metaphorical sin. When he saw that Kip’s hands were\nsmeared with literal blood, he gulped. Kip felt Ferkudi put something on his\nhead and saw that the young man had crafted green luxin crowns for both of\nthem.\n“You are here of your own free will?” the luxiat asked.\n“Yes,” Kip and Tisis said quickly. Kip realized he’d barely even looked\nat her since he’d gotten here.\n“Have either of you promised yourself to anyone else?”\n“No,” Tisis said.\n“No,” Kip said, a heartbeat late.\n“Touch your right hands and entwine your fingers.”\n“Wait!” Ben-hadad said. He waved his hands and almost fell over,\nhaving to hop on his good foot to regain his balance. “A Ruthgari wedding\ncan be considered illegitimate and annulled if there’s no fire. Water, wine,\nand fire to sanctify a marriage. You need them all.”\nThe whole squad started looking around for a torch. How hard could it\nbe to find a torch in the middle of a thousand merchants?\n“Ah, hells,” Kip said. He opened himself to the sun and raised his own\nleft hand, letting power roar through him. Fire gushed out of his hand\nskyward.\nHe must have been a bit tense, because it leapt out much farther than he\nmeant, a pillar of fire ten paces high for a moment, before he tamped it\ndown.\n“Flesh protuberance,” Ferkudi said.\n“Ferkudi!” Cruxer said. “Position! And shut it!”\n“Lightbringer indeed,” Big Leo murmured.\n“On with it!” Kip said. If the Lightguard hadn’t known where exactly to\nfind him before, they certainly would now.\nThe luxiat picked up the cup. He’d apparently dropped it when Kip\npainted the sky with fire. He filled it from a skin with wine. “The wine is\nOrholam’s gift. The shared cup signifies the joys and sorrows of the life you\nwill share.” He guided them to each drink, the cup held awkwardly in their\nclasped right hands. “Even the awkwardness you feel is an emblem of your\nnew—”\n“Just drink and say the oath,” Cruxer said.\n“Kip Guile, Breaker,” Tisis said, needing no prompting from the luxiat,"

My light is yours. With\nmy body, I thee worship.”\nKip blinked for a moment, because he could tell she meant it. “Tisis\nAntonia Malargos,” Oh, Orholam, it was like he was outside of his own\nbody.

My light is yours. With\nmy body, I thee worship.”\nAnd it was done. Kip had bound his will to this. It was finished. He was\nmarried.\nThe luxiat said quickly, “May there never be darkness between you. I\ndeclare you husband and wife.”\n“Go!” Cruxer shouted. “Go, go, go!”\nKip saw Teia squeeze her hood shut, covering all but her glistening eyes,\nthen she turned her back, and the black-and-white disks on her cloak rolled\ntogether, eclipse and darkness.\nKip and Tisis ran the other way. Big Leo had slung Ben-hadad over his\nshoulder and was pounding down the dock already, barely slowed by the\nweight. Kip followed, but it was as if the world had been drained of sound.\nThey sprinted down a dock, and the Lightguards ran after them. Kip poured\nred luxin across the width of the dock in a wide swath, even his pounding\nheart silent in his ears.\nThe Lightguards pulled up short in front of the red luxin, none of them\ndrafters, none of them willing to die. They fired their muskets, splintering\nwood around the running squad. Kip turned and drew his pistol, but saw the\ncrowd of innocents behind the Lightguards. If he missed…\nHe holstered the pistol and ran up the gangplank to the galleass. The\nLightguards had found sheets of wood to throw on top of the red luxin, and\nthey charged across. Finally gathering their courage, or thinking Kip was\ntoo far away to throw more red luxin, the Lightguards ran the rest of the\nway down the dock, rapidly closing the distance to the departing ship.\nKip stood on the stern gallery and shot the pistol at the Lightguards. He\nthrew luxin, the squad shouting at him to get down, calling him insane. One\nword worked its way through: Teia. Kip looked into sub-red and Teia\nmoving among the Lightguards.\nShe attacked no one. Merely bumped an elbow here just as a musketeer\nfired, extinguished a slow match there, tangled men in the lines on the deck\nas they ran about, causing several to fall.\nKip had been throwing death right at her.\nCruxer pulled Kip down and behind cover, berating him for risking\nhimself when there was no longer any reason to do so, but Kip didn’t even\nhear him.

Silent until, suddenly, the entire battery blew up in a\nconcussion that shook the earth and sea.\nExplosion layered on explosion. Cannons and muskets and a falling\nwall. Card after card. But they passed as fast as he saw them.\n“Tremblefist, no,” Kip said.\nAnd oddly, at the sound of his own voice, Kip was back. He could hear\nagain, and his eyes lost the intense, singular, war-blind focus. He saw his\nsquad: Cruxer, and Ferkudi, and Ben-hadad, and Big Leo, and Winsen. Teia\ngone, and in her place Tisis. And he saw himself, madly dealing death to\nenemies he didn’t have to fight at all. And he saw his two faces: child and\nwarrior, man and leader. Kip, who wanted to sit and cry and be taken care\nof; and Breaker, who was responsible for taking care of others. Karris said\nthat to take up the latter didn’t mean to deny that the former existed.\nKip took a deep breath, then he popped his neck to the left and the right,\nand when he turned, he was Breaker.\n“Breaker, my lord, what’re our orders?” Cruxer asked.\n“This ship is going to Rath, but when it lands, we won’t be on it,”\nBreaker said.\n“What?” Tisis asked.\n“Ben-hadad, you’ve been on skimmers and sea chariots.

Elevate him for some\npurpose? I have no idea. Still.” He said it with frustrated admiration, as of\nan adversary who had fought for so long and so well that they were nearly\nfriends.\nIronfist said, “I was there, within steps of that old scorpion. I could\nhave… Did I fail you, uncle? Did I fail my Ulta? After all this time, and\nhow high I rose.” He expelled a great breath.\n“Do you have it?”\n“The White had it hidden just where you said.” Ironfist handed over the\npolished ziricote-wood box, no wider than his hand and only a few thumbs\ndeep. “I found no key.”\n“Your commander’s pin,” Grinwoody said. Ironfist gave it to him, and\nGrinwoody snapped the pin between his fingers. Ironfist flinched, but\nGrinwoody wasn’t done. The halves hadn’t split randomly. He took one half\nand stuck it into the lock. It fit.\nA line around the box glowed briefly.\nGrinwoody said, “Throwing away your life to kill some noble was never\nto be your Ulta. There were… questions about your loyalty. Questions\nyou’ve quite answered now.” He opened the box a crack and exhaled\nreverently, then closed it. “They call us masters of secrecy, and yet in\ndazzling the eye with lying light, the Chromeria is without rival. They say\nyou’re the Blackguard because your skin is black, because your clothes are\nblack, because in wearing no color, you show that your allegiance is to none\nof the Colors. They say you are Blackguards because you surrender your\nown light of reason to serve as a slave, that you are like the black-robed\nluxiats in taking on the humility of colorlessness. They say you serve in the\ndark. They say a hundred things that are all true—all to obscure one, central\ntruth: you are called the Blackguard because you guard the black. The black\nseed crystal. Accessible only with the cooperation of the White and the\ncommander of the Blackguard both. It is the weapon that kills Prisms and\nquenches luxin. This is the tool that will rebuild the Order. This is the pen\nthat rewrites history. This, nephew, was your Ulta. You have succeeded.\nYou’ve done more for the Order of the Broken Eye than anyone in three\ncenturies.”\nWhy then was Ironfist ashamed? Ashamed that Grinwoody hadn’t\ntrusted him. Ashamed that for some few months, he’d thought he didn’t\nhave to choose sides, thought that his two oaths could be fulfilled without\nbetraying either one, that ancient enemies could be made allies as they\nfought a common enemy, that his Ulta might be to kill the Color Prince.

The cheering throngs along the Sun Day\nparade route fell silent, and every eye looked to the horizon, Ironfist’s eyes\nfirst of all.\nIronfist’s bitter regrets and introspection blew away with the last echoes\nof the great blast, and a rippling cloud billowed upward somewhere near the\ndocks, so intensely hot and huge that it folded in on itself like a mushroom\ncap. There was only one place on that side of the island that held enough\nblack powder to make an explosion so huge. He ran.\nWith his height and constant training and knowledge of every back street\non this island, the half league passed in no time. Crowds coming and going\nboth slowed his pace as he reached the narrow peninsula. Promachos\nAndross Guile’s Lightguards were trying to set up a perimeter, and doing a\npredictably bad job of it.\nAs Ironfist approached the line—were those idiots keeping out\nchirurgeons?—he couldn’t help but stare at the dissipating black cloud and\nthe rubble beneath it. The explosion had come from the cannon tower that\nguarded the harbor. The tower’s powder stores were sunk into its bedrock\nbowels so that even an invading navy’s fire couldn’t hit them. Carver Black,\nin charge of the island’s defenses, was meticulous in checking that\nappropriate discipline in storing and working around so much black powder\nwas maintained.\nOf course, with the Lightguards having taken over, those clumsy fools\nmight have begun storing the powder above ground. A dropped lamp, an\niron-nailed boot—if you let discipline slip for a heartbeat, this kind of\naccident could happen.\nBut Ironfist knew in his gut that this was no accident.\nThe Lightguards tried to bar him from the peninsula, but he said, “I’m\nCommander Ironfist, let me pass.”"

He’d been commander so long, it was impossible to think of\nhimself as anything else.\nThey moved immediately. So they hadn’t heard yet.\nThe cannon tower was still standing. Reinforced with iron and Orholam\nonly knew what kinds of luxin, the outer walls were cracked in some places,\nbut otherwise intact. The blast, thus contained, had shot up from the cellar\nthrough each of the five floors, hurling everything out the top, transforming\nthe cannon tower into a cannon aimed at heaven. Everything within had\nbeen flung into the sky: broad paving stones that had made the floors,\nsplintered wood, rags, and, nearer to the tower itself, even the massive\ncannons themselves.\nThe entry door had been blown out into the harbor, and heavy smoke\nroiled out of it still. Civilians and Lightguards alike surrounded the tower,\nlooking for survivors, surveying the damage, counting the dead. Ironfist saw\na corpse, legless, charred, his clothes blown entirely off him. Others bobbed\nin the waters. But of most of the dead, there was almost nothing left. A boot\nhere, a piece of meat unidentifiable there. Blood smears.\nIronfist found a corpse, dead not from the explosion, but of a slash\nthrough the neck. It could have been from flying shrapnel, but the man had\nno burn marks or evidence of injury from the concussion wave. He’d been\nlying here when the explosion happened, already dead.\nThat meant sabotage. Ironfist looked to the horizon. Was there a fleet out\nthere? No. And they’d have had warning if there was. Why this target, then?\nSurely the Color Prince wouldn’t spend lives and treasure blowing up a\ntower for no reason.\nA yell sounded from a knot of Lightguards at the water’s edge. Ironfist\nmade his way over there as they pulled the man from the waves. The man\nwas Parian, tall, hugely muscular, and wearing only dark trousers, his tunic\nlost, his headscarf lost. It was his brother.\nTremblefist. Dear Orholam, no. Ironfist’s heart stopped. It couldn’t—it\ncouldn’t… And yet there was no mistaking that imposing figure, the smaller\ntwin of Ironfist’s own body.\n“He’s alive!” someone shouted.\nIronfist crashed the lines of gawking Lightguards. “Away!” he roared.\n“That’s my brother! Move!”\nAnd then, with no time intervening, he was holding his brother in his\narms. He must have been convincing, because everyone had moved back a\ngood ten paces.\nIt was immediately obvious that something was very wrong.\nTremblefist’s body bore no wounds that Ironfist could see, but when his\neyelids fluttered open, the whites of his eyes were bloodshot almost pure\nred. If he had that kind of damage to his head…\nNo. Ironfist didn’t want to believe what his experience knew.\n“Harrdun,” his brother said, looking up at him."

If he had that kind of damage to his head…\nNo. Ironfist didn’t want to believe what his experience knew.\n“Harrdun,” his brother said, looking up at him.\n“Hanishu.” They had barely spoken each other’s birth names in all the\ndays since they’d taken their Blackguard names, there was so much pride in\nthe latter names, and so much pain in the former.\n“You should have seen me fight,” Hanishu said. “Twenty-seven men. In\nless than a minute. Not a scratch on me. They even used… mmmm. Used\nmuskets. Orholam forgave me, Harrdun. For Aghbalu. His holy breath was\non me in this fight. I made it through the whole tower.”\nIronfist was still trying to recover, the words clanged against each other\nlike a cacophony of pots and pans. “You did this?” he whispered tensely. “I\nthought maybe an attack by the Color—”\n“I saved the Lightbringer. They were going to sink his ship.” He found\nIronfist’s hand and clasped it. “I made it to the cellars. Set the fuse, ran. But\nthey’d locked the door out. So I climbed the entire tower, fighting, jumped\noff the top just as she blew. Landed it. One for the ages. Surfaced, was\nswimming back to shore, and a damn rock fell out of the sky. Had no idea\nthey’d be in the air that long… I’m all busted inside.”\nFrom his eyes, he hadn’t made the jump quite as clearly as he seemed to\nthink. But blows to the head could skew everything. And it didn’t matter,\ndid it?\n“Not long now,” Hanishu said. “Got a question, big brother.”\n“Anything,” Ironfist said.\n“Not for me. For you. Will take a while to answer.”\n“What is it?”\n“Before you left home to come here, you met with some people. You\nmade them an oath.”\n“What people?” But Ironfist knew, and his heart sank again that\nTremblefist knew about that.\n“I didn’t want to come to the Chromeria, you know, after what I did at\nAghbalu. But I came for you. Seeing you swear yourself to the Order, it, it\nwouldn’t leave me. I would have happily killed myself, but I couldn’t go\nwhile you were in danger. Funny thing. Coming here to save you is what\nsaved me. I came so that someday, when your soul was on the line, and you\nhad to decide which oaths to keep, that I would be here for you. I’m not\ngoing to make it, big brother. All that effort, all this time…” And he began\nweeping. “I failed you.”\nAs if the failure were his.\nThere was nothing to say, no way to combat the tears spilling freely\ndown Ironfist’s cheeks.\nTremblefist said, “After the fall of Ru, the others told me how you\nprayed. It had to be the first time you prayed since mother was killed, huh?”\nIronfist nodded tightly.\n“And he answered.”\n“He did.” A miracle cannon shot, five thousand paces, to save friends he\nmight be called on to kill."

One to the\nBearer of Light, and one to the Maker of it. So you have to decide without\nme, brother. Which man are you?”\nIronfist had no answer. He clung for comfort to the brother he should be\ncomforting. Like his life, Tremblefist’s death wasn’t easy.\nEpilogue 2\nGavin woke, facedown, cold, naked, lying on a hard floor. His missing eye\nwas professionally bandaged, but he had new bruises everywhere. He\ncouldn’t remember how he’d gotten here. Wherever here was. He rolled\nover, wincing at the many voices of pain singing like a Sun Day chorus, and\nopened his eye.\nIt was a small room, curving around him in a circle, shaped like a\nflattened ball. There was a hole above for bread to be dropped in, and a hole\nbelow for his waste. He couldn’t see the color, but the winking crystalline\nfacets told him he was in the very blue cell he’d made for his brother.\nIt had been repaired.\nIn the peaceful perfection of the passionless prison, Gavin felt a horror\nand revulsion unlike any he had ever known. Pain stabbed through his\nchest. Tight. Breathless, fighting for little gasps of air. His secrets were out,\nall at once, in front of the last person he loved and the one person he knew\ncould never understand.\nThose repairs meant his father was his captor. If he’d found this cell,\nhe’d found them all. That meant he knew everything: the false victory at\nSundered Rock, Dazen’s imposture of Gavin, and finally his murder of\nAndross Guile’s eldest and favorite son in the yellow cell.\nIt meant Andross planned to make him pay for it.\nStripped bare of clothes, and titles, and privileges, and power, and\nvision, and freedom, and stripped now of even his false name, Dazen stared\nat the grim reflection in the shining wall. It looked like a dead man.\nAcknowledgments\nThe problem with standards is living up to them. Acknowledgments are\nusually as tedious but necessary as a EULA. Where can I scroll and hit\nAccept already? Then you hit Accept, and it forces you to perjure yourself\nby averring that YES, I DID READ all that tiny print that I just didn’t read.\nWhat, you don’t believe my 12,000-words-per-minute pace?

Ratweed is sometimes\nused as a wrapping to hold the loose tobacco to allow use of both\nsubstances at once.\nAppendix\nOn Monochromes, Bichromes, and Polychromes\nMost drafters are monochromes: they are able to draft only one color.\nDrafters who can draft two colors well enough to create stable luxin in both\ncolors are called bichromes. Anyone who can draft solid luxin in three or\nmore colors is called a polychrome. The more colors a polychrome can\ndraft, the more powerful she is and the more sought after are her services. A\nfull-spectrum polychrome is a polychrome who can draft every color in the\nspectrum. A Prism is always a full-spectrum polychrome.\nMerely being able to draft a color, though, isn’t the sole determining\ncriterion in how valuable or skilled a drafter is. Some drafters are faster at\ndrafting, some are more efficient, some have more will than others, some\nare better at crafting luxin that will be durable, some are smarter or more\ncreative at how and when to apply luxin.\nOn Disjunctive Bichromes/Polychromes\nOn the light continuum, sub-red borders red, red borders orange, orange\nborders yellow, yellow borders green, green borders blue, blue borders\nsuperviolet. Most bichromes and polychromes simply draft a larger\nspectrum on the continuum than monochromes. That is, a bichrome is most\nlikely to draft two colors that are adjacent to each other (blue and\nsuperviolet, red and sub-red, yellow and green, etc.). However, some few\ndrafters are disjunctive bichromes. As could be surmised from the name,\nthese are drafters whose colors do not border each other. Usef Tep was a\nfamous example: he drafted red and blue. Karris White Oak is another,\ndrafting green and red. It is unknown how or why disjunctive bichromes\ncome to exist. It is only known that they are rare.\nOn Outer-Spectrum Colors\nThere is a small and controversial movement claiming that there are more\nthan seven colors. Indeed, because colors exist on a continuum, one could\nargue that the number of colors is infinite. However, the argument that there\nare more than seven draftable colors is more theologically problematic for\nsome. It is commonly accepted that there are other resonance points beyond\nthe seven currently accepted ones, but those points are weaker and much\nmore rarely drafted than the core seven. Among the contenders is one color\nfar below the sub-red, called paryl. Another equally far above superviolet is\ncalled only chi.\nBut if colors are to be so broadly defined as to include colors only one\ndrafter in a million can draft, then shouldn’t yellow be split into liquid\nyellow and solid yellow? Where do the (mythical) black and white luxins\nfit? How could such (non)colors even fit on the spectrum?\nThe arguments, though bitter, are academic.\nOn Subchromacy and Superchromacy"

        "text": "fit? How could such (non)colors even fit on the spectrum?\nThe arguments, though bitter, are academic.\nOn Subchromacy and Superchromacy\nA subchromat is one who has trouble differentiating between at least two\ncolors, colloquially referred to as being color-blind. Subchromacy need not\ndoom a drafter. For instance, a blue drafter who cannot distinguish between\nred and green will not be significantly handicapped in his work.\nSuperchromacy is having greater than usual ability to distinguish\nbetween fine variations of color. Superchromacy in any color will result in\nmore stable drafting, but is most helpful in drafting yellow. Only\nsuperchromat yellow drafters can hope to draft solid yellow luxin.\nOn Luxin (with sections on physics, metaphysics, effects on personality,\nlegendary colors, and colloquial terms)\nThe basis of magic is light. Those who use magic are called drafters. A\ndrafter is able to transform a color of light into a physical substance. Each\ncolor has its own properties, but the uses of those building blocks are as\nboundless as a drafter’s imagination and skill.\nThe magic in the Seven Satrapies functions roughly the opposite of a\ncandle burning. When a candle burns, a physical substance (wax) is\ntransformed into light. With chromaturgy, light is transformed into a\nphysical substance, luxin. Each color of luxin has its own properties. If\ndrafted correctly (within a tight allowance), the resulting luxin will be\nstable, lasting for days or even years, depending on its color.\nMost drafters (magic-users) can only use one color. A drafter must be\nexposed to the light of her color to be able to draft it (that is, a green drafter\ncan look at grass and be able to draft, but if she’s in a white-walled room,\nshe can’t). Each drafter usually carries spectacles so that if her color isn’t\navailable, she can still use magic.\nP\nHYSICS\nLuxin has weight. If a drafter drafts a luxin haycart over her head, the first\nthing it will do is crush her. From heaviest to lightest are: red, orange,\nyellow, green, blue, sub-red,* superviolet, sub-red.* For reference, liquid\nyellow luxin is only slightly lighter than the same volume of water.\n(*Sub-red is difficult to weigh accurately because it rapidly degenerates\nto fire when exposed to air. The ordering above was achieved by putting\nsub-red luxin in an airtight container and then weighing the result, minus\nthe weight of the container. In real-world uses, sub-red crystals are often\nseen floating upward in the air before igniting.)\nLuxin has tactility.\nSub-red: Again the hardest to describe due to its flammability, but often\ndescribed as feeling like a hot wind.\nRed: Gooey, sticky, clingy, depending on drafting; can be tarry and thick\nor more gel-like.\nOrange: Lubricative, slippery, soapy, oily.\nYellow: In its liquid, more common state, like bubbly, effervescent\nwater, cool to the touch, possibly a little thicker than seawater. In its\nsolid state, it is perfectly slick, unyielding, smooth, and incredibly\nhard.\nGreen: Rough: depending on the skill and purposes of the drafter,"

It is flexible, springy, often drawing comparisons to the green\nlimbs of living trees.\nBlue: Smooth, though poorly drafted blue will have a texture or can\nshed fragments easily, like chalk, but in crystals.\nSuperviolet: Like spidersilk, thin and light to the point of\nimperceptibility.\nLuxin has scent. The base scent of luxin is resinous. The smells below are\napproximate, because each color of luxin smells like itself. Imagine trying\nto describe the smell of an orange. You’d say citrus and sharp, but that isn’t\nit exactly. An orange smells like an orange. However, the below\napproximations are close.\nSub-red: Charcoal, smoke, burned.\nRed: Tea leaves, tobacco, dry.\nOrange: Almond.\nYellow: Eucalyptus and mint.\nGreen: Fresh cedar, resin.\nBlue: Mineral, chalk, almost none.\nSuperviolet: Faintly like cloves.\n*Black: No smell/or smell of decaying flesh.\n*White: Honey, lilac.\n(*Mythical; these are the smells as reported in stories.)\nM\nETAPHYSICS\nAny drafting feels good to the drafter. Sensations of euphoria and\ninvincibility are particularly strong among young drafters and those drafting\nfor the first time. Generally, these pass with time, though drafters abstaining\nfrom magic for a time will often feel them again. For most drafters, the\neffect is similar to drinking a cup of kopi. Some drafters, strangely enough,\nseem to have allergic reactions to drafting. There are vigorous ongoing\ndebates about whether the effects on personality should be described as\nmetaphysical or physical.\nRegardless of their correct categorization and whether they are the\nproper realm of study for the magister or the luxiat, the effects themselves\nare unquestioned.\nL E P\nUXIN’S FFECTS ON ERSONALITY\nThe benighted before Lucidonius believed that passionate men became\nreds, or that calculating women became yellows or blues. In truth, the\ncausation flows the other way.\nEvery drafter, like every woman, has her own innate personality. The\ncolor she drafts then influences her toward the behaviors below. A person\nwho is impulsive who drafts red for years is going to be more likely to be\npushed farther into “red” characteristics than a naturally cold and orderly\nperson who drafts red for the same length of time.\nThe color a drafter uses will affect her personality over time. This,\nhowever, doesn’t make her a prisoner of her color, or irresponsible for her\nactions under the influence of it. A green who continually cheats on his wife\nis still a lothario. A sub-red who murders an enemy in a fit of rage is still a\nmurderer. Of course, a naturally angry woman who is also a red drafter will\nbe even more susceptible to that color’s effects, but there are many tales of\ncalculating reds and fiery, intemperate blues.\nA color isn’t a substitute for a woman.

That said, generalities can be useful: a group of green drafters\nis more likely to be wild and rowdy than a group of blues.\nGiven these generalities, there is also a virtue and a vice commonly\nassociated with each color. (Virtue being understood by the early luxiats not\nas being free of temptation to do evil in a particular way, but as conquering\none’s own predilection toward that kind of evil. Thus, gluttony is paired\nwith temperance, greed with charity, etc.)\nSub-red drafters: Sub-reds are passionate in all ways, the most purely\nemotional of all drafters, the quickest to rage or to cry. Sub-reds love\nmusic, are often impulsive, fear the dark less than any other color,\nand are often insomniacs. Emotional, distractable, unpredictable,\ninconsistent, loving, bighearted. Sub-red men are often sterile.\nAssociated vice: Wrath\nAssociated virtue: Patience\nRed drafters: Reds are quick-tempered, lusty, and love destruction. They\nare also warm, inspiring, brash, larger than life, expansive, jovial,\nand powerful.\nAssociated vice: Gluttony\nAssociated virtue: Temperance\nOrange drafters: Oranges are often artists, brilliant in understanding\nother people’s emotions and motivations. Some use this to defy or\nexceed expectations.

Cheerful, wise, bright, balanced,\nwatchful, impassive, observant, brutally honest at times, excellent\nliars.

They don’t so much disrespect authority as not even\nrecognize it.\nAssociated vice: Lust\nAssociated virtue: Self-control\nBlue drafters: Blues are orderly, inquisitive, rational, calm, cold,\nimpartial, intelligent, musical. Structure, rules, and hierarchy are\nimportant to them. Blues are often mathematicians and composers.\nIdeas and ideology and correctness often matter more than people to\nblues.\nAssociated vice: Envy\nAssociated virtue: Kindness\nSuperviolet drafters: Superviolets tend to have a removed outlook;\ndispassionate, they appreciate irony and sarcasm and word games\nand are often cold, viewing people as puzzles to be solved or ciphers\nto be cracked.

Its main claimed use is\nnearly identical to paryl—seeing through things, though those who\nbelieve in chi say its powers far surpass paryl’s in this regard, cutting\nthrough flesh and bone and even metal. The only thing the tales seem\nto agree on is that chi drafters have the shortest life expectancy of\nany drafters: five to fifteen years, almost without exception. If chi\nindeed exists, it would mostly be evidence that Orholam created light\nfor the universe or for his own purposes, and not solely for the use of\nman, and would move theologians from their current\nanthropocentrism.\nBlack: Destruction, void, emptiness, that which is not and cannot be\nfilled. Obsidian is said to be the bones of black luxin after it dies.\nParyl: Also called spidersilk, it is invisible to all but paryl drafters. It\nresides as far down the spectrum from sub-red as most sub-red does\nfrom the visible spectrum. Believed mythical because the lens of the\nhuman eye cannot contort to a shape that would allow seeing such a\ncolor. The alleged color of dark drafters and night weavers and\nassassins because this spectrum is (again, allegedly) available even at\nnight. Uses unknown, but linked to murders.

Descriptions of an earthly form of the\nstuff (as diminished from the original as obsidian supposedly is from\nblack luxin) describe it as radiant ivory, or pure white opal, emitting\nlight on the whole spectrum.\nC T\nOLLOQUIAL ERMS\nStudents at the Chromeria are encouraged to use the proper names for each\ncolor, but the impetus to name seems unstoppable. In some cases, the names\nare used technically: pyrejelly is a thicker, longer-burning draft of red that\nwill burn long enough to reduce a body to ash. In other cases, the reference\nbecomes precisely the opposite of the technical definition: brightwater was\nfirst a name for liquid yellow luxin, but Brightwater Wall is solid yellow\nluxin.\nA few of the more common colloquialisms:\nSub-red: Firecrystal\nRed: Pyrejelly, burnglue\nOrange: Noranjell\nYellow: Brightwater\nGreen: Godswood\nBlue: Frostglass, glass\nSuperviolet: Skystring, soulstring, spidersilk\nBlack: Hellstone, nullstone, nightfiber, cinderstone, hadon\nWhite: Truebright, starsblood, anachrome, luciton\nOn the Old Gods\nSub-red: Anat, goddess of wrath. Those who worshipped her are said to\nhave had rituals that involved infant sacrifice. Also known as the\nLady of the Desert, the Fiery Mistress. Her centers of worship were\nTyrea, southernmost Paria, and southern Ilyta.\nRed: Dagnu, god of gluttony. He was worshipped in eastern Atash.\nOrange: Molokh, god of greed.

His center of worship was in\nsouthern Paria and northern Ilyta.\nOn Technology and Weapons\nThe Seven Satrapies are in a time of great leaps in understanding. The peace\nsince the Prisms’ War and the following suppression of piracy has allowed\nthe flow of goods and ideas freely through the satrapies. Cheap, high-\nquality iron and steel are available in every satrapy, leading to high-quality\nweapons, durable wagon wheels, and everything in between. Though\ntraditional forms of weapons like Atashian bich’hwa or Parian parry-sticks\ncontinue, now they are rarely made of horn or hardened wood. Luxin is\noften used for improvised weapons, but most luxins’ tendency to break\ndown after long exposure to light, and the scarcity of yellow drafters who\ncan make solid yellows (which don’t break down in light), means that metal\nweapons predominate among mundane armies.\nThe greatest leaps are occurring in the improvement of firearms. In most\ncases, each musket is the product of a different smith. This means each man\nmust be able to fix his own firearm, and that pieces must be crafted\nindividually. A faulty hammer or flashpan can’t be swapped out for a new\none, but must be detached and reworked into appropriate shape. Some\nlarge-scale productions with hundreds of apprentice smiths have tried to\ntackle this problem in Rath by making parts as nearly identical as possible,\nbut the resulting matchlocks tend to be low quality, trading accuracy and\ndurability for consistency and simple repair. Elsewhere, the smiths of Ilyta\nhave gone the other direction, making the highest-quality custom muskets\nin the world. Recently, they’ve pioneered a form they call the flintlock.\nInstead of affixing a burning slow match to ignite powder in the flashpan\nand thence into the breech of the rifle, they’ve affixed a flint that scrapes a\nfrizzen to throw sparks directly into the breech. This approach means a\nmusket or pistol is always ready to fire, without a soldier having to first\nlight a slow match. Keeping it from widespread adoption is the high rate of\nmisfires—if the flint doesn’t scrape the frizzen correctly or throw sparks\nperfectly, the firearm doesn’t fire.\nThus far, the combination of luxin with firearms has been largely\nunsuccessful. The casting of perfectly round yellow luxin musket balls was\npossible, but the small number of yellow drafters able to make solid yellow\ncreates a bottleneck in production. Blue luxin musket balls often shatter\nfrom the force of the black powder explosion. An exploding shell made by\nfilling a yellow luxin ball with red luxin (which would ignite explosively\nfrom the shattering yellow when the ball hit a target) was demonstrated to\nthe Nuqaba, but the exact balance of making the yellow thick enough to not\nexplode inside the musket, but thin enough to shatter when it hit its target, is\nso difficult that several smiths have died trying to replicate it, probably"

Rope spooled out from\ncareful fingers toward the pretty woman quietly working at the desk below.\nThe woman was perhaps thirty, wearing a slave’s dress, her copper hair\npulled back in a simple ponytail. As Teia watched, the woman folded a\npiece of luxin-imbued flash paper that all her spies used. She paused and\ntook a sip of an expensive whisky.\nThe woman was Prism Gavin Guile’s room slave. She was the White’s\nhidden spymistress. She was Teia’s former superior and her mentor.\nMarissia put down her whisky and as she sealed the note, she said,\n“Orholam forgive me.”\nDon’t look up. Please don’t look up.\nTeia was wearing the shimmercloak that she’d stolen, but clinging to the\nironwork on the ceiling like this, it didn’t conceal all of her body, and it\ndidn’t hide the dangling noose at all.\nBut Marissia didn’t look up. She put the note aside, and pulled out\nanother sheet of thin paper.\nAs her mentor leaned forward, Teia dexterously flipped the noose over\nMarissia’s head and then dropped from the ceiling, holding the rope.\nDraped over a beam above, the noose jerked tight around Marissia’s throat\nand hauled her to her feet. The sharp movement flung her chair backward\njust as Teia, the counterweight, swung down and forward. The falling chair\ncracked across Teia’s shins a moment before she crashed into Marissia.\nSomehow, Teia kept herself from releasing the rope, and she didn’t cry\nout. Marissia was choking, grabbing at her neck, scrambling to get her feet\nunder her.\nAmazing how pain shuts down your thoughts. If Teia hadn’t just gotten\nher shins destroyed, there were a dozen things she would have done.\nInstead, she clung stupidly to the rope, gasping, tears springing from her\neyes, face-to-face with her old superior.\nAs Marissia regained her feet, Teia saw the problem with Master Sharp’s\nplan: Teia wasn’t as heavy as Marissia. Marissia noticed it, too. Though\ngagging, she grabbed the rope above her head and pulled down with all of\nher strength.\nSomething shimmered in the corner of Teia’s eye, and Murder Sharp"

He buried a fist in\nMarissia’s stomach.\nMarissia’s strangled cough blew spit across Teia’s face. The slave\nwoman went slack. In quick motions, Sharp took the noose from Teia,\nthrew a sack over Marissia’s head, and bound her’s hands behind her back\nwith the same rope in such a way that any move she made to escape would\ntighten the noose around her neck.\nMaster Sharp was gifted with knots.\nHe forced Marissia to her knees and checked once more that she could\nbreathe—all the fight had gone out of her.\n“Not good,” Master Sharp said, turning back to Teia. “Not very good at\nall.” He was a lean man with sharp features, orangey-red hair, and a short\nbeard the color of fire. His most remarkable feature, though, were his teeth\nand his too-big, too-frequent smile, which he flashed now joylessly, by\nmere habit. Usually, the teeth he revealed with that smile were too-white\nand too-perfect, but today, he wore dentures of beaver’s incisors, a full\ndisconcerting mouth of big, wide, flat incisors. He’d whittled them down\njust enough to fit in his mouth.\n“But you kept her from destroying any of the papers,” he continued, “so\nI’ll accept it.”\n“You were here the whole time?” Teia asked. She set the chair upright\nand massaged her aching shins. Orholam have mercy, those damned teeth\nmade her skin crawl.\n“This is too important for me to let you bungle it. She was some kind of\nsecretary for the Prism. Who knows what information she has access to?”\nSo the Order didn’t know who and what Marissia really was. Why then\nwere they kidnapping her?\nAnd why kidnapping? Teia had thought that the Order only killed\npeople. When they’d given her this assignment, she’d thought she was\ngoing to have to murder someone.\nNot that they wouldn’t murder Marissia afterward.\nHanding Teia the noose, Murder Sharp strode to the window to look\ndown at the islands. Even from where she was, Teia could see a thick curl\nof black smoke rising to greet the morning sun.\nEarlier this morning, the squad’s trainer and friend Tremblefist had\nblown the black powder stores beneath the cannon tower so Kip and the rest\nof his squad, the Mighty, could escape by sea. He’d probably given his life\ndoing it.\nThe squad had gotten away, though, while Teia had chosen to stay here.\nAnd now she was doing this. She was a fool.\n“We’re lucky,” Sharp said. “The few Blackguards who weren’t already\non the parade route have abandoned their posts to get down to that tower.\nStill, no time to waste. You watch her close. Break her neck if she screams.”\nHe shook his head at that last part. He’d said that for Marissia’s benefit.\nHe made a fist and mimed hitting her stomach. Knock the wind out of her if\nshe screams, he meant."

Sometimes he had deeper\nplans. Sometimes he didn’t think of the obvious. But he never liked being\nquestioned. And there was no upside in Teia appearing too smart.\nSharp scooped all the papers off the table and into a sack.

She wanted to say\nsomething.\nWhat was Teia going to tell her? She hadn’t known Marissia outside of\ntheir work, but she’d felt a kinship and deep respect for the woman. They\nhad both been slaves. Both were spies, and Marissia had risen as high as\nany slave or spy could. Marissia had been the one who told Teia that the\nOrder would make her do something terrible. “Let it be on my head—but\ndo it,” she’d said.\nBut there was no way she could have guessed that the something terrible\nwould involve herself.\nAnother tug. Master Sharp had ducked into the slave’s closet off the\nmain room, out of sight and earshot. “He’s gone. Only for a moment,” Teia\nwhispered.\n“Third drawer, left side,” Marissia whispered. “Halfway back, straight\nup. Push hard. Quick!”\nMaster Sharp had left the drawer open, so Teia only had to take one step\nand stoop. The surface felt flat, but as Teia pushed hard on the surface, she\nfelt something snap with a slight chalky scent of broken blue luxin, and a\ntiny section of the wood sank in. A folded piece of parchment dropped into\nher hand.\nTeia stepped back into place, stashing the parchment in a pocket. “Got\nit,” she whispered.\n“Tug when you need me—”\nMaster Sharp stepped back in. “What’s she saying?”\n“Um? What?” Teia said. For one terrifying moment, her mind went\nblank. “Oh, she’s trying to bribe me.” Teia said it like she was bored.\nStaring at her hard, Master Sharp ran a freakishly long pink tongue over\nthose horrid wide teeth. “I took a bribe…” He smacked his lips. “Once. Had\nno plan to let the man go of course, and killed him as soon as I got the\ncoin.” Sharp tucked a package of documents tied with red ribbon into his\nsack—or maybe it was green ribbon. Teia was colorblind, so she could only\ntell it was one or the other. “No harm, right? The Old Man… disagreed.\nEmphatically.”\nHe smiled, too broadly.

Something about those teeth twisted Teia’s\nstomach more than when he’d worn a full set of wolves’ fangs.\n“How much did she offer?” he asked.\nTeia froze. There was a hook in that question. Marissia the Prism’s room\nslave might have squirreled away a small fortune. Marissia the spy would\nhave saved a lot more, and with her life on the line, would she not offer a\nlarge bribe? But maybe not too large, a spymistress would be smart enough\nto start small—\nToo long, T, don’t take too long!\nTeia said, “She hadn’t mentioned any figures yet. And I wasn’t listening,\nanyway. I’m not in this for coin.” Change the subject, change the subject.\n“Why are you, then?” Master Sharp asked. “You a true convert?”\n“Are we really going to have this conversation in front of her?” Teia\nasked. “Now? You said we needed to—”\n“We don’t need to worry about her.” His voice lowered dangerously,\n“And don’t question me.”\nOrholam have mercy. That cemented it. Whoever they were giving her\nto really was going to kill her. “Uh, I honestly don’t know enough about the\nOrder’s beliefs yet to know what I think. I’m here for revenge.”\n“Revenge? On who?”\nTeia cocked her head as if it were an odd question. “On all of ’em.”\nHe grinned, this time for real. “You’ll get plenty of that. And you’ll\ncome to the Crimson Path eventually.” The true friendliness should have\nmade him less scary, but any comfort she might have felt was ground to\npaste between those inhumanly wide teeth.\nHe walked over to Marissia, still on her knees. “How much would you\ngive us?”\nTremulously, she said, “As much as you want, I swear. I can get access\nto the Prism’s account if we act fast. Please, sir, please.” She broke off as if\nterrified. It twisted Teia’s guts because she couldn’t tell which was true:\nMarissia’s earlier bravery or her current terror. Maybe both.\n“I’ve changed my mind,” Master Sharp said. “If she yells, kill her.” Had\nhe forgotten he’d already threatened that?\nOr did he actually mean it this time?\nMarissia collapsed, sobbing quietly.\nMaster Sharp nodded to Teia. “I need to check the White’s room and\nmake a distraction. Be ready to go quick. If I’m not back in five, untie her,\nthrow her off the balcony as if she suicided, and make your way out the\nsame way we got in.” He threw his hood over his head and pulled the laces\nthrough the grommets quickly, cinching the mask tight over his nose and\nmouth, leaving only his eyes clear, and those shadowed under the hood. He\nturned and began shimmering.\nOn the back of his gray cloak, briefly, the image of a gray owl appeared\nwith its wings spread and talons extended to strike.

He was.\n“Quickly,” Teia said, “what do you want me to do?”\nMarissia got up on her knees. Her voice was breathy with controlled\nfear. “Did he take the papers from my slave’s desk? Package.

Any other hour, and all those papers\nwould be locked away safe… No matter. No time.” She bent for a moment.\n“He’ll take it all to his office anyway. That parchment you grabbed from my\ndesk. It’s a code. Crack it. It’s the combination or key word to the Old Man\nof the Desert’s office. Teia, that office is here, in the Chromeria. That means\nhe—or she, we don’t even know for sure that the Old Man of the Desert is a\nman—is here. But if you open the office without using the code, it’ll wash\nthe room in fire. Everything in it will be destroyed. You can’t let that\nhappen. Not least because the White’s papers will be destroyed too.”\n“I’ll find it, I swear. But what—” Teia cut off at the sound of steps\noutside the room. She tapped Marissia’s shoulder to tell her to be silent, and\ndrafted, disappearing with her own borrowed shimmercloak.\nBut whoever it was walked past, and Teia heard the banging of the door\nto the roof. She and the squad had had quite the fight up there, only hours\nago, but only a single Blackguard was standing watch now. Master Sharp\nhad said the Blackguard would want the area isolated until they could\nexamine it to try to figure out what had happened.\n“What about you?” Teia asked. “How do we save you?”\nA pause. Teia wished she could see Marissia’s face, but the bag stayed\nperfectly still, giving no hint of her fear or her bravery or her hatred or her\ndesperation.\n“We don’t,” Marissia said quietly."

Master\nSharp was speaking before he was even fully visible. “Give me that cloak.”\n“My shimmercloak?” Teia asked.\n“Not yours. It’s the Order’s, and don’t forget it.”\n“I’m the one who stole it! I risked everything to—”\n“Now!”\nTeia unclasped the choker and handed Master Sharp the burnt-hemmed\nshimmercloak. He lowered his own hood, threw Teia’s cloak on over his\nown cloak, attaching the choker awkwardly. He pulled his hood back up,\nbut couldn’t lace it properly. He swore.\n“What are you doing?” Teia asked.\nHe swore again, and said to Marissia. “You do other than what I say, and\nyou die now, and not easy. Understand?”\nHer head bobbed, the sack trembling as she wept. He slashed the rope\nbetween her neck and her wrists, and slung her over his shoulder. “Teia,\nhelp me with the cloak.”\nTeia spread out the second, bunched cloaked over Marissia’s body.\nGiven that Marissia was bent in half over his shoulder, it covered her fully,\nif awkwardly.\n“I have to sneak out without a cloak?” Teia asked.\n“You go out the way we came in. Outside. Collect the climbing\ncrescents as you go. Be quick. You won’t have long before people start\nlooking up here.” He poked Marissia. “You, caleen, when I tell you, you\nscream that there’s a fire in the White’s quarters. Because there is.”\nOh, that was why he hadn’t gagged Marissia. The Blackguards would\nrecognize her voice calling for them.\nStill holding Marissia over his shoulder, Master Sharp stooped to pick\nup the bag full of papers he’d stolen.\n“You want me to take the bag?” Teia asked.\nHe almost handed it to her, then paused. Anxiety hammered great blows\nagainst her mask of nonchalance. He said, “Better not. Get climbing.”\n“I could bring it to—”\n“Now,” he said, and there was quiet menace in his voice. Without\nwaiting, he turned his back, and far more slowly than usual, the cloaks\nbegan shimmering, the fox emblem on Teia’s burnt cloak showing dark gray\nagainst the gray and then fading. The door opened, and Teia smelled smoke.\n“Fire! Fire in the White’s quarters!” Marissia shouted. “Fire!”\nAnd then the door closed behind them.\nThe obvious course was to hurry up and climb. Once the smoke started\nbillowing out of the White’s windows—if it wasn’t already—eyes would\nturn toward the Prism’s Tower. Teia couldn’t be clinging to the walls in full\nview when that happened.\nBut Teia had a card to play that Master Sharp didn’t know."

A FINAL QUEST\nFOR VENGEANCE.\nChapter 1\nIt was all going so nicely, right up until the massacre.\nSir Hjortt’s cavalry of two hundred spears fanned out through the small\nvillage, taking up positions between half-timbered houses in the uneven\nlanes that only the most charitable of surveyors would refer to as “roads.”\nThe warhorses slowed and then stopped in a decent approximation of\nunison, their riders sitting as stiff and straight in their saddles as the lances\nthey braced against their stirrups. It was an unseasonably warm afternoon in\nthe autumn, and after their long approach up the steep valley, soldier and\nsteed alike dripped sweat, yet not a one of them removed their brass\nskullcap. Weapons, armor, and tack glowing in the fierce alpine sunlight,\nthe faded crimson of their cloaks covering up the inevitable stains, the\ncavalry appeared to have ridden straight out of a tale, or galloped down off\none of the tapestries in the mayor’s house.\nSo they must have seemed to the villagers who peeked through their\nshutters, anyway. To their colonel, Sir Hjortt, they looked like hired killers\non horseback barely possessed of sense to do as they were told most of the\ntime. Had the knight been able to train wardogs to ride he should have\npreferred them to the Fifteenth Cavalry, given the amount of faith he placed\nin this lot. Not much, in other words, not very much at all.\nHe didn’t care for dogs, either, but a dog you could trust, even if it was\nonly to lick his balls.\nThe hamlet sprawled across the last stretch of grassy meadow before the\ncollision of two steep, bald-peaked mountains. Murky forest edged in on all\nsides, like a snare the wilderness had set for the unwary traveler. A typical\nmountain town here in the Kutumban range, then, with only a low\nreinforced stone wall to keep out the wolves and what piddling avalanches\nthe encircling slopes must bowl down at the settlement when the snows\nmelted.\nSir Hjortt had led his troops straight through the open gate in the wall\nand up the main track to the largest house in the village… which wasn’t\nsaying a whole lot for the building. Fenced in by shedding rosebushes and\nstanding a scant two and a half stories tall, its windowless redbrick face was\nbroken into a grid by the black timbers that supported it. The mossy\nthatched roof rose up into a witch’s hat, and set squarely in the center like a\nmouth were a great pair of doors tall and wide enough for two riders to pass\nthrough abreast without removing their helmets. As he reached the break in\nthe hedge at the front of the house, Sir Hjortt saw that one of these oaken\ndoors was ajar, but just as he noticed this detail the door eased shut.\nSir Hjortt smiled to himself, and, reining his horse in front of the\nrosebushes, called out in his deepest baritone, “I am Sir Efrain Hjortt of\nAzgaroth, Fifteenth Colonel of the Crimson Empire, come to counsel with"

I have met your lord mayor upon the road, and while he\nreposes at my camp—”\nSomeone behind him snickered at that, but when Sir Hjortt turned in his\nsaddle he could not locate which of his troops was the culprit. It might have\neven come from one of his two personal Chainite guards, who had stopped\ntheir horses at the border of the thorny hedge. He gave both his guards and\nthe riders nearest them the sort of withering scowl his father was overly\nfond of doling out. This was no laughing matter, as should have been\nperfectly obvious from the way Sir Hjortt had dealt with the hillbilly mayor\nof this shitburg.\n“Ahem.” Sir Hjortt turned back to the building and tried again. “Whilst\nyour lord mayor reposes at my camp, I bring tidings of great import. I must\nspeak with the mayor’s wife at once.”\nAnything? Nothing. The whole town was silently, fearfully watching\nhim from hiding, he could feel it in his aching thighs, but not a one braved\nthe daylight either to confront or assist him. Peasants—what a sorry lot they\nwere.\n“I say again!” Sir Hjortt called, goading his stallion into the mayor’s\nyard and advancing on the double doors. “As a colonel of the Crimson\nEmpire and a knight of Azgaroth, I shall be welcomed by the family of your\nmayor, or—”\nBoth sets of doors burst open, and a wave of hulking, shaggy beasts\nflooded out into the sunlight—they were on top of the Azgarothian before\nhe could wheel away or draw his sword. He heard muted bells, obviously to\nsignal that the ambush was under way, and the hungry grunting of the pack,\nand—\nThe cattle milled about him, snuffling his horse with their broad, slimy\nnoses, but now that they had escaped the confines of the building they\nbetrayed no intention toward further excitement.\n“Very sorry, sir,” came a hillfolk-accented voice from somewhere\nnearby, and then a small, pale hand appeared amid the cattle, rising from\nbetween the bovine waves like the last, desperate attempt of a drowning\nman to catch a piece of driftwood. Then the hand seized a black coat and a\nblond boy of perhaps ten or twelve vaulted himself nimbly into sight,\nlanding on the wide back of a mountain cow and twisting the creature\naround to face Sir Hjortt as effortlessly as the Azgarothian controlled his\nwarhorse. Despite this manifest skill and agility at play before him, the\nknight remained unimpressed.\n“The mayor’s wife,” said Sir Hjortt. “I am to meet with her. Now. Is she\nin?”\n“I expect so,” said the boy, glancing over his shoulder—checking the\nposition of the sun against the lee of the mountains towering over the\nvillage, no doubt. “Sorry again ’bout my cows.

And I, uh, didn’t have the barn door locked as I should have.”\n“Spying on us, eh?” said Sir Hjortt. The boy grinned. “Perhaps I’ll let it\nslide this once, if you go and fetch your mistress from inside.”\n“Mayoress is probably up in her house, sir, but I’m not allowed ’round\nthere anymore, on account of my wretched behavior,” said the boy with\nobvious pride.\n“This isn’t her home?” Hjortt eyed the building warily.\n“No, sir. This is the barn.”\nAnother chuckle from one of his faithless troops, but Sir Hjortt didn’t\ngive whoever it was the satisfaction of turning in his saddle a second time.\nHe’d find the culprit after the day’s business was done, and then they’d see\nwhat came of having a laugh at their commander’s expense. Like the rest of\nthe Fifteenth Regiment, the cavalry apparently thought their new colonel\nwas green because he wasn’t yet twenty, but he would soon show them that\nbeing young and being green weren’t the same thing at all.\nNow that their cowherd champion had engaged the invaders, gaily\npainted doors began to open and the braver citizenry slunk out onto their\nstoops, clearly awestruck at the Imperial soldiers in their midst. Sir Hjortt\ngrunted in satisfaction—it had been so quiet in the hamlet that he had begun\nto wonder if the villagers had somehow been tipped off to his approach and\nscampered away into the mountains.\n“Where’s the mayor’s house, then?” he said, reins squeaking in his\ngauntlets as he glared at the boy.\n“See the trail there?” said the boy, pointing to the east. Following the\nlad’s finger down a lane beside a longhouse, Sir Hjortt saw a small gate set\nin the village wall, and beyond that a faint trail leading up the grassy foot of\nthe steepest peak in the valley.\n“My glass, Portolés,” said Sir Hjortt, and his bodyguard walked her\nhorse over beside his. Sir Hjortt knew that if he carried the priceless item in\nhis own saddlebag one of his thuggish soldiers would likely find a way of\nstealing it, but not a one of them would dare try that shit with the burly war\nnun. She handed it over and Sir Hjortt withdrew the heavy brass hawkglass\nfrom its sheath; it was the only gift his father had ever given him that\nwasn’t a weapon of some sort, and he relished any excuse to use it. Finding\nthe magnified trail through the instrument, he tracked it up the meadow to\nwhere the path entered the surrounding forest. A copse of yellowing aspen\ninterrupted the pines and fir, and, scanning the hawkglass upward, he saw\nthat this vein of gold continued up the otherwise evergreen-covered\nmountain.\n“See it?” the cowherd said. “They live back up in there.

The\nthin trunk bowed under his weight, its copper leaves hissing at his touch, its\nwhite bark leaving dust on his cape. The series of switchbacks carved into\nthe increasingly sheer mountainside had become too treacherous for the\nhorses, and so Sir Hjortt and his two guards, Brother Iqbal and Sister\nPortolés, had proceeded up the scarps of exposed granite on foot. The\npossibility of a trap had not left the knight, but nothing more hostile than a\nhummingbird had showed itself on the hike, and now that his eyes had\nadjusted to the strangely diffuse light of this latest grove, he saw a modest,\nfreshly whitewashed house perched on the lip of the next rock shelf.\nSeveral hundred feet above them. Brother Iqbal laughed and Sister\nPortolés cursed, yet her outburst carried more humor in it than his. Through\nthe trees they went, and then made the final ascent.\n“Why…” puffed Iqbal, the repurposed grain satchel slung over one\nmeaty shoulder retarding his already sluggish pace, “in all the… devils of\nEmeritus… would a mayor… live… so far… from his town?”\n“I can think of a reason or three,” said Portolés, setting the head of her\nweighty maul in the path and resting against its long shaft. “Take a look\nbehind us.”\nSir Hjortt paused, amenable to a break himself—even with only his\ncomparatively light riding armor on, it was a real asshole of a hike. Turning,\nhe let out an appreciative whistle. They had climbed quickly, and spread out\nbelow them was the painting-perfect hamlet nestled at the base of the\nmountains. Beyond the thin line of its walls, the lush valley fell away into\nthe distance, a meandering brook dividing east ridge from west. Sir Hjortt\nwas hardly a single-minded, bloodthirsty brute, and he could certainly\nappreciate the allure of living high above one’s vassals, surrounded by the\nbreathtaking beauty of creation. Perhaps when this unfortunate errand was\nover he would convert the mayor’s house into a hunting lodge, wiling away\nhis summers with sport and relaxation in the clean highland air.\n“Best vantage in the valley,” said Portolés. “Gives the headperson plenty\nof time to decide how to greet any guests.”\n“Do you think she’s put on a kettle for us?” said Iqbal hopefully. “I\ncould do with a spot of hunter’s tea.”\n“About this mission, Colonel…” Portolés was looking at Sir Hjortt but\nnot meeting his eyes. She’d been poorly covering up her discomfort with\nphony bravado ever since he’d informed her what needed to be done here,\nand the knight could well imagine what would come next. “I wonder if the\norder—”\n“And I wonder if your church superiors gave me the use of you two\nanathemas so that you might hem and haw and question me at every pass,\ninstead of respecting my command as an Imperial colonel,” said Sir Hjortt,"

Do you think I would put my\nsoldiers through it, if I had a choice? Why would I give such a command, if\nit was at all avoidable? Why—” Sir Hjortt was just warming to his lecture\nwhen a fissure of pain opened up his skull. Intense and unpleasant as the\nsensation was, it fled in moments, leaving him to nervously consider the\nwitchborn pair. Had one of them somehow brought on the headache with\ntheir devilish ways? Probably not; he’d had a touch of a headache for much\nof the ride up, come to think of it, and he hadn’t even mentioned the plan to\nthem then.\n“Come on,” he said, deciding it would be best to drop the matter without\nfurther pontification. Even if his bodyguards did have reservations, this\nmission would prove an object lesson that it is always better to rush through\nany necessary unpleasantness, rather than drag your feet and overanalyze\nevery ugly detail. “Let’s be done with this. I want to be down the valley by\ndark, bad as that road is.”\nThey edged around a hairpin bend in the steep trail, and then the track’s\ncrudely hewn stair delivered them to another plateau, and the mayor’s\nhouse. It was similar in design to those in the hamlet, but with a porch\noverhanging the edge of the mild cliff and a low white fence. Pleasant\nenough, thought Sir Hjortt, except that the fence was made of bone, with\neach outwardly bowed moose-rib picket topped with the skull of a different\nanimal. Owlbat skulls sat between those of marmot and hill fox, and above\nthe door of the cabin rested an enormous one that had to be a horned wolf;\nwhen the cowherd had mentioned such a beast being spied in the area, Sir\nHjortt had assumed the boy full of what his cows deposited, but maybe a\nfew still prowled these lonely mountains. What a thrill it would be, to\nmount a hunting party for such rare game! Then the door beneath the skull\ncreaked, and a figure stood framed in the doorway.\n“Well met, friends, you’ve come a long way,” the woman greeted them.\nShe was brawny, though not so big as Portolés, with features as hard as the\ntrek up to her house. She might have been fit enough once, in a country sort\nof way, when her long, silvery hair was blond or black or red and tied back\nin pigtails the way Hjortt liked… but now she was just an old woman, same\nas any other, fifty winters young at a minimum.

Judging from the tangled\nbone fetishes hanging from the limbs of the sole tree that grew inside the\nfence’s perimeter—a tall, black-barked aspen with leaves as hoary as her\nlocks—she might be a sorceress, to boot.\nIqbal returned her welcome, calling, “Well met, Mum, well met indeed. I\npresent to you Sir Hjortt of Azgaroth, Fifteenth Colonel of the Crimson\nEmpire.” The anathema glanced to his superior, but when Sir Hjortt didn’t\nfall all over himself to charge ahead and meet a potential witch, Iqbal\nmurmured, “She’s just an old bird, sir, nothing to fret about.”\n“Old bird or fledgling, I wouldn’t blindly stick my hand in an owlbat’s\nnest,” Portolés said, stepping past Sir Hjortt and Iqbal to address the old\nwoman in the Crimson tongue. “In the names of the Pontiff of the West and\nthe Queen of the Rest, I order you out here into the light, woman.”\n“Queen of the Rest?” The woman obliged Portolés, stepping down the\ncreaking steps of her porch and approaching the fence. For a mayor’s wife,\nher checked dirndl was as plain as any village girl’s. “And Pontiff of the\nWest, is it? Last peddler we had through here brought tidings that Pope\nShanatu’s war wasn’t going so well, but I gather much has changed. Is this\nsovereign of the Rest, blessed whoever she be, still Queen Indsorith? And\ndoes this mean peace has once again been brokered?”\n“This bird hears a lot from her tree,” muttered Sir Hjortt, then asked the\nwoman, “Are you indeed the mayor’s wife?”\n“I am Mayoress Vivi, wife of Leib,” said she. “And I ask again,\nrespectfully, to whom shall I direct my prayers when next I—”\n“The righteous reign of Queen Indsorith continues, blessed be her\nname,” said Sir Hjortt. “Pope Shanatu, blessed be his name, received word\nfrom on high that his time as Shepherd of Samoth has come to an end, and\nso the war is over. His niece Jirella, blessed be her name, has ascended to\nher rightful place behind the Onyx Pulpit, and taken on the title of Pope\nY’Homa III, Mother of Midnight, Shepherdess of the Lost.”\n“I see,” said the mayoress. “And in addition to accepting a rebel pope’s\nresignation and the promotion of his kin to the same lofty post, our beloved\nIndsorith, long may her glory persist, has also swapped out her noble title?\n‘Queen of Samoth, Heart of the Star, Jewel of Diadem, Keeper of the\nCrimson Empire’ for, ah, ‘Queen of the Rest’?” The woman’s faintly lined\nface wrinkled further as she smiled, and Portolés slyly returned it.\n“Do not mistake my subordinate’s peculiar sense of humor for a shift in\npolicy—the queen’s honorifics remain unchanged,” said Sir Hjortt, thinking\nof how best to discipline Portolés.

If she thought that sort of thing flew with\nher commanding colonel just because there were no higher-ranked clerical\nwitnesses to her dishonorable talk, the witchborn freak had another thing\ncoming. He almost wished she would refuse to carry out his command, so\nhe’d have an excuse to get rid of her altogether. In High Azgarothian, he\nsaid, “Portolés, return to the village and give the order. In the time it will\ntake you to make it down I’ll have made myself clear enough.”\nPortolés stiffened and gave Sir Hjortt a pathetic frown that told him\nshe’d been holding out hope that he would change his mind. Not bloody\nlikely. Also in Azgarothian, the war nun said, “I’m… I’m just going to have\na look inside before I do. Make sure it’s safe, Colonel Hjortt.”\n“By all means, Sister Portolés, welcome, welcome,” said the older\nwoman, also in that ancient and honorable tongue of Sir Hjortt’s ancestors.\nUnexpected, that, but then the Star had been a different place when this\nbiddy was in her prime, and perhaps she had seen more of it than just her\nremote mountain. Now that she was closer he saw that her cheeks were\nmore scarred than wrinkled, a rather gnarly one on her chin, and for the first\ntime since their arrival, a shadow of worry played across the weathered\nlandscape of her face. Good. “I have an old hound sleeping in the kitchen\nwhom I should prefer you left to his dreams, but am otherwise alone. But,\ngood Colonel, Leib was to have been at the crossroads this morning…”\nSir Hjortt ignored the mayor’s wife, following Portolés through the gate\nonto the walkway of flat, colorful stones that crossed the yard. They were\nartlessly arranged; the first order of business would be to hire the mason\nwho had done the bathrooms at his family estate in Cockspar, or maybe the\nwoman’s apprentice, if the hoity-toity artisan wasn’t willing to journey a\nhundred leagues into the wilds to retile a walk. A mosaic of miniature\nanimals would be nice, or maybe indigo shingles could be used to make it\nresemble a creek. But then they had forded a rill on their way up from the\nvillage, so why not have somebody trace it to its source and divert it this\nway, have an actual stream flow through the yard? It couldn’t be that hard to\nhave it come down through the trees there and then run over the cliff beside\nthe deck, creating a miniature waterfall that—\n“Empty,” said Portolés, coming back outside. Sir Hjortt had lost track of\nhimself—it had been a steep march up, and a long ride before that. Portolés\nsilently moved behind the older woman, who stood on the walk between Sir\nHjortt and her house. The matron looked nervous now, all right.\n“My husband Leib, Colonel Hjortt. Did you meet him at the\ncrossroads?” Her voice was weaker now, barely louder than the quaking\naspens.

We’ll ride out at first”—\nthe thought of sleeping in on a proper bed occurred to him—“noon. We ride\nat noon tomorrow.

She had a stern bearing he wasn’t at all\nsure he liked. “Your officer can surely tarry a few minutes before delivering\nyour orders, especially if we are to have you as our guests for the night. Let\nus speak, you and I, and no matter what orders you may have, no matter\nhow pressing your need, I shall make it worth your while to have listened.”\nPortolés’s puppy-dog eyes from over the woman’s shoulder turned Sir\nHjortt’s stomach. At least Iqbal had the decency to keep his smug gaze on\nthe old woman.\n“Whether or not she is capable of doing so, Sister Portolés will not\nwait,” said Sir Hjortt shortly. “You and I are talking, and directly, make no\nmistake, but I see no reason to delay my subordinate.”\nThe old woman looked back past Portolés, frowning at the open door of\nher cabin, and then shrugged. As if she had any say at all in how this would\ntranspire. Flashing a patently false smile at Sir Hjortt, she said, “As you\nwill, fine sir. I merely thought you might have use for the sister as we\nspoke, for we may be talking for some time.”\nFallen Mother have mercy, did every single person have a better idea of\nhow Sir Hjortt should conduct himself than he did? This would not stand.\n“My good woman,” he said, “it seems that we have even more to parley\nthan I previously suspected. Sister Portolés’s business is pressing, however,\nand so she must away before we embark on this long conversation you so\ndesire. Fear not, however, for the terms of supplication your husband laid\nout to us at the crossroads shall be honored, reasonable as they undeniably\nare. Off with you, Portolés.”\nPortolés offered him one of her sardonic salutes from over the older\nwoman’s shoulder, and then stalked out of the yard, looking as petulant as\nhe’d ever seen her.

The war nun flicked the malformed ear that emerged from Iqbal’s\npale tonsure like the outermost leaf of an overripe cabbage, rage rendering\nher face even less appealing, if such a thing was possible. Iqbal swung his\nheavy satchel at her in response, and although Portolés dodged the blow, the\ndark bottom of the sackcloth misted her with red droplets as it whizzed past\nher face. If the sister noticed the blood on her face, she didn’t seem to care,\ndragging her feet down the precarious trail, her maul slung over one\nhunched shoulder.\n“My husband,” the matron whispered, and, turning back to her, Sir\nHjortt saw that her wide eyes were fixed on Iqbal’s dripping sack.\n“Best if we talk inside,” said Sir Hjortt, winking at Iqbal and ushering\nthe woman toward her door. “Come, come, I have an absolutely brilliant\nidea about how you and your people might help with the war effort, and I’d\nrather discuss it over tea.”\n“You said the war was over,” the woman said numbly, still staring at the\nsatchel.\n“So it is, so it is,” said Sir Hjortt. “But the effort needs to be made to\nensure it doesn’t start up again, what? Now, what do you have to slake the\nthirst of servants of the Empire, home from the front?”\nShe balked, but there was nowhere to go, and so she led Sir Hjortt and\nBrother Iqbal inside. It was quiet in the yard, save for the trees and the\nclacking of the bone fetishes when the wind ran its palm down the\nmountain’s stubbly cheek. The screaming didn’t start until after Sister\nPortolés had returned to the village, and down there they were doing\nenough of their own to miss the echoes resonating from the mayor’s house.\nBooks by Brent Weeks\nPerfect Shadow (e-only novella)\nTHE NIGHT ANGEL TRILOGY\nThe Way of Shadows\nShadow’s Edge\nBeyond the Shadows\nNight Angel (omnibus)\nTHE LIGHTBRINGER SERIES\nThe Black Prism\nThe Blinding Knife\nThe Broken Eye\nThe Blood Mirror\nThank you for buying this ebook, published by Orbit.\nTo get news about the latest Science Fiction and Fantasy titles from Orbit,\nalong with special offers and exclusive content, sign up for the Orbit\nnewsletter.\nSign Up\nOr visit us at www.orbitbooks.net/booklink/\nContents\nCover\nTitle Page\nWelcome\nDedication\nMaps\nEpigraph\nChapter 1\nChapter 2\nChapter 3\nChapter 4\nChapter 5\nChapter 6\nChapter 7\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 10\nChapter 11\nChapter 12\nChapter 13\nChapter 14\nChapter 15\nChapter 16\nChapter 17\nChapter 18\nChapter 19\nChapter 20\nChapter 21\nChapter 22\nChapter 23\nChapter 24\nChapter 25\nChapter 26\nChapter 27\nChapter 28\nChapter 29\nChapter 30\nChapter 31\nChapter 32\nChapter 33\nChapter 34\nChapter 35\nChapter 36\nChapter 37"
