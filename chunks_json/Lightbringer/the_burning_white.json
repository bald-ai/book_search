The process is known as drafting, and each drafted color has\nunique physical and metaphysical properties and innumerable uses, from\nconstruction to warfare. Trained at the empire’s capital, the Chromeria,\ndrafters lead lives of privilege, with politicians and powerful families vying\nfor their services. In exchange, they agree that once they exhaust their\nability to safely use magic—signaled when the halos of their irises are\nbroken by the colors they draft—they will be killed by the emperor, the\nPrism, in a ceremony on the most holy day of the year: Sun Day. Drafters\nwho have broken the halo are called wights, and they descend into madness\nif they are not Freed; those who run from the ritual Freeing are hunted to\ntheir deaths. Only the Prism can draft with limitless power, and he or she\nalone can balance all the colors in the satrapies to prevent luxin from\noverwhelming the lands and creating chaos. Every seven years, or on a\nmultiple of seven years, the Prism also gives up his or her life, and the\nruling council installs a new Prism. If the Prism refuses death, he or she is\nlikewise hunted down by the elite squadron assigned to protecting the\nempire: the Blackguard.\nBook One: The Black Prism\nKip Delauria is scrounging for shards of luxin on a battlefield of the False\nPrism’s War outside Rekton. He comes upon a green wight, Gaspar Elos,\nbound and trying to escape. Satrap Garadul has declared himself king and is\nplanning to lay waste to Rekton; there is an army camped not far away. Kip\nraces to the home of red dyer Master Danavis, who urges Kip to find his\nfriends and run. During his escape attempt, Kip inadvertently drafts. Later\nhe finds his mother, Lina, gravely injured, hidden in a cave with one of his\nfriends. She gives him a rosewood box containing a mysterious jewel-\nencrusted dagger before dying.\nAt the Chromeria, Prism Gavin Guile receives a message from Lina,\ntelling him that he has a son in Rekton named Kip. Gavin soon sets off with\nBlackguard Karris White Oak. They make their way to Tyrea on a luxin\nskimmer/glider of his own creation, which allows them to cross the entire\nCerulean Sea in a day. Upon their arrival they discover that Rekton has\nbeen destroyed, and they find Kip trying to defend himself from Garadul’s\nMirrormen. Gavin quickly dispatches the soldiers, realizing that Garadul is\ntrying to set up his own Chromeria and has declared himself king. Gavin\nrecognizes Kip as his bastard and claims him; Garadul takes the dagger\nbefore they leave.\nGavin and Kip make their way back to the Chromeria, where Kip is\nimmediately tested to see what he can draft. He is discovered to be a\nsuperchromat and is revealed to be a blue/green bichrome. He also reunites\nwith Aliviana (Liv) Danavis—a friend from his hometown and daughter of\nCorvan.\nMeanwhile in Tyrea, Karris has set out on her own. She finds Corvan"

She finds Corvan\nDanavis—Dazen’s greatest general in the False Prism’s War—in a\nbasement, the lone survivor of the brutal massacre in Rekton. Karris is\ncaptured by the king’s forces, and she discovers that King Garadul’s right\nhand, a polychrome wight who calls himself the Color Prince, is the one\ninciting rebellion. He is Karris’s brother, whom she’d thought long dead.\nCorvan begins to make his way to Garriston to warn the governor.\nBack at the Chromeria, it is revealed that Gavin is in fact Dazen,\nmasquerading as his older brother. The real Gavin Guile (‘the prisoner’) is\nstill alive, held in a blue luxin prison far beneath the Prism’s Tower. Prism\nGuile meets with the Spectrum, the governing body of the Seven Satrapies,\nand tells them what Garadul is planning. Gavin decides to make his way to\nGarriston with Kip, Blackguard Commander Ironfist, and Liv—who is to be\nKip’s tutor. Once they arrive in Garriston, Gavin deposes Governor Crassos\nand takes command. He reunites with and reinstates General Danavis,\ngiving his old friend command of Garriston’s defenses.\nGavin plans to build a magnificent yellow luxin wall around Garriston in\nan attempt to save the otherwise vulnerable city. Brightwater Wall is nearly\ncomplete when a cannonball destroys the gate as Gavin is finishing it.\nMeanwhile, Kip sneaks away to infiltrate Garadul’s camp as a spy to find\nKarris, and Liv goes with him; Kip is captured, and Liv is invited to join the\nColor Prince. Liv saves both Kip and Karris by agreeing to join the Color\nPrince if he’ll spare Kip’s and Gavin’s lives.\nDuring the Battle of Garriston, Gavin goes down after drafting white\nluxin, Kip kills King Garadul, and the rest of the forces retreat to the docks.\nKip helps rescue Ironfist, and they run across the ocean to one of the barges,\nwhere Kip races to meet another threat: a young polychrome, Zymun, who\nhas been assigned to assassinate Gavin. Zymun’s attempt fails when Kip\nintercedes. Kip takes the dagger Zymun used and realizes it is the same\nblade his mother gave him; he recovers the knife, which now has a blue\ngem in the hilt.\nGavin realizes he has lost the ability to see or draft blue. The prisoner\nhas broken out of the blue prison to find himself inside a green one.\nBook Two: The Blinding Knife\nGavin and the refugees from Garriston are aboard the barges, and he tries to\nreconcile with the fact that he has lost blue. He saves the refugees from a\nsea demon, then departs with Karris for Seers Island, where he negotiates\nwith the Third Eye, a powerful Seer, to get permission for the refugees to\nbuild a home on her island. The Third Eye knows who he really is and that\nhe has already lost blue. She gives Gavin some useful advice about the\nbane, and Gavin later kills the blue bane by himself."

Kip makes\nsome friends and meets Teia, a color-blind paryl drafter and a slave. The\nwar isn’t going well for the Chromeria, and Ironfist announces that the\nBlackguard will graduate the top fourteen candidates instead of the usual\nseven. As hard as training is, the new interest Kip’s grandfather, Andross\nGuile, has taken in him is worse. Andross demands Kip play Nine Kings for\nextremely high stakes.\nGavin and Karris return to the Chromeria after getting the refugees\nsettled in their new home. He meets with the Spectrum, and Seers Island is\nrenamed New Tyrea, giving it power as a satrapy and Danavis as satrap.\nKarris is ambushed and beaten by men hired by Andross Guile.\nA librarian, Rea Siluz, introduces Kip to Janus Borig, an eccentric old\nartist who creates priceless original Nine Kings cards infused with magic.\nJanus warns Kip that her life is in danger, and soon Kip discovers Borig’s\nhouse burned and Janus mortally wounded by two mysterious assassins.\nKip recovers a deck of completely new cards, kills the assassins, steals their\nshimmercloaks, and gives the items to Ironfist and Gavin. Kip eventually\nranks fourteenth in his Blackguard testing and is revealed to be not a\nbichrome, but a full-spectrum polychrome.\nMeanwhile, Liv has sworn fealty to the Color Prince and his cause. His\narmy begins to make their way from Garriston toward Ru, a large city in\nAtash. Gavin travels to Ru with Kip and a team of Blackguards. They go on\nscouting missions. Gavin reveals his skimmer to the Blackguards, and\ntogether they sink the Gargantua, an enormous ship owned by pirate king\nPash Vecchio.\nGavin and Karris reconcile and marry just before they go to war against\nthe Color Prince. With the new Blackguard inductees and the Chromeria’s\nforces, they must destroy a green bane that is birthing a new god, Atirat.\nIronfist and Teia lead a team in an assault on a watchtower. The green bane\nemerges from the sea; Gavin, Kip, and Karris fight their way to it, killing\nwights in their wake. Amid the chaos, Gavin realizes he has lost the ability\nto see or draft green. Liv directs a huge beam of light to the bane spire,\nawakening the new green god Atirat.\nBack at the watchtower, Teia, Ironfist, and company aim cannon fire at\nthe bane, causing the spire to explode. Using the explosion as a distraction,\nKip drives his dagger—the powerful Blinding Knife—into the green god\nAtirat, killing it.

Gavin tries to intervene but can only redirect the knife into his\nown body. Gavin falls overboard, and Kip jumps after him.\nThey are quickly picked up by the Bitter Cob, led by pirate captain\nGunner, a crazed cannoneer who was on a ship Gavin had earlier destroyed;\nthe Blinding Knife has grown into a huge gun-sword.

Karris, who is now\nmarried to the Prism, is removed from the Blackguard to become\nspymistress for the White.\nUpon his homecoming, Kip tells the Spectrum and Karris that Gavin is\nstill alive and forges a tenuous alliance with Andross. He trains and studies\nunder Karris and reunites with his old Blackguard squad: Cruxer, Ben-\nhadad, Big Leo, Teia, Ferkudi, Winsen, Goss, and Daelos. Andross grants\nthe group access to restricted libraries so they can research heretical Nine\nKings cards and the Lightbringer, a long-prophesied savior of the satrapies,\nhoping they’ll gain information to win the war. The group meets and\nbefriends Quentin Naheed, a humble and brilliant young luxiat and scholar.\nBack across the ocean, Gavin—color-blind and unable to draft—is a\ngalley slave on Gunner’s pirate ship.

Under the White’s orders, Teia becomes a double agent for\nthe Chromeria, infiltrating the Order; she immediately undertakes various\nmissions to prove her loyalty to the Order. Teia soon gets a message from\nKarris that someone is planning to kill Kip, and she hurries with Cruxer and\nWinsen to try to help their friend. They save Kip and kill the Blackguards\nwho were trying to assassinate him.\nWhile meeting with Andross, Kip learns that his grandfather knows\nabout Zymun, who is on his way to the Jaspers, and that when he arrives, he\nwill be named Prism-elect—unless Kip can find Andross’s missing Nine\nKings deck, as well as the originals Kip saved from Janus Borig’s house.\nKip, after confessing his feelings to Teia and telling her about Tisis’s\nproposal that they marry, goes down to the Prism’s training room and finds\nthe lost Nine Kings cards in a punching bag. When Kip accidentally absorbs\nall the cards, he falls dead and enters the Great Library, where he meets an\nimmortal: Abaddon.\nMeanwhile, Karris and Ironfist learn where Gavin is and plan to go\nrescue him.

When they return, they take Gavin to a chirurgeon they\ntrust to hide him while Karris goes to look for Kip.\nBack in the training room, Teia finds Kip’s body.

Kip has trouble\nsorting out reality from the visions he saw on the cards.\nTeia follows Andross to his estate on Big Jasper, where she overhears\nhim meeting with Zymun about Zymun’s future with the Guile family, and\nthen with Murder Sharp plotting to assassinate the White.

Gavin wakes up to find that\nMarissia is with him in the blue cell to tend to his injuries. She confesses\nthat she was not only Orea Pullawr’s spymistress, but also her\ngranddaughter.

She reveals that Kip\nmarches to Dúnbheo to free it, not having seen the White King’s trap.\nGavin spends months in the black cell, and eventually discovers the\ndead man there is not a will-casting, but something else entirely. Grinwoody\nappears sometime later, revealing that he is the Old Man of the Desert and\nthat he will free Gavin if he agrees to sail to White Mist Reef, climb the\nTower of Heaven, and kill Orholam—what the Old Man believes is the\nnexus of magic in the satrapies—using the Blinding Knife. Gavin agrees,\nplaces a piece of black luxin that will ensure his obedience over his eye\nsocket, and walks to the ship. It is the Golden Mean, captained by none\nother than Gunner.\nTeia is given a final mission by the Order to test her. She is told to\nmurder someone (Gavin) once he has completed a quest for the Order. If\nshe fails, they will murder her father.\nKarris meets with Andross, who tells her that Ironfist has declared\nhimself king of Paria. She then has to kill Blackguard Gavin Greyling, who\nbroke his halos while out searching for her husband. After his Freeing,\nKarris orders that the Blackguard is to search for Gavin no more, accepting\nthat he is dead.\nLiv decides to join the White King and realize her full powers as a\ngoddess, seeing that he is preparing to sail the bane to invade the\nChromeria.\nKip and his army successfully free the besieged city of Dúnbheo, at\ngreat personal cost to Conn Arthur, who deserts following the battle. Kip\ndeposes the nobles and claims the city for himself and his army. He and\nTisis profess their love for each other and are finally able to consummate\ntheir marriage.

        "text": "Why? One of the challenges of writing an epic story over multiple\nvolumes is balancing dramatic unities against one another. The Lightbringer\nseries tells one huge, unified story, but my goal has been for each book to\ncomprise its own story so that both journey and destination satisfy.\nSometimes the desires of an individual novel yield to the demands of the\nwhole series—say, when big plot questions are raised in one volume but not\nanswered until several books later. Other times I think an individual novel\nhas the better claim.\nThis series certainly doesn’t need more complexity, and thus the vast\nmajority of the scenes are presented in chronological order. But what’s a\nwriter to do when a character jumps the gun and gets into her book five\nproblems while the other characters are still wrapping up their book four\nproblems? (In this case, Teia.)\nA strict chronological presentation would interrupt the other characters’\nbook four finales, and then, when book five came out, what Teia had done\nmere hours before would have to be reintroduced. Worse, that ordering\nwould undercut our end-of-book satisfaction—that precious, fragile feeling\nthat though this epic journey will continue, we’ve reached a logical base\ncamp.\nCharacters warming themselves around a fire and looking up at the\nmountain peak they’ll attempt tomorrow? That’s a good tease. Characters\nnever stopping hiking and the book simply ending? That’s bad structure.\nIn another case here, a character off in the hinterlands has his most\ninteresting scenes occur back-to-back in a single day, while everyone else’s\nare spread over weeks.\nChronological order may be the simplest, but where one character’s\nactions won’t (yet) affect other characters, I’ve chosen to present a small\nnumber of scenes in the order I think gives the best reading experience\ninstead.\nTrust me, when the characters come back together, it all works out.\nThe chronology, that is. Not necessarily the events.\n—Brent Weeks\nin a hole in the ground, outside Portland, Oregon\nBeware of shedding blood unnecessarily… for blood never\nsleeps.\n—AN-NASIR SALAH AD-DIN YUSUF IBN AYYUB (SALADIN)\nChapter 1\nThe White King’s plan to destroy Kip Guile only began with an\nassassination. The assassination began with the scent of cloves.\n“I love being in the Mighty, don’t get me wrong,” Big Leo was telling\nFerkudi, “but sometimes the bodyguard duty is too much for only five of us,\ndon’t you think? The Blackguard always has at least a hundred warriors.\nThat’s like ten times as many. Fifteen? Dammit, twenty. You see? That’s\nhow tired I am. And sure, they gotta guard more people than we—”\nFerkudi sniffed.\nBig Leo stopped. He took his eyes off the chattering nobles for the first\ntime all night and glanced at him. Like most things he did, Ferkudi sniffed\ndifferent, huffing in his air in little triads, short, short, long.\nThe two of them had pulled door-guard duty for the big dinner party\nhailing Kip (Breaker to the Mighty) as the Liberator of Dúnbheo. After his\ninitial chilly reception by the Council of Divines—and a couple of hangings\n—the nobles of Blood Forest’s cultural capital were trying to make nice."

        "text": "initial chilly reception by the Council of Divines—and a couple of hangings\n—the nobles of Blood Forest’s cultural capital were trying to make nice.\nWhen Ferkudi said nothing, Big Leo took the sniff as agreement. He\ncontinued, “I mean, no one’s going to make a move on the city’s big savior\ntonight, right? It ever bother you no one seems to notice Lord Kip Guile\ndidn’t save the city all by himself?”\nEverything was fine, Leo thought. No one was acting strangely. Sure,\nthere were some nerves as everyone was trying to figure out how to turn\nBreaker into an ally, but the noise of the crowd was right. People even\nseemed to be enjoying themselves.\nFerkudi sniffed.\n“Don’t tell me you’re coming down with a cold,” Leo said, not looking\nover this time.\nFerkudi inhaled deeply, like a war-bound soldier carefully filling his\nmnemonic storehouses with the scent of his wife’s hair.\n“What?” Ferkudi said blankly. “Cold? Huh?”\n“Yeah, all right. What was I—oh, yeah, I mean Breaker saves the city,\ndistributes all our food to the starving? And fixes that ceiling-art-whatever-\nthing? That meant something to these people. He’s like a god here now. If\nthe Council of Divines or any of the Blood Forest nobles makes a move\nagainst him, the people would riot. They’d burn the nobles’ heart trees,\nstring up every last one of—”\nFerkudi interrupted. “Anyone get added to the guest list late?”\nFerkudi loved lists, all lists. When the palace chatelaine had shown him\nher immaculately organized ledgers, the look on his face had been a\nbaggage train of astonishment, then disbelief, then rapture, and finally utter\ninfatuation for the bespectacled sexagenarian and her perfect figures. Kip—\nBreaker—had been turning Ferkudi’s odd brain to good use in his now daily\nwranglings with traders and bankers and nobles. The Mighty mostly used it\nfor humor: setting Ferkudi to ranking units of the army by sewage produced\nhad been a recent favorite. (By weight? No, by volume. How long after\nexcretion?)\nBut when you pulled door duty, there was nothing humorous about\nreconciling the guest list. “Absolutely not!” Big Leo said, stone serious.\nSomething in his growl or his changing stance sent a few nearby nobles\nback a step.\nIt was a discipline they’d learned from the Blackguard—there were\nnever to be late additions or surprise guests when they provided security,\never. If a Blackguard saw someone at an event who wasn’t on the master\nlist, he or she had free rein to consider them a threat.\nBut that only worked when the Blackguards could identify every guest\nby sight. Maybe Ferkudi could do that on the Mighty’s second night in\nDúnbheo, but Big Leo certainly couldn’t. A flare of white-knuckled rage\nshot through him. The five of them, being asked to protect the Lightbringer\nhimself? Impossible!\nDamn you, Cruxer, it’s been a year. You should have recruited fifty of us\nby now.\nBut everything still looked fine.\n“Ferk?” he said."

You should have recruited fifty of us\nby now.\nBut everything still looked fine.\n“Ferk?” he said.\n“I talked with the cooks,” the big round-shouldered young man said,\nsniffing again. “There were no dishes with cloves.”\nCloves. Superviolet luxin smelled something like cloves. Big Leo felt a\nfrisson down his spine.\n“Breaker’s the only declared superviolet in the room,” Big Leo said. Kip\nsat at the head table, where he was chatting amicably with an older woman\nwho was some kind of authority on cultural antiquities.\nHe was much too far away for the scent to be coming from him.\n“A secret message?” Big Leo said. Superviolet was often used for\ndiplomatic messages. This was precisely the kind of crowd that would carry\nthose, and even a noble could get jostled, breaking some fragile superviolet\nluxin scrawled on a parchment.\nOr the cooks could have added cloves to one of the dishes at the last\nmoment. Right?\nHell, for all Big Leo knew, maybe some lady walking past had clove-\nscented perfume.\n‘Falsely declaring an assassination attempt is the worst thing you can\ndo…’ Blackguard Commander Ironfist had once lectured them, ‘… except\nstand over the body of your ward. Announcing an assassination attempt\nmeans throwing a burning torch into the powder magazine of history. You\nare the people trusted with guns and spears and drafting while the most\npowerful and paranoid people in the world sleep and sup and talk and f…\nfornicate.’ They’d laughed, but the point was serious: several Prisms had\nbeen murdered by cuckolded spouses and scorned lovers. ‘When powerful\nparanoid people see you burst into a room shouting, armed and drafting,\nyou will see pistols somehow appear on people who you know have been\nsearched and cleared. You will see munds somehow turn out to be able to\ndraft. You will see people innocent of everything except stupidity give you\nreasons to believe they need killing.\n‘In a false alarm, you may see people die for no reason other than that\nyou yelled. You may kill them yourself.\n‘Given all that, some say calling a false alarm is shameful,’ Commander\nIronfist had said. ‘But I say a Blackguard who doesn’t shout a Nine Kill\nonce in their life isn’t working on edge. We protect the most important\npeople in the world. Work on edge.’\nThe code was shorthand for the number of attackers, the suspected\nintent, and capabilities. A normal shout might be One Kill Five (a solo\nattacker, attempting assassination, likely a red drafter) or Two Grab Ten\n(two attackers attempting kidnapping, armed with muskets). Nine was\n‘unspecified’ and the most likely to be wrong.\nBig Leo looked over at Ferkudi, praying he’d say he’d been mistaken.\nFerkudi was glowering at the room, his brain grinding forward as slowly\nas a millstone and just as implacably.\nBehind their smiles, not a few of the Blood Forest conns might want Kip\ndead, but none would dare to move against him openly, certainly not with\nhis army deployed inside their city.

But someone else had good reason to\nwant Kip dead. Someone who would stop at nothing. The White King.\nHe shouldn’t have anyone serving him, not in this city. But he might.\nBig Leo’s eyes met Ferkudi’s. There was no hesitation there.\n“Nine Kill Seven!” Big Leo bellowed—\nJust as Ferkudi yelled, “Nine Kill Naught!”\nWhat?! ‘Naught’ wasn’t superviolet. ‘Naught’ meant a paryl-using\nassassin.\nBut their voices had already flown like torches from their hands to land\namid friends and foes and fools, the nervous and naïve, all of them paranoid\nand powerful.\nAnd the black powder of history roared in reply.\nChapter 2\nKip Guile had become a thousand hands holding two thousand cords, each\none twisting in his fists, tearing away in every direction, each believing\ntheir own petty happiness was more important than the survival of them all.\nHe smiled at mousy Lady Proud Hart, finding a measure of real joy in her\nexcited jabbering about his repairs of the ceiling art Túsaíonn Domhan, ‘A\nWorld Begins.’ He wondered if what he was doing now was easier or harder\nthan that repair, weaving the myriad magics together into one yoke and then\npulling the whole from extinction into new life.\nExcept here the two thousand cords were conns and banconns, merchant\nprinces, gentleman pirates, emissaries, slavers, spies, confidence women,\nand deserters, and exiles and refugees in their tens of thousands—and even\none shy and fabulously wealthy art collector. Some cords turned to shape\nwithout complaint, adding weight but also more usefulness. Many resisted\nhis pull, rightly distrustful of another war, another Guile. Many tried to\ntwist him to their selfish ends. But behind others, even tonight, Kip could\nfeel an undue tension, pulling against him.\nHe wasn’t looking to weave an emperor’s robe for himself, for\nOrholam’s sake, he was making a simple yoke, that he might heave the\nSeven Satrapies away from the edge of an abyss.\nIt was the White King. Koios was at work here in this very room tonight.\nKip could feel it.\n“With your discovery that the old masters used truly full-spectrum\nmagic, Great Lord Guile,” Lady Proud Hart was saying, “nine colors! not\nseven! who’d have dared believe it?—with that insight, we can bring art\nback to life that has not graced this earth with its true beauty in centuries.\nYes, yes, the Chromeria will be peeved, but surely art is a demi-creation\nthat brings great glory to the Creator Himself, no? The creation of beauty is\nworship! Who can deny it?” She was a tiny woman, the foremost expert on\nForester antiquities in the world, or so Tisis had told him. She was also very\nconnected and universally loved here. “With you leading the efforts, Conn\nGuile—oh dear, did I let that slip?

Unofficially, of\ncourse, until the formal—”\nAcross the room, Ferkudi and Big Leo suddenly shouted, “Nine Kill\nNaught!” and “Nine Kill Seven!” simultaneously.\nFor an embarrassingly long moment, Kip didn’t understand why they’d\nbe so rude as to scream during a civilized dinner party.\nIn one instant, Kip’s greatest dread was that Lady Proud Hart was\nwarming to asking him to repair dozens of fragile, priceless works of art\nhimself. There was no way he wouldn’t destroy half of them if he tried. He\nwas the f’ing Turtle-Bear.\nIn the next instant, dual cracking noises woke him from a social fear to a\nphysical one, like a man wakened from a fitful sleep by a thief in his room.\nLux torches snapped open, Ben-hadad threw one blue and one green torch\nonto the banquet table, each flaring and burning and spitting magnesium\nheat, scorching the priceless walnut.\nKip suddenly lurched backward as Cruxer heaved on his shoulders,\nyanking him and his chair to get him out of any possible line of fire as\nquickly as possible.\nCruxer suddenly stopped the chair’s skidding feet with his own, pulling\nthe chair hard toward the ground and catapulting Kip into the air.\nKip flipped over backward, only belatedly tucking his knees.\nWhen they’d practiced this, he’d landed on his feet. One time.\nNot this time. He crashed onto his hands and knees behind Cruxer.\nBy the time Kip stood, Cruxer had slammed an oblivious serving girl out\nof the way and off her feet with a hard shove and planted himself in front of\nKip, whose back was now against the wall. Cruxer, with one side of his\nblue spectacles knocked askew, was staring at the blue burning lux torch on\nthe table and drafting.\nThe tall bodyguard whirled each hand in circles, building a blue luxin\nshield, swiping left and right, painting the air itself with crystalline\nprotection.\nTo not make a stationary target of himself, Kip dodged left and right\nwithin the space behind Cruxer, drafting as much off the lux torches as he\ncould while trying to identify a threat.\nFerkudi and Big Leo were barreling through the wide common hall to\nget to his side. The music of lyre and timbrel and psantria fell silent.\nKip had asked for a small party—which meant (not counting those\nlaboring in the kitchens and stockyards) a hundred lords and ladies and\nlackeys and lickspittles, thirty-some servants and slaves, fifty men-at-arms\n(who, on Cruxer’s insistence, were allowed no more armament than a table\nknife), and a dozen performers.\nAll of them were shrinking back from the center of the room and the\nhigh table. Some of the men-at-arms were covering their charges with their\nown bodies or hauling them toward the doors. Other men-at-arms were still\nstupefied like blinking heifers, too dull to do the only work for which they’d\nbeen hired."

Other men-at-arms were still\nstupefied like blinking heifers, too dull to do the only work for which they’d\nbeen hired.\nA hundred people in the room, and not one whom Kip could see as a\nthreat.\nIn a far corner of the room, the petite Winsen had jumped up on a\nservant’s sideboard to get a view of the whole room, his bow already strung,\narrow nocked but not drawn, its point sweeping left and right with Winsen’s\ngaze.\nThen Kip’s view was obscured as Cruxer finished the shield-bubble of\nblue luxin.\nIt wasn’t elegant work. Despite being made of translucent blue luxin, it\nwas nearly opaque, but Kip knew it was strong. Cruxer did nothing halfway.\n“More men,” Cruxer muttered. “We need more men.”\nIt was only then that Kip finally processed the last bits: ‘Nine Kill\nSeven’ meant a possible assassination attempt by an unknown number of\ndrafters, possibly involving a superviolet. With no one charging forward\nnow, that sounded like a false alarm. Nine Kills were often false alarms.\nBut ‘Nine Kill Naught’ meant a paryl drafter.\nAn assassin from the Order of the Broken Eye. A Shadow.\nWhich meant the assassin might be invisible, the kind of monster who\ncould reach through clothes and flesh and luxin unseen and stop your very\nheart.\nWith a pop like an impudent kid clicking his tongue, Cruxer’s solid\nshield-bubble of blue luxin burst and simply fell to dust.\nAghast, Cruxer hesitated, baffled at how something he’d built to be\nimpervious could simply fail, but Kip was suddenly loosed. Paryl was\nfragile. It could slide through luxin or flesh, into joints or hearts. But it\ncouldn’t stretch, couldn’t cut, couldn’t survive violent motion.\nAs some nerve was invisibly tweaked, Cruxer’s knee buckled under him\neven as Kip dove away.\nKip rolled to his feet and ran straight for the high table. Last thing he\nwanted with a paryl assassin nearby was to trap himself against a wall.\nShouting, “Paryl!” he leapfrogged over the head table between the great\nclay jugs of wine.\nIn typically flamboyant Forester fashion, there was a tradition at big\nparties for the conn to line up all the wine he intended to serve his guests in\ngreat jugs on the head table as a sign of his largesse and wealth. The guests,\nfor their part, were expected to drink all of it. Naturally, the jugs got bigger\nas the egos did.\nHere, for the man who had saved the city, some of the most brilliant\nexamples of the big jugs ever crafted were lined up along the entire length\nof the high table like a rank of alcoholic soldiers.\nIn all the majesty of his gracefulness, the Turtle-Bear clipped one of\nthem as he cleared the table. He rolled into the open space in the center of\nthe big U of all the tables.\nThe priceless glazed clay jug painted with gold zoomorphic swirls and\nstudded with precious stones tottered, teetered with the countervailing\nmotion of the sloshing wine inside, tilted, toppled—and smashed."

He was physically out of the fight for a while, but his eyes\nwere up and he was already barking orders, no fear at all in his voice,\ndespite his helplessness. “Ferk, Leo, wide! Keep moving! Paryl!”\nBig Leo had already unlimbered the heavy chain he usually draped\naround his neck and tucked into his belt. He began whirring it in the air\naround him, sweeping it into a shifting shell of shimmering steel. No fragile\nfingers of paryl would make it through that. Because of Teia, the Mighty\nhad an idea of what paryl could do.\nFerkudi, the grappler, had knots of luxin in and around each hand—a\ncoruscating chunk of crystalline blue luxin in his right, and a spreading\nshillelagh of woody green in his left. He would count on deflecting any\nattacks with luxin just long enough to close the distance so he could seize\nan attacker.\nKip thought, if sub-red doesn’t work…\nStill moving erratically, still scanning, Kip began narrowing his eyes to\nchi. It occurred to him a little late that the last time he’d messed with chi,\nhe’d been blind for three days.\nToo late.\nThe thunderclap of a pistol fired at close range rocked Kip. He saw fire\ngush from a barrel sweeping right past his face, heard the snap of a lead\nball, and felt the concussive force flattening his cheek like a boxer’s punch.\nIn the barren, total focus that answers the sound of Death’s footfall, the\nworld faded. No sound. No people. There was only the pistol, floating in\nmidair held in a disembodied, gloved hand by the invisible killer. As the\npistol jumped, the Shadow’s shimmercloak rippled with the shock wave,\nmomentarily giving shape to the assassin.\nA black burning powder cloud raced hard on the musket ball’s heels.\nThe burning cloud stung Kip’s face as he fell. He’d not noticed his feet\ntangled, but he definitely saw a second pistol sliding into visibility as it\nemerged from the cover of the shimmercloak.\nAnother boom and then a clatter.\nKip hit the ground on his side and saw Ferkudi leaping through the air\nover him, trying to snatch the assassin, blue luxin and green forming great\njagged claws to make his arm span twice as wide.\nFerkudi caught nothing, though, his sweeping arms and luxin claws"

He landed on his chest with a thump and lost\nthe luxin, both claws breaking apart and beginning to disintegrate on the\nfloor.\nBig Leo followed hard on Ferkudi’s attack, flinging his chain out to its\nfull reach in a wide circle at waist height.\nThe last link caught the edge of the retreating Shadow’s cloak and threw\nit wide. The sudden glimpse of boots and trousers and belt where the rest of\nthe man was invisible gave the impression they were staring through a tear\nin reality. Disrupted by the blow, the magics in a section of the cloak sizzled\nout of sync with any colors in the room before settling again as the assassin\nspun out of reach.\nThen the cloak draped down again, covering him with its invisibility.\nAs Kip pulled himself together, deafened but unhurt, Big Leo pressed\nhis advantage against the assassin, charging after the Shadow like a hound\non the scent. His chain whipped out again, hitting nothing—\nBut there was a glimpse of boots as the assassin dove toward one wall.\nThis time, the whirling heavy chain came down with all the force in the\nwarrior’s mountainous body. It cracked the floor tiles and shot sparks, but\nhit no flesh—the Shadow was fast.\nPeople shrieked, cowering back in fear as Big Leo charged toward them.\nThe Shadow must be nearly among them. If Big Leo struck again, he was\ngoing to kill or maim more than one of the bystanders.\nBut Big Leo pulled up short, flicking out the end of the chain just short\nof the crowd, who were panicked now, pushing one another through the\nnearest door as if pushing a cork down into a wine bottle.\nWith the easy grace of a squad that’s worked together so long they act\nlike one body, Big Leo diverted the tornado of heavy chain for one instant\nas Ferkudi barreled past him.\nBig Leo couldn’t attack too close to the crowd. Ferkudi had no such\ncompunctions. Again, with arms and luxin spread and all of his\nconsiderable bulk at a full sprint, Ferkudi made a flying leap at the portion\nof the bunched crowd where he guessed the Shadow was.\nFerkudi’s tackle sent at least a dozen people flying—none of them the\nShadow, and he went down in a tangle with all of them.\nWhich only left one way the Shadow could have gone—right back in\nfront of the high table.\nKip saw Ben-hadad, wearing his knee brace but still hobbled by his\ninjury from when they’d fled the Chromeria, standing at the far end of the\nhigh table. He had his heavy crossbow loaded and aimed—right at the\ncrowd. But to shoot at the Shadow was to shoot at the crowd beyond it. The\nfrustration was writ all over his bespectacled face.\nBen, Kip knew, felt useless. That all his brilliance was for naught.\nCouldn’t fight. Couldn’t help his friends who were in mortal peril. Couldn’t\nshoot unless he got the perfect opportunity—which he couldn’t, with these\npanicked strangers everywhere."

He fired his bolt\nat nothing Kip could see—\n—and blew out the front of every one of the priceless wine jugs lined up\non the high table. They jetted rivers of wine onto the floor in front of the\nhigh table as if someone had opened spigots on all of them.\nThen, in orderly succession, they tumbled and exploded on the floor.\nThe wide wave of wine washed every which way. Then the wave parted\naround two barriers, momentarily indistinct, then surrounded and revealed.\nWine covered the floor everywhere, except in two, foot-shaped depressions.\nKip nearly unleashed the bolt of magical death he’d gathered in his right\nhand, until he saw the stunned face of Lady Proud Hart directly in the line\nof fire behind where the invisible Shadow was standing. The noblewoman\nwas still seated. Hadn’t moved from her place, frozen by shock.\nThen there was splashing as the Shadow realized he’d been discovered,\nand bolted.\nWine-wet footprints marked his passage, but Kip had it now.

Faint skeletons grinned at him everywhere through their flesh\nsuits. Metal in cold black and bones like pink shadows; all else was merely\ncolored fog.\nIn chi, though, the shimmercloak flared with weird energies, magic\nboiling off it in clouds like a sweaty horse steaming on a cold morning.\nThe Shadow stopped running, his shoes finally dry enough not to leave\nfootprints. He turned back into the middle of the room, checking that he\nwas unseen, skeletal hands pulling the folds of the cloak in place.\nKip kept moving his head, as if he, too, were blind.\nThe Shadow drew a short sword, but kept it tucked down, covered by his\ncloak. He walked toward Kip, secure in his invincibility.\nOrholam, he wasn’t giving up, even though they were all on alert now.\nKip couldn’t decide if it was overweening pride or terrifying\nprofessionalism that the man thought he could still pull this job off against\nthese odds.\nWaiting until the Shadow was close, Kip suddenly looked directly at\nhim. “You’ve a message for me,” Kip said. “What is it?”\nThe Shadow stopped as suddenly as if he’d been slapped. Kip could see\nthe man’s skull dip as he checked himself. No, no, I’m still invisible. It’s a\nbluff.\n“You’ve got a message,” Kip said.\nThe skeleton-man paused, as if he thought Kip was trying to fool him\ninto speaking and giving his position away. After a moment, he shook his\nhead slightly.\n“Ah,” Kip said, gazing straight where the man’s veiled eyes must be.\nThe air began humming with Kip’s gathering power. “Then you are the\nmessage.”\nThe Shadow twitched as he finally accepted that Kip really could see"

He lunged forward, stabbing—\nAnd Kip’s pent-up fury of tentacled-green and razored-blue death\nblasted into the assassin and threw him across the room.\nThe danger past, Kip released chi, and was immediately reminded why\nhe hated chi. Drafting chi was like riding a horse that kicked you every time\nyou got on, and every time you got off. In the face.\nKip fell to his knees, his eyes burning, lightning stabbing back into his\nhead, tears blinding him. He squeezed his eyes tight shut, but when he\nopened them, they were still locked in chi vision, people around the room\nshowing up only as dim shadows and skeletons and metal-bearers.\nChi was the worst.\nKip willed his eyes to open to their normal apertures, and mercifully,\nthey did. This time, thank Orholam, chi hadn’t stricken him blind.\nBig Leo materialized, standing over Kip, as Ferkudi went over to make\nsure the Shadow was dead. Ben-hadad and Cruxer limped over, leaning on\neach other, Cruxer looking better by the step.\nOnly Winsen hadn’t moved. He still perched on his table in the corner of\nthe room, an arrow still nocked, never having shot. He wasn’t usually shy\nabout shooting in questionable circumstances.\nFerkudi stood back up. The Shadow was, indeed, dead. Very dead. Gory,\ndon’t-look-at-that-mess-if-you-want-to-sleep-tonight dead.\nIt was a mistake.\nNot killing the man, but that he’d obliterated him: Kip had destroyed a\nshimmercloak.\nNo one reproved him. No one said he should have done better, as\nAndross Guile or Gavin Guile would have. Maybe they didn’t even think it.\nBut he did. He’d been out of control.\nIt was a reminder that he’d been drafting a lot. In its unfettered strength,\ngreen had taken him further than he wanted to go. If nothing else killed him\nfirst, it would be green that got him in the end. Indeed, he hadn’t looked at\nhis own eyes in a mirror in a while, fearing what the bloody glass would tell\nhim.\n“What the hell, Win?!” Big Leo demanded. “Where were you?”\nBut the lefty still stood silent, a bundle of arrows held with the bow in\nhis right hand for quick drawing, as if he didn’t even hear them.\nBig Leo blew out an exasperated breath, dismissing him. “And what the\nhell’s with you, Ferk? You say you smell cloves—and then shout Nine Kill\nNaught?”\n“My goof,” Ferkudi said as if he’d said he wanted wine with dinner but\nthen decided he’d really wanted beer. “Saffron. Not cloves. I meant I\nsmelled saffron. Paryl smells like saffron. Superviolet is cloves. Always get\nthose two mixed up.”\n“You confused saffron and cloves? They don’t smell anything alike!”\n“They’re both yummy.”\nBig Leo rubbed his face with a big hand. “Ferk, you are the dumbest\nsmart guy I know.”"

I\nsmelled saffron half an hour ago, out by the palace’s front doors. Didn’t\neven think about it. Breaker, my apologies.” He knuckled his forehead. “I\nthink it’s customary to offer my resignation?”\n“None of that,” Cruxer said. “This is none of your faults. It’s mine.\nYou’ve all been right. The Mighty’s too small. We’re spread too thin. And\nthat’s on me.” Kip had kept it secret that Teia was infiltrating the Order of\nthe Broken Eye, but he had mentioned that Karris was afraid the Order had\npeople even in the Blackguard itself, which had made Cruxer stop any talk\nof adding to the Mighty, fearing that whoever they welcomed in might be a\ntraitor.\n‘How can you be certain one of us isn’t with the Order already?’ Winsen\nhad asked. ‘I say we add people. Might as well get a few shifts’ rest while\nwe wait to get stabbed in the back.’\nAs if they weren’t already sometimes nervous about Winsen, what with\nhis alien gaze, total disregard for danger, and overeagerness to shoot.\n“You all did your part,” Cruxer continued. “And you all did your parts\nbrilliantly. I mean, except Winsen, who I think might be angling for a\nBlackguard name. What do you think of Dead Weight?”\nThe Mighty were all just starting to laugh, delighted, turning toward\nWinsen, when Kip saw something go cruel and hungry in the little man’s\neyes. Win had never taken mockery well.\nWin’s obsidian arrow point swept left as the archer drew the nocked\narrow fully, pointing straight at Cruxer, who was standing tall, flat-footed.\nThere was no time for him to evade. Win’s move was as fast as a man\nstepping in a hole while expecting solid ground. The bowstring came back\nto his lips in the swift kiss of a departing parent and then leapt away.\nHe couldn’t miss—\n—but he did.\nHe loosed another arrow and was drawing a third before the Mighty\ndove left and right. Kip was throwing a green shield in front of himself—I\nalways knew it would be Win. That saurian calm. That unnatural\ndetachment.\nBig Leo crushed Kip to the ground, disrupting his drafting and blotting\nout all vision as he offered his own body as a shield.\n“Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!” Winsen shouted. “Easy, Ferk! Ben! Easy, Ben!”\nKip unearthed himself from the living mountain that was Big Leo and\nsaw Winsen with bow lifted high in surrender.\nBen-hadad had his crossbow leveled at the archer, his fingers heavy on\nthe trigger plate.

He dropped\nthe arrows from his right hand to show he was no threat. “They often work\nin pairs.”\nThere was a clatter behind the Mighty. Metal hitting stone—not three\npaces behind them.\nWar-blinded by the threat in front of them, not one of them had looked\nback.

It’s what a family does.\nThe day they’d lost him had been the day everything went north for\nTeia. Karris had become the White. Zymun became Prism-elect.\nCommander Ironfist had been fired. Kip and the Mighty had nearly been\nkilled escaping, and Tremblefist had died silencing the cannons to save\nthem.\nTeia had stupidly decided to stay behind. She’d told herself she could do\nmore good here.\nDo good?! Mostly she’d learned to use her magic to murder slaves.\nShe wasn’t even good at her bad work.\nShe’d botched the assassination of Ironfist’s sister so badly that he’d\nimmediately figured out who’d sent her and who she was—Teia was the\nreason Ironfist had declared himself a king rather than a satrap.\nAnd now, in his revenge, the Chromeria had lost Paria.\nOut of the original seven satrapies, that left them with only two and a\nhalf: Abornea, Ruthgar, and half of Blood Forest.\nThe empire had been a seven-legged feast table; now it was a top-heavy\nend table teetering on two golden legs. The only question was which way it\nwould fall.\nBest for Teia to side with the Order, then. Kingdoms rise and empires\nfall, but the cockroaches survive.\nAnd that’s what this next kill for the Old Man meant, when Teia stripped\naway all her pretenses. It meant siding once and for all with the Order. Not\npretending anymore. No longer a double agent, an agent.\nShe arrived at Little Jasper’s back docks in the last minutes before dawn,\nfeeling as sere and barren inside as the wind-scoured Red Cliffs.\nHer father wouldn’t want her to buy his life at such a price, but Teia had\nworried for far too long what other people wanted.\nThough the Old Man hadn’t come right out and said it, Teia’s next kill\nwas Ironfist.\nTo guarantee her obedience, the Order held her father hostage. He would\nleave their company a rich man or not at all.\n‘This is the pain that will transform you into Teia Sharp,’ the Old Man\nhad said.\nMay Orholam—absent or blind or uncaring as He was—send that vile\nman and all the Order with him to the ninth hell.\nTeia didn’t know how or why, but Ironfist was either on that odd bone-\nwhite ship she spied coming into the dock now, or he waited wherever it\nwas sailing next.\nIt wasn’t ‘betrayal,’ technically. He’d declared himself a king. That\nmade him the traitor.\nAnd killing a traitor wasn’t wrong… Right?"

That\nmade him the traitor.\nAnd killing a traitor wasn’t wrong… Right?\nIronfist had been like a father to her, but in infiltrating the Blackguard\nfor the Order, he’d betrayed the man who was like a father to them all:\nsavant and savior, paterfamilias and Promachos, godlike Gavin Guile.\nIronfist had sworn loyalty to Gavin! He’d administered those very oaths\nto half the rest of the Blackguard! Before the blades come out, you have to\ndecide where you stand. King Ironfist had decided to stand for himself.\nHe’d thrown off his loyalty to Gavin, and now he must be trying to do the\nsame with the Order.\nWhy else would they be sending Teia to assassinate him? He was one of\ntheir own.\nHad been, anyway.\nNow Teia would be the shield that came down on his neck. Hers would\nbe the hand that brought his head to her masters.\nIt would hurt to kill Ironfist. But it wouldn’t break her. She was beyond\nthat now.\nInvisible in the master cloak, Teia made her way out onto the lonely\ndock. Cheerless dawn was threatening the horizon as sailors prepared the\nship in hushed tones. There was no harbormaster present, nor any of the\nusual dockhands or slaves or attendants Teia would have expected. It was a\nghost ship—fitting for the departing condemned.\nThree figures stood on the quay. One was hunched and swaddled as if ill,\nor perhaps to hide his height. The second was a broadly gesticulating man\nwith a wild, woolly beard with match cords woven into it and a gold-\nbrocaded jacket worn open over his bare chest, despite the chill of the\nmorning. The third figure had his back to Teia. There was something in his\ncarriage that spoke of being human freight, a slave about to be passed from\none man to another. Teia had seen that broken shuffle before; in truth, she’d\nwalked like that herself.\nSo she dismissed that one, flaring her eyes to paryl to look at the others\njust as the heavily cloaked man presented a sword.\nIts appearance hit her like a rapid blow to the nose, leaving her blinking:\nthat blade should have shone white in her paryl vision. Metal always did,\nwith minute variations of tone for different metals. This thing was invisible.\nNo, the shimmercloaks made things invisible—when you looked at an\nactive shimmercloak, you saw whatever lay beyond it. This was a bar of\nblack, heavy nothingness. Usually, darkness is a hole, an absence, as death\nis the absence of life.\nThis was a piece of hungry night, of darkness breathing.\nThis was more than Death, hammered and folded into killing shape. This\nwas not made by the hand of man. Perhaps in the youth of Old Man Time,\nsome dead demigod, after his descent to the all-devouring depths of the\nninth hell, had rallied instead of despaired at his imprisonment there.

A paryl marker, visible only to her, the sign\nthat this man was her target, hung in the air above the wretch she’d\ndismissed as a slave.\nHe couldn’t be—he wasn’t Ironfist.\nHe wasn’t Ironfist.\nEven from the back it was clear this man was too small. Broad across his\nhunched shoulders, square-jawed, but light-skinned and not tall enough.\nHair covered with a grubby hat. He was just some broken old warrior.\nAll the cold courage she’d been knotting tight loosed its tension from\nher limbs and she could suddenly breathe.\nShe didn’t have to kill Ironfist.\nSomething like a prayer of thanks made its way to her teeth. But there it\nstopped.\nWhy would the Old Man think I’d have a hard time killing some\nstranger?\nThe man a sailor had referred to as Captain Gunner whistled a\nmelodious little trill. “C’mon!” he said, waggling his bushy eyebrows at the\nslave. He had a winsome, goofy grin, but he struck Teia as not very stable,\nand very, very dangerous. “What’ll it be? Death or glory?”\nApparently, the poor bastard was being offered some kind of choice. Not\nmuch of one, though, since no matter what he did Teia was going to be\nkilling him afterward.\n“Let’s sail,” the slave said, straightening his stooped shoulders and\ntaking up the blade. Some spirit came back into him, and recognition\nclobbered Teia like a left hook to the neck. “Death and glory, Cap’n\nGunner,” said none other than Gavin Guile.\nThe Prism himself, Gavin Guile. The price for saving Teia’s father was\nthat she assassinate Emperor Gavin Fucking Guile.\nChapter 4\nThe young goddess strode barefoot through the hidden shipyards in a dress\nmostly faded to blue from the original bright murex purple it had been when\nthe White King had given it to her.

The words had been their own; the\nspeakers hadn’t intended such conformity. Surely here, among the new\npagans, odd magic was the norm. Wights of every color walked the streets.\nSix of the bane had been gathered in closer proximity than perhaps ever\nbefore in history. But this magic was different.\nAliviana, born Aliviana Danavis, now the goddess Ferrilux, passed the\nwights guarding the doors. The superviolet wights were the easiest of all:\nthey could belong to her in an instant, if she willed it. The dull, animalistic\nsub-reds were the most challenging for her; they goggled bestial eyes at all\nthose around them, as if everyone else had heard a tone to which they were\ndeaf. One of the burned freaks even stared at her, but couldn’t comprehend\nwhy Aliviana might be important.\nThe cadences and then the silence rippled through the petitioners in two\nslow waves before her, only to burst at the circle of the White King’s nine\nbodyguards, all formerly elite drafter-warriors who had made the leap\nhalfway to godhood and were now polychrome wights with black-luxin-\nedged vechevorals and ataghans and scorpions and flyssas and man\ncatchers, even in their weapons preferring the old and provincial to the\nmodern and universal.\nLiv’s superviolet luxin died where she touched those spears, as all magic\ndied when it touched living black luxin.\nThat these wights had such weapons told her that the White King had\nbeen experimenting with his black seed crystal. She wondered if he\nunderstood that he was playing with the most dangerous magic in all the\nworld, and something tightened uneasily in her stomach.\nAn emotion, perhaps.\nShe could dredge up a name for it from her memory, if she tried, but she\nsimply didn’t care to.\n“That’s far enough!” the White King boomed.\nAnd then everyone could see her, her will-crafting broken as if it were a\nspell. The people fell away from her, some literally so, tumbling over their\nneighbors in their astonishment and fear.\nWeapons came to wights’ hands, but not even the reds or sub-reds\nmoved to attack without the White King’s command.\nA superviolet will-crafting compels only one’s reason, as an orange hex-\ncrafting compels only one’s emotions, so anyone at all could have broken\nher webs with a shouted word.\nBut instead of noticing the artistry of her drafting that had allowed her to\nshift the vision of six hundred twenty-seven people and seventy-three\nwights, the people seemed impressed with their king instead.

As if he had\ncommanded her to be visible and she had no choice but to comply. As if it\nwere proof that his magic was greater.\nHer rage needed no help finding its name. It was quite well fixed to the\ncondescending, pompous polychrome wight who now stood before an ivory\nthrone.\nBorn Koios White Oak before a fire at his family’s mansion on Big\nJasper had robbed him of his good looks and humanity and illusions, the\nWhite King was an imposing figure, she could admit. To his burn-scarred\nflesh, he added luxin and hexes. He’d refined his control of both in the time\nshe’d been gone. He wore gold-edged white silk trousers of some flowing\ndesign that reminded her of something from an ancient woodcut, a fashion\nfrom the time of the nine kingdoms. He wore a matching tunic laced tight\nover his thin body with gold cords, with knots at ritual intervals. Rather\nthan looking ruddy or pallid or freckled from his Forester heritage, his skin\nwas now white as the noonday sun. His many and grotesque lumpy burn\nscars were somehow invisible, whether by the arts of cosmetics or will-\ncrafting. She doubted he’d actually been healed; the White King was all\nabout appearances, not changing underlying realities. His eyelids were\nkohled black so as to accentuate their many colors, and his ivory skin was\nstudded with glued-on jewels and protruding luxin.\n“You look well, Koios,” Aliviana said. “It seems I’m not the only one\nwho’s changed since you sent me away with an assassin whom you ordered\nto either murder me or chain me up like your other pet djinn.”\n“Daughter! Our new Ferrilux!” the White King said. “You speak like\none who has become the goddess of pride indeed! You have blossomed into\nall I had hoped you might be, with a little additional cheek thrown in for\ngood measure.”\nHe chuckled, and his people seemed to take that as a sign that it was safe\nto laugh, and they did.\nIt was an odd sound, laughter; one she had neither made nor heard for a\nyear, twelve days and twenty hours, seven seconds. Only after it was gone\ndid Aliviana think that she should have been listening to the messages that\nlaughter carried. Was it the laughter of a people afraid of their king, or of\npeople in awe of and in love with him?\nToo late.\nThe unfamiliar emotional freight had gone unweighed, and her memory\ncould no more call it back to take its measure than one could call back an\ninsult carelessly offered.\n“May I have a word? In private?” she asked.\nHer jaw strained suddenly against her effort to open it. Don’t grovel,\nBeliol hissed.\nNo one else could hear him. Careful not to let her irritation show on her\nface, she slammed the thought down and even triggered her zygomatic\nmajor muscle. From this distance, the White King might take it for a\npleasant smile. “Please,” she added.\nChapter 5\n“Another nightmare?” Tisis asked. “You think the assassination attempt…?”"

He’d\nleft his side sweat-damp.\n“I’d kind of hoped…” Tisis’s sigh echoed his own. He could tell she’d\nbeen up for a while, meeting with her spies or something. She’d even\nselected clothes for him. She thought he slept too little, and tried to protect\nhim.\n“How’d I ever find you?” he asked her.\n“The first time, I was sabotaging your initiation. I think the second was\nwhen I was jerking off your grandfather.”\n“Honey, I didn’t mean—”\n“Just so you know, in case you ever thought I might make comparisons,\nyou are—”\n“No, let’s not!” Kip said.\nTisis was not a disinterested party when it came to discussing these\nparticular dreams. Dreams of Andross Guile.\n“Should I summon the attendants?” Tisis already had the small bell in\nhand, a sign that he was already late.\nHe held out a staying hand. “Can I tell you something? Something\nbizarre?”\nOf course he could, but she didn’t put down the bell.\n“I dreamed of him as a young man. He’s going to woo a bride and trying\nto save the Guile family as he does so, and he doesn’t even realize—for all\nhis smarts—that he’s broken, utterly broken by his own brother’s recent\ndeath.” He paused.\n“So far… not that bizarre,” Tisis said. Her own lack of sleep was making\nher shorter with him than usual.\nKip looked down at the Turtle-Bear tattoo on the inside of his wrist. The\ninks or luxins that made the colors were all still vibrant from the Battle of\nGreenwall a few days before; it would fade, in time. He’d been using every\ncolor of luxin recently. The wick of his life was burning fast. Maybe that\nhad something to do with the dreams.\n“They’re not dreams, exactly,” Kip said. “I think they’re dreams of a\ncard.”\n“But you forget most of what you see when you wake. Exactly like a\ndream.”\n“Well, yes. I didn’t say it wasn’t a dream at all. Just that it’s a dream of a\ncard.”\n“You said you’d never touched the full Andross Guile card. That he was\ntoo clever to allow all of his experiences to be captured.”\nHe had said that. Janus Borig had convinced Kip’s grandfather to let her\ndo two very partial cards, stubs, that showed only particular scenes, similar\nto what an untalented Mirror could make, or what a good Mirror would\nmake of an item. The card needn’t show the maker of that item’s entire life\nstory; the card’s focus would be limited to the item itself. Kip had only\ntouched a stub card. So he thought. “And I believed it fully to be true,” Kip\nsaid. “But these dreams…”\n“Nightmares,” she said. “And, as they’re of that creature, it’s fitting that\nyour dreams are twisted.

And considering everything you need to do—yesterday—it’s a\ndistraction, too.” Tisis rang the bell to summon the servants more loudly\nthan necessary. “You’re going to be late,” she said.\nAnd then she was gone.\nShe wasn’t really mad at him, he knew. She’d apologize for this tonight.\nThey were all of them adjusting to the burdens of their new, magnified\npositions and the quagmire they’d stepped into. Tisis was trying to take care\nof Kip as well as everything else—first, even—and it must seem to her that\nhe wasn’t even trying to help her help him. He was spending precious\nminutes talking about dreams while he was late to a council of war?\nBut he hadn’t even told her the worst part, the thing out of all the\nlandscape of impossibilities that had actually struck him as bizarre before\nhe even woke. The young Andross Guile that Kip had seen from the inside\nduring his dream? Kip had sort of liked him.\n“No need to cry, Your High and Mighty, I’m here,” Winsen said.\nKip looked up, surprised. He hadn’t even heard the door open.\nWinsen. Why did it have to be Winsen?\nKip wasn’t crying, anyway. Just feeling morose. Not that he expected\nWinsen to understand fine gradations of emotions.\n“Where are the servants?” Kip asked.\n“I asked them to step out so I could assassinate you,” Winsen said.\n“You’re not gonna let that go, are you?” Kip thought he only thought it,\nbut it slipped out. Damn, just when he thought he was getting better at\ngoverning his tongue, Kip the Lip showed up again.\n“Let it go?” Winsen said. “You all looked at me like I was really gonna\nkill you. Except Ferk. But that’s only because he’s too dumb. I think he was\njust running over to give me a lecture on weapon safety.”\n“You know,” Kip said, rubbing his eyes, “I kind of hate you sometimes.”\n“Yeah, but you hate me less than anyone else does.”\nFor a moment, Kip was stunned to silence by the near compliment.\n“And the feeling’s mutual!” Win said, as if to save them from having a\nmoment. “You all done with your beauty rest, princess? Can we go now—\nyou know, to that meeting you ordered us all to be at a half hour ago?\nCruxer’s been shittin’ cobbles.”\n“Thank you for that,” Kip said.\nWinsen grunted, as if straining to pass a cobblestone.\nKip was a stone."

Tisis and I had a long conversation on why I do actually need to\ndress like… you know, the rich and careful way I’ve been dressing—so as\nto encourage people not to see me as overly young or sloppy or a\nbarbarian.”\nToo late, Kip realized that Winsen was not the person Kip wanted to\nrecount any more of that conversation with.\n“Hey, don’t look at me,” Winsen said. “I totally understand why you\nspend a Blackguard’s yearly wages on a single set of clothes. I’d do it\nmyself if I’d been paid in the last six months. Or, you know, ever.”\nKip rang the summons bell again, louder.\n“I understand your need to project yourself at a certain standard,”\nWinsen said, as if offended. He lowered his voice momentarily. “And how\nmuch work it takes to try to make you look good. And I know Cruxer’s\nirritated at waiting, so I sent your servants on ahead of us.”\n“Oh gods,” Kip said. “You’re not gonna have the servants primp me in\nfront of the Mighty!” Being naked in front of the Mighty was nothing. But\nbeing bathed (by strangers!), and tweezed, and picked at, and salved, and\nmassaged, and having strangers chatter things like, ‘Should we emphasize\nor de-emphasize the surprising and obvious power of his buttocks?’\nTorture.\nWinsen said, “Me? And embarrass you like that? Your Grace, I am\nshocked!”\nChapter 6\nHope leaped in Teia like a gazelle from a lion’s grip.\nGavin Guile is alive! And he’s here!\nThat had to mean that the man with the Hellfang blade was the Old Man\nof the Desert himself—for who else would the Old Man trust with such a\nweapon or such a prisoner?\nAnd if that was the Old Man, Teia could follow him from here now and\nfind his lair and his real identity and report to Karris and maybe even find\nword of where her father was—\nBut lose Gavin. The former Prism had already boarded the Golden Mean\nwith Captain Gunner.

That meant those Blackguards were here not\nfor him but for her.\nThey were here in case she decided to disobey and not board the ship.\nWhich meant they must be sub-reds. The Old Man trusted no one,\nespecially not his well-nigh-invisible assassins. He was not a man—or\nwoman perhaps, Teia still couldn’t assume—who would hone a blade to\nrazor sharpness and then let it cut his own throat.\nTeia’s heart sank like a panting gazelle into the lion’s patient paws.\nThe Order didn’t know it, but she could defeat sub-red with a\nsufficiently dense cloud of paryl now. But it was a blustery morning, and a\ngust of wind would be the death of her.\nIt would be a huge gamble to try to make it past the traitor Blackguards\nwithout being seen.\nAnd Gavin would be lost to the wide sea and whatever desperate\nmission the Old Man was sending him on. If Teia did make it past these\nBlackguards, how long would it take her to reach Karris? How long to get\nher alone so Teia could report the truth?\nHow could Karris mobilize skimmers without breaking Teia’s cover?\nThere were other Blackguard traitors than these two, Teia knew.\nWhat contingency plans did the Old Man have ready, just in case Gavin\nwere rescued?\nHe wouldn’t let him be taken alive, would he? No. Gavin had seen him,\nheard his voice.\nThere had to be a course here where Teia did everything right and\nsomehow averted disaster, but she was paralyzed.

Her thoughts of defiance had lasted less than two\nminutes.\nGavin Guile was amidships. The captain was removing his chains.\nTeia shuddered with a slave’s visceral revulsion at the fetters. She eyed\nhis wrists, looking for sores as instinctively as another woman might check\na man’s fingers for a wedding band. There were none.\nWherever Gavin Guile had been held, he hadn’t been chained. The other\npossibility—that he might not have fought his chains—was unthinkable.\nEveryone fights the chains. Most, like Teia, gave up after a few cuts. When\nyour own mother puts you in chains, you think maybe you deserve them.\nTo her shame, Teia didn’t even have scars on her wrists.\nBut thinking of that called to mind Ironfist in that terrible room, over the\npooled blood of his sister, whom Teia’d just killed. Ironfist, tearing his\nchains out of the wall in his rage and agony. But even he hadn’t broken his\nchains, had he?\nNo one breaks the chains, T. You can only ask to be let out nicely.

Hide\nlike she was supposed to do until they were far out to sea. Obey. It was a\nstrain to stay invisible for so long, to be so open and sensitive to the light,\nwhich was only swelling by the minute as the sun fingered the horizon. But\nshe couldn’t pull herself away.\nThe Prism had always been the height of majesty, of virility, potency.\nShe’d heard other Blackguards say in hushed tones, ‘Whatever else we do,\nwhatever happens, we were Blackguards in the time of Gavin Guile.’ Here\nwas a man who was emperor who actually deserved it.\nSeeing Zymun get ready to step into his place had made Teia sharply\naware of how rare that was. Gavin made you believe in the Great Chain of\nBeing; that some humans really were one step below Orholam, that they\nwere surely made of fundamentally different stuff than you were.\nThe man before her threatened to give the lie to all that. Haggard,\npathetic, ill, in sloppy clothes over a body with dirt so caked on that it\nseemed a washing would foul the water without cleansing the man. He must\nhave lost as much weight as Kip had in Kip’s time at the Chromeria, but\nGavin hadn’t had the weight to lose.\nBut she saw a glimpse of the old Gavin Guile charisma like a glint of\nsunlight off a distant lighthouse as he shook his head at some comment\nCaptain Gunner had just made and gave a lopsided grin. “‘Good furred\nmuffins’? Orholam’s saggy nipples, man, never change,” Gavin said to\nGunner.\nThe grin—that quintessential Guile grin that Teia knew so well from his\nson—exposed a missing dogtooth. That hadn’t been gone before his\nimprisonment. It made Teia touch her own, still sore even after Karris’s own\nchirurgeon’s ministrations.\nNor had his eye been missing before. Gavin now wore a patch on his left\neye with an unsettling black jewel in it. Gunner was just relieving him of\nthe black sword, carefully wrapping it in cloths and handing it off to a\nnervous sailor to take below.\n“Speaking of change, you need to,” Gunner said. “No, no, you know I\nhain’t religious. I mean, I give my ’spects to the Nine Ladies and the sea\nwitches and keep my friendly spat with Ceres”—he spat into the water\n—“ya shriveled, sandy old cunt—and naturally, I tip a bowl for Borealis\nand Arcturus and the Bitch o’ Storms, but that’s just salt sense for a man of\nmy avocation.

Only thing worse ’n a stanky sailor’s a\nstanky prince.”\n“Technically, I’m an emperor,” Gavin said.\n“So two things worse. Anyhoo, as our mutual fiend there in the\nwrappings wants this pale little gold beauty back on the waves two bells\npast. But there’s a way to do things when gettin’ a ship shipshape, things to\ncheck. Crew to kick in the pucker. So get yourself clean afore you come\nbelowdecks. My new girl deserves the best. I’ll have a man bring you fresh\nclothes.”\n“These are actually new. Generous guy. Gave me new clothes in\naddition to the starvation and imprisonment and the black eye. I—”\nCaptain Gunner gave him a flat, dangerous look. “They’ve got a miasma\nabout ’em. Bad luck. You fold ’em nice and leave them on the dock. Five\nminutes.”\nGavin nodded agreeably, but Teia could see gears turning in his head,\nquick as Kip: So I’m being put in my place. Fair enough… Captain. He\nmumbled, “Was a joke. Little joke. Black eye. Never mind.”\n“Tolerable sailors, this lot. All Order folk, though,” Captain Gunner said,\nlooking at the men and women scurrying about at their tasks.\n“Oh, good. Now I feel better about consigning them to certain death,”\nGavin said. “I’ll clean up before I come below.”\n“End don’t try en’ run.”\n“Running’s not in my cards, I’m afraid,” Gavin said with some forced\ngood humor.\nIndeed, the man looked like he could barely stand. But as Captain\nGunner departed, Gavin Guile climbed up the stairs of the sterncastle and\naccepted a bucket and sponge.\nTeia watched him invisibly. She should go belowdecks, out of the way\nof rushing sailors. She was invisible, not incorporeal, and her presence was\nsupposed to be a secret at least until they were on their way. But she\ncouldn’t bear to be shut in with her self-loathing just yet.\nNo wonder the Old Man hadn’t told her who her target was. If he’d had\neven a sliver of a doubt about her loyalty, he couldn’t tell her. And no\nwonder he’d thought it would be a painful kill for her: it wasn’t that he\nthought she had any special personal connection with Gavin Guile; it was\nthat she was a Blackguard. Her whole life, her entire calling, was dedicated\nto protecting the Prism. She had only ever wanted to be a Blackguard, and\nthis murder asked her to betray the very essence of that.\nThat was the pain that would make her a Sharp. Teia Sharp.\nBut Gavin Guile wasn’t merely a Prism, was he? Not merely a\nfigurehead emperor, or even a good man. He was Kip’s father. Karris’s\nhusband. To the Blackguards who still searched the seas and the Seven\nSatrapies for him, he had earned the Name ‘Promachos,’ ‘The One Who\nGoes Before Us to Fight.’ The image it evoked was the point of the spear,"

Gavin Guile is a man who shakes history.\nBut my father…\nSailors were scurrying around, double-checking knots before Cap’n\nGunner arrived to see that they’d done everything right. She dodged\nthrough the rushing men and made it up the sterncastle ladder.\nGavin was wasting no time. He’d stripped naked and was scrubbing\nvigorously at his arms and chest, rubbing his skin ruddy and flinging water\nabout.\nTeia realized she wasn’t embarrassed by his nudity. Perhaps it was\nbecause he looked sick, faded so far from his former sun-hot glory that she\nfelt only pity. Perhaps it was because she, not yet eighteen years old and\nstill never having lain with a man, had seen so many people naked now in\nusing paryl constantly that nudity simply didn’t mean anything to her.\nPerhaps it was because she had to kill him, and you couldn’t let a target be\nfully human. A target was meat and blood and breath to be stilled, not a\nfather, not a lover, not a leader you’d adored.\nA year ago, she would have been embarrassed, regardless.\nShe’d been different then. Better.\n“Grab me that razor?” Gavin said. “This beard.”\nTeia looked around the sterncastle to see who he was talking to. There\nwas no one here. The nearby sailors had all disappeared.\nGavin said, “I’m ragged and beaten and half-blind and melancholy and\nexhausted, but I’m not deaf.”\nTeia had been damn near silent.\n“And you stepped in a water drop,” Gavin admitted. He smirked, as if he\nknew his life was in danger but he just didn’t care. “Which shimmercloak is\nthat?”\n“The fox,” Teia said, defeated. “How would—”\n“The fox? That’s the one burnt all to hell. That means you’re new. And\nshort. Woman, by your voice. Who are you working for?”\n“I’ve been sent to kill you,” Teia said. “I mean, after you do whatever\nyou’ve agreed to do.”\n“The Order itself, then?” Gavin asked, still scrubbing his face and neck.\nHe barely moved his mouth, didn’t look toward her, and spoke in a near\nmumble to keep his voice from carrying. Not a dumb man, Gavin Guile.\n“There is, after all, more than one group that would like me dead. Though\nseveral of them might hire the Order, I suppose…”\n“I work for the Order itself. Everyone else thinks you’re already dead,\nso far as I know.”\nTeia wasn’t sure why she said that. She worked for the Order? No, she\nstill hadn’t decided, right? Why didn’t she say she worked for the\nChromeria first, a lie to give him hope? He looked like he could use some.\n“It’s enough to make you wonder, isn’t it?” Gavin said, picking up the\nrazor and starting to shave. He didn’t seem to even consider using the little"

What’s next?”\n“It is kinda shitty,” Teia admitted.\n“So. Deep cover or doubting convert?” Gavin asked.\n“What? Why would you ask that?”\n“Because we’re talking.” He tested the smoothness of his cheeks with a\nhand, then set down the razor, farther out of reach than necessary. “If you\nwere fully theirs, there’d be no need for you to approach me in the few\nminutes before we sail when you can still change your mind. Less than a\nfew minutes, now. You have a decision to make. It’s hard to go against the\nOrder, after you’ve seen what they do.” He scrubbed an armpit and smelled\nthe sponge afterward. Wrinkled his nose, coughed.\n“Deep cover,” she said. Why was it so hard to let him know that?\n“Very deep, if you’d kill the Prism to maintain it.”\n“You think I’ve already decided,” she said, piqued.\n“Adrasteia!” he whispered, triumphantly. “Kip’s Blackguard partner.\nKnew I’d heard that voice before.”\nShe didn’t think that before now she’d spoken two sentences in front of\nGavin Guile, and he remembered her voice? Dammit. The man was a\nlegend for a reason.\n“They have my dad,” she said. Wasn’t sure why she said that, either.\nIt had been so long since she’d had anyone to talk to at all. Karris was\nthe nearest thing, and Karris was her commander. A friendly commander\nwas still not quite a friend. Not in these times.\nOr maybe there was a reason so many had given their confessions to this\nman.\n“Ah,” Gavin said, getting it. He scrubbed his other armpit. “So those\ngoons guarding the passage back into the Chromeria are sub-reds, then. To\nmake sure you go.”\n“I can drop them,” Teia said. “Probably.”\n“All four?” he asked, amused.\nFour? She’d only seen two. “Two before the others attack…?” It came\nout with a silent ‘maybe’ on the end, which she hated.\nAnd I’m in deep cover. You’d think I’d be a better liar.\n“And then everyone on this ship joins the fight,” Gavin said. “Not on our\nside, in case you were getting your hopes up.”\n“What if we jump off at the last moment? Takes a while to turn a ship\naround… even if a few jump off and swim to pursue, we’d have a good\nhead start.” It was desperation talking, though.\nGavin didn’t answer. He looked toward the rising sun. He was trembling\nmerely from the effort of scrubbing his legs. A running leap from the ship,\npast how many people?\nHe couldn’t even run. Certainly couldn’t fight.\n“What if—what if I had another cloak? Could you…?” Gavin Guile had\nonce been able to do everything anyone else could do with drafting. Maybe"

Try to carry him and keep him invisible,\nthen fight four men by herself? Four men with muskets?\n“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Gavin Guile said, looking at the sunrise. “I can’t\nsee the colors.

I never really bothered with paryl. They all said it was useless,\nand it always hurt my eyes when I tried to play with it. Of course, I didn’t\nknow it had any real use. Now… Shimmercloaks. Magic swords. It’s like\nI’ve lived long enough to see all my childhood stories come to life. Just\nneed a dragon now.” He paused. “On second thought, no dragons. I think\nwe’re fine without dragons.”\nHe pulled on his new trousers. Threw on the loose tunic. “Tell Karris I\nlive. Tell her… tell her to give me twelve months before she marries some\nother lucky bastard. I’ll either be back by then or I won’t be back ever. And\nyou, go save your dad.”\n“I can’t,” Teia said. “He’s hidden. I’ve got no way to find him. All the\nOrder’s cells are kept separ—”\nThey were interrupted by Captain Gunner coming up to the waist of the\nship from belowdecks.\n“It’s just a matter of will, Adrasteia,” Gavin said. “You grab the one\nthread your fingers can reach, and you pull until the whole cloth unravels.”\n“It’s not that simple. They’re—”\n“And if you can’t save your father, then you poison the well. You rip\nthem out by the root. And every time your heart inclines to mercy, if you\nlove your father, you remember whatever tiny shred of devotion you hold\ntoward that poor man, and you make sure they don’t steal and murder any\nother little girl’s father ever again.”\nShe trembled with sudden rage that he would question her love.

Her feet were going to strike the\ndock’s side just short of the front edge.\nShe lifted her feet, tucking her knees as if in a deep squat, and barely\ncleared the gap, but the position left her nothing to absorb the shock of\nlanding. She tumbled head over heels, barely having the wherewithal to\nswirl the cloak and cloud back over her body as she stopped.\nOne of the Order sailors lifting the plank paused, staring right at where\nshe was. He lifted a hand to shade his eyes, and Teia saw that she had\njumped right between him and the rising sun—which was either brilliant or\nthe worst possible thing she could have done. Any part of her that had been\nexposed would have thrown a shadow over his face. On the other hand, he\nwas now looking directly into the rising sun.\nThe sailor on the other side of the heavy plank looked over at the man,\npeeved he’d stopped. “You fookin’ gonna help me stow this fookin’ thing,\nya beaver shite eater?”\nThe man cast his eye around the dock again, puzzled, but then he said,\n“Man can’t appreciate a sunrise for two fookin’ heartbeats? You and your\ndysent’ry gams, foulin’ a liminal moment.”\n“It’ll be a subliminal moment if you don’t start helping, because I’mma\nknock you the fook out.”\n“Take one deep breath through that poo pincher disfiguring your gob for\na moment, won’tcha? It’s a sunrise.”"

If she’d been faithful to dad,\nyou’d not be here. And I weren’t talking about that kind of soul, not that\nyou’d be familiar…”\nTeia lost the rest as another man came to the rail with a long pole to push\nthe ship away from the dock far enough for the slaves belowdecks to get\ntheir oars out.\nShe watched as the gap between her and obedience grew until it was\nunbridgeable.\nShe was committed.\nThe Old Man’s command had been the kind of ultimatum on which a\nwhole world turns: murder Gavin and become fully one of us and be given\nall you could want or hope for, or else.\nI choose ‘or else.’\nFor no reason that Teia could understand, for no reason that made any\nsense at all, her heart suddenly soared.\nShe’d failed in her every single attempt against the Order so far. But she\nwould not fail again.\nShe straightened her back and drew her powers about her. As far as the\nOld Man knew, she was gone for at least a month and a half, if not twice\nthat.\nThe Order didn’t have their own skimmers yet, so that meant six weeks\nat least before anyone could return with word of her absence—and\ntherefore, her disobedience.\nShe couldn’t tell the commander or even her friends that she lived, lest\nsomeone betray her, or let it slip to someone who would. So she must\nbecome a ghost, moving invisibly through the world of men, leaving\nnothing but terror and death.\nIn commissioning Teia to infiltrate the Order of the Broken Eye, Karris\nhad wanted her to destroy the Order utterly, so they wouldn’t be able to\nenslave and blackmail and murder ever again. Teia had always understood\nher mission was necessary, but now it was personal.\nShe had six weeks.\nSix weeks to find someone in the Order of the Broken Eye, to follow\nthat thread to the leadership, and that would lead her to what she needed:\ntheir papers. Even if one leader could memorize a list of all the secret\nmembers of the Order, his underlings couldn’t be expected to. Codes had to\nchange and adjustments be made. On top of that, there would be deeds and\ntitles, lists of properties owned and the places they met. The membership\nlists would go to Karris so she could round up people for hanging or to go\non Orholam’s Glare. But the papers would also give Teia places to search\nand Braxian cultists to interview—or torture, if necessary—to tell her where\nher father was being held.\nSix weeks to find her father and free him.

But against\nthese people? She felt something gloriously strong and ugly and beautiful\nrising in her heart, easing the worry on her brow, and turning her mouth to a\nsmile.\nThe Order had made her. They were about to learn how well.\nOne of those masked Blackguards who’d saluted the Old Man of the\nDesert had moved with a bit of a limp. That was her thread to pull.\nLet the haunting begin.\nChapter 7\n“On the one hand, I couldn’t be more horrified,” Tisis Guile said, looking\nout the window in a flowing red summer dress accented with a vibrant\ngreen that perfectly matched the emerald luxin in her eyes.\nThe moment she’d stepped through the living white-oak doorway of the\nPalace of the Divines two days ago, Tisis had assumed the wardrobe of\nyoung royalty and a mien of measured grace and slow eloquence like a\nfavorite pair of old boots. Strangely, the guise had endured without wrinkle\nor rumple, her cadences and tones and even accent seamless over the long,\nfull days of affectation since they’d arrived.\nIt had taken Kip several days to realize the persona wasn’t a pretense.\nThough Tisis absolutely was trying to impress both the nobility and the\nservants, this was no false face. She had grown up in the corridors of power\nin Rath and Green Haven and the Chromeria, and only at the last had she\nhad her retinue forcibly limited by Andross Guile.\nFar from being a façade, for the first time, Kip was seeing his wife in the\nfull flower of her natural environment.\nThank Orholam he’d first seen her at her weakest. She’d intimidated the\nhell out of him then, when she’d been vulnerable, isolated, uncertain.\n“On the other hand,” she said, letting the curtain fall, “I couldn’t be\nprouder.”\nFor this one thing, thank you, Grandpa Guile. You did me a good turn\nwhen—well, when you pretty much forced this stunning woman to marry\nme and made her think it was her own idea.\nKip was really going to have to tell her about that someday.\nShe noticed his smile slip, but before she could ask anything, Kip said,\n“Huh? What?”\nHe’d been staring at decrees and reports and budgets for so long he was\ndrifting. She was horrified about something? Proud?\n“What’s going on?” Big Leo asked Tisis, gesturing outside. “Something\nwrong out there with the queue?”\nAfter word had gotten out about Kip’s magical restorations to Túsaíonn\nDomhan, everyone wanted to see the masterpiece ceiling functioning as it\nhad been intended, so Kip had simply said whoever wanted to see it could.\nThat was how he and Tisis ended up sleeping in nondescript guest\nchambers: his permission had been taken as an order, and now there was a\nconstant line out the door, out the Palace of the Divines, down the steps,\nand into the square below. People who had far better things to do in this\nwracked and wretched city were instead waiting hour upon hour to see"

People who had far better things to do in this\nwracked and wretched city were instead waiting hour upon hour to see\nKip’s handiwork, even sleeping in line, watched by attentive guards. He and\nTisis decided to move to another room rather than expel those who’d waited\nso long at the end of every day.\n“Come see,” Tisis said, not to Kip, though.\nThe Mighty crowded around the windows, peeking carefully. Except for\nWinsen, who, with his typical subtlety, pulled the curtain fully back to stare\ndown into the courtyard.\nAll of them were bored. Kip couldn’t blame them. While they all waited\nfor their only paryl drafter to finish her quiet scans of the room, with her\neyes midnight orbs against her true black skin, Kip had things to do. The\nrest of them didn’t.\nThough Kip had never thought of him as the devious sort, Cruxer had\nbeen the one to initiate room searches. As it turned out, several other\nchambers in a row that had been provided for the Mighty’s meetings had\nbeen riddled with spy holes.\nIt wasn’t the only way Kip and his Nightbringers, outwardly hailed as\nliberators, had been passively resisted, and carefully made to feel\nunwelcome. The Divines were either not half as clever as they thought, or\nthey believed themselves to be untouchable. Kip hoped they weren’t stupid,\nbut they were treating him like he was, and it was a burr under his saddle.\nRegardless, until the woman finished her paryl scans, the Mighty\ncouldn’t talk strategy.\nKip hadn’t appreciated how good Teia was at drafting paryl until Súil\nhad given him a basis for comparison. She was nice, but she needed breaks\nevery few minutes, and even when she was working, she was slow.\nHe considered taking over the scanning himself, but that would shame\nher. It would also reveal more of the full extent of his abilities to any spies\nwho might be watching.\nThe Mighty missed Teia for a dozen reasons, but her speed was one\nthey’d mentioned repeatedly. Kip had agreed with them but offered no\nmore, telling them only that Karris had needed Teia. Paryl’s ability to see\nthrough clothing for hidden weapons was so useful for a Blackguard that\nKip hadn’t needed to lie to them about Teia’s real work hunting the Order—\nthat had felt like a secret that wasn’t his to give away and one too dangerous\nto share.\nBut the Mighty had brought up Teia’s absence more as they realized how\nimportant it was to trust your paryl drafter absolutely. In fraught times, how\ndo you trust a stranger who can kill you without leaving any evidence,\nwhose powers can’t be detected or countered except by someone who\nshares them?\nNo wonder paryl drafters had so often been hunted down throughout\nhistory, their arts no longer taught, but instead buried and for the most part\nhappily forgotten.\nBut the biggest problem with having Súil around was that it made him\nmiss Teia. And all that didn’t bear thinking about.\nKip had been lucky last night. The Mighty stopping two Shadows? How\ndid that happen, really?

The Mighty were good, but… the Shadows must\nhave been inexperienced or lazy, underprepared, undisciplined. Would the\nOld Man of the Desert really spend two Shadows to send a message? Kip\nhad said that, but it had been bravado.\nYou can’t admit that all of your best people together barely stopped two\nof the enemy, and only because they’d been incredibly lucky. So was it\nluck, or was the Old Man telling Kip he could kill him that easily, or…\nwhat was the alternative? Divine intervention?\nKip only wished he could believe that.\nIf it were a message, though, what was the message?\nThis whole city was starting to infuriate him. Not just the attempted\neavesdropping. The passive resistance. The bureaucracy. ‘That’s not the\nway we do…’ ‘Ancient tradition dictates…’ ‘The people will be mortally\noffended, but if my lord wills it…’ ‘The priests are being summoned for a\ngrand council to vote to allow just that, my lord, but so many of them are\nold, it’s taken longer than expected. Doubtless they’ll meet today. But I’m\nafraid if you preempt their authority…’\nBut there were things only he could do, and that he could only do if he\nstayed. Things only Kip cared enough to do. Things only he could get away\nwith. That wasn’t even counting the things he should do that he could do\nbetter than anyone else. Worse, he didn’t know who he could trust enough\nto leave in charge.\nThe longer he stayed, the more fighters flocked to his banners and the\nbetter the intelligence he received. More time also meant more resources he\ncould gather for his army.\nBut the longer he stayed, the more time he gave the White King to learn\nwhat Kip had accomplished and move to counter what he would do next.\nHe was going to go full Andross Guile on those old bastards.\nHe looked at the papers stacked on his desk. A year’s worth of\ncommitments and decisions.\nTwo more days. I can give it two days. What can I accomplish in two\nmore days? Enough?\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said beside Tisis at the window, “there’s a crowd.”\n“So? There was a crowd yesterday.” Kip started sorting the stacks into\nwhat he could possibly hope to do in two days.\n“I went out there this morning again,” Cruxer said. “I recognized some\nof them. Same people. They’re not leaving after they see the ceiling.”\n“They want to wait in the queue to see it again, that’s their business,”\nKip said.\n“They aren’t in the queue,” Cruxer said, troubled. “Yesterday they came\ncurious. They left exultant. Today they’re… expectant?”\n“I think they’re hoping to make you king,” Tisis said quietly.\n“Uh-huh,” Kip said, not looking up. “Too much to do today, sorry,” he\nsaid.\nHe would meet with the merchant in the next two days. Definitely. His\nquestion was, how much of a fight did he put up over these shortages? Of\ncourse the discrepancies were never ‘surpluses,’ but he couldn’t be certain"

Of\ncourse the discrepancies were never ‘surpluses,’ but he couldn’t be certain\nwhose fingers had lightened the shipments. Men on his side, or on the\nmerchant’s, or the merchant himself, swindling Kip? Contracts with\n‘neutral’ traders were the worst, especially this asshole Marco Vellera.\nKip was pretty sure Marco Vellera was actually Benetto-Bastien\nBonbiolo, one of the four Ilytian pirate kings. Or three kings and a queen at\nthe moment, technically—there was a rumor that a king had been on the\nGargantua when Gavin and Kip sank it. They still called them kings,\nthough; apparently ‘the Ilytian pirate monarchs’ didn’t have the same ring\nto it. Kip’s problem was that Vellera was undoubtedly not selling supplies\nonly to him but also to Koios, and to Satrap Briun Willow Bough as well.\nHe hated that, but there was no recourse for it. If you started seizing\nmerchants’ caravans, you bankrupted the merchants. Bankrupt more than\none, and the reasonable ones stop coming, leaving you to deal with the\ngreedy who’ll gouge you, or the desperate who might steal from you\noutright; you end up paying with one kind of coin or another.\nSo far, Kip thought his own performance as a leader was decidedly\nlacking. He couldn’t win every game like Andross Guile, and he couldn’t\nbreak every game like Gavin Guile, so he was forced to do his best to\nrebound a loss from one game (the financial war) into a win in another (the\nshooting war).\nBlubber bounces back, boys.\nKip was first on Marco Vellera’s trade route, so he was surreptitiously\nbuying up the supplies he guessed the White King needed most.\nFinding the coin to do all these things was what half the stacks of papers\non the tables were all about. It involved a lot of bending the truth to a lot of\nvery concerned bankers.\n“Breaker, she’s serious,” Cruxer said.\nKip didn’t even look up. “Uh-huh. Happens to everyone who dabbles in\nthe art-restoration business. Hazard of the trade, getting offered a crown.”\n“Art?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Fixing the ceiling?” Ben-hadad prompted.\n“Oh, right! Right.” Ferkudi looked up. “What’s wrong with the ceiling?”\n“Crowd’s not that big. Oh, they’ve seen us,” Winsen said, now beside\nCruxer. “Crux? How does a High Magister wave? Like so?” He waved a\ndevil-may-care wave, and Kip could hear the crowd go mad with\nexcitement.\n“‘Not that big’?” Kip said, suddenly rooted to the desk, papers forgotten.\n“Nor that small,” Tisis said.\n“How not small is ‘not small’?” Kip asked.\n“I dunno,” Winsen said. “Maybe twenty thousand?”\n“What?!” Kip shot to his feet.\n“He’s joking,” Tisis said. “Maybe a thousand?”\n“Nine hundred fifty-seven,” Ferkudi said.\nThey all stopped. They looked at him."

They’re\nnot any more likely.” He suddenly looked troubled. “They aren’t more\nlikely, are they?”\nBut Kip suddenly remembered. They were worried about spies listening\nin. Tisis was only bluffing, trying to give the Divines something to worry\nabout—to soften them up for what Kip planned next. She wasn’t serious.\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said as Kip stepped up to the window himself,\ncurious. There must be a small crowd at least, for Tisis’s play to have any\nteeth.\nBut Cruxer put a hand on his chest, stopping him. “Kip! Don’t you step\ninto view unless you plan to become a king. With all that that entails. For all\nof us.”\n“You’re serious,” Kip said. Since when did Cruxer call him Kip?\n“Never more.” The look in Cruxer’s eyes was inscrutable, and Kip\nsuddenly wasn’t sure what his friend would do if he tried to take that last\nstep.\nEver righteous, would Cruxer see Kip taking a crown as treason?\nBut as if he’d just wondered the same thing, Cruxer dropped his hand as\nif Kip were burning white-hot.\n“Where can I stand where they won’t see me?” Kip asked.\n“Let ’em see you,” Winsen said. “‘King’s Guard’ has a nice ring to it.\nLot better than ‘Winsen, Kip Guile’s Mighty Right Hand, You Know, the\nSuave and Dashing One.’”\n“‘Right hand’?” Cruxer asked, eyebrows climbing.\nWinsen shrugged, helpless. “I can’t stop people from talking,\nCommander.”\n“‘Suave’?” Ferkudi asked.\nBen-hadad said, “‘Dashing’? ‘Dashing Away from the Fight,’ maybe.”\n“Least I can dash, Hop-Along,” Winsen sneered. “Funny, I don’t\nremember the cripple complaining about my speed when I saved his gimpy\nass last night. And I am suave, Ferkudi. Certainly compared with the village\nidiot of the Mighty.”\n“Oh, I’m sure you are,” Ferkudi said. “I mean, if you say so. It was a\nreal question. I don’t know what ‘suave’ means.” He cut off suddenly.\n“Hold the door! Who’s the village idiot of the Mighty?”\n“Was that a real question, too?” Ben-hadad muttered.\nKip peered past the edge of a curtain—and then he understood what\nCruxer had meant. Hundreds of people were gathered, yelling and waving\ncrude little green flags and banners he couldn’t read from here.\n“They might not look like much…” Tisis said.\n“The banners or the people?” Ben-hadad asked.\nTisis went on quietly without answering. “But you encourage these ones,"

Being a king? There’ve\nbeen hundreds of kings—”\n“Not since the Seven Satrapies were founded,” Kip said.\n“Being a king’s like barely the second rung on the ladder to the heavens,\nand you’re heading pretty near the top of it.”\nBen-hadad said, “Don’t say it.”\n“You’re the Lightbringer, the Luíseach here or whatever,” Winsen said.\n“He said it,” Ben-hadad said.\n“He just had to say it,” Big Leo said.\n“Win, the rest of you, too?! Are you serious with this?!” Kip said.\n“Setting that up—even talking about it with the kitchen staff or, or anyone!\n—it’s totally destructive for everything we’re trying to do here. If you\nencourage that kind of talk, we might do a hundred amazing things, but if\nwe don’t do one thing from some stupid prophecy, maybe even one we\ndon’t know about—or even if some idiot wrote it down wrong or translated\nit wrong three hundred years ago or whatever—then all of a sudden,\neveryone on our side loses heart, because I look like a fraud. Rather than\nbeing a leader who’s helping save a satrapy, I look like some delusional\nmegalomaniac who thinks he’s Lucidonius come again! Do you really not\nsee how that’s a problem?!”\n“Right, we’ve heard it before,” Winsen said. “It’s too late. You’re asking\nus to pretend because you don’t like the pressure? Tough shit. People\nalready are joining us because they believe in you. Sure, deny it publicly,\nplay it however you want, but the cards are on the table, you—”\n“Enough!” Tisis said. “Win, you’re a moron. Do you not remember why\nwe’re here?”\n“We invaded?” Winsen asked. “Liberated, I mean.”\n“Here, here,” she said.\nKip saw it dawn on the slight archer: Oh, right, spies might be listening\nto every word. Shit.\n“Kip,” Tisis said, “ignore him.”\nOf course, all of them were trying to think whether Winsen—or Kip—\nhad said anything that would be disastrous if it had been overheard.\nTisis went on: “The real reason the people here might dream of you as\ntheir king is simple.

He should have discovered if there were spies, and\nwhose. He should’ve figured out exactly what lies to funnel to that person\nto make them do what he wanted.\nAndross Guile would have.\nCruxer said, “Súil, thank you. Excellent work.

Sure,\nhe’d break some rules, break expectations, a bully’s arm, a chair”—he\nflashed a grin at that memory—“but I don’t think that boy would break the\nempire. I guess it slipped out. I guess I’ve been wondering if maybe you’re\nmore their Lord Guile than our Breaker. Maybe it was an ill omen, that\nname.”\n“You gave it to me,” Kip said.\n“I hadn’t forgotten,” Cruxer said. “Lot of things about that year that I\nregret.”"

She briefly kissed Kip’s cheek—they were trying to\nbe less irritating with their affections around the Mighty—and left.\nMoments later, Kip’s drafters sealed the doors.\nEveryone began examining the big map. Kip had been doing a little trick\nSúil had taught him, using a small amount of paryl, which was highly\nsensitive to other colors, to make a form of a small portion of the three-\ndimensional map, then quickly filling in the colors with other luxins to\nmake a fragile copy of Green Haven and its surroundings. He turned it\naround and tilted it to get a sense of how the changes in elevation might\naffect sight lines, and the flow of horses and men in a battle.\nBut he was really just stalling.\nCruxer turned to him. “Over to you, milord.

If the capital falls, the satrapy falls. We’re the only\nones who can possibly save them. But the Council of the Divines isn’t\nwilling to give us the support they promised they would if we saved this\ncity. Worse, they may not even have it. They also won’t give us access to\nthe palace’s Great Mirror array, which probably won’t even help us much\neven if I win another pointless fight over it. Our most popular and capable\ngeneral, Conn Arthur, has snapped and deserted. Sibéal Siofra has\ndisappeared, too.

In trying to gain\nthe initiative, I’ve blundered horribly instead. Immediately after the battle,\nwhen I sent nearly all the Nightbringers’ will-casters and their animal\npartners on ahead of us to attack the White King’s supply lines to disrupt\ntheir siege? Tisis has just discovered that the White King did the same to us\nfirst, weeks if not months ago. He’s blocked the Great River behind us. We\ndon’t know where. We can’t get any intel or reinforcements from the rest of\nthe Seven Satrapies. And now, after I’ve sent away our most powerful\nforces, it appears one of the bandit kings—a lovely fellow named Daragh\nthe Coward—has gained sudden wealth and a huge number of recruits and\nmay lay siege to us here within days. I suspect he’s been bought by the\nWhite King. So you tell me: is ‘hopeless’ a question, or the answer?”\nSome of this was news even since last night, and they all took a moment\nto absorb it.\nWhat would you do here, father?\nKip suddenly stood, because the first step at least was obvious.\nMaybe it was time to see if he was the son of Gavin Guile after all. He\nlooked over at Cruxer, and his commander’s throat bobbed as he saw what\nKip intended.\nKip flashed him a grin.\nAnd maybe it was the grin that did it, the intimation of confidence, for\ninstead of raising an objection, Cruxer nodded. He was in with Kip,\ncategorically.\nKip strode to the windows, head high, threw back the drapes, and waved\nto the damned crowd, smiling broadly.\nThey cheered. Of course they did.\nChapter 8\nTeia thought there were two kinds of women most aware of how many\npeople at a party are staring at them: a pretty one who opts for much more\ndaring clothing than usual, and a hideous one who’s dressed the same way\nand only becomes aware of her mistake as her carriage pulls away, leaving\nher stranded.

She’d face death, and\nconsign her father to it as well.\nA couple hours ago, she’d felt like some kind of avenging nocturnal\nangel: I’ll be a ghost, haunting their dreams!\nThat would make them nightmares, she supposed.\nI’ll haunt their nightmares!… But do you haunt nightmares? Why not a\nnice empty house? Maybe in the countryside. With cheese, maybe. And\nwine.\nI am not good at this being-scary business.\nAs she ascended the Prism’s Tower invisibly, she felt less like a phantom\nand more like a mouse in the stables. No one noticed her, but if they did, it\nwas far more likely to be disastrous for her than for them. And that was just\non the slaves’ stairs.\nAn invisible assassin breaking into the White’s quarters was, after all,\nexactly the kind of thing that the Blackguard had been formed to stop.\nShe’d done it before, but she’d also rushed across a busy street without\nlooking and lived—that didn’t make it a good idea to do it repeatedly.\nIn the first hours after leaving Gavin Guile alive, Teia had retrieved a\nfew of her things from the barracks—again dodging invisibly around her\ncompatriots and friends. Because any of them might be working for the\nOrder of the Broken Eye, she had to appear to have simply vanished. The\nOld Man of the Desert would check, after all.\nWhoever he or she was, they had certainly not survived this long—like a\ntapeworm in the guts of the Chromeria itself—without being fanatically\ncareful.\nShe’d had to take a few hours to plot, and to rest.\nThe truth was, even after training for the last year with the master cloak,\nthe longest Teia could comfortably stay invisible was still only a couple\nhours.\nNow, with night full upon the Jaspers and the shift change about to\nbegin, it was time to sneak into Karris’s room and tell her that her husband,\nGavin, was alive. Further, he’d been here in the Chromeria itself, mere\nhours ago.\nAnd Teia hadn’t saved him. Oh, and she hadn’t reported earlier, when\nthere might have been a good chance at rescue.\nIt was not a report Teia relished giving.\nShe made it into the room on the heels of Watch Captain Blunt and\nKerea—neither of whom was a sub-red, thank Orholam.

If anything, oddly, losing her hand had made\nher less of a hard-ass than before.\nTeia had taken advantage of the Blackguards’ noise in moving about the\nroom to position herself in a dark corner behind Samite’s back—the woman\nwas facing the window and the door, where threats were likely to appear.\nThey’d also dull her night vision.\nPretty quickly, Teia realized that Samite intended to stand guard all\nnight. Not good.\nWhy? What the hell was going on?\nLong minutes passed, and none of them moved. Teia was going to have\nto think of something to get rid of Samite, or she was going to be here all\nnight.\nAnd it’s harder to be totally silent for an entire night than one might\nguess. Teia relaxed her hold on paryl. She didn’t have the strength to stay\nfully invisible all night, but with the darkness and Samite staring the other\nway, she shouldn’t have to.\n“You can go,” Karris said from the bed. Finally.\nPlease obey, Trainer Samite. Please?\nBut Samite merely squared her shoulders. Though not tall, she was built\nlike a draft horse.\nAfter a long minute, Samite said, “Being this kind of hard? Not good.\nThis kind of hard is brittle. You should weep for him.”\nFor him? Huh? For Gavin? That had to be it. But why was this\nhappening now? So far as Karris knew, Gavin had been absent for nearly a\nyear.\n“You’re not weeping,” Karris said. There was nothing of tears in her\nvoice, either.\nAh, so not Gavin, then? Who would they both weep for?\n“I’m on duty,” Samite said. “This is your break from duty. These hours\nare when you need to regroup so you can put on your face tomorrow.”\nKarris scoffed.\n“The dumbest scrub learns that if you don’t take off your blacks and\ngive ’em a wash, you’re gonna stink, and you’ll wear through ’em in no\ntime. That applies to your clothes, too, O Iron White.”\nTeia had never heard someone speak so scornfully to Karris, not even\nwhen she’d just been Karris White Oak.\n“Do I need to order you to go?” Karris asked coldly.\n“Not the kind of order I’m required to obey,” Samite said. She turned\nher back and folded her arms.\n“What, you think I’m a danger to myself? I’m not going to kill myself.”\nThe condescension was thick in Karris’s voice. Teia had never heard her\ntalk that way to anyone, either.\nThen she remembered these two had been in the same cohort. They’d\nknown each other for nearly twenty years, and been through everything\ntogether.\nYou can be a bitch to a heart-friend, when you really have to.\nBut Samite merely applied the servant’s veto—she pretended not to\nhear: what I have just heard is a fool’s order; my mistress is no fool; ergo\nmy mistress obviously didn’t give it.\nKarris sank back into her covers. Speaking to the ceiling, she asked,\n“Have you ever done it?”"

More than anything.”\n“Have you ever done it? Personally?”\n“You know I haven’t,” Samite said a few moments later, back still\nturned.\nWhat the hell? They were talking about a Freeing. Someone must have\nbroken the halo recently. One of the Blackguards?\nTeia’s chest went tight. No.\nA scroll of the names of every Blackguard Teia knew started unfurling\nbefore her mind’s eye. Who was close to bursting their halo? She felt a sting\nof guilt at the realization that losing some of her comrades wouldn’t bother\nher at all.\n“You want to know a secret?” Karris asked. Her voice was bitter as the\nblack kopi she loved. She sat up. “A secret I barely even dare whisper even\nhere? Here, in my own rooms, to you, my oldest fri…” She trailed off.\n“What?” Samite asked. Teia drafted the paryl she’d been holding loosely\nand disappeared before Samite turned around.\nThe one-handed warrior’s face was forgiving toward this woman who’d\nbeen such a bitch moments ago.\nBut Karris didn’t give the answer. Instead, she looked suddenly ill.\n“Oh my God,” Karris said. “This is why Prisms go mad. This is why\nGavin was always so wretched at Freeings.”\n“What are you talking about?” Samite asked, tense.\n“I knew it was hard, Sami. I thought I knew. But… it’s not hard.”\nSamite’s face was writ with the same confusion Teia felt. Killing their\nown wasn’t hard? Karris had killed before; surely she knew that the\nphysical act wasn’t so difficult most of the time, so she meant something\nelse.\n“Oh God,” the White blasphemed, though perhaps such a desperate tone\nmade uttering the holy title a prayer rather than a curse. “Oh God.” Her pale\nskin went death-white. Her fingers grabbed wads of the covers and she\ngulped convulsively to keep from vomiting.\n“What…?” Samite asked.\n“It’s not hard, Sami,” Karris said. “I killed that boy, and the veil lifted.\nThis. What we’re doing. It’s not hard. Koios is right. What we’re doing is\nwrong. And if it’s wrong when Gav Greyling offers me his life willingly,\nhow much worse is it when we drag women to the Prism’s knife as they\nscream and wail and beg us to think of their children?”\nTeia felt as if a horse had kicked her. Seeing the White herself lose faith?\nOh, that was pretty bad.\nAnd admit that the Blood Robes were right?\nThat was also bad.\nBut that wasn’t the part that Teia’s mind couldn’t hold—like cupped,\nimploring hands as someone emptied a full pitcher of blood into them.

Personally.\nBut after all the people Karris had had Teia kill… all the murders of\ninnocent slaves and the kidnapping and murder of Marissia, all the shit\nshe’d ordered Teia to do and to be party to, she, the White herself, was\nlosing faith merely because she’d had to hold the knife? Once?\nNow she flinches?! How dare she.\nSure, you’re only human. You’re allowed to have your doubts.\nBut you can’t doubt this. You’re the White. Any doubts you had should\nhave been dealt with years ago.\nIf you doubt, why should anyone believe?\nAmong the Blackguard, Gav’s was an honorable death. A combat death.\nIt was counted as succumbing to your wounds from battle. A hero’s death. It\nwas giving your all, and more. It was being willing to give not just your life\nbut even more, your sanity. Most Blackguards, if they felt the halo break,\ntried to die on the field. Easier that way for everyone. Safer.\nBut if you didn’t, what you asked in return for your sacrifice was that\nyour friends would end you before you dishonored yourself by hurting\nthose you loved. If possible, if you lived so long, you were accorded the\nhonor of being Freed by your highest commanders, those you trusted with\nyour body and your soul, the head of the Blackguard, or a High Luxiat, or\nthe Prism himself. Nothing short of the dawn Sun Day ritual itself was too\nimportant to be interrupted for a Blackguard’s Freeing.\nThe people who’d put you in the place where you needed to die in order\nto serve them would hold the knife.\nAnd all you asked for all your suffering and sacrifice was a steady hand\non the knife and a steady look in the eye. You asked them to affirm the\nmeaning not just of your death but of your whole life, of the oath of service\nyou’d given and that you were upholding even after breaking the halo,\nwhen everything in you screamed to break troth. You asked them to have\nthe basic decency to honor your sacrifice.\nHow could you become the White, and look into the eyes of a good man\nwho was dying for you, and blink?\nThe Iron White, they called her.\nIt was a bitter taste in Teia’s mouth. A mock.\nTeia felt the darkness all around her like dead, cold fingers touching her\ncheek; cold, wormy breath blowing down on her hood, wheezing. But as\nshe drafted paryl now, she couldn’t say any more that the darkness was\nmerely a cloak around her than you could say the air was merely around\nyou once you breathed it in.\nShe opened herself to darkness and it took her.

And\nnevermore would be.\nTeia would give Karris her report. Not today. But eventually. Teia would\ndo her duty. She always did. The monsters she fought were still monsters.\nHer friends still her friends. Her commanders still, unfortunately, her\ncommanders. Doubts are for old warriors, not young ones.\nBut on a personal level? Fuck you, Karris.\nYou’re making everything you put me through, everything you made me\ndo, be for nothing. Now you’ve given me a dead friend. Why would I give\nyou a live husband?\nYou took my Gavin. Why should I give you yours?\nTeia waited until morning. As the Iron White slept in her soft bed,\nAdrasteia’s mind never wavered, her determination never faltered, her focus\nnever flagged, her will never failed. Witness to weakness, she was\nimplacable.\nWhen the morning shift came in, she slipped out the door and got to\nwork.\nChapter 9\nKip was following Tisis through the verdant vibrancy of the forest. The air\nwas thick as hot soup, the ground spongy underfoot with mosses and\nfanning ferns, but there was no trail. The clouds broke overhead with the\nkind of downpour that could last a few minutes or all morning. Kip was\ndrenched in warm sky spit within seconds.\nIt was kind of miserable being out here, actually. And a total relief.\nHis Nightbringers only nominally controlled this land, not even a league\nfrom Greenwall. It should be safe—aside from the snakes. They had scouts\nfarther out, after all, and this was in the direction least likely for them to be\nattacked by Daragh the Coward’s bandits, or any unlikely sneak attack from\nKoios. Cruxer was still nervous, of course. But this had to be secret, so only\nKip, Cruxer, Ferkudi, and Tisis had slipped away.\n“What’s your read on this?” Tisis asked.\n“This?” Kip asked. They’d already agreed he couldn’t make a decision\nuntil he learned more. That was the whole point of actually hiking out here\nrather than just sending orders. “You mean…”\n“Daragh,” she said, gesturing to the scroll case at her belt as if doing so\nagain.\nOh, that. He’d missed it in the rain and with staring at his footing.\nDaragh the Coward wanted to meet with Kip.\nKip first suspected he was trying to gain time to spread his forces out to\nshut down supply or reinforcement, but Daragh had asked to meet in\nperson, in neutral territory.\nAs if there were any such thing.\nThey’d sent a message back saying that if Daragh didn’t trust Kip would\nhonor a flag of truce, then he obviously wouldn’t trust any deal he might\nmake with Kip, so a meeting was pointless. Thus Daragh could meet him in\nthe city or not at all."

Thus Daragh could meet him in\nthe city or not at all.\n“There’s a reason his bandits haven’t attacked us directly all this time,”\nKip said.\n“Depends how you define ‘us,’” Tisis said.\nThe bandits literally lived by enslaving and pillaging, with raping\nthrown in for good measure and murder as their primary tool. That Daragh\nthe Coward hadn’t attacked Kip’s forces per se was incidental to her: their\nvictims were Foresters, and that by itself made them Tisis’s people.\n“I’m trying to see it—for the moment—as he does,” Kip said. He’d\nexplained this already. In Daragh’s mind, he had avoided attacking Kip’s\npeople, even as Kip had passed through territory he considered his own.\nThat didn’t happen by accident, not with men like this. So to him, that\nshould mean he and Kip could still work something out.\nTisis would rather fight. Regardless. To her Koios was an invader, but\nDaragh the Coward was a traitor, which was worse. She might not forgive\nKip if he fought the invader but forgave the traitor.\nWhich made her right morally but wrong strategically.\nThat was tomorrow’s problem.\nThey came to the small encampment suddenly, set in a hollow hidden by\na hill. General Antonius Malargos greeted them outside the longhouse.\nThe year of being in authority had transformed Antonius. He’d been the\ngawky young red drafter, terminally the little-brother figure to his cousin\nTisis—whom he still adored. He was still lean, but there was a focus to him\nnow, a strength that knew itself and hadn’t given up its striving to grow\nmore. His people loved him because he loved them, and because he was\nbold. That he had the Malargos good looks didn’t hurt, either. He had an\nintuitive grasp of tactics, and would throw himself headlong wherever he\nsensed weakness.\nThis was, after all, the young man who’d leaped from his own ship as it\nwas being captured by pirates to steal the pirates’ own ship—and in so\ndoing saved Kip’s father.\nOddest of all for a man so bold, Antonius accepted instruction from\nthose he respected.\nHe himself had no sense at all of strategy; his eyes glazed during those\ndiscussions, but he was young yet. Logistics were beyond him completely,\nbut he could have others attached to him to help with those—though it\nwould always have to be someone with a steel spine, because Antonius had\nlittle patience for those who said things couldn’t be done.\nKip liked him a lot.\n“My people here will keep quiet,” Antonius said.\nHe had only ten men here. Even at that, Kip wasn’t certain he was right.\nAntonius’s total faith in his people inspired deep loyalty in return. But Kip\nknew that the same person might show different kinds of loyalty in different\nkinds of fights.\nAnd this was not a fight Kip or anyone wanted.\n“They know what has to be done with deserters,” Antonius said.

Either\nbecause he was just that obvious, or to put some backbone in them. So\nmaybe he wasn’t that certain of how quiet they would keep, after all.\nFerkudi took up a position outside the door. Cruxer stepped inside first.\nKip followed, bracing himself for what he might have to do.\nIn the shadows of this longhouse with no fire burning at its center, stood\na pygmy woman, dirty, her eyes exhausted red: Sibéal Siofra. Next to her,\nchained to great stakes driven into the ground, smeared with ash and grease\nsuch as hunters employ to melt into the forest, but also dirty and disheveled\nfrom hard days and nights, knelt an enormous bear of a man, his every\njutting muscle covered with red hair, the bereaved deserter and Kip’s former\nsecond-in-command, Conn Ruadhán Arthur.\n“My lord,” Sibéal said, “there’s no need for the chains. The conn here\ngot into some booze while foraging. Just lost track of time. Got lost on his\nway back. But we’re back now and reporting for duty. With all apologies\nfor our absence.”\nShe was floating the possibility for the lash, not the noose.\nBut Conn Arthur snorted, shaking his head. “You spent days dragging\nmy ass back here, and that’s the best you could come up with, Sibéal?”\nKip ignored him, turning to Antonius. “It’s my understanding they came\nin of their own will. That they were returning, not captured. That right?”\n“She was certainly returning of her own will…” He hesitated. Antonius\ncould tell that Kip was trying to point him in some direction, but he\ncouldn’t see what it was.\n“And he was with her—when she returned voluntarily,” Kip said. “So\nthat’d be dereliction of duty, not desertion.”\n“That’s, uh, that’s right,” Lord Antonius said, relieved.\nThe law was the law, but Kip didn’t want to hang his friend.\n“So that’s what happened?” Kip asked. “I’m very disappointed in you\ntwo.”\n“That’s not what happened,” Conn Arthur growled at the floor.\n“Stop!” Sibéal shouted at him. “Think about what you’re doing!”\n“I’ll not let you be whipped for what I’ve done,” he said. He lifted his\nshaggy head to look at Kip with heavy eyes. “My lord, I told you I was\ngoing to desert. I did. It’s not on her. She came and dragged me back.”\n“Damn you,” Sibéal whispered.\nShe deflated, and Kip’s heart fell too. She’d risked her life trying to save\nher friend, but some men don’t want to be saved.\nIt wasn’t her fault. It was Kip’s. Conn Arthur had tried to resign, but Kip\nhad thought without their work and the company of people who loved him\nthat Ruadhán would die, so he’d forbidden it.\nRuadhán had left anyway.\n“You tried,” General Antonius told Kip. “We all did. There’s no win\nhere. He doesn’t want to live.”"

This was bigger than one bereaved man who couldn’t bear\nto fight anymore. If Kip let his friend off now, it’d destroy morale. People\nwould say there was one rule for Kip’s friends and one for everyone else.\nTo save a man sunken in self-pity and ungrateful for his second—no, his\nthird—chance would make that even worse. It would cast doubt on Kip’s\njudgment.\nBut hanging him? Did Kip want to be known as the man who hanged his\nown friends?\nAndross Guile would do it. Hell, Gavin would probably do it, too.\nAntonius said, “Sibéal doubtless noticed things wherever it is they went.\nShe reports on it, and we say she was out scouting. I don’t think any\npunishment’s necessary for her.”\nKip looked at the others for any ideas and saw only grief.\nCruxer said, “Not all the soldiers killed by war die on the field. It’s no\none’s fault.” He cocked his head at a thought. “Well, it’s the White King’s\nfault. May he burn in hell. But it’s not yours.”\nNo one else had anything to say. No plans. No ways out.\n“You go,” young General Antonius said. “I’ll handle it.”\nKip looked to Conn Arthur, but the big man didn’t even meet his gaze.\n“Everyone out,” Kip said.\nThey looked at him, and saw the resolve in his face. Tisis went out first,\nthen the Blackguards, except Cruxer, who stood guard impassively. He\nwasn’t going to leave no matter what Kip said, not with a man as dangerous\nas Conn Arthur might become if he’d gone truly mad.\nKip stopped Antonius, though. “General,” he said. “I’ll need your\ndagger.”\nThe general nodded grimly and passed Kip a big, ornate dagger he’d\ngotten from his aunt Eirene Malargos. It was a showy piece, but very fine,\ntoo. The woman had an eye for quality.\nThen they were alone in the damp and the dark and the smoky close air\nof the longhouse. It felt close to the earth in here. Real, solid, and dirty.\nHere, with clan and family tight around them, people made love on just a\nfew blankets and rushes on the floor, and they gave birth on the same floor,\nand played with their children, and bickered, and ate, and died, all here,\npacked close. It was still sometimes shocking to Kip’s Tyrean sensibilities,\nbut such a life felt connected, too. Unashamed.\nHe breathed in the heavy air and let it flow through him.\n“You remember that time we did the survey after that raid went\nsideways?” Kip said. “You know, at Three Bridges, to see how many of us\nwere hurt?

And we’d be damned if\nwe let them die without a fight.”\n“Some fights you can’t win,” Ruadhán growled, and Kip felt Cruxer go\ntight despite the big man’s chains.\n“We’re all wounded,” Kip said. “And we’ve got work to do. I need\nhands. I need your hands. We need your hands. The men who lie down and\ndie do no good for anyone. Don’t get me wrong; I want you to live because\nI love you, but I also want you to live so you can fight for us. This is bigger\nthan you, bigger than your griefs, your failures, your brother. It’s bigger\nthan him. He helped us. He saved hundreds or thousands of lives. He was\nheroic at the end, and that makes a huge difference. It matters.\n“But he’s dead, man. He died saving lives, and now you won’t live to do\nthe same. I don’t feel sorry for you, Ruadhán, I’m pissed off you won’t help\nwhen we’ve got work to do.”\n“I’ve got nothing left,” Conn Arthur said, as if Kip was refusing to see\nthe obvious.\n“When it serves life, there’s a time to choose death,” Kip said.\n“Absolutely. And your brother made that choice, but he took too damn long\nto make it. He was selfish, and he got other people killed.”\n“Don’t talk about my brother.”\n“There’s a time to choose life, Conn, and you’re taking too damn long to\nmake it,” Kip said. “You’re in a pit, so I’m throwing you a rope, but I ain’t\ngonna fuckin’ climb for you. You dyin’ today? It hurts me more than you.\nBut if you choose to live, I want you to live for one reason—because you’re\ngoing to make yourself useful. You’re worried it hurts our traditions for me\nto let you live? Yes. It does. People will think you got preferential\ntreatment? Yes, they will. Because you are. Not because I love you, but"

If you climb out of this pit,\nyou’re on the hook to prove me right. You’re on the hook to work every day\nto show you’re worth the third chance I’m giving you, and someday, when\nit’s your turn, when it’s wise, you’re on the hook to give that chance to\nsomeone else.” Kip blew out a breath in exasperation. “Look at your\nfucking shoulders, man. You were made to bear burdens. You are strong as\nfuck, and you’re not acting like it. So, if you want to stay and curl up and\ndie? Then fuck you. You’ve already wasted too much of my time.” Kip\nturned away, but then paused.\nHe pulled a knife from his belt and stared at Ruadhán, eye to eye.\n“It’d tear up the men to hang you,” Kip said. “So you want to die? Have\nthe goddam decency to think of someone else a bit, would you?”\nKip dropped the knife and the key, outside the cell. Ruadhán would have\nto strain against his chains to get either of them.\nKip gave Sibéal the signal to get out of the longhouse. Stony-faced,\nsilent, she went, not daring to look at Conn Arthur, who was still staring at\nthe ground anyway.\nThen Kip strode out as if it weren’t tearing out his heart not to offer soft\nwords to his suffering friend.\nBut Kip knew all about the slimy, steep-sided pit of self-pity.\nSometimes, a hard kick in the ass can do what a soft word in the ear can’t.\nOr so he hoped.\nOutside, the men searched his face for any clue of what they must do,\nbut none dared ask him anything. Kip found Sibéal. “You’d already said\nyour goodbyes?”\n“Yeah, I didn’t know how soon you’d hang us. It was like he was\nalready d—”\n“You know it’s better for you if he takes the knife.”\nA guilty look flashed over her face, then was hidden by anger. She knew.\n“Why the hell would you say that? He’s my best friend.”\n“You could finally move on.”\nShe moved to angrily deny it, but words fell dead with no spirit to give\nthem life.\n“Is it so obvious?” she asked.\nKip suddenly remembered glances he’d seen others exchange about the\ntwo. He’d never spoken of it to anyone. He’d only realized Sibéal loved that\nbig idiot minutes ago. Others had, he saw now, known it for much longer.\nHe said, “Obvious enough to a few who love you.”\nHer people’s uncanny smile on her lips twisted bitterly. “I’ve made\nmyself a laughingstock.”\n“No one’s laughing.”\nSibéal got quiet. They breathed the forest air together. “I’m pretty sure\nhe loves me, too, and just hates himself too much to see it.”\nKip said nothing. It was a poison that had to be drained, that she’d held"

        "text": "he loves me, too, and just hates himself too much to see it.”\nKip said nothing. It was a poison that had to be drained, that she’d held\nin for too long, and that had spurred her to actions that could well have cost\nher her life.\n“It wouldn’t all be so bad if I didn’t want kids,” she said. “I mean, we\nhave ways to know when not to take a man to bed, to avoid his seed taking\nroot. But… all that effort to fix the problem doesn’t fix the problem when\nyou want the problem, does it? I want a child. Hell, I want lots of them, if\nthis war ever ends. I want loud, shrieking, giggling, climbing-over-me-and-\nclinging-to-my-legs life everywhere. A house bursting at the seams with life\nafter all this…” Her voice fell off. “But I want him.”\nKip hesitated, but then said, “Do you think it’s a coincidence that you’ve\nchosen to fall in love with a man in an impossible situation that he himself\ncreated?”\n“What do you mean? What do you mean I’ve chosen to—”\n“You’ve done exactly the same thing he has. You’re in a pit, too, Sibéal.\nAnd if you want to, even if he dies, you can stay in yours. You can curl up\nin grief around your sweet, doomed love. You can take that tragedy and\nwrap yourself up in it like a blanket to keep you feeling warm and self-\nrighteous, because this world done you wrong. You could’ve gotten out\nearlier, and if so, sure, what happens in there today would be a terrible blow\n—losing a dear friend is always tragic, but people lose friends in war, and\nstill go home and have those babies and that full house. You could’ve gotten\nout earlier and easier, but you didn’t.\n“You’re here now. So you can stay in this shit, or you can climb out, too.\nAnd I’m sorry to say it, but I don’t have a rope to throw you or a key to\noffer. Climbing out will be tougher than it would be to tell yourself what a\nnoble martyr you are and live half a life, cuddled up with your misery. But\nyou’re making a choice, like it or not. This isn’t happening to you. You can\nchoose to love him and have his babies—and, yeah, probably die in\nchildbirth. Or you can choose to love him and not have babies, or adopt—\nplenty of war orphans already, and there’ll be more before we’re done. Or\nchoose to move on. Or choose to sink into self-pity and self-loathing. I even\nrespect a couple of those. But whatever you choose, I expect you to make\nyourself useful in the meantime. If he kills himself in there in the next few\nminutes, you get to clean up the blood and the shit, and you get to bury him.\nYou brought this mess on us when you brought him back. If he can’t find\nthe guts to use the knife or to live, then you get to be the hangman. None of\nthese other men and women deserve to have that on them. Last, as we both\nhope, if he comes out, choosing to live, you get to clean him up. Maybe it’ll\nbe a good chance to tell him what you are choosing for your life."

Maybe it’ll\nbe a good chance to tell him what you are choosing for your life.\n“Regardless,” Kip said, “report for duty first thing tomorrow morning; I\nwant you to brief me on the lands you’ve scouted. Oh, and Captain Siofra?\nNever fucking leave your post without permission again.”\nChapter 10\n“To work,” Kip said to the Mighty gathered around the table with him once\nmore. “Strategy first. The banking meeting will come next. Big Leo, Ferk,\nyou’re in on that one. Tactics we’ll save for when General Antonius and the\ntrainers can be here. Ferkudi, I’ll need you to lead a logistics meeting later.\nBring your ledgers. I know you don’t need ’em, but everyone else does.\nBen-hadad, you’re in that one, too. I know you are each doing the work of\ntwo or three people, so let’s be quick. Now the big question: what do we\nhave to do to win?”\n“Define ‘win,’” Winsen said.\n“Winsen, shut up,” Cruxer said.\n“No, I’m serious. I’m not being a jackass.” He shrugged. “This time.”\nBig Leo said, “We win once we kill the White King and all his\nleadership. That’s winning. Nothing short of that.”\nBen-hadad took off his flip-down spectacles. “What if, by that definition,\nwe can’t win?”\n“You think we can’t win?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Worse,” Ben-hadad said. “Breaker doesn’t.”\nThey all looked at Kip. “I never said that,” he said.\nBut they all knew him.\n“Focus on the problem,” Cruxer said. “We have to lift the siege on\nGreen Haven or we’ll lose the satrapy. If we lose the capital, we lose Blood\nForest. We do that and the other satrapies fall eventually. Maybe we can’t\nbeat him alone, but we’re not alone. Winning is stopping him here, showing\nhe can be defeated and trusting the rest of the empire to do their part, too,\nalbeit later than we’d like.”\n“No, we have to do more than that,” Ben-hadad said. “The White King\nhas multiple paths to victory. Big Leo was right. We have to kill him. Even\nif he loses here, he can go on and win elsewhere, drawing strength from\neverything he’s already conquered, and then come back. With the land he\nholds and the revenues he commands, the longer this war goes on, the more\ncertain our defeat.”\nCruxer said, “To lift the siege, we either have to leave right away or\nwe’ll get besieged ourselves here. Even if the bandits can’t keep us under\nsiege for more than a few weeks, that’ll be long enough for Green Haven to\nfall. But if we leave, we leave Dúnbheo defenseless.”\n“I kind of like the idea of those old bastards on the Council of Divines\nbeing led away in chains. They deserve it for all their lies,” Winsen said.\n“But everyone else here doesn’t,” Cruxer said.\n“Dúnbheo was under siege,” Ben-hadad said. “Of course they lied to us."

Admit they\ndidn’t have any food or supplies to share? They’re corrupt idiots, but not\nstupid idiots.”\nCruxer said, “Dúnbheo has ceremonial and symbolic power. History.\nThe whole satrapy is taking heart as they get news of our victory over the\nnext days and weeks. The Divines might have convinced themselves the\ncity still has strategic value as well.”\n“Aw, Cruxer, always trying to see the best in everyone except yourself,”\nWinsen said. “It’s cute.”\n“Shut up, Win,” Big Leo rumbled.\n“The thing is,” Kip said, feeling like he was groping around the foot of a\nreally big idea, “Koios knew it didn’t. If he’d already seized Loch Lána and\nhad a plan in motion to strangle the Great River, why try to take Dúnbheo?”\n“The symbolic value,” Ben-hadad said. “This city is still Blood Forest’s\npagan heart—and there’s still that huge throne in that audience chamber. A\nthrone unpolished by a king’s waxing moons in four centuries. If the White\nKing sits there, he becomes a king in truth—the first king since\nLucidonius.”\n“But if that was it,” Kip said, “why wouldn’t he have come here himself,\nto make sure the city fell?”\n“A general has to delegate,” Ben-hadad said. “If you see a general\nfighting on the front lines, you’re seeing a damned foo—” He cut off as he\nrealized something. He looked at Kip and cringed. “Uh, I mean, usually,\nyou’re seeing a man choosing glory over victory.”\n“Breaker fights on the front lines,” Ferkudi said.\n“Thanks, guys,” Kip said.\n“I did say ‘usually,’” Ben-hadad grumbled.\nKip had moved fast, trying to cut the White King’s lines of supply and\nreinforcement while getting supplies and reinforcements of his own—the\nword of Kip’s victory saving Dúnbheo should have given the Spectrum a\ngood reason to bet fully on him. Instead, the White King had beaten him to\nthe exact same strategy.\nKip had been doing everything right to make allies. At great cost, he’d\ndone all he could to make friends, and here he was, alone and unsupported.\nAgain.\nNo, no, that wasn’t true. He and his people were alone and unsupported.\nHe wasn’t poor Kip Delauria of Rekton anymore. He was Kip Guile of\nBlood Forest. And if the fights felt the same—the isolation, the self-doubt—\nmaybe all those earlier fights had been readying him for this one.\n“Maybe there are other forces Koios is worried about threatening his\nsiege,” Ben-hadad said. “The pygmies, maybe? Or maybe the Chromeria’s\nfinally decided to stop sitting on its thumbs and is attacking from Atash? Or\nmaybe he’s so certain of victory, he’s in no rush.”\n“He’s attacked aggressively everywhere else, from Garriston to Idoss to"

Or\nmaybe he’s so certain of victory, he’s in no rush.”\n“He’s attacked aggressively everywhere else, from Garriston to Idoss to\nRu to Ox Ford,” Kip said. “Now he changes?”\n“If we leave Dúnbheo, he can paint us as abandoning them to die. If we\ndon’t leave, he can paint us as cowards abandoning Green Haven to die.\nThat’s worth a few weeks for him, isn’t it?” Ben-hadad said.\nBig Leo said, “Does it give us enough time to call back the Night\nMares?”\nI should’ve kept the Night Mares with me, scouting. If I had, this never\nwould have happened.\nMoving fast doesn’t help if you move exactly the wrong direction. Dim\npeople ride a mule to their conclusions; bright ones ride a racehorse. But\nnot always in the right direction.\n“No,” Kip said. “They’re our fastest troops. That’s why I sent them.\nBefore any messengers could catch up with them, they’d have split in a\nhundred directions anyway, trying to rally the villages.”\n“So have we already lost?” Ben-hadad asked. He was skipping ahead of\nthe rest of them to the final judgment. That was just how fast his mind\nworked. Ben might well become a great general in time, but his true genius\nlay with the machinae he could imagine, and then actually make, and then\nperfect. Few people could do even one of those things.\nOf them all, Ben-hadad was the one who should change history—and\nwould, if Kip didn’t get him killed first.\nKip pulled back his sleeve where the Turtle-Bear tattoo was vibrant with\nall the colors he’d recently drafted. “Turtle-bears can do many things, but\none thing they’re shit at: they don’t know how to give up.”\n“Are you telling me you have a plan?” Cruxer asked.\n“Does this have something to do with why you went to the window\nyesterday?” Ben-hadad asked.\nThe crowd today, as Tisis had predicted, was easily twice as large.\nThe seals on the door cracked open, but there was the appropriate knock,\nso no one was alarmed. Tisis came in. Kip was glad to see her. “News?” he\nasked.\nShe nodded. “I have an update on our… cicatriferous friend.”\nPrivate nicknames were useful when you were worried about being\noverheard, so they’d privately coined that for Daragh the Coward, who was\nfamous for his many scars.\n“Good news, I hope?” Kip asked.\n“No,” she said. She looked ill. “But there’s something else first.”\nShe blew out a breath as she looked around at the Mighty. She tossed her\npetasos onto the table. “I’m in charge of the scouts. This map is mine. Kip\ninvented it, but all the intel on it is work I cleared. It’s all from interviews I\nconducted, reports I checked. I’m responsible for what’s on it and for\nwhat’s not.

I still have no idea\nhow Koios took the river without me hearing about it. There are rumors\nnow about river monsters, which I assume and really hope are river wights\n—I don’t know, and I still can’t confirm them. Regardless, it’s an enormous\nfailure. I’ve got people checking everything, but it may be weeks before we\nknow what went wrong. There should have been some refugee, some report.\nMaybe there was. Maybe I filtered it out. I must have. I’ve got ideas about\nwhat happened, but I’m not even going to offer guesses right now. Not after\nthis.”\nTucking an errant strand of blonde hair behind an ear, she looked at\neveryone in turn around the table, except Kip. “I failed you, and I’m sorry.\nIt won’t happen again.”\nThere was only silence. No one protested that she hadn’t bungled things\nbadly.\nShe looked over at Winsen. “If you give me shit, Win—”\n“I won’t,” he said.\n“… I’ll deserve it,” she said, finishing over his words.\nHe looked at her one moment more. Then he shrugged. “I won’t.”\nDammit, Winsen, don’t you go surprising me with a glimmer of\nhumanity.\nFinally she looked at Kip, “My lord. I failed you most of all. I’d like to\noffer my—”\n“Denied. Give us your report,” he said.\nShe didn’t want anything soft from him, not after such a failure, not in\nfront of these men, whose acceptance she craved so much.\nThey accepted her as one of the Mighty, but she was different. It wasn’t\nor wasn’t only that she was a woman; Teia had obviously belonged with\nthem, different as her own abilities were from theirs. But Tisis feared they\nonly tolerated her for Kip’s sake. She feared they thought her weak because\nshe was no warrior.\nThe worst thing Kip could do in this moment was coddle her. It would\nalienate her from them forever.\nShe took a deep breath. “With the Blood Robe deserters and the refugees\nand escaped slaves from the war, I’ve been tracking upward of fifty bandit\ngroups, but I concentrated on Iphitos the Archer, Bardan the Grave Digger,\nColm the Cannibal, with Daragh the Coward having a smaller band, but\nclaiming territory we’ve traversed. I tried to get agents in with these various\nbandits, but each band requires anyone who joins to do one terrible thing or\nanother as initiation to weed out such infiltrators. Do you know how many\ngood guys are willing to murder innocent people in order to infiltrate a gang\nof bad guys?”\n“None, I’m sure,” Cruxer said.\nKip could think of one: Teia.\nHe didn’t say it, of course. Not to his wife.\n“Anyway, so I couldn’t get good sources, but now that Daragh the\nCoward’s army is within two days’ march, I’m working on getting figures\nof the composition of his forces now.”\nThey all chewed on that."

You think we can buy him off?” Ben-hadad\nsaid.\n“With what money?” Ferkudi asked.\n“You were saying, earlier? About a plan?” Cruxer prompted Kip.\nThere were few options, and none of them good. No use bemoaning it.\nKip said, “Pull the last remaining Night Mares we have from messenger\nduty. Send them to surround Daragh the Coward’s camp tonight and\ntomorrow. Tell them to let themselves be seen, though. Then move\nstealthily to another side of their camp and be seen again. They’re to do all\nthey can to appear to be a much larger force.” Kip looked around the room,\nseeing sudden hope in some of their faces. He trusted these men with his\nlife. He trusted them even with his fallibilities. “Truth is, calling it a plan\nwould be generous. And it relies way too much on an open question.”\n“What’s that?” Ferkudi asked.\n“What’s an ‘open question’?” Winsen asked him. “‘Well, you see, son,\nwhen a mommy question and a daddy question love each other very much\n—’”\nIn unison, Big Leo, Ben-hadad, and Cruxer said, “Shut up, Win.”\n“What’s the question?” Cruxer asked, trying to get them back on track,\nas ever.\nKip said, “How much am I really Gavin Guile’s son?”\nChapter 11\nAliviana had stood in place for two thousand seven hundred seconds, hands\nfolded in front of her, chin high. In their hundreds, the petitioners had\nvacated the hall. Gods don’t inconvenience themselves for mortals.\nBut apparently, they do inconvenience one another. Her patience had\nworn thin after the first six hundred and twenty seconds. It was such a\ntransparent power play to make her wait while he took his time that her\nestimation of the White King fell by the minute.\nThen she realized he wasn’t merely waiting to see if he could goad her\ninto some outburst; he was taking counsel. He sat silent on his throne with\nthe air of one listening to attendants. Very interesting. She would have to\nspeak with Beliol about that later.\n“Your old love is in Dúnbheo,” the White King said finally.\n“He humiliated the forces you sent to take the city, you mean.” Of\ncourse she’d told Koios about Kip, a long time ago. Including that the love\nhad been one way, and the other way. None of which mattered now. What\nmattered was letting Koios know she had her own means of knowing\nthings.\nBut he didn’t look surprised she knew. “I’d have preferred to crush\nyoung Guile, but entangling him will serve almost as well. If my generals\nfail in the task I leave them, I can return when my reign is secure with ten\ntimes the forces and all the gods. His time is almost finished.”\nHe was studying her as if this were a test. “Do you think I care?” she\nasked.\n“Don’t you?” he asked."

His time is almost finished.”\nHe was studying her as if this were a test. “Do you think I care?” she\nasked.\n“Don’t you?” he asked.\nShe thought about it, really thought about it. “I… liked Kip,” she said\nfinally. “Really liked him, actually. Not in the puppy-panting-after-my-heels\nway that he liked me, naturally. But he was a good kid. Too damaged,\nthough. Too self-loathing for one to ever really take him seriously. Who\nneeds all that? But I… admired that he was loyal. He tried to do what was\nright, no matter the cost. I see now that that was a weakness. He took\nloyalty to illogical extremes. You can’t help others when you’re dead\nyourself. It’s a miracle he’s not dead already, come to think of it. Kip… Kip\nhas always been doomed, hasn’t he? I shall miss him, but mortals die. It is\nour burden to watch their lights bloom in the darkness and then fade back\ninto it after a few short years, isn’t it? I shall mourn his passing—no, no,\nthat’s not exactly true, and will be less true as time goes on. I shall note his\ndeath when I learn of it, perhaps even regretfully, so whether I do that now\nor in some years, what’s the difference?”\n“Here I thought you came to threaten me,” the White King said.\n“Threaten?” she asked, surprised.\n“You’ve refused to bend the knee to me. Your message spoke of a\npartnership instead, so surely you have some ‘or else,’” Koios said. He sat\ndown now on his ivory throne as if she were merely another petitioner come\nto beg some favor of him. It was a power display, to sit when the other must\nstand. He even pretended nonchalance, but his muscles, though bent into a\nslouch, were taut for action.\nShe noticed such things. She had quite the eye for detail now.\n“Oh, I see,” she said. “That helps immensely. You’re taking me being\nenslaved to you as the default, so my defiance of that order irks you, and\nyou assume I must have some force backing me up, some power that allows\nme to insult you to your face by not groveling. That is quite illuminating.\nInstead, the true default is that we each reign over separate realms, and we\ncan either join together—if such is mutually profitable—or we can go to\nwar, which most certainly would not be. Comprehending easily this truth,\nwhich seems to have eluded you, I spoke of partnership.”\n“That is not the way of things.”\n“Aha,” she said. “So. You’re not quite the ideologue you pretend to be,\nbringing a new order of justice and freedom to the realms; you’re simply a\nmaniac. Well, then, I can deal with that, too.”\nHis eyes flashed and he sat up. His bodyguards rippled as if they were\ndirectly connected to his will—which, she thought, perhaps they were. She\nwould have to study that. His lungs filled. At his neck, his pulse throbbed\nfaster.\n“In that case,” she said before he could go on, “you want threats of me."

They made her eyelid twitch. “Perhaps you require a\ndisplay of power? Really? The king of the djinn needs that?”\nSuddenly, he grinned despite himself. Then he laughed. “I think I missed\nyou, Liv.”\nShe didn’t like being called Liv anymore. But she held her tongue.\n“No one speaks to me that way. Not anymore. Not that I like it, mind\nyou,” he said. “But it seems that when one bans certain kinds of talk, it\ndoesn’t just stop that one thing; it radiates out and silences so much. I hold a\nhumorless court, I’m afraid, and I’m probably somewhat to blame for that.”\nProbably? Somewhat?\nBut again, she held her tongue.\n“We can skip the displays of power,” he said, “but… it’s the ‘God of\nGods,’ if you will.”\n“‘Gods’ plural? You got two of them to worship you? Which ones?” she\nasked.\nHis bodyguards went wide-eyed. That was helpful to her new study. It\ntold her they still had some will of their own.\n“All of them,” the White King said flatly.\n“Surely not dry old Samila Sayeh.”\n“They all worship me,” the White King said.\n“If you define ‘worship’ as bowing at the right times, lighting incense,\nand mumbling prayers, I’m sure that’s true.”\n“I am their god,” the White King said.\n“That, however, I’m certain is not true. What’s the point in being a god\nif you have to worship another god? No. They don’t really worship you;\nthey fear you. Which is excellent, as far as it goes. Fear is a powerful\nmotivator, though one that may fade in time. They remember what you\nwere, and they do or will hope to transform themselves as you have\ntransformed yourself. You are not categorically other to them. One can\nrevere what one wishes to emulate. One can’t revere what one wishes to\nreplace. I’m sure each one will serve you for a time, and then you can kill\nthem and replace them. The replacements will serve much longer, never\nhaving known you as merely a man. The new gods, if not corrupted by the\nold ones, may then revere you indeed, and then your reign will be secure.\nOr more secure. But it will take a few purges.”\nThe pique faded, and she watched his mouth quirk backward\nmomentarily as his lower eyelids tensed.\n“You’re asking yourself,” she said, “‘Is she the first to guess my plan, or\nonly the first to do so to my face?’”\n“You don’t fear me,” he said. “That makes you more dangerous than any\nof them.”\n“Not true on the first part, and for the second, it really depends what you"

My mortal nature hasn’t\nfaded so much yet. But fear has lost much of its motivating power. I don’t\nwear your chain, and I tell the truth. That may make me dangerous. It also\ncan make me helpful, especially when one is surrounded by those who\nconstantly lie.”\n“Then tell me about Kip… truthfully,” he said.\n“Kip?”\n“Your threat.”\n“Oh, that. Well. I could work with him. Very easily. He’s never tried to\nkill me or make me his slave. I can trust him. All things I can’t say of you.”\n“And yet here you are,” Koios said. “Ready to make a deal to kill him\nand all his friends. How terribly ungrateful of you.”\nShe blinked. She’d not thought of gratitude in a long while. No matter.\n“I know I could trust Kip forever. But ‘forever’ is such a short span for\nmortals. Kip will die soon. He’s burning too hot, rising too fast, and loved\nby too many. He has something of greatness in him, and that makes small,\npowerful men feel small and powerless, and there’s nothing they hate\nmore.”\n“Says the girl goddess,” Koios said wryly.\n“Says the small, powerful man,” she said.\nHe was actually so shocked that he didn’t move at all for a long\nmoment. It must have indeed been long and long since he had felt genuinely\noffended.\n“The point is that you’re exactly right,” she said. “Kip and I have certain\nsimilarities in rising fast and high by our wits. What I—”\n“Did you know that an earthquake made the Red Cliffs? It thrust the\nseabed into the very sky. Those who climb still see the imprints of fishes a\nthousand paces above the sea. You see, in a great upheaval like that, or like\nthe coming of the God of Gods, mountains are plunged into the sea, and\nlow places are flung up to the heavens,” the White King said. “So when we\nfind fish on a mountaintop, let us not praise them too quickly for making the\nclimb.”\nLiv saw several of the bodyguards grinning, as if he’d really put her\nback in her place.\n“The point is,” Liv said, “Kip will die. I don’t intend to, ever, and I can’t\ntrust whomever comes after him to keep whatever deal we make, no matter\nwhat oaths we swear. If I align myself with the Chromeria, they’ll come\nafter me eventually. They’ll have to. By my very nature I’m an abomination\nto them. I’d forever be a compromise they made, and their… What was\nyour word again? Their ‘gratitude’ toward me would eventually die. Worse,\nso would their fear. You, however, won’t.”\n“Won’t… what? Betray you?”\n“Die. Or forget. I understand you. You and I have reached the same\nconclusion. Everything you’ve done has been predicated on your\nunderstanding coupled with intelligence and patience.”"

And they were\nbecoming less so as she grew into her full nature.\nShe had also nearly forgotten how painfully inefficient most\nconversations were. “May I continue?”\n“Please,” he said, and the symmetry of him saying ‘please’ to her in\nreturn for her earlier ‘please’ and thus closing the loop made her feel\ninordinately better.\n“You and I understand that the nine kingdoms were doomed to fall, not\nbecause of who won the Deimachia, but by the very fact of it. Once the War\nof the Gods began, all of them were doomed, and their kingdoms, too. The\nvery physics of this world are set against any one color dominating for long.\nAny can reign for a time, but with every additional year of the colors being\nout of balance, it takes more and more effort even to draft the dominant\ncolor, and less and less for one’s enemies to draft theirs. It’s a fool’s game,\nand you’re not that kind of fool. This is why you haven’t become a god\nyourself. Inside the system, you would be entrapped by the system. You\nwouldn’t be able to help attempting to dominate the colors. It is in the\nnature of the inner-spectrum colors to do so.”\n“But not of your color?” he said.\nShe scowled. Did he not know? “Do you not know?” she asked.\n“Enlighten me,” he said.\nShe scowled harder. If she lectured him on superviolet, she would want\nto tell him about chi, and whatever else he clearly didn’t understand. It was\nvery hard for her not to finish a thing once begun. It was one of the\nweaknesses of her color that she had noticed, and she wished to keep those\nfrom him for as long as possible. Still, if she wished to live through today,\nshe had to portray herself as just enough of a threat, and not too much, and\na wellspring of useful information—enough so as to get him to swear the\noath with her.\n“Superviolet stands far apart, is rational, and strictly abides oaths,” she\nsaid, introducing the idea. “Only chi is safer to you, but it’s so far from\nhuman concerns as to be useless. Plus they get cancers and die within a few\nyears. Blue is safe so long as the hierarchies above and below it are stable.\nGreen can be corralled if given enough freedom. Yellow believes itself to be\nperfectly positioned to stand atop that hierarchy, and is most dangerous.\nOrange is wily, but hates direct conflict. Red and sub-red must be\nmanipulated but are too chaotic to be threatening and are easily read and\ntherefore misled. Paryl is profoundly influenced by any color at all, and\ntherefore any magic.

If her mind and will\nweren’t destroyed by a long tutelage of being controlled by every magic,\none such might invert her weakness and attempt to control every magic\ninstead.\n“A less intelligent full-spectrum polychrome would have made himself\nthe yellow god, hoping to balance all the others. Instead, you seek\nsomething harder, to take power over all the gods at once, because once\nheld, that’s a power you could actually keep. You will become a king of\ndjinn. Or, apologies, a god of gods.”\n“Thank you,” the White King said.\nShe nodded.\n“And you, you hardly fear me at all?”\n“You’ll have better than my fear: you’ll know you can trust me.”\n“Really? You bear me no ill feeling for when that rash fool Phyros\nSeaborn tried to chain you with the black luxin?”\nShe shook her head, baffled. If Phyros Seaborn had put the living black-\nluxin necklace on her neck, it would have plunged through her very spine if\nshe’d tried to remove it or if she’d disobeyed the White King. She’d killed\nPhyros for trying to make her a slave. “Yours was a logical effort. Exactly\nwhat you should’ve attempted at the time. In truth, I resent you implying\nPhyros did it without your orders more than I resent the attempt.”\n“A mistake,” the White King said. “I was curious to see how far you’d\nembraced your godhood. A mortal would be furious with me.”\nIt struck her oddly. “I remember a peculiar joy in being carried along at\ntimes by fury. It made me feel powerful.” She shrugged. “That’s no longer\nnecessary. Nor is you chaining me.”\n“Oh?”\n“The power of order for one of my metaphysical nature is proportional\nto my power absolutely.”\nIt took him a moment to understand. “Ah. Ferrilux doesn’t lie.”\n“I suppose that’s close enough,” she said. If one disdains nuance.\nBut apparently she’d not kept her face blank.\nHis lip curled.\nShe remembered again that though she had left most emotion behind, he\nhad most certainly not. Her statements of fact could be taken as insufferable\narrogance. How tiresome. She sighed. “What it means is that if I take an\noath, I could break it, in my current state. But doing so would set me back\ntwo to three centuries. During all that time I would be vulnerable.”\n“And in two or three centuries?” he asked with a smile that showed no\ncontraction of the orbicularis oculi. It was not the part of his face that had\nbeen burned; thus the tell was true.\n“In two or three centuries I hope I shall never be in such a vulnerable\nposition that I shall need to take an oath.”\nHe gave a thin smile, as if she were a particularly dense child. “What\nI’m asking is, will you be able to break an oath you make, then?”\n“An oath bonds one’s will and one’s nature in a temporalized and\nexternal rubric,” she said.\nHe was nodding, but he had a blank look.\n“That’s the whole point of an oath,” she said.

How could a man of\nintelligence not see this immediately? “All liars weaken themselves, but\nbreaking an oath would break me. Besides,” she said, “we’ll give each other\nplenty of space.”\nHe raised his eyebrows.\n“When you win, King Koios, because of the way”—‘the stupid way,’\nshe didn’t say; she had to speak truth, but she didn’t have to speak all the\ntruth all the time—“you’ve chosen to wipe out most of your warriors and all\nthe Chromeria’s, you’ll be very, very weak for a decade or two. Stronger\nthan everyone else, however, so your weakness won’t matter. Unless…”\n“Unless?” His eyebrows knit.\n“You’ve heard the Everdark Gates are open? It’s true. And I can tell you\nthat the Angari wave-tamers have been truly fascinated this past year by\nwhat’s happening in their seas, and by what’s happening here. They’re\nhungry for new lands to conquer, and they believe that the Gates’ failure is a\nsign of favor from their gods.”\n“I’ll happily fight their gods with my own.”\n“Then you’ll die happily. The first wave they’re amassing is three times\nthe size of all your armies together, I should say. And I mean your armies\nnow, before all the losses you’ll take with this island siege you have\nplanned. Nor are they lacking for magic of their own. I’m no Gaspar\nEstratega, but I believe they would defeat you even if your forces and the\nChromeria’s fought united against them. However, you needn’t fight at all. I\ncan close the Everdark Gates again. And the Angari are seafaring people,\nwhose gods are sea gods. They have tamed creatures that are much like our\nown sea demons. But because they love only the sea, if the Gates are shut,\nthey will not attempt an attack through the mountains and the deserts that\nhave kept them from our lands for so long.”\n“You’ll save me from a threat that isn’t even real?” The condescending\nsmile crept back onto his face.\n“Send your people, then,” she said. “Confirm it for yourself. Time draws\nshort, but perhaps you have time if you’ve duplicated the skimmers by\nnow? No? Sad. But I assure you, if we don’t have an agreement before you\ninvade the Jaspers, I’ll fight for Kip. I’ll have to. Because afterward you\nwon’t need me, and I won’t be able to challenge you.”\n“How rational of you,” he said.\n“Was that supposed to be an insult?”\n“I hope you’ve also come up with some good reasons why I shouldn’t\nkill you now, bringing a threat like that here. Or have you forgotten so much\nabout fury?”\nShe was bored of this conversation. He treated her like a moron while\nacting like one himself half the time.\n“Do you need a list of my threats?” she asked. “Backup plans? Dead\nman’s switches? I have such things.

Instead, I would like today to be the last time we think of each\nother as adversaries. Let us instead become distant allies, brought together\nfor a short period to sort out our mutual concerns and then happily parting\nto do what we will with our own distant lands.”\n“So let’s run this hypothetical,” he said. “We make an alliance. A\npartnership, as you said. I need you now not to join Kip, and perhaps even\nto shut the Everdark Gates. And let’s say I accept that because of your\nnature, I can trust you forever. But I will grow in power far more than you\nwill, and I will close my vulnerabilities in time. Why would you trust me to\nkeep my oaths?”\n“Because I bring you a gift. Will-crafting. We’ve both done it in this\nroom this very day. Do you know why the Chromeria forbids will-crafting\nin all but the most rudimentary forms?”\n“They have an especial delight in forbidding things. I’ve given up caring\nwhy.”\n“You shouldn’t have. An oath binds one’s will to a word, but a drafter\ncan bind her will to something more permanent.”\nShe saw his eyes light up. He was a smart man. If an oath could be\nmagically binding, and anchored to something permanent, any drafter he\ncould force to take an oath of fealty to him would be unable to break that\noath—ever.\n“This works with gods?” he asked.\n“You won’t be as good at doing it as I am,” she said honestly. “And your\ngods will have a very long time to work against it. You’ll still have to kill\nthem, after a time. Yes, of course I know you plan to do that. Mortals,\nhowever? I wouldn’t say it’s permanent, but if it takes them a hundred years\nto unwind a spell and most of them don’t live half so long, that’s a\ndistinction without a difference, isn’t it? That is why the Chromeria\nabandoned an entire branch of magical study. It was one of the first pieces\nof lore the Chromeria erased. True slavery to the gods, for life.”\n“That is a handsome gift,” he said. “And now that you’ve given me the\nlead, perhaps that’s all I require of you.”\nA threat. Again. “It will likely take you a hundred years to find a\nsuperviolet who can do what I’ve already done, though maybe you’ll get\nvery lucky and it will only take you ten. But these next ten years are when\nyou’ll be most vulnerable. If you can live ten years, you’ll likely live\nforever. So I know you might kill me out of pique today, but I’m gambling\nthat you’ll take the deal where we both win, both in the short term and in\nthe long.”\n“What do you want?” he asked.\n“You can have all the lands of the Seven Satrapies.

With many, many words, the Divines communicated\ntheir chagrin at the assassination attempt and commitment to find those\nresponsible. They wished—they said—to help Kip and his marvelous\ncompanions in any way possible; therefore, he must understand that this\nparticular refusal wasn’t personal and this particular request was in fact\nimpossible and this small change Kip requested was one they were quite\nwilling to accommodate but would mortally offend some other important\ngroup (and that group’s support was necessary for the following list of\nreasons).\nYesterday, for many long minutes, Kip had actually listened to them.\nThey knew what they were talking about, after all. They had run this city\nfor generations. He’d adjourned the meeting with the thought that it was,\nfrankly, just damned hard to govern a city.\n“… which sadly has, from time immemorial, been the prerogative of the\nKeeper herself.”\n‘Prerogative.’ The word had stuck to Kip for some reason. Not because\nit was that odd of a word but because of the landscape of other words used\nby these old men (never an old woman on the Council of Divines, at least\nnot that survived into the records). ‘Prerogative’ joined ‘tradition’ and\n‘customs’ and even ‘demesne,’ the violation of any of which would either\n‘needlessly cause terrible offense’ or ‘deeply alienate’ or ‘create antipathy’\nor ‘endanger all you’ve accomplished.’\nThe circumlocutions suddenly sounded familiar, strumming an old and\nmuch-hated chord from his past: Kip was being handled.\nMother used to do this, with her drugs, listing all the reasons it was\nimpossible to quit just now.\nPower was the Divines’ drug, and Kip was threatening their supply.\nWhat would you do here, father? he’d asked himself.\nHow had Gavin done it? All Gavin’s life, he’d broken through all the\nhorseshit like this, upending other people’s games and yet emerging not\nonly unscathed but beloved.\nWell, let’s see: He was basically all-powerful, and he cajoled, charmed,\nand used wit and humor to take the edge off of whatever he was going to do\nanyway. Plus he was incredibly handsome, which never hurt. Oh, and when\npeople defied him, sometimes he’d kill all of them.\nSo no one went into a meeting with Gavin Guile entirely fearlessly,\nwhich meant that when he was charming instead, and told them how it was"

But\nthat hadn’t been a full plan, only an intuition of one.\nWhile the old men were conferring with one another again yesterday,\nKip had said to the Mighty, ‘I want to turtle-bear their porcelain shop and\ngive the old Divines a heart attack or three. Ideas?’\n‘Oh, I have ideas!’ Big Leo said.\n‘Ripping people’s arms off is not an idea,’ Kip said. ‘It’s a daydream.’\n‘You didn’t even let me tell you what I’d do with them,’ Big Leo\ncomplained.\n‘I didn’t say I didn’t share it,’ Kip said. Morning had expired, and with\nhis realization that he was being handled, so had his patience. ‘Also Lord\nGolden Briar has the worst breath I’ve ever smelled.’\n‘You’re telling me that’s his breath?’ Ben-hadad asked. ‘I thought—’\n‘Gentlemen,’ Cruxer said as the men came back.\n‘Yeah, we don’t know if they’re all deaf,’ Ferkudi said, too loudly. ‘I’ve\nbeen watching, and Lord Appleton is faking that old-man shuffle.’\nLord Appleton looked over.\n‘They’re none of them dumb, either,’ Kip said, carefully screening his\nmouth against lipreading with a lifted cup.\nWinsen hissed, ‘Unlike our pal whose name rhymes with Jerkudi.’\nAfter the meeting adjourned on more empty promises and stalling, Kip\nhad listened to his wife’s idea.\nSo today, they met the Divines in one of the side gardens, where Tisis\nmade much of the flowers. Then Kip suggested she see some of the exotics\nthe people had been bringing. In no hurry, they made their way to the front\nof the palace. Kip split his time between pleasantries to the old Divines and\ngreeting people waiting in the long queue to see Túsaíonn Domhan that\nwrapped around the building, more and more spending his time on the\npeople, much to the Divines’ consternation.\nFinally, on the way to the front of the palace, they picked up the\nhundreds of admirers to whom Kip had waved yesterday. Cruxer had not\nbeen a fan of this part of the plan, but the people kept a respectful distance\nonce the Mighty demonstrated what that was. They themselves weren’t\nquite certain what they wanted of Kip.\nThe Divines looked more and more uncomfortable, but when Lord\nAodán Appleton suggested reconvening inside, Kip pretended not to hear.\nAnd finally, they made it to the mound of flowers that had been piled out in\nfront of the palace, partly in thanks to Kip’s Nightbringers for liberating the\ncity and partly to cover the smell of the putrefying and still hanging Divine\nand conn."

The stench was nearly intolerable. Kip stopped at the top of the\nsteps as Tisis pretended to admire the flowers here. The Divines were\npainfully aware of their dead compatriots nearby, though none dared look at\nthem.\nKip said, “You’ve told me we need a full council to have a quorum to\nvote on certain matters, matters that must be decided immediately. So let’s\nagree—”\n“New councillors! Yes!” Lord Rathcore said. “Just what a conn is for!”\n“A conn?” Kip asked as if this were a surprise. It was supposed to be a\ngreat honor, and they’d been trying to extract all sorts of concessions from\nhim in return while only hinting it might be possible. In reality, he was\nbeing asked to pay for the privilege of eating two slices of warm bread\nhiding a turd.\nBeing named conn was an honor, and it would give him legitimacy that\nwasn’t derived from his father or grandfather. It would be something he’d\nearned himself. He wanted that, and they obviously sensed that.\nBut by law and tradition, a conn had significant limits to his power here.\nBy assenting to a defined role and swearing to its oaths, Kip would be\nassenting to its limits, too. The Divines weren’t offering a gift; they were\noffering Kip chains decorated with gold filigree.\n“No,” Kip said. “I don’t have time for the frippery and delay. I’ll give\nyou my suggestions. You can approve them if you do so unanimously, yes?\nI suggest Lady Proud Hart and Lady Greenwood.”\nTheir heads did not literally explode, but several of them turned shades\nredder.\n“My lord,” Lord Appleton said, “we could make you conn within the\nhour. It would honor our ways, and then perhaps we might even”—he\nlooked like he was trying to swallow a mouthful of salt—“come to an\nagreement on one of those noble matriarchs.”\n“You’re not hearing me,” Kip said. “I don’t want the position.” He was\nfeeling red, and he almost insulted the pointless position itself—which\nwould have been an insult to the whole city.\n“Milord,” Lord Spreading Oak said patiently as if trying to counsel\nreason, “becoming conn is the only way for you to accomplish all you think\nyou need to do.”\n“Funny,” Kip said, “the last conn believed that was true, too.” He looked\nup at the hanged, rotting Conn Hill. “Tell me, Lord Spreading Oak, if a man\nhas as much power as a king but not the name, is he more or less than a\nking?”\nBy long tradition and by an explicit oath as he took office, a conn\ncouldn’t become a king.

Can\nyou find it in your hearts to help me, please?”\nThe crowd heard only that Kip wanted to save them, again, and that the\nDivines were somehow driving him out of the city instead. Ugly\nsuggestions rippled through them, and the air took on a palpable menace.\nThe Divines looked at the mob uneasily, and then at each other.\nChapter 13\n“My mama suicided just like that,” Gunner announced, heedless of all cues.\nGavin lay stretched out sunning himself on the hard, unforgiving deck of\nthe ship’s forecastle, his eyes closed, still adjusting to the harsh, bleached\nsunlight of freedom after his long stint in darkness.\nGunner’s voice was like a child pounding on the door when you’re in\nthe middle of a bad lay: Gavin wasn’t enjoying himself as much as he’d\nexpected, but what he was doing was a lot more enjoyable than what he was\nbeing called to do.\n“I’m sorry to hear that, Captain,” he said, shading his eyes and cracking\nthem open briefly—only because Gunner was the kind of man who might\nstomp on Gavin’s head if he thought he wasn’t being shown the proper\nrespect.\nGavin had told himself he needed to get sun, needed to get his eyes\nreaccustomed to the light, needed to feel the light on his skin in case just\nmaybe his disability was healing itself. Or something.\nHe was better at lying to others, though, than to himself. No, Gavin was\nlying about, seeking an idyll and finding himself merely idle.\nClosing his eyes as if to fend off the captain through his obvious\nexhaustion, Gavin reached out his fingertips, wishing they might dip into\nthe sapphire waters as they had that morning he touched the sea demon.\nEyes? Eye. Funny how he still thought of them in the plural, while at\nother times he couldn’t ignore the jagged black monstrosity strapped to him\nin that eye patch, feeling like it was trying to burrow into his head.\n“Y’ain’t gonna ask, is ya?” Gunner said.\nHe moved into Gavin’s sun, swaying with the waves, so that Orholam’s\none eye blinded Gavin’s one eye only half the time.\nInstead of conjuring that morning of peace, arms spread touching the\nwaters, and that numinous creature, the memory that came swimming\nserpentine to the surface was of the day he’d been shackled spread-eagled"

When she\nwasn’t burning out people’s eyeballs with a white-hot poker, she was\nprobably quite nice.\nHa. People had thought the same of him, on Sun Days, as he slaughtered\nso many.\n“That evil eye of yourn,” Gunner said with a shudder. That was his\ncharming name for the black jewel that would kill Gavin if he tried to\nremove it. “It still shivs me the givers.”\nGo away, Gunner.\nCome to think of it, perhaps many had denounced Gavin for the fraud he\nwas, but his circle of privilege had kept those cries from his ears.\n“Kin I touch it?” Gunner asked.\n“Probably kill us both if you do. Go ahead.”\nWhat if Grinwoody—traitorous monster that he was—while certainly an\nasshole, was fundamentally correct? Gavin—nice and charismatic man that\nhe was—had certainly served a monstrous function. All of the empire’s\npower was predicated on its control of drafters: identifying, training,\ndistributing, and then eliminating them.\nEliminating them? No. Executing them for crimes they might commit.\nThe Chromeria did this by defining morality and medicine for their own\nends. They said that like dementia striking an elderly person, breaking the\nhalo has no moral dimension. It’s a sad, natural process that leads to a\nperson acting contrary to their own character, and in ways that are terribly\ndestructive. Gavin had fought wights; he’d seen the destruction they could\nwreak. Could.\nBut the Chromeria coupled this with a moral injunction. It’s not wrong\nto break the halo, but it’s wrong to run if you do. It’s good, they said, to die\nright before you do. They said it’s not suicide to volunteer to be killed. It’s\nserving your community.\nThey defined Life as one of Orholam’s Great Gifts, but carved out a\nremarkable exception. To most of the world, a drafter who’d served their\ncommunity for one or two decades went on a last pilgrimage—Sun Day at\nthe Chromeria—and simply never came back.\nDrafters simply only lived to forty or forty-five. That was the way it\nwas.\nBut Gavin had been the instrument of that brutal reality, ramming the\nknife through ribs, vomiting empty prayers at black heavens painted white.\nHis conscience revolted at what he did, and he did it anyway.\nHe was the monstrous fist inside the velvet glove. If an institution\nrequires the monstrous in order to operate—requires, not commits\nincidentally, requires in an essential way—is it not therefore itself\nfundamentally monstrous?\nCan one commit murder and walk away clean?\nGunner huffed some sound between a grunt and a bark, still standing\nthere. He hadn’t touched Gavin’s eye, but he’d been watching him all the\nwhile.\n“What kinda shit horse is this? I get me a broken Guile?”\nIf an institution presents itself as uniquely moral but is secretly"

I get me a broken Guile?”\nIf an institution presents itself as uniquely moral but is secretly\nmonstrous, isn’t that proof that its very ideas are corrupt and corrupting,\nrather than that only some few of its practitioners are corrupt?\nThe implications were horrifying.\nIf the Chromeria was fundamentally corrupt, then they were all of them\n—the Chromeria, the Broken Eye, and the Blood Robes—equally horrific.\nAll committed evil, and all excused their own evil as necessary.\nMaybe it was worse than that. It wasn’t that each defined the good\ndifferently and thus excused different evils; it was that right and wrong\nwere meaningless concepts: there was only what flavor of power you\npreferred.\nCan good fruit come from a bad tree?\n“Blackberries,” Gunner said, moving out of the sun once more, allowing\nOrholam’s cursed eye to dazzle Gavin.\n“What?” Gavin asked, grimacing against the light. “She killed herself\nwith blackberries? How? The brambles?”\n“No, that just sorter popped in me eggshelf. Egg bone? Shell. Eggshell.”\nHe rapped on his forehead with his knuckles. “Words, sentences, you know,\nnot my own? Popped in there? Happens to ever’one, right?”\n“Yeah, sure, right—no, no. I don’t follow at all. How’d your mom die?”\nIt was the most delicate way Gavin could think of to ask about a suicide.\nSeemed like Gunner wanted to talk about it, and Gavin probably needed to\nhumor the man. He propped himself up on an elbow, squinting at the man\nstanding over him.\n“Wrong question,” Gunner said. “You got it sorter back swords,\ndon’tcha?”\nOrholam help him, either Gunner was starting to make more sense, or\nhis madness was contagious, because Gavin understood him perfectly.\nHe blew a long-suffering sigh. Very well. He sat up. He knew what\nGunner meant about the wrong question. He was to ask not, ‘How did she\ndie, Gunner?’ but, ‘How’d she live?’\nOddly, with Gunner, this would actually be the quicker way to get to\nhow she died (and thus, get him to go the hell away) than trying to get a\nstraight answer. Gunner seemed a bit bored being a captain when there was\nneither ship nor storm to fight. He’d already trained his new crew to some\nacceptable degree of proficiency on the many cannons that worked in\nconcert, and now even that diversion was denied him, as he’d decided to\nconserve the rest of their powder for the dangers to come.\n“Smart man, y’are, Yer Guileship.” Gunner grinned the big, happy gap-\ntoothed grin of a man who was rarely understood and who prized it when he\nwas.\nGunner took a deep breath, spat in the waves, muttered a curse to Ceres,\nand made the sign of the seven. “She uz pregnant most ’er time. Not with\nmy pa’s brats, and that was clear as the Atashian shallows, him bein’ a\nsailor, en’ gone most the time."

Not that he were the subject of any\nhagioglyphics his ownself. Probably had ’least four other wives in other\nports. He was the marrying sort. Gave my mama nothing but baby-batter\nand beatings, though. Finally died, or got took slave, I guess.\n“I got my luck from her, though, cuz she mat a good man after that.\nDidn’t beat her once, not even when she ast for it. Treated us li’l brats like\n’is own, though we were a right handful a hell and hot coals. Arranged\napprenticery for me, and afore he put me on a ship he taught me to fight so I\nwouldn’t be made a buttboy.\n“But kin you believe? All that good he done us, and Mama cheated on\nhim, too. Some folk—my mama, me, you—we got the devil in us, Guile.\nCanna go straight, no gatter how many second chances we met.”\nGatter? Met?\nMatter. Get. No matter how many second chances we get.\nAh, Gavin thought. It had been a while since he’d heard the pirate speak\nat length. It took some getting used to.\nAgain Gunner spat over the gunwale with a muttered curse at Ceres.\n“Papa didn’t learn it out, but I did. I punched her in the face and gave\nher the raspy side a’ my tongue. But I didn’t hell tim neither. I had little\nbrothers and sisters. What would they do without ’im, if he left ’er? Mama\nwas so keen on makin’ the beast with two backs with any dangerous man\nwhat winked at her that she never even noticed she uz setting her own\nhouse on fire by doin’ it—with all us kids inside, burnin’. She was pregnant,\nthat’s what for I hit her in the face. She told ’im the black eye was from\nfalling down. Uz a better lie than you’d think. Only thing she was ever good\nat was gettin’ on her back in a hurry.”\nPlease don’t tell me you murdered her.\n“S’pose the harpies took vengeance on her, since no one else would.\nSomethin’ broke in ’er after she shat out that last babe. One night after we\nwere all asleep, she cut her arms up good, almost bled dry. Papa patched her\nup. Never seen a man what done nothin’ wrong look so hunted.\n“Mama went on crying and carrying on most every day. Elgin, she\nnamed him. Algae, we all said. The baby, right?”\n“Right,” Gavin said. He felt sick to his stomach already, and he was\nworried this was only going to get worse.\n“Pa was a smith. One day, when he wouldn’t stop cryin’, Mama quick\nsnatched up Pa’s hammer, and laid li’l Algae down on the workbench, lined\nhim up good—she uz gonna smash his head, we thought. Then she stopped\nherself, and she smashed her hand instead, smashed it jelly, kept smashing."

That wet, sloppy sound and her screamin’ won’t never come\nout me ears. Hear the echoes to this day, rattlin’ from cliff to cliff inside my\nskull. Said she had ta be punished for wantin’ a do such a thing.”\nFuck, Gunner! I am trying to enjoy some goddam sunshine!\n“To save her life, Pa had to cut the hand off and burn the stump dry and\nsizzly, while she cursed him and screamed and asked to die. I hope you\nnever have to hear yer mama beggin’ ta die, Guile.”\nNo, mine didn’t beg. She asked politely, and I killed her politely. Thanks\nfor the reminder of that, asshole.\n“We thought she was gettin’ better, after that. Healin’. I was jus’ ’bout to\nship out. Her ‘little man,’ she called me. Made her so proud, she said. Not\nthat it should mean much coming from her, she said. Broken woman, Guile.\nIt ain’t how it s’pos’d ta be. Well, one day she puts on her finest and\nwanders out to the bog. Lays down and spreads her arms out lick thet. Lick\nwhat you done earlier.\n“Someone saw her. Threw her a rope, but the whole area was too\ntreach’rous to get close. She wouldnae take the rope, right at her hand.\nHelp, that near. I s’pose she reckoned she’d take different kinder escape.\nThatcher—that’s who threw the rope—ran to get help. But when we all\ncome, she was gone. Sunk.”\nGavin had entertained the notion at first that maybe Gunner was making\nsport of him, that he was going to reveal this was all a tale simply to wind\nhim up and pass a few minutes of boredom at sea. Now he didn’t think so.\nNot at all.\nThe bouncy, ceaselessly grinning and hollering and spitting pirate who,\nhaving been raised amid a cacophony of accents himself, veered wildly\nbetween all of them and none, who covered his habitual malapropisms and\nneologisms by purposely creating as many as possible so that he might\nbecome larger than life—that legend was suddenly simply a slender Ilytian\nman, hitting middle age earlier than he ought, his face drawn, eyes haunted\nby things forever lost.\nGunner said, “I held this mammary like a puzzle box.”\nMammary? Oh no. Memory. Don’t laugh, Gavin. For the sake of all that\nis holy, do not laugh right now when Gunner’s feeling this vulnerable.\n“Puzzle box?” Gavin said. He cleared his throat. He deliberately looked\nup at the burning white of a celestial eye as bleached of all color as his own\neye was. The pain braced him.\n“Aye. The mam’ry. I squeeze it, palpate it, grab it with both hands, twist\nit round, pinch at it, trya sink my teeth in t’ it…”\nDon’t. Even. Grin.\nGunner had to be putting him on. But Gavin looked at the man, and he\ngave no indication of levity."

Prob’ly e’ryone who looks oft a cliff thinks a taking the\nsharp drop with a sudden stop. E’ery sailor has thought of takin’ that swim\nwhat fattens sharks. We all got the black moment when the evil eye of the\nbarrel dares a starin’ contest. And we’re all a hair trigger’s pull from the\nmusket’s dare. It’s the devil’s gift, ain’t it? It’s the heritage o’ man, aye?”\nGavin’s moment of humor had dried to a desert.\nThough surely some folk lived who’d never known what it was like to\nonly just barely hold on to life by your bloody fingernails, Gavin certainly\ndid.\n“Aye,” he said quietly.\n“But lyin’ in a bog? Lettin’ yourself sink slow? That requires real\ndedication.” He snorted suddenly. “Heh. What’s a real commitment to\ndying, Guile?”\n“Huh?”\n“Deadication. Eh? Eh?”\nBut the flare of amusement faded faster than a flintlock’s flash. Gunner\nsquatted down close to him and in a low and somber tone, he said, “Tell me,\nGuile, do you reckon, at the better end, as the bog muck closed slow o’er\nher face, as she sucked it in and coughed on that first lungful… you reckon\nshe fought to live?”\nIt was a question as dangerously loaded as the pistols at the quicksilver\npirate’s hips.\n“I hope so,” Gavin said quietly.\nBut it seemed Gunner wasn’t even listening. He stood and looked away.\n“Thatcher said afore he run to get help, Mama was muttering about\nCeres, calling her goddess of crops, fertility, or some such… He said my\nmama was begging Ceres for sumpin’. Odd, what? Everyone knows Ceres\nis the bitch of the sea.” Gunner spat overboard.\nHe went on. “Hungry goddess, either way, I s’pose. She who gives so\nmuch takes all she wants, too. As if it’s right. But I don’t think ennyun\nshould go out like thet, stretched out like an offering afore god or goddess\nor man. I reckon I’d ruther go to the roar of the cannon.” He jumped up on\nthe barrel of a huge cannon that dominated the forecastle. He obviously had\nfeelings for it, as other men adore their horse or a sword. “Maybe double or\ntriple load and let rip. If I can’t have it, no one can, eh?”\n“I… suppose,” Gavin said, frowning. It sounded like a damnable waste"

It sounded like a damnable waste\nto him.\n“Just like magic for you, then, eh?” Gunner turned and watched Gavin’s\nexpression sharply, while he still stood on the cannon, nearly over the water,\narms not even extended for balance.\n“I… What?”\n“You can’t have it, no one can?” Gunner pressed.\n“Uh…”\n“That’s what you’re doing. Ain’t it? Killin’ magic. All of it. For\neveryone. I was there. I heard the old man. Be a different world without\nmagic, sure as a sailor on shore leave is on the look for tipples and nipples.”\nBy Orholam’s unseeing eye. Gunner was a sly old dog, wasn’t he?\nIt was all a setup. Not the cruel kind Gavin suspected to make fun of\nhim, but a vulnerable kind that was far more clever. ‘Look, I’ve opened up\nwith you. Why don’t you open up with me?’\nBut Gunner was no Andross Guile. Having committed to telling his\nstory to get Gavin to open up in turn, Gunner had told his own tale fully and\ntruly. Now, feeling overexposed, he’d barely remembered his initial purpose\nin telling Gavin at all.\nGunner now only wanted to distract Gavin from the wound he’d\nunwittingly revealed.\n“Oh, I see,” Gavin said.\n“You hafta!”\n“Uh. Right. And I do.”\n“Half ta. Cuz you only got the one eye,” Gunner said. “Instead a two?\nNever mind. Not very bright sometimes, are ya, Guile? Go on.”\nThere was something about being called stupid by an illiterate that\nrankled more than it ought to have, but Gavin held back. He said, “You\nwant to know if I’m going to do… his bidding.” Curse you forever,\nGrinwoody.\nGavin couldn’t say the name without risking that black jewel shooting\nthrough his brain. He didn’t even know if he could talk about his mission to\nkill Orholam—which Grinwoody thought was simply an impersonal nexus\nof magic. Grinwoody, at least, thought sticking the Blinding Knife into that\nnexus would kill all magic in the world.\n“I do,” Gunner said. “Seems ya change every time I lay my orisons on\nya. Yer name, your face, number of eyeballs and fingers, sometimes your\nheart. But you were never a quitter, not even when I had you pull that oar.\nNever gave up. Till now.”\nGunner’s point was something else entirely, but Gavin couldn’t get past\nhow he’d put ‘when I had you pull that oar.’ Oh, yes, let’s do pretend my\nenslavement was nothing personal, you piece of human—\nThen again, maybe it hadn’t been.\nAs Prism, Gavin’s own murders had fallen like rain on the heads of the\njust and the unjust alike.\nShit.

Like so many of the nobles of the Seven Satrapies, he didn’t\nmuch resemble the people he was supposed to represent. Here in fair Blood\nForest, he was dark-skinned, with light eyes and curly hair, and a sheen of\nsweat on his forehead despite the coolness of the morning.\nKip couldn’t help but hate him a little. The man was a vision of what\nKip would’ve become if he’d never joined the Blackguard.\nHe waved the man over to stand beside him while he examined his maps\nagain. From all the refugees who’d come here before the siege, Tisis had\ngathered a wealth of new intelligence for Kip’s maps. In no small part, she\nwas trying to see how she’d missed Koios’s getting around them to take the\nriver with her scouts never hearing of it. Messengers were coming and\ngoing constantly, adding new points to the map even now, chatting in quiet\nvoices. Currently, Tisis was working with four drafters and Sibéal Siofra to\nadd points to the map. The pygmy woman wore a fresh demeanor and new\nclothes to go with it. There was a new self-respect that joined beautifully\nwith her previous professionalism.\n“Hello, Ambassador,” Kip said. “Welcome to my humble council.” He\ndidn’t say ‘court.’ Not yet.\n“A pleasure to be received so graciously. An excellent day to you,\nLuíseach.”\nThe words stopped even Tisis, who met Kip’s gaze quickly.\nMaybe if they lived long enough to become an old married couple\nsomeday, they’d be able to have whole conversations with a glance. Right\nnow, all they said was simply, ‘What?!’\nIn a voice that sounded overly casual even to his own ears, Kip said,\n“I’ve not claimed that title. Why would you claim it for me?”\nThe man patted his forehead with a handkerchief, but when he spoke,\nthere was no reticence in his voice. “You’re busy saving this satrapy, so I’ll\nbe as direct as people say you are: you let others claim you to be the\nLuíseach when it serves your purposes, and back off when it seems\ndangerous. Oh, don’t get me wrong, I don’t blame you. Problem with\nclaiming a prophecy is that you have to fulfill all the conditions of it,\nthough, huh?”\n“You’ve come to play games,” Kip said. He wondered if this\nconversation would have been different if they’d held it in the palace’s great\nhall. As it was, this parlor now held only a few hundred scrolls and tomes,"

As it was, this parlor now held only a few hundred scrolls and tomes,\ngleaming wood in the natural-unnatural patterns the old joiners here had\nloved, and only those courtiers closest to him. The Mighty were all here,\neither on guard, or at the window, or sending or awaiting messages from\ntheir other duties—other than Big Leo, who was demonstrating his mastery\nof the soldier’s art of sleeping anywhere. The big man was sitting at the end\nof the map table, head back, even as his hands draped protectively over a\nbrace of lamb shanks on a plate in front of him so the servants wouldn’t\ntake them away while he dozed.\nA few other servants and palace slaves were bringing and taking letters\nand assisting Tisis with the great map, but it was nowhere near the crowd\nthat would have attended an official audience, had Kip given one.\nCome to think of it, a year ago, Kip would have thought this was quite a\ncrowd. He was growing accustomed to a life lived before others. It was\nchanging him.\n“No games,” Ambassador Red Leaf said. “But we’ve work to do, and\nrapidly, you and me. I simply wanted to show you I’m not a fool.”\n“Many would consider showing your cards immediately to be foolish\nindeed,” Kip said. My grandfather, for one, the best player of them all.\n“Many would. But not you. You have shown yourself capable of\nwielding the truth like a scalpel, but you prefer to use it as a hammer. You\nlike to shock people into silence by telling truths they can’t believe you’d\nactually say.”\nKip said nothing. This man thought he was clever. Perhaps he was.\nTruth was, Kip was a little unnerved. He’d never been aware of being\nstudied before.\n“Then let us be direct,” Kip said. “What do you want of me?”\nIt had been Andross who told him to use the truth like a hammer.\nAndross, whom Kip could never equal, would have twisted this fat little\nman before him into knots, and had him thanking him for the pleasure.\n“Satrap Willow Bough wants your army.”\n“Oh, he does?” Kip asked, all doe-eyed innocence.\n“Don’t make me bare my throat for nothing, my lord. I’m trying to avoid\nwasting your time.”\nKip nodded his head magnanimously, granting the point as a certain\nsomeone did when a stupid person made a surprisingly good point. He’d\nseen that damned nod enough. “What power do you have to negotiate?”\n“Total.”\nKip paused for the second time in this brief conversation. He knew to let\nhis arched brows and silence do all the work, but he said, “Meaning…?”\n“Total. Without you Green Haven will fall. We’ve sent a hundred\nmessages begging the Chromeria’s help, Ruthgar’s help, the pirate kings’\nhelp, anyone’s help—appealing to treaties, to honor, to greed. We’ve\noffered anything and everything.

To save his satrapy, he would\ntrade his very life, or if he must, his city.”\n“Interesting,” Kip said. “I hadn’t heard he was stupid.”\nAmbassador Red Leaf didn’t so much as blink. He didn’t play along like\na sycophant would, nor did he rush to his master’s defense.\nSo he was either disloyal or simply a man capable of holding his tongue.\n“Now,” Kip said, “now I’m impressed.

With\nthat man, Kip was always sprinting to catch up, was always the pupil at the\nmaster’s feet. Every victory against him was hard fought and only half a\nvictory at best. What a man Andross Guile could have been. Where had he\ngone wrong?\n“What’s Green Haven’s situation?” Kip asked. It had, oddly, been harder\nto get solid intel on their allies than on their enemies.\n“We have a hundred and ten thousand soldiers, five thousand eight\nhundred twelve drafters. Of those, honestly, maybe two thousand will be of\nuse in battle. Two hundred pygmies with tygre-wolf mounts from Conn\nSiofra.”\n“Conn Siofra?” Kip asked, shocked. He looked over at Sibéal. He\nprobably shouldn’t have asked that out loud. Too late now. “Is that your\nfather?”\n“Little brother,” she said. Kip thought he saw real joy in her pygmy\nsmile. Then she said, “Usurper.”\nWell, shit. And now Kip looked ignorant of his own people in front of\nthe ambassador. But it was beside the point. “Other troops?” Kip asked,\nirritated with himself.\n“Twelve hundred cavalry, and a militia led by the woodsmen of forty\nthousand.”\n“And how many of your nearly one hundred sixty thousand have been\nblooded?” Kip asked. “Ten thousand?”\nBram’s brow wrinkled as if he were trying to figure out some way to pad\nthe total, as Kip’s disgust had made it clear that that was a low number. “If\none counts the militias?” the ambassador offered.\nAha. So the commoners in the militias weren’t worth counting, despite\nthat Kip’s army—the only army to have success against the Blood Robes—\nwas composed of such folk.\nThese morons.\nWhat would Andross do here? Andross would consolidate power into\nthe only hands that knew what to do with it: his own.\n“So rather than giving commissions and better arms to your best\nfighters, you’ve consigned your only veterans into militias under officers"

He\ndidn’t need to approach it.\nThe ambassador nodded. “They are yours indeed.”\nKip said, “What’s to stop me from letting you and the White King smash\neach other and then marching in, wiping out the remnants of your armies,\nand declaring myself king?”\nThe man pursed his wide mouth. It made him look like a frog. The\nquestion had clearly already occurred to him. “Your conscience, this\npeople’s loyalty to their own, and our incompetence.”\n“Incompetence?” Kip asked. The others were clear.\n“Coming in and wiping up the remnants only works if there are only\nremnants left. If, however, the Blood Robes take Green Haven easily, with\nfew losses of their own, you’d be facing the White King with his\nexperienced troops and competent leaders who would have the advantages\nof our defenses, our materiel, and our wealth. Right now? With us inside the\nwalls and you outside them, and the Blood Robes exposed, our odds\ntogether are better than good. But what are your odds if you have to try to\ntake Green Haven by yourself, from them?”\nSo the man was clever after all.\nMost people didn’t even see their own weaknesses so well. Most\nwouldn’t have been so adept at framing the question in terms of what would\nbe good for Kip, rather than that he simply must help them because, well,\nhe must.\n“Any deal you make with me is binding, and you have full authority to\nmake treaties? How do I know none will gainsay it afterward?” Kip asked.\n“You said yourself that you’ve promised everything to everyone.”"

How do I know none will gainsay it afterward?” Kip asked.\n“You said yourself that you’ve promised everything to everyone.”\n“But we’ve given no one this.” Ambassador Red Leaf produced a scroll\nwith a single sentence written on it. He read it aloud: “‘On our oaths and\nholy honor, any deal Bram Red Leaf signs with Kip Guile shall be fully\nbinding on the satraps, lords, and peoples of Blood Forest now and\nforever.’” Below that sentence was a candle’s worth of sealing wax: the\nWillow Bough seal prominent, surrounded by constellations of every\nleading clan’s seal and all of the remaining unaffiliated smaller clans’, too.\nKip handed it over to Tisis, who had stopped even pretending to work on\nher map. She looked at it carefully. “Named, signed, and sealed by the head\nof each family,” she said. “Every signature that I recognize—and that’s\nmost of them—is correct. And the wording… this means exactly what it\nsays.”\nThe ambassador said nothing. The scroll said it for him. Satrap Briun\nWillow Bough might be no military leader, but he was clear-eyed about his\nsituation. It was desperate, but he was taking desperate actions without\npanicking.\nIt made Kip like the man. It took uncommon strength of character to\npresent yourself to a foreigner, a younger man, and one of dubious birth no\nless, and say, ‘I’m in desperate straits. Will you please, please help?’\n“I’ll be named satrap,” Kip said. “And put in full charge of the armies.\nI’ll expect the resignations of everyone on the board of electors of the satrap\nso it can’t be stripped from me in a few months, and I’ll have the power of\nappointing new ones.”\nThe room went dead silent.\nKip went on, “Briun Willow Bough will be allowed to keep all of his\nown lands but will vacate the palace, leaving it furnished and adequately\nstaffed. He can take his own gold, but if he raids the treasury, I’ll have him\nhanged. The city needs that coin and more, if we’re to keep fighting. All the\nnobles above the salt will give me one part in five of their lands and\npossessions immediately, like so: they will divide their possessions and\nwealth into five as they see fit, and I will choose which part I take. In cases\nof indivisible properties, trades will be allowed as assessed by an\nindependent party and accepted within one year, or else the part I deem the\nlarger reverts to me. Any hidden undeclared assets will become my\nproperty, and future possession of them by other parties considered theft.\n“All officers will resign their commissions and reapply to the same posts\npending my approval—though there will be no cost for the second\ncommission. Failure to reenlist will be considered desertion. Families I find\nespecially helpful in the transition or the defense of the Forest will find their\ntax reduced to one part in seven.”\nIt was even more audacious than he and Tisis had discussed, and\neveryone in the room froze.\nBram looked suddenly ill. “That would make you a dictator. I would be\nresponsible for giving away a fifth of all Blood Forest’s wealth. My lord, on"

My lord, on\nbehalf of my entire family, I signed that scroll myself.”\n“Then perhaps as you’re being particularly helpful, you should only give\na seventh?” Kip asked.\n“No!” the ambassador said, mortified. “No, I’m sorry. We would be\nshamed to the tenth generation if it looked like you bought this treaty by\npaying us off.”\nHe didn’t pat his forehead now, though. He looked up with those keen\neyes hidden in his chubby face like raisins poked deep into bread dough.\n“But you’ll save us?”\n“I’ll certainly try,” Kip said. “Unfortunately, the White King does get a\nsay in how that turns out.”\n“Not some halfhearted effort, though,” Bram insisted. “You’ll send\neveryone. Tomorrow? You’ll bind your future to ours?”\n“Tomorrow’s not going to happen. But we’re mobilizing already. The\nday after. But are you really worried we’ll betray you, after all we’ve done\nfor these lands?” Tisis asked the ambassador, disbelieving.\n“Those people out there may want to make you king,” Bram said. “But\nyou’d have to fight if you wanted to be king in anything more than name,\nand a civil war burns a lot of treasure and more goodwill. So maybe this\nagreement is your way to take the same power without having to fight for it.\nWith what you’re asking, you’d be instantly wealthy, with complete\nlegitimacy to your power. We couldn’t dislodge you. From there, how hard\nwould it be for a man of your talents to make yourself king in truth? Rather\nthan even fight at all, you might negotiate a peace with the White King.\nMaybe you already have.”\nKip said, “You’re standing in a city I liberated from the Blood Robes.\nWe killed thousands of them, this week.”\n“I know, I know. I’m just—I just need to know that you’ll save us. I\ncan’t give you everything and get only words in return.”\n“Of course we’ll march to save Green Haven,” Kip said, and he could\nsee the relief wash over the man’s face. “So we’re agreed?”\nThe ambassador took a deep breath, but he’d already decided, Kip could\ntell. He wasn’t even patting his sweat. “We’re agreed,” he said.\nSomeone in the room whooped.\n“We are going to go kick some Blood Robe ass, my friends,” Ben-hadad\nsaid.\n“Satrap’s Guard,” Winsen said, testing it out. “Meh, it’s not quite as\ngood as King’s Guard, but I’ll take it.”\nSeveral others in the room—locals—looked stricken. Kip was going to\nabandon the city to Daragh the Coward?\nKip had no hope that word of that wouldn’t get out quickly. He only\nhoped it didn’t get to Daragh before their meeting. The timing here could\nget dicey.\n“Bring in the scribes,” Kip said. “I’ll want twelve copies made to\ndistribute throughout the satrapies. Lady Guile, would you look over the\nlanguage?”"

Why would I\ntrust you?”\n“What is that supposed to mean?” She let the ‘my dear’ go this time.\nHe shot her that deprecatory look again. “You’re honest.

I also trust you to be lousy at lying to anyone\nelse.”\n“I’m not a child,” she said.\nStill not turning toward her, he said, “What do you want, Liv?” exactly\nas one would address a child.\nThe engineer made to withdraw.\n“Why have I been denied being in charge of communications? I’m\nFerrilux, goddess of superviolet. It is what I do.”\n“It is what you will do,” Koios said. “Integrating our forces will take\ntime, and I can’t risk you bungling anything at this juncture.”\n“So you don’t trust me not to bungle things?”\n“Yes, that’s exactly it,” he said.\n“Fuck you,” she said.\nHe made no move toward her, but the papers in his hands suddenly went\nup in flames. The engineer staggered backward and fell with a yelp.\n“My apologies,” Koios said to the man finally.\n“No trouble at all, Your Majesty,” he said, slowly getting up and\nretreating. “I’ll redraw the schematics and bring them back immediately.”\n“No need. It looks excellent. You may go.”\nKoios turned toward her. “Not in front of the mortals, please?”\n“Done,” she said. “I want access to all your research as you promised,\nand my bane. It’s been two days since we took our oath—”\n“You were supposed to show me how to make my own oath stones!”\n“I did.”\n“You know my superviolets couldn’t follow what you did.”\nOf course she did.\n“You will know how to make oath stones before I leave, this I promise.\nAfter the battle. I couldn’t very well hand you chains you could so easily\nput on me, now, could I?”\nHe took a deep breath. “You won. I shan’t underestimate you again.”\n“We both win, Your Majesty,” she said. “Now, let me help us win the\nreal war. My research and my bane. Please. And if you’d tell me the plan, I\ncould actually help it succeed. Which is, after all, the whole point, isn’t it?”\nHe weighed her with his color-knotted eyes, waves of different luxins\nrising and falling within them as he called on each in turn. “Apology\naccepted,” he said. “You’ll have the superviolet research and command, and\nthe bane.”\nShe didn’t leave."

Last year, he’d\ntried to chain her with a black luxin necklace. Now, it pleased her to remind\nhim of it with a chain that bound them both instead.\n“You’re really going to throw it in the sea?” he asked.\n“When I leave. As I promised.”\n“What would happen if I destroyed it instead?”\n“That would be very difficult. But if you succeeded… You bound your\nwill to it, utterly. Break one, break the other. I’ve told you all this. It should\nnot be news.”\n“It isn’t. I wanted you to repeat it in different words so I could tell if you\nmeant what your words seemed to mean before.”\nHe strode over to a map.\n“Kip is here,” he said, not bothering to wait for her to reach him before\nhe started. “We’re here. Dúnbheo has massive numbers of ships and\nexcellent docks, so coming down the Great River and turning up the coast\nhere could take Kip’s Nightbringers possibly as little as two weeks. Less if\nthey pack only essentials and don’t expect a protracted fight. Coming\noverland would likely take four weeks, three at best.”\n“And you said we’re about three weeks from launching the armada,” she\nsaid. It was significantly later than she’d first assumed, and that meant she\nmight have to hedge this bet of joining Koios. “So if he doesn’t figure out\nwhat you’re doing for another week or two, he can’t possibly make it?”\n“He’s got less time than that, actually,” Koios said. His grin was skeletal\nunder the hard blue luxin.\nShe raised her hands palm up.\n“We’ve seized the Great River,” the White King said, “right behind his\nback.”\n“You what? How’d you manage that?”\nHe looked immensely pleased with himself. “In many ways, my wights\nare inferior to the Chromeria’s drafters. But they’re also fearless. We’ve\nmade great strides with magics long buried.”\n“What? Some kind of night magic?”\n“No luck with that. The caoránaigh.”\n“What is that? Sea monsters?”\n“Wights who’ve transformed their bodies as much as possible for the\nwater. They took the names of old monsters to make people fear them.\nActually, though, I wonder if what they are is exactly what those old\nmonsters were. They can go wherever the rivers go, unseen, and board\nboats before anyone knows they’re there.”\n“How many do you have?” Aliviana asked.\n“Enough. Mercenaries on the shores for fortifications and intel. Wights\nin the woods, wights in the waters. No one escapes. The silence won’t hold\nforever, but it’s already held longer than I’d dared hope. Long enough.”\n“And if he figures out your little plan? What if—”\n“Hardly ‘little.’ No one’s ever done it before.”\n“For good reason!” she said. “What if Kip moves faster than you\nimagine?

The capital’s there, and you’ll never hold the\nsatrapy without Green Haven. Not for long. These people—”\n“The people of this satrapy believe Kip is the Lightbringer. Their\nLuíseach.”\nShe put her hands to her cheeks in mock horror. “Oh no, the\nLightbringer! Whatever shall we do?” She shook her head. “Are we really\ngoing to start listening to what desperate peasants say?

He’s not some mystical being, Lucidonius reborn or\nsomething. He’s a fat kid. A cringing whinger. There’s nothing in him of—”\n“It doesn’t matter. I don’t care how you cover for your old boyfriend—”\n“I’m not covering and he’s not—”\n“You misunderstand. I don’t care if he really is the Lightbringer.”\nShe couldn’t follow that at all. Either he’d gone mad, or…“You know\nsomething I don’t,” she said.\nHe looked at her as if surprised by her astuteness.\nThat rankled. Underestimating me? Still? I will burn you.\nThe White King said, “As long as the Lightbringer’s not on the Jaspers\nwhen I arrive, the Jaspers will fall.”\n“How do you know that? Because some prophecy says so? I thought all\nthis superstitious horseshit was just a put-on until you fully seized power,\nlike your ‘freeing’ of the slaves.”\n“Silence!” he roared.\nHis guards shifted uncomfortably, looking at each other uncertainly. Oh,\nhadn’t everyone seen through that foolishness by now?\nShe turned her attention to Koios. She couldn’t tell if he’d yelled\nbecause she was right or because she was wrong. Even as she was getting\nbetter at divining the tells that showed this emotion or that, her own\nemotions were growing more distant, more mysterious, and her intuition\ngetting worse. Reading anger and fear didn’t tell her for which reasons he\nwas angry and afraid.\n“You don’t understand how this works at all, do you?” he sneered. “Hell,\nit could be real.”\n“This prophecy?” she asked.\n“Since Guile burned me, I’ve seen things that bent my mind in half. The\nChromeria’s too quick to dismiss what it doesn’t control. I’m sorry to see\nthat you do the same. Maybe you didn’t escape their tutelage soon enough.\nMaybe their weakness infected you.”\n“How dare you!” she said, but he didn’t even stop.\nHim talking about things that had bent his mind in half didn’t bode well.\nEven if the Chromeria oversold the dangers of going wight, this man was a\nwight seven times over, and was trying for nine.\n“But the accuracy of the prophecy doesn’t matter,” he went on. “The"

Everyone on Big and\nLittle Jasper will know they need this young Guile—that their own\nprophecies, written by one of their most credible prophets, say they need\nhim.”\n“You’ll be making things even easier for Kip, then. If you position him\nas the only hope for the satrapies, you’ll be helping unite the satrapies\nbehind him. Do you not see that as more than a little dangerous? I’m no\nstrategist, but maybe uniting our enemies isn’t the best idea?”\nActually saying she was no strategist was a bit difficult. It was only\npartly true. Far more difficult still was accepting the look he gave her: like\nshe was stupid.\n“The loyalists will know that their sole and slim hope of victory rests on\nKip being there when I arrive—and he won’t be. So they’ll know they’re\ndoomed. Do you know what happens when people know that if they fight\nyou, they’re doomed to certain death and gruesome tortures? I do.

And I’ve\narranged for that to be impossible.”\nShe didn’t know how he intended to do that, but at the least it meant the\nWhite King had people in Dúnbheo, and a way to communicate with them\nrapidly, exactly as she’d suspected.\n“And how do you have any idea who he is at all? He’s surprised you\nagain and again. He’s destroyed your forces at every turn.

Nor\ncould we give Andross Guile such power over us. So we set a trap for\nDazen. Sealed the windows. Chained the doors and gates shut after he got\nin. He was only a blue/green bichrome, and it was after midnight. We got\nKarris’s maid to take his lenses under some pretense, to pack with Karris’s\nthings or some such. He was disarmed.” His eyes took on a distant look, red\npain outlined with spiky black hatred, or black hatred impregnated with red\npain, such that the two had mingled to a hue that stained the soul forever.\n“We set upon him. Started beating him. It got out of hand. All the years\nof White Oaks being humiliated and outmaneuvered. Those smiling,\nbeautiful, adored and entitled and deified fucking Guile brothers. There was\nthis moment when Rodin tried to stop us, and my brothers and I looked at\neach other… and without a word, the rest of us decided to kill Dazen. And\nin that split second where we hesitated? That son of a bitch split light. He\nwas a natural Prism, as the world hadn’t seen since Vician’s Sin. Four\nhundred years—and we stumble upon a true Prism. I remember the look in\nhis eyes as it happened. I think he was as surprised as we were.\n“Rodin threw up a shield—trying to help the Guile, against his own\nbrothers. That’s what Guiles do, Aliviana. They turn brother against brother.\nRodin went down first in the crossfire.”\nYou mean you killed him. Or one of your brothers did. Otherwise you’d\nblame Dazen for that murder, too.\n“But it was still one bloodied man against all the rest of us, and we were\ndrafters all. And he had no light! Around corners so he couldn’t draft off\nthem, we popped mag torches, and then we came at him. And you want to\nknow what this lightsplitter does next?”\n“What?”\n“He absorbs everything we throw at him. Luxin missiles and streams of\nfire. Darts. Spears. Blades and waves. Projectiles and pure heat.\nEverything.”\n“What?! That’s not how lightsplitting works—” Liv started.\n“Black luxin. As if he didn’t have enough tricks. He soaked up\neverything we threw at him, and he threw it all back at us. Killed us all.\nOnly I made it to the courtyard fountain. Others of our household tried to\ntake refuge with me there from the smoke and heat and flames, but I fought\nthem off lest we all die. The water heated, unbearably. I burned, boiling like\na crab in a kettle. And only that night’s breeze kept the smoke from killing\nme as it did so many others. Some mercy. The pain is with me daily, still.”\n“I’m sorry,” Liv said. It didn’t seem at all adequate, but what could be?\n“It’s no matter.

I wouldn’t choose Rodin’s fate for her, but if she chooses to\nstand with the Guiles…?”\n“She’ll deserve it,” Liv said. She guessed then, from the hardness in his\neyes, that it had been Koios himself who’d killed his brother that day. Koios\nhad seen the vulnerability Rodin opened. The rest of the White Oak\nbrothers would be reluctant to attack for fear of harming Rodin, and Koios\ncouldn’t let that stand.\nHe’d killed his own brother, and blamed Dazen.\nHe was crazy, but only in the implacable I-don’t-care-what-my-victory-\ncosts-you sense. And he’d been that way before the fire.\nHe said, “So now, tell me, Aliviana Danavis, my new Ferrilux, do you\nthink that I—of all people—will underestimate a Guile?”\n“I see that you have very good reasons not to.”\n“But you have no faith in me? You really do have the arrogance of\nFerrilux, don’t you?”\nThat didn’t merit a response.\n“Kip is easily handled,” he said. “Kip is like his father, not his\ngrandfather. He reacts to the needs in front of him. He sees people, not\nnumbers, not cards to play. To him, no one is disposable. He is brilliant, else\nI would have destroyed him already—and you’re right, I’ve tried. But the\nway to beat Kip remains simple: I’ll beat him with present needs and battles\nand victories far away from where they might matter. In terms of that game\nhis grandfather likes so much, it doesn’t matter what card Kip pulls. He’s\nplaying at the wrong table. And I’ll keep him there until the real game is\ndecided.”\nShe hesitated, but again, she was getting worse about not speaking her\nmind. “That… eases my mind a great deal, but you’ve only established that\nif he stays in Dúnbheo a few more days, he can’t get here with his full\narmy.”\n“Do you want to know how delicious I find this?” the king said.\n“What?” Was he even listening to her?\n“We are the old gods reborn, Aliviana. We are the nightmare that has\nkept luxiats and magisters awake at night for a thousand years. Do you not\nsee the irony? I tried to kill Dazen Guile—and I couldn’t! Orholam sent the\nChromeria the only man who could possibly save them from me.

As they\nnow came to the Chromeria, the faithful from all over the world had once\nmade pilgrimage to climb it. The luxiats said that only after Vician’s Sin\nhad Orholam hidden the tower and the island, raising a reef to bar any entry\nto such holy ground, and raising the mist itself to hide His own connection\nto the earth. In grief at their disobedience and rejection of him, He’d\ncovered His face from the world.\nSo the luxiats said.\nOthers said an isle of glass lay there, and the reef and the mist had risen\nafter an earthquake had plunged the isle into the sea.\nEven as a child, Gavin had wondered how much of either tale was true.\nHe’d longed to come here one day to see for himself.\nAs a young Prism, he’d wanted to come here to confront Orholam, but\nhe’d always wanted to live more.\nHe’d always assumed the descriptions he’d read of White Mist Tower\nmust be either fanciful or poetic, describing the feelings evoked by seeing a\ntragically formerly holy place, rather than literal descriptions of the thing\nitself. The ancients were an emotional tribe, after all, as much given to\nhyperbole as were sailors.\nWhite Mist Tower wasn’t literally a tower, but it did look eerily like a\ntower carved from blocks of white mist. Gavin squinted against the\ndistance. As if imprisoned inside a glass shell, the clouds of the ‘tower’\nspiraled in a dense circle, swirling constantly but not in accord with the\nprevailing wind. The outlines of that ephemeral tower were unmoved by the\nnautical winds, and sprawled wider than the entire island they obscured.\nWhite Mist Tower wasn’t like a tornado or waterspout. Those were diffuse,\nmutable, and mobile. This tower was of equal thickness from where its foot\nrested atop the reef itself to where its head was lost in the heavens.\nThough it was still at least a day’s travel away, even from here and even\non a bright sunlit day like today, the mixture of the natural and unnatural\nabout the form was stomach-twisting. Gavin could only imagine the effect\non sailors on more foreboding days, seeing a natural mist suddenly yield to\nthat monstrosity without warning."

Gavin could only imagine the effect\non sailors on more foreboding days, seeing a natural mist suddenly yield to\nthat monstrosity without warning.\n“Big lux storm last night,” Gunner said, coming up to Gavin at the\nrailing. “And you, sleeping through all the rough action like my last port-\ngirlie done, trustin’ daddy Gunner to take you safe through the storm.”\nYuck. “Lux storm?” Gavin asked instead.\n“Common roun’ here.”\n“They are?!” Gavin asked. “I’ve never read anything about that.”\n“You Chromeriacs. If it ain’t writ down, it don’t exist for ya,” Gunner\nsaid, shaking his head. “Takes a big storm to get this good a view’a the mist\ntower. Purty, uh? Hope it stays this nice when we trya shoot the gap inna\nreef.”\nBut Gavin had suddenly lost interest in the enormous tower of mist far\nbefore them, or their navigational choices. “A lux storm? Really?”\n“Nornj ’un. Queerest thing ya ever seen. Sheets, orange sheets. You\nknow how folks call lots a rain ‘sheets a rain’?”\n“Sure.”\n“Not like that. This uz like a ribbon unfurlin’ from the skies to the\ndepths. Gorgeous. Gorgeous, ’cept for the vijuns.”\n“Visions?” Gavin asked. Gunner hadn’t woken him for that?\n“Some says a man sees what’s in his heart out there.”\n“That’s not how orange works.”\n“Innit?” Gunner asked sharply. “Lots of experience with lorange ux\nstorms, eh?”\nOrange lux storms.\n“No,” Gavin admitted.\n“Pro’lem of rewardin’ men o’ will, like your Chromeria do. You all\nimpose whatcha think oughta be, ignoring what is when it ain’t\nconvenient.” Gunner twisted a bit of his beard and poked it between his\nteeth. Then sucked on it. “One little plop as the sheet first dropped, like a\nhard turd hittin’ a full chamber pot, then nothing except a rush. Solid\nconnection from the seas to the heavens. Afterward, some the men swore\nthey saw a whale.” He shrugged. “Like I said. Vijuns.”\n“A whale?”\n“Black whale. Immense. O’ course, I’m not sure what other color a\nwhale would look like at night, and no one ever says, ‘Oh, take a looksie at\nthat relatively small whale.’” Gunner twisted his lips. “Heard plenty of\nsailor stories, even when men weren’t in a hallucino-jammy—halloosina—\nhalluxination storm. But a whale? I near whipped a man this mornin’ what\nwouldn’t stop goin’ on with his lies, swearin’ a black whale nudged the port\nquarterdeck, like a little kiss.”\nWhat the hell? There hadn’t been whales in the Cerulean Sea in\ncenturies. Scholars said the closing of the Everdark Gates had choked off\nsome essential migration route, either sealing them out while they were\ngone or keeping them in to die.\n“That’s where you sleep, innit?” Gunner asked. His cunning eyes\nglittered."

He could tell the question held some kind of danger,\nbut he had no idea why.\n“Port quarterdeck’s where you fold your hands, aye?”\n“What’s it matter? It didn’t happen,” Gavin said. “You said so yourself.”\n“I know it di’n’t happen. You know it. But when men who oughta\nfookin’ hate a Guile start believin’ mythical beasties o’ the deep are paying\nhomage to ’im, I gotta ask who they think you are. I esk that, and then I\ngotta esk myself who you think you are.

Mebbe I gotta\nclap ya back in chains to reminder everyone what you is?”\n“I’ve said nothing to them,” Gavin said. It was almost literally true.\nGoing on a mission like this, they were all dead men already. No need to\nbond with his enemies.\n“Who is ya, Guile? Yestiddy you’d said you’d fight, afore your end.\nWhaddaya see when you look in the mirror? A fighter?”\nWhat kind of question was that? Of course Gavin was a fighter.\n“You fightin’ me, Guile? After all what I done for ya?”\nGunner gripped Gavin’s face suddenly, his hands sharp and hard with\ncallus and sinew. He wrenched Gavin’s chin toward himself and bored his\neyes into Gavin’s.\nGavin accepted it. Maybe he only had been a fighter. Maybe his talk of\nfighting at the end yesterday wasn’t a wry boast; maybe it was an empty\nboast.\n“O Dazen Guile,” Gunner mocked. His eyes were glittering mirrors as\ndark and sharp and dangerous as living black luxin. “O Master of Land\nWays and Sea Ways, Man of Low Cunning and High Artifice, what are ye\nnow?”\nWhat. Not who.\nGunner released his chin, abruptly dismissive.\nHe who had flown, literally flown, in the peerless machina he’d dubbed\nhis condor, tasting a freedom no one ever had before; he, a genius whose\nfield of play had encompassed the sky itself—he himself was being dragged\nwhere he didn’t want to go, blackmailed, afraid, passive. He couldn’t even\nblame actual chains now, as he might have when he’d been a slave—\n—Enslaved! It’s different!\nHe was crippled. Half-blind. Enslaved, yes. But enslaved, not a slave.\nHis bondage had been a temporary condition, not an identity. Emperor\nGavin Guile had setbacks, not losses. He was Gavin Guile, victor. Never\nGavin Guile, victim.\nBut really.\nSeriously now.\nHow long has it been since that was true?\n“You really t’ink you’re gonna fight the suckin’ sand? Then why’d you\nwander into this bog in the first place?” Gunner said."

Then why’d you\nwander into this bog in the first place?” Gunner said.\nSuddenly another piece of this dangerous little man snapped into focus\nfor Gavin. Gunner was the soul of tenacity. That was what had made him\nthe best cannoneer in the world. When a mystery or even a whim took\nGunner in its teeth, he would follow it to the bitter end. If a shot wobbled,\nanother man might fire another ten rounds from his cannons to figure out\nwhy before abandoning it as fruitless; Gunner would empty a treasury to\nfire a thousand rounds until he understood exactly why one shot deviated a\nhand’s breadth from the last.\n“That’s a shit question,” Gavin said, forgetting for a moment who he\nwasn’t. “The whole world’s a bog. Some stay on a safe path, some step off\nit unwittingly, some are led off it, and some are pushed. All that matters is\nthat once caught in the bog, some fight, some ask for help, and some lie\ndown.”\nGunner picked his teeth. “You been lyin’ down lots.”\nThat stung. When he wasn’t sunning himself, ostensibly to accustom his\neyes to the brightness of the sun, but really hoping to reawaken his magic\nand his color vision, Gavin had been sleeping like the dead. He woke late\nand went to his rack early, not to plot but to sleep. He was actually starting\nto feel human again after his imprisonment, no longer so easily tired—but\nbefore this past year had demolished him so thoroughly, he’d been one of\nthe most highly energetic men he’d ever known. Gunner’s barb was a\nreminder that he was not now what once he had been.\n“A metaphor’s a gun. You gotta know its range,” Gavin said, with less\ndefiance than he’d intended.\n“Aye. But even a man firin’ at greatest random hits the mark\nsometimes,” Gunner said. “Like what your man Commander Ironfist done\nat Ru. Snatched your bacon from the coals, eh? But I guess you were\nspeakin’ o’ metty-force. Metal farcically…?”\n“They trip up the best of us,” Gavin said, smirking.\nSudden as a summer squall races over the horizon, Gunner’s face went\nmurder dark. “And how ’bout the worst of us? You got a bone to prick with\nme, Guile?”\nGavin blinked. “It’s, uh, it’s only an expression. I meant it could happen\nto any of us.”\n“You di’n’t say that. And a Guile never misspeaks. And when a Guile\nsays ‘the best of us,’ he means hisself. You meant yourself, didn’t you?”\n“In this, uh, particular instance, I—You know something, Gunner?\nCaptain Gunner, I mean. Sir.”\n“Something?! Do I know something?!” The little man drew himself to\nhis full height and grabbed his wild beard in a defiant fist.

Also a fine… Aha!\nA fair fine fiddler, too!”\n“Do you know why we’re doing this?” Gavin repeated.\n“I heard ya! It’s only din a few bays. Days. I ain’t forgot. We go to\nensconce our legends in the firmament of the Celestine! They’ll be naming\nconstellations after us. Me mostly, ’tis truth, but there’s stars enough to go\n’round.”\n“That ain’t the why for me,” Gavin said.\nGunner made his voice small, whiny, mocking: “‘We’re already\nlegends!’ says you. I know. So why for you? You really think you’ll save\nyour lady’s skin? From the master o’ them?” Gunner threw his chin toward\nhis Order crew, meaning Grinwoody.\n“You ever wonder if you’re a good man, Gunner?”\n“Eh?” Gunner scrunched his face like he was trying to pick some jerked\nmeat out between his teeth with his tongue. “I’m tops at most things what I\nput my hand to. But being a man? Ain’t really something you gotta try at if\nyou’re in our perfessions, aye? Not sure what kinda pirate worries ’bout\nhow manly he is.” Gunner stopped, looked at his first mate. “Pansy!”\nThe woman, with her hair glued in hard, spiky points, resembled a\nflower in zero respects; she was at the ship’s wheel on the sterncastle,\ntwenty paces away. Her body was as hard as a terebinth tree clinging to a\nwind-torn cliff, and her face was harder still. “Aye, Cap’n?” she shouted,\neven her voice harsh.\n“Pansy, you ever worry ’bout how manly you are?”\nShe answered immediately. “Daily, Cap’n!”\n“Didn’t think so!” Gunner said. He scowled at Gavin.\nGavin couldn’t tell if the pirate was taking the piss.\nHe tried another tack. “Captain, I got a head full o’ books, enough to\nknow a few things. For good and ill, history’s written with a blood-dipped\nquill. Good men died, fighting against me, under the banners of bad men,\nheld there perhaps by old loyalties or law. But that never bothered me. We\nwho gamble in taking up arms with the intent to kill know that our own\nlives are our ante,” Gavin said. “But I get this dream. Not every night, but\noften enough to dread sleep. In it, I’m manacled to a kneeler, and buckets of\nblameless blood march into a darkened room and pour themselves over my\nhands while I fight to get away, and all the time, they shriek at me. You\nken?”\nGunner nodded."

Gavin had never told anyone about that. Maybe he would’ve\ntold Karris, if they’d had longer together.\n“From the Freein’?” Gunner asked.\n“Aye.” ‘Ayes’ and ‘ain’ts’ now seasoned Gavin’s speech like salt in\njerked meat. “There was this girl…” He trailed off. And at the end, he’d\ngiven her death. He gave them all death.\nIt made him want to vomit all over again. How could I have done that?\n“Ya killed her, I s’pose? So what? It’s the voyage they sign on for,\ninnit?” Gunner asked. “Yer drafters.”\n“It is,” Gavin allowed, narrowly avoiding using another ‘aye.’\n“Then what’s the pro’lem? They know the deal: Light duty mos’ times,\nrespect e’erwhere, good pay, and when they take the last lonely boat, their\nfamily gets a sack o’ gold. They get all that, and in return they gotta obey\nand they get a short life. Sailors get nothing ’ceptin’ the obedience and short\nlife.”\nPutting it like that, it didn’t sound like such a bad deal. Better than\nworking a farm until the arthritis made every move hell, and then working it\nanother ten years, prayin’ you could hold on to life until your sons and\ndaughters could fend for themselves.\nDidn’t sound like a bad deal, when you were fifteen years old and forty\nsounded ancient and they asked you to scrawl your damn idiot signature on\nthe vow.\nBut it didn’t seem like such a good deal when you were a father who\nstill felt young and you held an infant in your arms who’d already never\nknow her drafter mother, and the Prism who’d killed her first now asked\nyou to hand over the child to some uncaring luxiat so he could slice your\nheart out, too.\nIt didn’t seem like such a good deal when you were the man who held\nthe knife and murdered artist kids like Aheyyad Brightwater.\n“In all my time as the head of the faith,” Gavin said, “I could never\ncome up with more than two questions that were worth a damn. As it were.”\nIt sailed over Gunner’s head. In his world, ‘damn’ was for punctuation,\nnot punning. And it wasn’t the full truth anyway. Gavin had a third\nquestion, but he didn’t let himself even think it too loudly.\nGavin looked at the great tower of cloud on the horizon, growing ever\ncloser.\n“Two questions?” Gunner prompted. “Or did you mean that metty-\nforcibly?”\n“No. I mean, yes? First: is Orholam real? And second: if He is real, is\nHe like we think He is?”\nGunner was looking at him like he wasn’t making sense. “Uh… what?”\nGavin tried again. “You and I, Captain, we’ve seen the shit. The real\nproblem with Orholam comes if He is who He says He is.”\n“And who else would he be?” Gunner asked. “Hand me that hoo-dad,\nwouldja?”"

I’ll\nfind my own way, and you can go to hell. When the dichotomy was ‘Do I\nobey Grinwoody or do I defy him?’ given Gavin’s nature, that wasn’t even a\nchoice.\nBut defying Grinwoody meant either a fast death (say, by blurting out\nhis name while wearing this stabby hellstone eye patch) or a slow one (by\naccepting failure and death), so Gavin, despairing and defiant but not\nsuicidal, had chosen ‘slow.’\n‘Slow’ meant becoming passive. And his whole soul hated that. Sinking\ninto sarcasm is the heart’s last rebellion against a mind choosing\nhelplessness.\nLogical step to inexorable step, his answers had marched him into\nwaters that now closed over his head. When your answers lead you\nlogically to despair, you don’t have the wrong answers; you have the right\nanswers—to the wrong questions.\nGavin didn’t want to give Grinwoody what he wanted, but there was no\nway out. In his current state and situation, Gavin couldn’t outsmart him or\noutfight him or out-magic him. He couldn’t deny Grinwoody what he\nwanted.\nBut that was framing the problem exactly wrong. In truth, it didn’t\nmatter what Grinwoody wanted—it mattered what Gavin wanted.\nGavin didn’t want Grinwoody to win…? Gavin didn’t want to die…?\nDivergent as those seemed, both of them were importantly distinct from\nwanting victory or wanting life.\nWhat do I want?\nOdd thing to wonder, here, when he had no power to get it. Before, he’d\nnever asked it in any profound way. His ‘great’ goals for every seven years\nhe served as Prism hadn’t been great in any way. They’d been field\ndressings on a gaping wound of purposelessness. His housebroken dream\nhad been merely to stay alive, to not be unmasked as a fraud.\nSure, that made sense for a month or two after the war while he healed.\nBut he’d never become more. Never dreamed more than declawed\ndreams.\nHe’d put his brother in the grave, but Dazen had also died at Sundered\nRock.\nWhat did Gavin want?\nWhich Gavin?\nTime stretched, as if something were supposed to happen right now—\nbut nothing did. Gavin looked around. Nothing. Odd. He sank back into his\nthoughts.\nMaybe Gavin only wanted to win.\nIn Gavin’s place, a hero would strive for some positive good. Say, to\nsave the empire. That kind of goal would ready him to fight a diverse host\nof battles. He would be one man: integrated, of one purpose, strong whether\nhe had to fight to save the empire from foreign enemies, or from traitors, or\nfrom those corrupting it, or if it needed renewing, he would be strong\nenough to undertake even its reformation.

And short lives, often. Sure, but villains got those, too, so\nmaybe that was a wash.\nIt was all moot. Gavin wasn’t a hero.

He’d treated Grinwoody’s\ndemands as merely another prison that he had to figure out how to escape…\nand yet, even with his own life and all the world on the wager, Gavin hadn’t\nfound any heart for the effort.\nHe just didn’t care to save the Chromeria. Not in the abstract.\nHe loved many people there. But the Chromeria itself was as corrupt as\nhe was. The ‘White King’ was a murderer, a liar when it served him, and a\nwielder of oversimplifications, but Gavin couldn’t object to the basic charge\nthat the Chromeria was often shitty, and had been throughout history. Nor\ncould he claim that the Magisterium, whose High Luxiats were entrenched\nbeside those in power and empowered to speak against them, had, instead\nof standing against those abusing power, become indistinguishable from\nthem.

This was legendary.\nHow do you prove once and for all that there’s no God? How do you\nshow that even if He is there, He’s small and weak and unworthy of\nadoration? How do you prove that Orholam doesn’t see, He doesn’t hear,\nHe doesn’t care, He doesn’t save?\nYou show up on His front door, uninvited. You go inside without\nknocking. You take a look around.

There was nothing more impossible—and that very\nthought was like a breath of clean air after months in the must and stench of\nhimself in the black cell.\nThe Old Man of the Desert, Grinwoody, real name Amalu Anazâr, hoped\nto change the world’s entire social and political order by killing magic\nitself. He believed that what lay at the center of White Mist Reef wasn’t a\npersonality, but simply the central node upon which the whole network of\nmagic depended. He thought if Gavin destroyed that, all magic would fail.\nGrinwoody thought that would change the world. He thought that was\nenough.\nGrinwoody was wrong.\nThrowing luxin around was merely a personal power. The genius of the\nChromeria as an organization was that through education first and coercion\nlater, they’d turned that power into communal power, then traditional\npower, first subservient to political power, then enmeshed with it, and\nfinally indistinguishable from it. They had ensconced themselves in the\nworld’s politics and culture and religion and trade. But even if a sconce is\noriginally placed high so that it may cast its light far, if the fire it held dies,\nthe sconce remains, and it remains in its high place. So, too, the\nChromeria’s social and political and commercial and ceremonial power\nwould falter if magic were lost, but it wouldn’t necessarily be broken.\nDestroying magic wasn’t enough.\nFearing the lash, even freed of his chains, the slave will still pull at his\noar, but men of unfettered soul, who though chained are still whole, will\nsmash it like trash on the floor.\nMagic was one major tool by which Orholam and Orholam’s Chosen\nworked His will in the world, but they had others. People didn’t send their\ndaughters to be living and dying sacrifices to the Chromeria because of\nmagic, but because they believed it was what Orholam demanded.\nGavin—High Lord Gavin Guile, Emperor, Promachos, and mighty\nPrism, Orholam’s Chosen, the Highest Luxiat, the Defender of the Faith—\nGavin the Liar Prince, the High Deceiver, was the only one who might be\nable to kill the religion itself. Down to its rotten root.\nIf that fell, everything built on it would, too.\nHe who’d been ‘blessed’ with the gift of black luxin could kill the Lord\nof Light and watch tumble all the horrors built on men’s fear of Him. Half-\nblind and chained and toothless as he was, Gavin might stagger to the\npillars that upheld the roof of the empire. He might find strength had come\nonce more to his old muscular will—strength enough to lever apart the\npillars upholding the very heavens and bring it all down. Gavin the Liar,\nwho’d murdered innocents to uphold others’ lies, could destroy the greatest\nlie of all.\nGavin would bring down the rebels, not in order to save the empire but\nin order to make it fall correctly.\nFuck the old way.

He\nwould come back from death, come back from this journey to heaven and\nhell, and Gavin would invert all they had hoped. Gavin, the Son of the\nMorning, the Bright Hope of the World, had been cast down into a ninefold\nhell. But he hadn’t stayed down. He’d broken through and escaped from\none color of hell to another and another—until his own father had shut him\ninto the inner darkness.

Not among these doomed\nservants of the Order.\nBut he wasn’t one of the doomed anymore. Not in his own mind.\nLooking over at Gunner, Gavin felt the old, reckless, confident Guile\ngrin spread over his face for the first time in eons. “Gunner? Captain? Let’s\ngo find God. I’ll bring the sword, just in case He’s a dick.”\nGunner’s mercurial mood abruptly stilled. All the guns of his attention\ndrew broadside. His eyes weighed Gavin, judging velocity, pitch, charge,\nspin. Eyes tightening, he calculated windage, current, the target’s distance,\nspeed, and parallax.\nGavin welcomed the judgment, fatal as it might be. The end began here.\nThis was Gunner’s destiny.

Or, if one believed the darker rumors,\nhe simply didn’t think they counted enough to deserve their own scars when\nhe did kill them.\nKip was the son of an emperor. He didn’t want to be impressed at the\nsight of the man who’d strolled into the audience chamber this morning as\nif he owned it, but there was no denying that Daragh was impressive.\nDaragh the Coward didn’t just have four hundred seventeen scars covering\nhis arms and cheeks and forehead and fists: every one of his scars was\nhypertrophic. Hypertrophic scars didn’t spread beyond the original wound\nlike keloid scars did, but they did puff up, thick and red against Daragh’s\nolive skin, cartilaginous and angry.\nApparently such scars often itched terribly.\nWhich made the bandit lord’s skin a striped shrine not only to human\nmortality past, but to one man’s misery past and present.\nKip regarded the bandit with lidded eyes. This wasn’t going to be easy.\nHe knew what he had to do.\nDaragh the Coward wore his dark, curly hair in long dreadlocks piled\ninto a tail on top of his head. He tucked his tight breeches into rich knee-\nhigh boots. Doubtless in order to better display his mutilated pelt, he wore\nno tunic, only a leather weapons harness, currently with many empty\nsheaths and pistol hooks, as the Mighty had resolutely refused his demands\nto come into Kip’s presence armed.\nKip had been tired of being the center of attention all the time, so he’d\nexpected to feel relieved as the smiling bandit king drew every eye.\nInstead, Kip was surprised by how it irked him.\n“Your Highness,” Daragh said, making an elegant bow. He was flanked\nby two muscular men and followed by three more. Kip presumed they were\nall warrior-drafters.\n“‘My lord’ will do,” Kip said.\n“Ah, but you’re not that, are you?” Daragh said pleasantly.\nReally? You’re going to play the shame-me-with-my-past card? Instead\nof saying anything, though, Kip merely stared at the man, as if\nmonumentally bored by the stupid games this bandit was trying to play.\nThe moment stretched uncomfortably, and Kip the Lip somehow\nmanaged to hold his words like a disciplined line of infantry holding its fire\nwhile enemy cavalry charged into range.\nDaragh broke first. He was, after all, the one who had requested this\nmeeting. “Not my lord, that is. Not yet, anyway.” He gave a gap-toothed\ngrin, backing off from the other possible implication of his words: that Kip\nwas a bastard.\n“You fled from your owner seventeen years ago now,” Kip said. “That’s\nlong enough to learn correct terms of address, even if one were possessed\nmerely of low cunning and not much intelligence.”\nWith some tightness around his eyes, Daragh the Coward smiled again,\nand Kip could well imagine him holding that same smile while he slid a\ndagger into your ribs. “We learn different things in the forests and firths\nthan do the soft-handed boys that weaker men call lords.”"

You see, Daragh… or, I’m sorry, my own\neducation was geared more toward drafting and war than rhetoric and finer\npoints of alionymics: do you prefer Master the Coward, or is it always\nDaragh the Coward…? Seems too long for ordinary daily usage. Just\nDaragh, perhaps? Dar-Dar?”\nIt had taken Tisis no small amount of prying to find that old nickname,\nand that Daragh hated it.\nThe bandit let it roll past, but wet his lips. “Daragh is fine for my\nfriends.”\nDon’t say, ‘You can call me Daragh the Coward.’\n“You can call me Daragh the Coward. Or Lord Daragh, if you prefer.”\nKip sighed.\nGrandfather, is this how you feel all the time? Playing against stupid\npeople? “Lord? Baron of the Bayou, I suppose? The Earl of the Estuary?\nThe Count Who Can’t?” Kip didn’t give him the time to reply. “Enough\npleasantries. I would rather be serving this people, and for your part, Lord\nDaragh, you would doubtless rather be raping and murdering them, as you\ndo, but we’ve things to discuss, don’t we? The growth of my power has\ncome at the expense of yours, yet you’ve been careful to avoid attacking me\ndirectly.\n“That avoidance doubtless cost you both in money and in the respect of\nyour people, but you’re cunning: you wanted to keep an option open, just in\ncase there was a time to jump onto my side. But now things have changed.”\nSurprisingly, Daragh kept quiet. He wanted to see how accurate Kip’s\nread of him and his situation was.\nThat suited Kip. He would set the ground rules of this game, and skip\npast some of the introductory positioning. Except that he had to be careful\nnot to go too far too fast: one of the things he needed not to do was to reach\nthe crisis of this meeting too quickly.\n“You’ve been at this a long time. You know exactly what it costs to keep\nyour men fed. Everyone you’d ordinarily prey upon has fled, and you’ve\nstill not attacked the easy pickings under my protection? Even as, in recent\ndays, your forces have swelled far beyond what you can support through\nbanditry in the best of times. That means you’re making your big move.\nPerhaps you’ve realized there’s not much security in retirement for a bandit.\nOr perhaps you’re not thinking about the growing stiffness in your joints\neach morning or the pain in your aging back. You want to come back in\nfrom the cold, you want lands, you want to stop running, stop watching\nyour back and become a lord—for him or for us. Maybe you don’t even\ncare.

So come, let’s make like horse\ntraders. What do you want? I’ve much else to do today.”\nIf Daragh the Coward was aghast at Kip’s open assertion that he served\nthe White King, he didn’t show it. “My dear b—Lord Guile,” he said as if\ncatching himself. “I’m surprised. I come to a room full of people like you\nall, gracious lords and ladies that you are. But we’re all Foresters, are we\nnot? We’re not so removed from the earth beneath our toes and the wind in\nour hair. I see the curiosity in every eye, and yet we’ve not even taken the\ntime for proper introductions.”\n“How’s that?” Kip said. The man was stalling, trying to reframe the\ndiscussion.\n“You haven’t asked me about my scars,” Daragh said. “I—”\n“No! No! Of course not!” Kip interrupted as if aghast at the idea.\n“So you do know—”\n“No, why would I? And I don’t need to know. I was taught better than to\ndraw attention to the disabilities of my guests. I’d never! It’s uncouth to\ncomment on things a man can’t fix: say, a cleft lip, or a lame foot, or even\na… a regrettable clumsiness at shaving.”\nThe room erupted in shocked laughter.\nThe laughter hit Daragh the Coward so hard that Kip felt momentarily\nsorry for him. No one likes to be mocked, but mock a noble and he’s still a\nnoble. Mock a shopkeeper, she still owns her shop. But a bandit leader lives\non his reputation. Turning this man’s fearsome scars into an object of\nridicule?\nThat could be fatal.\n“But might I suggest”—Kip paused, as if he’d bumbled into rudeness\nand wanted to extricate himself—“perhaps… just let the beard grow out?”\nMurder shot through Daragh the Coward’s eyes. He shot a glance at\nstony Cruxer and then Big Leo, whose expressions said, ‘Don’t even think\nabout it.’ Clearly in the camps he’d lived in for nearly two decades, when\none mocked another man, the possibility of personal violence was always\non the table. He was unaccustomed to dealing with insults when that was\ngone.\n“I bring five thousand men and you—” Daragh said, raising his voice.\n“Five thousand?! Five?!” Kip interrupted. And here was where, if Tisis\nor Antonius was wrong, he was going to get his ass handed to him. “You\nhave three thousand four hundred men; three hundred more who are\ncasualties, well enough to walk but not to fight; and a thousand more camp\nfollowers. And that’s counting the cavalry you were hoping to conceal\ntwelve leagues from here in Little Wash. What kind of counting is this? The\nCount Who Can’t Count indeed! Did you really never progress beyond\nusing your fingers and toes?” Kip ticked off numbers on his fingers."

Or do you expect to negotiate with\nme while you lie?”\n“I assure you our strength is felt far beyond our numbers,” Daragh said.\n“Three hundred fifty drafters ride with us—three hundred forty-eight, for\nthose of you who hold an abacus in one hand while you jerk your cock with\nthe other.”\nThe room went quiet again.\n“Well, then, finally. Now we can begin,” Kip said quietly, suddenly\ndeathly calm. “Would you rather have a sign-up bonus of twenty denarii per\nsoldier and fifty per cavalryman who brings his own horse and one hundred\nfor every drafter, or would you like one-seventh of all our eventual loot,\nwhich will include anything we seize that was formerly the satrap’s?”\nDaragh the Coward blinked, blinked. Then the weasel came to the fore.\n“The sign-up, paid up front.”\n“Half up front,” Kip countered. “Half after freeing Green Haven.”\n“Done.” Daragh extended his hand to clasp on it.\nKip didn’t move. “So, as it turns out, you’re a bit of an abacus man\nyourself,” he said, sneering. “Get out. You’re small-time. Do you think a\ntattered peacock strutting in the mud impresses eagles?”\n“So no deal?” Daragh asked, baffled.\nKip laughed derisively. “No, no deal.”\nOrholam damn it. Three hundred–some drafters? That was a real prize.\nAnd it was completely possible that Daragh had that many. A drafter was\nmore likely than anyone to flee slavery or indenture, and the most likely to\nescape successfully.\nBut Daragh the Coward didn’t leave.\nHe couldn’t.\nThe reason for that was right there in his reputation. ‘No scars on his\nback.’ He’d surely put up with his men’s complaining about his not raiding\nKip’s undefended lands. Daragh couldn’t leave without at least an insulting\noffer on the table for him to reject.\nBeing sent away, like he hadn’t been taken seriously by a boy half his\nage? A boy who’d mocked him?\nThat would be death to his reputation.\nIf the man weren’t an inveterate murderer and rapist and many other\nthings Kip knew but wished he didn’t, Kip would have felt bad for treating\nhim so unfairly.\nSold by Ilytian slavers to a rural Ruthgari lord far up the Great River,\nyoung Daragh had had the great misfortune of his master being murdered.\nThe locals were intent on following an old custom: if a man was murdered,\nall of his slaves were killed for not stopping it.\nThe theory was that a man couldn’t be murdered without his slaves\nbeing aware of the plot, or at least deciding not to step in to save him.\nBesides, who was more likely to murder you than your slaves themselves?\nOne way to dissuade slaves from turning on their masters was to give all the\nslaves in a household the greatest possible incentive to protect their master,\nespecially from each other."

Then he’d crossed the Great River into Blood Forest\nand taken up banditry.\nWhat else could an escaped slave do?\nHaving not grown up with slavery, Kip was still unsettled by the entire\ninstitution, and his discomfiture had only grown, the more familiar he’d\nbecome with it. His own first experiences with slavery, even with as\nuncomfortable as they’d been, hadn’t been representative.\nSpeaking with Marissia, a slave to Gavin Guile? Marissia had more\npower and wealth than most nobles. Similarly, though technically slaves, in\ncertain areas the Blackguards had authority above most lords’, also often\nretired with wealth, and commanded far more respect than most drafters.\nThe Chromeria had slowly eroded the extent of slavery, believing it as\nintrinsically prone to abuse but also as ineradicable as lending at interest or\nprostitution. How else could debtors be forced to honor contracts when they\nmight have no way to pay other than their own labor? What else could be\ndone with enemies during war?\nWould it please Orholam more if His people massacred all captured\nenemies? Were they supposed to build giant cages for the captured until\nhostilities ceased?\nWhat if the hostilities lasted decades? Who would feed their foes for so\nlong? Would they feed them still if war led to famine, as it so often did?\nWho would stand guard over these men? What kind of horrors must happen\nin such cages? Aside from being economically impossible, was it really\nhumane to sequester men away from society and family? Man is a social\nanimal. Even slaves were allowed human connections, the company of\npeers, perhaps the love of a woman or a man, and the hope of children—if\noften blighted hopes. What would long-term prisoners have?\nSo the Chromeria compromised. The biggest concession they’d won was\nthat children of slaves were now born free.\nWith slaves’ children born free, the only sources of new slaves were\nsuddenly criminals, war, and piracy. Unsurprisingly, more things were made\nillegal, especially for poor young men and young women; piracy increased\ndramatically, and small wars were started on pretexts to allow raids for\nslave labor—which had, indeed, fed the fires of the unending Blood Wars.\nWhen Gavin had violently ended the Blood Wars, he’d demanded that\nall the slaves taken by each side be allowed to return home.\nIn two war-torn and impoverished lands, it had sounded impossible.\nLudicrous.\nIt had been the kind of administrative nightmare that Andross Guile\nadored. He and Felia Guile had woven diplomatic magic with the\nopportunity, giving Blood Forester lords lands in Ruthgar and Ruthgari\nlords lands in Blood Forest so as to stitch their interests back together.\nCertain exceptions were carved out (and bought) that enriched Andross.

Some great families\nfound themselves vastly diminished—but their close allies stood too much\nto gain from Andross’s reforms to join a revolt.\nAnd no one wanted to fight Gavin Guile. So it worked.\nAll the slaves were returned unharmed, which made Gavin Guile greatly\nloved here. It also made slavery generally hated and also very expensive, as\nthere was no supply of fresh slaves except at great expense from Ilytian\n‘traders’ whose often-forged documents might invite more trouble than\neven a skilled slave could be worth.\nIt might have all meant that Kip was living during the last generation in\nBlood Forest to know slaves—if he weren’t taking slaves himself.\nSlavery was as evil as war, and both would continue to create broken\nmen like Daragh until the end of time.

If you’re guilty of other things in\nother satrapies, you’re on your own for that, but we won’t hand you over to\nanyone.”\n“That’s a shit deal.” Daragh sneered.\n“You’re rapists and murderers,” Kip said. “Did you expect roses and a\nvictory parade, or a hope at a new life and loot?”\n“I expected—”\n“The other option you can choose,” Kip interrupted, “is that you be\nintegrated into the army.

After ninety days, they sink or swim on their own.\n“That gives your men time to learn, time to bond with their new units,\nand time for us all to get through this campaign. It’ll give them time to\ndecide if they want to live as honest men.”\nThe bandit king’s face creased with worry as he sensed the longing\nwelling up in the men accompanying him. “And what about me?

Your skills are unquestioned.”\nThat caused a disapproving buzz through everyone gathered. Half the\narmy?! Scandalous! Ridiculous. Offensive beyond words.\n“Half the army isn’t enough,” Daragh said, seeing that he had to move\nfast before the pressure could mount against Kip, but bartering, audacious.\nBut Kip saw him fill with sudden hope, the acquisitive hunger of the\nraider he was.\n“No, it’s not,” Kip said.\n“But it’s close,” the man said, regaining his grin, judging the mood of\nthe room easily, as he’d judged the moods of his free raiders so often\nbefore, seeing he had to provide a win for Kip. “I confess my mastery of\ncavalry lags behind my direction of foot soldiers. I should think we’ll be\nmost successful if I merely take over the infantry for now.

But you couldn’t fully disarm drafters,\nalthough meeting in this room, with only white and black tones on all the\nwalls, and all Kip’s men wearing only the same, did everything possible to\nminimize that risk. As did dragging out the meeting so long—which Kip\nhad done for this purpose: most drafters couldn’t hold luxin packed inside\ntheir own bodies for very long, if they even knew how to pack it all. It\nslowly leaked away, so Kip had been disarming them, simply by going\nslowly.\n“As you said,” Kip went on, “you’re the boss. You, Daragh the Coward,\nled these men into murder and theft and dishonor. Albeit with great\ndifficulty, I can forgive their crimes and require others to do the same. But\nthe blood of the innocent cries out for an answer. Your men’s sins fall on\nyou. You could have stopped the worst of it. You could have minimized the\nevil your men committed, even though you are bandits. Instead, you\nallowed, you incited, and you took part in all the worst that they did. You\nled your men to ever greater depravity.\n“Nonetheless, you came under a flag of truce. I gave my troth. So. If you\nand your men leave now, as I promised, I will not kill any of you, nor—\nunless attacked—will I pursue you until after my army has defended Green\nHaven. No trickery. But if your men wish to have the new start I’ve offered\n—if they wish to live henceforth as honest, pardoned men, they will need to\nbring you, Daragh, either dead or in chains, to the foot of the stairs of the\nPalace of the Divines.”\nKip looked at the hard-faced men around Daragh, ignoring him\ncompletely. “You have until tomorrow morning. It will take time to\nintegrate you into the army.”\n“You can’t do that!” Daragh shouted. “These are my men. They will do\nwhat I say! You can’t buy them from me!”\n“I am doing nothing,” Kip said. “I’m pointing out three paths you each\nmay choose: one, abandon the Forest in her hour of need and choose to be\nbandits until the day you die; two, serve as auxiliaries and remain on the\nedges of human society; or three, buy the chance to become honest men\nagain.

Further, if any of you earns a citation\nfor valor in battle, he will also earn having his family redeemed.” Kip raised\nhis hand, as if he were taking an oath, but with his fingers spread. “Up to\nfive family members manumitted, at my expense.\n“But perhaps you will say, ‘What if I fall heroically in battle but no one\nsees my heroism?

I can’t see everything, or root out\nevery injustice, so let me add this: whether you earn a ribbon or not, if you\ndie in battle or from wounds sustained in battle, five family members shall\nbe redeemed, at my expense.\n“If you pledge your hands to me,” Kip vowed, looking at each of those\nstone-faced men, “I will repay you five times over. Honorable service, a\npardon for wrongs, and freedom for you and those you love most. This I\nswear.”\nFreedom? Real freedom?\nWhat Kip promised wasn’t just an absence of the chains that all fugitive\nslaves found intolerable by definition—else they’d not have run in the first\nplace.

You’d wanted to make\nsure the men were recognized for what they did rather than just being\nhanded a ribbon, but if we take even half a minute for each citation, the\narmy will be standing there all morning.”\nTisis, I could kiss you. The subtext was perfect: we give out plenty of\nvalor citations.\nEach of Daragh’s men would later think, If they give out so many valor\ncitations, how hard will it be to earn one myself?\n“Very well,” Kip said. “That first, then the embargo, and then breakfast,\nI suppose.”\nDaragh the Coward had finally gotten Kip’s silent if unsubtle message—\nI have many other things to do, most of them far more important than you—\nand was striding, fuming, out of the audience chamber.\n“Darling,” Kip said out of the side of his mouth, but not turning toward\nher. “Are we giving out valor citations?”\n“Of course we are,” she said quietly. She cleared her throat. “Now.”\n“You just came up with that?” he asked.\n“Yes?” she said.\n“I love the hell out of you,” he said.\n“You better,” she said.\nHe glanced over at her. She was still facing forward, regal, but she was\nbeaming.\nHis next thought was less joyous: Citations. Great. Something else to\nadd to the list.\nAs Daragh the Coward passed through the doors of the audience\nchamber, he stopped. He turned back, defiant.\nDrawing up, his jaw jutting and his scarified chest puffed out, oiled\nmuscles tensed, he roared from the vestibule, “Guile! You never asked\nabout my name!”\nKip gave him a puzzled glance. Making a little motion to the soldiers to\nclose the doors, he said, “Why would I give two shits what people call a\ndead man?”\nChapter 18\nThe rudeness of murder had always bothered him. That was how he knew\nhe wasn’t a monster, yet. It still bothered him.\nFacing the predawn sun, praying alone, her husband having departed\nafter a long night of lovemaking and tears, the Third Eye now sat up\nstraight, her sunburnt arms saluting the rising light.\nShe had to be dead before the sun’s disk broke the horizon.

He already regretted how this job had to go: he\nwouldn’t face her. He wouldn’t feast on her fear or explore the fathomless\nmystery of watching a life cross over, hoping even after all these years to\ncatch a glimpse of the soul in flight to… elsewhere.\nHe couldn’t afford such consolations, not with a woman of this power.\nShe was a Seer, the greatest Seer of them all, the Third Eye. She would die\nat her prayers, unafraid. He thought that, at least, was very decent of him.\nBut then suddenly she spoke—and not in prayer.\nClearly, but not loudly, not like someone calling for help, she said,\n“There is one thing that you cannot do, you who were once—but shall not\nhenceforth be—Elijah ben-Kaleb. There is one thing you cannot do, despite\nall your awesome power.”\nIt was as if he’d been sprinting and the earth dropped into an abyss\nbeneath his feet. His true name. He froze. For the first time in years, he felt\nthe squeeze of fear’s heavy fist around his neck. She couldn’t know his\nname. The shimmercloaks hid Shadows from mystical as well as mundane\nsight.\nSo was it a guess?\nLudicrous!\nShe knew Elijah Sharp was here, so she knew the Order hunted her and\nknew that they’d sent their best. That went beyond unnerving. What could a\nSeer in her position do with such knowledge?\nBut she knew more. She knew his father’s name. She knew everything.\nIt was a trap, meant to make him flee!\nOr delay! Or…\nShe was a Seer. Anything he did now could be playing straight into her\nschemes.\nBut he’d extended paryl webs across every entrance, and none had been\ntripped. He checked them again.\nThey were still alone.\nWhat was that bit about him not being Elijah ben-Kaleb after today?\nWhat did she mean?\nBut the sun must surely be touching the horizon any moment. There was\nno time to sort out the muddle in his head.\n“There is one thing you cannot do,” she said. Her voice was quiet, her\nmien unthreatening, but there was no mistaking the strong steel in her.\n“You, son of Kaleb, son of a father whose very name means ‘faithfulness,’\nyou were trusted to live up to that name your father earned and gave to you\nas a free gift. Elijah ben-Kaleb, you were sent into the shadows as a candle\nunlit, sent to take the flame at the perfect moment to banish that darkness.\nBut you decided the price was too high. You came to hate the cost of the\nflame. You didn’t want your life consumed in giving light. But all our lives\nare wax, and time itself is heat unbearable, and every day we melt—but\nsome of us take flame! I am such a soul, dying to bring light to a dark\nworld.\n“You? You felt your sacrifices were unseen and so your sins would be\nunseen, too. And so you were reborn to the shadows, and a name of light no"

No, nor that mockery they gave you. Sharp? Though\nmolded into the shape of a blade and painted black, how sharp is melted\nwax? I, too, have a great gift, Elijah. And I, too, have been called to pay that\nselfsame price, to become a sacrifice seemingly unseen, to act with heroism\nunheralded.”\nHe sometimes acted with a bit of delay, struggling to make sense of\nwords spoken to him, and that was all that saved her now. Was she calling\nhim dull?\nHe wasn’t stupid!\nBut what ‘price’ was she going on about? And the thing she said he\ncouldn’t do? What was that?\nThere were only moments left, but he was already waiting, and she\nspeaking. Both knew this was rapidly winding to a finish. His paryl webs\nwere still undisturbed.\nIf this was a trap, it was a shitty one.\nGently, she said, “Elijah, even with the eye of a Seer, I cannot see you,\nbut I see the darkness you cast into every life you touch. And though it slay\nme, I choose to spend my life bringing light instead. You think you came\nhere of your own will? I think you were brought to me. You were not sent\nby malice but pulled by mercy. You will kill me, I’ve no doubt, but nothing\ncan hide you from the All-Seeing one. I dub thee Elijah ben-Zoheth, and I\ntell you this: for all your power, Elijah ben-Zoheth, you cannot steal that\nwhich I freely give.”\nThen, in fear and rage, and in shame, exposed in the first light of the\nrising sun, he murdered her.\nBut afterward, for the entire long journey back to the Jaspers, he was\ntroubled. He played that morning over and over in his mind. Had he\nblundered?\nNo. He couldn’t have kidnapped her as he’d kidnapped that slave\nMarissia for the Andross Guile job. It was too dangerous, the area\nunfamiliar. More importantly, those weren’t his orders—and the Old Man of\nthe Desert was awfully particular about his orders being followed exactly,\nalpha to omega.\nThe roots of Sharp’s broken teeth throbbed at the very idea of\ndisobeying his master.\nHe’d done right. He’d done the only thing he could do. It didn’t matter\nanyway. None of it meant anything.\nBut what had she freely given? He didn’t understand. The Name? That\ndidn’t seem right. And what was that about anyway?\nHe knew its literal meaning, of course. He hadn’t walked Abornea’s\nshores for many years, but some things one doesn’t forget. Why had the\nThird Eye used her last words to Name him? And what did she mean by\ndubbing him ben-Zoheth, the Son of Separation?\nChapter 19\nAfter her long night, the dawn prayers in the company of the faithful\nlightened Karris’s burdens; the pleasantly smiling Andross Guile waiting for\nher slammed them back in place.

Never a good sign.\nIt was a cloudless late-spring morning and the High Luxiats had opened\nthe sanctuary’s massive sliding doors that all the congregants could greet\nthe beauty of Orholam’s rising eye together. Karris’s sole consolation for\nwhat was doubtless going to be a painful interaction was the vision of\nAndross squinting against the sun behind her.\n“Orholam shine upon you, Promachos,” Karris said. Orholam loves this\nman, too, she reminded herself, trying to squeeze some genuine feeling into\nher smile.\n“May all your prayers be answered half as promptly,” he said, “and\ntwice as kindly.” His smile was amused. He didn’t miss much.\nThe only way to baffle Andross was with real kindness. She’d fallen\nshort of that. Again. Dammit.\n“Oh—” Karris stifled the curse. The White really wasn’t supposed to\ncurse. “Our meeting. The Parian situation. I forgot.”\n“Understandable. I should’ve reminded you.”\nBecause Andross didn’t forget. Andross never forgot. Anything. It was\nan infuriating reminder that his inhumanity didn’t only make him less than\nhuman; all too often, it seemed to make him more.\n“You really ought to get a secretary, someone who could be an overseer\nas well, ideally. As I have in Grinwoody, and Gavin had in, uh, what was\nher name?”\nFrom a kinder man, the pretense that he’d forgotten might have been\ninterpreted as him trying to bridge the gap between his own perfection and\nher own… not. She should really try interpreting Andross in the best\npossible light.\n“Marissia,” she said curtly. Dammit.\nThey began walking together toward her chambers. It had a better\nmeeting space than his apartments, and going into his home alone felt like a\nfly volunteering to scout a spider’s lair.\n“Tragic she ran away,” Andross said. “Slaves.”\nShe hadn’t run away. Andross had paid the Order—the Order!—to\nkidnap her. Not that Karris could admit she knew that, not without\nendangering Teia. But it did turn her stomach. Had Andross had a grudge\nagainst her husband’s room slave, or had taking her been a way to keep\nKarris from learning all the things Andross feared Marissia might know? He\nwould’ve interrogated her, and like many, he probably believed that slaves\nhad to be interrogated under torture for their testimony to be trusted. And\nthen he would’ve killed her. Just a bit of property destroyed: the price he\nhad to pay to keep his kidnapping of her secret.\nMarissia had been holding a bundle of Orea Pullawr’s papers that the old\nWhite had intended for Karris. But Karris still hadn’t figured out any way to\nlearn if Andross had taken them or if the Order had kept them and never\neven told him about it.\nHe said, “You did check with your bankers, didn’t you, to see that she\ndidn’t steal more from you? Terrifying that one might be betrayed by\nsomeone who slept in the Prism’s very bedchamber, isn’t it?”"

Terrifying that one might be betrayed by\nsomeone who slept in the Prism’s very bedchamber, isn’t it?”\nHe had to remind her of where Marissia had slept, didn’t he? Not just in\nGavin’s suite, but so often in his bed.\nI knew he’d use this to put me off balance. I’m the White now. Do it like\nI practiced.\n“Gavin shared so much of his life with her,” Karris said. “I’m sure she\nwas simply afraid of what I might do to her without him here. She loved\nhim very much.”\nShe was actually surprised to find real compassion in her voice. And her\nheart.\nScore one for the new White!\n“Loved him? Slaves, always forgetting their place these days,” Andross\nscoffed, shaking his head as he took a scroll case from his own man\nGrinwoody.\nYes, I’m sure everyone was well behaved back when you were young.\n“It was my failure, not hers,” Karris said instead. “It was no betrayal. I\nbegrudge her nothing, though I admit it hurts that she left without a word.\nBut she took nothing that wasn’t hers.”\n“Other than her body.”\n“No. Gavin manumitted her,” Karris said.\n“Really? When? I wasn’t aware of any papers filed on his behalf.”\n“In his will,” Karris said. It was as good a time as any to admit she’d\nfinally accepted the truth about his death that she’d denied for a year. “I’m\nfiling them today.”\nOther than a quick upward flash of his eyebrows, though, he gave no\nindication he’d even heard, no vaunting, no I-told-you-so.\nNo, that wasn’t true. He said nothing for several minutes. He didn’t\npoint out that the provisions of a will didn’t apply until the deceased was\npronounced legally dead, and that Marissia had ‘run away’ many months\nbefore that.\nIndeed, Karris’s first paranoia had involved suspecting Marissia herself\nin Gavin’s abduction, but not one of them had panned out. And then Teia\nhad told her what had really happened, and she’d been ashamed.\nKarris and Andross stepped past the Blackguards, who’d finished\nchecking the safety of the lift. One of Karris’s attendants was reduced to the\nservile role of setting the counterweights, as the woman was considered\njunior to Grinwoody because Andross (as promachos) held the highest\nabsolute rank. Naturally, one of the Blackguards stood at her elbow\nwatching her—one of Karris’s Blackguards, not Andross’s, because while in\nthe Chromeria the Blackguards considered the White the highest-ranking\nofficial, behind only the Prism, though the personnel assigned to guard the\nWhite and the promachos (and for that matter the Prism and the promachos,\ntoo) were all drawn from the same pool. Several of Andross’s Lightguards\nalso attended him, though they pretended not to be aware of their own place\nin the hierarchy (below the Blackguards in most matters at the Chromeria,\nthough as free men and women, they were nominally socially above the\ntechnically servile Blackguards).\n“I’m afraid your brother’s nonsense really has riled them up,” Andross"

Can you imagine?” Andross said. “Who would\nwant a free woman to attend him when he’s ill? Does anyone really want a\nperson who works for coin to be the physicker who prods one’s intimate\nplaces and knows one’s ills and shameful diseases? Without the fear of the\nlash, would not one motivated by coin to sell one’s secrets to whomever\nmight bribe her? And what free woman would choose the work of laving\nlepers or massaging whores’ prolapsed rectums or taking on the death\nsentence of palliating the plagued? There is work not even the most\npenurious would choose. Your treasonous brother can’t be ignorant of this,\ncan he? Surely not. Who empties the chamber pots in his camps? Who\ncollects the urine to tan the leather, who mucks the stables, who swives a\ndozen stinking ugly soldiers every night? Free men and women? Nonsense.\nThere are just things that free people won’t do.”\nHe seemed utterly unaware that of the ten people sharing the lift, eight\nwere slaves. Seemed unaware—and probably even was. He’d been so\npowerful and rich for so long that Karris could believe that. Andross\nremembered everything—but only everything he thought important. He was\nsly, but not omniscient, and he didn’t think of others who didn’t rise to the\nlevel of being players for his games.\nKarris was the ninth person in the lift. Technically, as a Blackguard,\nshe’d been a slave herself. She didn’t believe Andross was unaware of that\nin the slightest. “I suppose it’s a good thing, then,” she said.\n“Hmm?” he asked.\n“That I was a slave myself,” she said. “You expect me to believe you’d\nforgotten?” The second part slipped out of the corral before she could shut\nthe gate. Sarcasm was not the appropriate mode for a White. Not a good\none.\nAct in a manner commensurate with my office’s dignity.\nDammit.\n“Oh my,” he said, putting a hand to his chest. “What a horrific gaffe.”\nHe made no effort to sound authentic.\n“Do you know the thing about slights?” she asked. Thank Orholam she\nhadn’t drafted red in a long time.\n“What’s that, dear?”\n“They’re slight.”\n“So is a bee sting,” he said. Damn he was quick!\n“What’s a bee sting to an iron bull?” she said, just as quickly. She’d\nlearned from long practice: never let a Guile keep talking. “Let it go. It’s\nbeneath you, father.” If she let him talk, he’d make some crack about how\nshe’d just compared herself to an iron bull. There was an Iron White joke in\nthere somewhere, too, so she had to strike faster.\nThus, calling him ‘father.’\nHe grimaced at the word. Then quirked his eyebrows as if accepting\nhe’d deserved that for calling her ‘dear.’\nKarris had learned that she had to watch for the most fleeting expression\non the promachos’s face."

But everything else about him?\n“Good thing—” she resumed. “I mean, if have your permission to finish\nmy earlier thought?”\n“Not so bad at slights yourself when you put your mind to it… or is\nwithering scorn a bit different?” he asked, amused like a father whose\ntoddler wishes to wrestle and actually thinks she’ll win. “But please. Do\nfinish.”\nShe copied his eyebrow quirk, accepting the withering scorn in return\nfor her own. But it pissed her off, deeply. It took her a moment to collect\nherself. “If there are certain things that free people won’t do, then it’s a\ngood thing I was a slave.”\n“Why’s that?”\n“Because there’s nothing I won’t do to keep my people safe.”\nWhat was that twitch at the corners of his mouth with the rise of his\neyebrows? A victory?\nNo. No? Maybe surprise melting into amusement.\n“Funny. I said the same thing when I was a young man,” Andross said.\nHe smiled widely now. “I believe you mean it just as much as I did.”\nWhich of course could be interpreted several ways.\nBut he was moving on. He said, “We’ll see if that holds when the bill\ncomes due, won’t we? Because I’m sorry to say we may get to see what\nyou’re really willing to do for your people sooner than we’d like.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” Needlessly confrontational, Karris. A\nmore dignified White would’ve assumed an innocent air and said,\n‘Whatever do you mean? Are you going to bring me up to speed about the\nParians now?’\nDealing with Andross Guile was exhausting. Karris was already\nmentally out of breath, and he didn’t seem to be breaking a sweat.\n“The sea chariots haven’t verified it yet,” Andross said. The lift had\ncome to a stop, and the Blackguards opened the door, but he made no move\nto exit. “It’s a large sea after all, but our spies in Azûlay agree: Your King\nIronfist is sailing. Here. He’ll likely arrive a week before or after Sun Day,\ndepending on the weather. He’s coming to negotiate.”\nThe Blackguards in the lift and those outside it couldn’t help but\nexchange looks, but Karris couldn’t read their thoughts. She couldn’t even\nuntangle her own. Ironfist was coming back?\n“If he wants to negotiate, why wouldn’t he take a sea chariot?” she\nasked. “He knows how to build them.”\n“A secret it would have been nice for you not to put in the hands of a\ntraitor,” Andross muttered. “But you misunderstand.” He glanced briefly at\nthe slaves. All of them were cleared to serve at the highest levels, which\nmeant they were trusted fully, but Andross trusted no one fully, except\nmaybe Grinwoody. “They say he’s furious. They say he’s bringing an army.\nThey say he wishes to negotiate our surrender.”\nIt was a punch in the guts when you haven’t had time to tense your belly."

He was the kind of gentle warrior who got quiet and\nsomber before he went into a battle. You never wanted to see him furious.\nIn sparring, he’d bested his brother Tremblefist—the man whose battle rage\nhad earned him a Name: the Butcher of Aghbalu.\nKarris did not want to see Ironfist furious.\nBut forget fighting Ironfist himself. The people of the Chromeria,\nfighting against Parians? Their brothers? More than half of the Blackguards\nwere Parians, and though she’d never question their loyalty, she also never\nwanted to put it to the test.\nEspecially not with a real enemy at the door. Even a victory over Ironfist\nwould only guarantee losing to the White King, and the dissolution of the\nempire.\n“Oh, but I left out the best part,” Andross said, motioning that he was\ngoing to remain in the lift. “You’ll pardon me. I’ve other urgent matters to\nattend to, given this news.”\n“What? What is it? Tell me the rest.”\n“King Ironfist trusts no one. Has no close advisers. Seems to think\nanyone at all could be a traitor.” He opened his palm toward Grinwoody,\nbut the wrinkled old slave didn’t notice, seemed frozen. “Grinwoody,”\nAndross said, exasperated.\nThe old man started and fumbled a scroll into Andross’s outstretched\nhand.\nKarris didn’t like Grinwoody.\nNo, no, if a White is to be without stain—as a White must be—then she\nmust be honest, with herself first of all.\nKarris hated Grinwoody’s guts. Not only because he was an extension of\nAndross’s malevolent will, a spiked gauntlet on Andross’s steel fist of\ncommand, but because he’d taken the Blackguard training—at far too\nadvanced an age to usually get a chance. Then, when he’d passed all of it,\non the eve of his final vows, he’d accepted a buyout of his contract to serve\nAndross. Karris, like every Blackguard, despised those who stole their\nexpensive training and went elsewhere for the sake of more money. It spat\non everything the Blackguard was. You bond with a fellow elite warrior-\ndrafter, thinking they’ll be your brother for life, and then he turns his back\non you.\nRegardless of his many years of faithful service to Andross, the\nBlackguards still thought of Grinwoody as a traitor. Which made it worse\nfor everyone that as he was Andross’s secretary and slave overseer, they had\nto deal with him constantly.\nHim getting old and mentally missing a step sent an unkind (and unholy)\nthrill through her.\nAndross was frowning, frustrated at having to take time from his real\nproblems to manage a slave. That was a duty Grinwoody was supposed to\nhandle for him.\n“Five lashes, milord?” Grinwoody knew, even when he himself was the\nproblem, to keep the interruption to his lord’s day quick and quietly\nefficient.\n“You’re too damn old, you fool. Five would break you.”"

The\nsuspicion among Paria’s nobles is that this talk of our surrendering to him\nmay be a feint.”\n“A ‘feint’?” Karris asked.\n“The Parian nobility believe there’s something else Ironfist wants.”\n“Yes, thank you, I know what a feint is. I meant a feint to what end?”\nKarris snapped. Not the way the White should act at all.\n“There were certain questions he’s asked with ‘uncommon intensity,’ is\nhow my spy put it.”\nOh yes. Ironfist had stood at the elbow of the world’s most powerful and\ndevious personalities, seeing how they excelled and how they failed, and\nwhen, and often why. But it was one thing to study how the best people in\nthe world do a thing; perhaps Ironfist was learning it was quite another to\nactually do it. Karris had been learning it herself for a year now.\nIt was like analyzing a fight versus taking the blows yourself.\nFinding out exactly what you needed to know to act boldly and notifying\nall the people who needed to know, because they were the ones who would\nactually make it happen, while keeping spies in the dark about what you\nintended? That was not as easy as you’d think, even after years of watching\nit. A master worked art a mere spectator couldn’t even see.\nKarris herself still didn’t know how the hell Andross did half the things\nhe did.\n“What kind of questions?” Karris asked, impatient. They were still\nholding up the lift.\nNow she was getting paranoid, wondering if Andross was somehow\nusing even that silence against her.\nImportant to remember: there isn’t always a secret plan to make you\nlook a fool. Andross was her ally, after all. At least against Ironfist.\n“About the Prism-elect, naturally,” Andross said. “But also about you,\nhis old friend. People there can’t believe he’ll actually side with the White\nKing. But for some odd reason he blames me for his sister’s unfortunate\naccidental death. It comes out now that she had quite a penchant for riotous\nliving. She used all manner of intoxicants, mixed together no less.”\n“That is odd,” she said. “But at least the part about Ironfist not wanting\nto side against us is good… right?”\n“In declaring himself king, he’s committed treason. He believes I\nordered his sister’s murder—who, despite her flaws, was at least a\nlegitimate Nuqaba. So him sending an army here is not good news in any\nfashion whatsoever.”\n“I didn’t say it was good news. I said—”\nAndross ran right over her words. “So what’s his play? He paralyzes us\nfrom hostile action with an offer to ally with us, but then, once he’s here\nwith his army…”\nKarris said, “He gives us some kind of ultimatum? He’ll only join us\nif… what?”"

Short of that, Ironfist could likely ask anything at all. The\nChromeria would have to agree.\nAndross could obviously tell by the look on her face that she’d grasped\nthe crux of it. She felt dread growing in the pit of her stomach. It was one\nthing to think, ‘I am so dead.’ It was quite another for a cowled man to\nescort you to the executioner’s ax-bitten, bloodstained block.\n“He seemed quite intent about… about you,” Andross said, watching her\ncarefully.\n“You said that.

Or so\nhe must surely believe, with me as promachos. What guarantee could I give\nhim that would make him trust me? He thinks I am a man of such low\nmoral character that I have truck with assassins!”\nOf course, Andross had—but he wasn’t going to admit to it, not even\nonly in front of slaves. Andross was no fool. (Though perhaps he believed\nKarris was.)\n“Believing me so low,” Andross said, “how could he trust any oath I\ngave him? If he believes I murdered his sister—who was guilty only of\nbeing slow to answer the Chromeria’s call for help—he must doubtless\nbelieve I would murder him, an outright traitor.”\nGee, old man, maybe if you didn’t assassinate people, maybe people\nwon’t think you assassinate people.\nBut as soon as Karris had the thought, she realized how hypocritical it\nwas. She was the one who’d made that job vastly more difficult by ordering\nTeia to assassinate the Parian satrapah as well. She was the one who’d\nknowingly sent a young woman—hardly more than a child—to do a job\nthat even a master assassin might’ve botched. It was her fault in sending\nTeia at all that Teia had been unmasked by Ironfist. If the Nuqaba (and no\none else) had simply died that night, Ironfist might never have known it was\nan assassination at all. He might have guessed it was some aggrieved local.\nIt was Karris, not just Andross, who’d turned Ironfist into an enemy.\n“Thus,” Andross said as if it were merely an interesting tidbit, “as far as\nI can presume, the only way Ironfist thinks he can keep himself safe from"

Gifted? I’m skilled. People call others ‘gifted’ when they don’t\nwant to believe they’re worse at something because they’re not willing to\nput in the work excellence requires. Regardless—I mean, if I have your\npermission to finish my thought?”\nThat. That was gratuitous. “By all means, please do,” she said, nearly\npolitely.\n“Actually, let me qualify that. I spoke too soon. The rest stands, but the\ndestroying them part? You’re right. That’s my gift.” He flashed his\neyebrows, as if it were all interesting, but tangential. “Now, where was I?\nOh yes. If I guess correctly, given what he thinks he knows, Ironfist\nbelieves that the only way he can be safe from me…” Andross smiled,\nsavoring the moment, “… is if he marries you.”\n“What?!” Surely Karris hadn’t heard that right.\n“How long has he been in love with you?”\n“What, what? Never!”\n“Well,” Andross said with a shrug. “Perhaps it’s solely political, then.\nWe’ll hope it doesn’t come to it regardless. We’ll hope he shows up with\nfewer soldiers and ships and drafters than rumored. These numbers often do\nget exaggerated. And he’s a political novice, after all. We might yet\noutmaneuver him.”\nBut Karris knew Ironfist, and Ironfist knew both her and Andross.\nIronfist wouldn’t come here unless he was certain he could win. And\nimplacable, righteous rage tends to make up for a lot of limitations.\n“But if all goes poorly,” Andross said, stepping off the lift. “I guess it’s\ngood news that you’ve accepted that Gavin’s dead. You’re a widow; your\ntime of mourning is finished, and you’re free to remarry.”\nHer mouth made an O, but no sound came out.\n“After all,” Andross said, “you just told me: you’re willing to do\nwhatever it takes to save your people, aren’t you?”\nHe’d set her up. Somehow.\nShe’d never seen it coming.\nIt was like that time he’d hired those men to ambush and beat her. This\ntime he was doing it with nothing more than his words, and this time, he got\nto watch her take the beating.\nShe couldn’t muster any defense. She only looked at him, stricken as if\nshe were down on the paving stones of that street again, taking kicks.\n“You know, there’s one good thing about my son dying,” Andross said,\ntiming his words perfectly with the closing of the lift’s doors. “He didn’t\nlive to see you give up on him.”\nChapter 20\n“So, boss, remind me why we’re going up here?” Winsen said as they"

        "text": "live to see you give up on him.”\nChapter 20\n“So, boss, remind me why we’re going up here?” Winsen said as they\nascended a bone-white spiral ramp to the roof of the Palace of the Divines.\n“Two reasons,” Kip said. “Ben really wanted to see the mechanism, and\nthe Divines really, really didn’t want him to.”\n“Good enough for me,” Big Leo said. “Why so many of us? Are we\nexpecting a hostile reception, or you just giving the nunks a chance to fail?”\nChagrined after the assassination attempt, Cruxer had been screening\nprospective new members for the Mighty. Fifteen of them followed the\nMighty today. Kip shrugged and said quietly, “Every day’s a new chance to\nfail.”\nCruxer gave him a disapproving glance.\n“What I meant is,” Kip said more loudly, “if I had any idea what’s so\nsecret about their big secret, I might have an answer to that question.”\n“But you don’t, because it’s secret,” Ferkudi said, nodding.\n“It’s just a big mirror, right?” Winsen asked.\n“Like the Blue Falcon is just a boat,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Well… it is,” Winsen said flatly.\nBen-hadad said, “You did not just say that my masterpiece, the finest\nskimmer ever created, is ‘just a boat.’”\n“No, actually you said that,” Winsen said.\nBen-hadad paused in his limping up the stairs. He dropped his head in\ndefeat.\n“He’s got you there,” Ferkudi said loudly. “You did actually say that.”\n“Helluva view, huh?” Kip said, to forestall more sniping. The Palace of\nthe Divines was topped by its heart tree, a massive white oak whose roots\nwere artfully (and, he assumed, magically) woven through the walls of the\npalace below it. To the north and south of that great tree was a narrow band\nof old-growth forest with smaller white oaks descending down the sides of\nthe palace as if it were simply a steep hill. That band of forest looped back\ninto the palace’s rear gardens.\nThe ramp was a white ribbon that circled the entirety of the palace, at\ntwo points of each revolution passing through that band of trees and moss\nand rocks, but suspended above the ground and never close enough to any\nof the trees to touch them.\nThere were interior stairs that would have taken them to the roof faster,\nbut this looping, outside way was the more formal route, and he wanted to\ngive the Foresters as much of his respect as possible. He didn’t know why,\nbut only the Divines, a conn, and the Keeper of the Flame and her people\nwere supposed ‘by ancient tradition’ to approach the heart tree atop the\nPalace of the Divines.\nKip was breaking that tradition, so there was no need for him to stomp\non their feelings any more than necessary.\n“Why aren’t you telling them the real reason?” Tisis asked him quietly.\n“Those were real reasons,” Kip said, but it came out as defensive.\nHis wife said nothing.\n“Because I’ve got a feeling it won’t work. It can’t be as simple as I"

It can’t be as simple as I\nthink, or they’d have done a better job with their defenses already. And…”\n“And you don’t want to fail in front of the nunks,” Tisis said.\nHe pursed his lips and turned to admire the view. It was breathtaking.\nHe’d never imagined a city so filled with trees and flowers and greenery of\nevery shade, and here as they climbed, they were able to see over the great\nliving wood-and-leaf curtain that was Greenwall. Beyond on one side lay\nmany leagues of undulating forest canopy and crops, and on the other was\nthe sparkling sapphire of Loch Lána.\n“They’re signing up for a job that might cost them their lives. To protect\nme,” Kip said. “I don’t want their first impression to be that they’ve made a\nhuge mistake. That I’m not worth it.”\nHe glanced over at her a few moments later. She had that perfectly\nserene look on her face that told him she was definitely mad at him.\nFinally, after one last steep section, the white walkway deposited them\nbefore an ornate gatehouse on the roof that blocked their view of most of\nthe giant white oak.\nA woman stood before the building, blocking their way.\n“Please, stay back,” the brown-veiled woman said. She sounded kind,\nbut Kip’s heart was gripped by sudden fear. Something about the Keeper of\nthe Flame struck him as wrong.\nHer voice was more full of gravel than an old haze smoker’s, but her\nerect carriage and lean figure spoke of a much younger woman. Her veils\nwere bound tight against the contours of her face, with a choker high on her\nneck.\nHis own unbounded throat cut off his breath.\nLuxurious braids of fire-copper hair woven and shaped with platinum\nthread and opals reached down her back like tongues of flame reaching\ndown for hell instead of seeking its natural level with the æthereal fires.\nThough no one used the title for her, everything about this woman\nshouted priestess to him. The pagan kind.\nShe raised black-gloved hands in amused surrender. “I’m happy to\ncooperate, but I’m not safe.”\nNot being able to see the woman’s face bothered him. A condescending\nsneer would give those words different meaning than a patient smile.\nShe sighed, though he’d said nothing. She asked, “Do you trust these\npeople to hold the fate of our satrapy and the entire war in their hands? Do\nyou trust each of them not to loose secrets that might start a future war? If\nso, follow me.”\nKip looked over at Cruxer. The man understood instantly.\n“Nunks,” the Commander said, “Gemel-six. Forget the hinge like last\ntime, and you’ll be doing froggers till sunset. Mighty, Aleph-eight.\nEveryone else, out.”\nSome high-level lord who’d somehow tagged along didn’t move.\nCruxer turned a heavy gaze on the man.\n“Surely you don’t mean me,” the man said innocently. “As the palace’s\n—”\n“I haven’t killed a man in four days,” Cruxer said without inflection."

        "text": "“Surely you don’t mean me,” the man said innocently. “As the palace’s\n—”\n“I haven’t killed a man in four days,” Cruxer said without inflection.\nThe apple of the lord’s throat bobbed. He seemed in sudden need of a\nchamber pot. He disappeared down the great ramp, nearly running.\nThe prospective new members Cruxer had selected for the Mighty\nfollowed, propping the door ajar at its foot and jamming a wedge into its\nhinges, lest it be closed and barred against them in an ambush. It left Kip\nand Tisis and the Mighty alone in what he now could only think of as less a\ngatehouse and more a temple. This wide building, whitewashed under thick\nbranches of purple-blossoming wisteria, covered and controlled the entire\napproach to the enormous heart tree. The circuitous path up here now\nseemed less a gentle climb and more like a pilgrimage route.\nThe Mighty had already fanned out. Tisis stayed close to Kip, giving\nhim room to take a wide stance himself, but near enough that Big Leo could\ninterpose his considerable bulk between her and Kip and any threat. Ferkudi\nwas the roamer, so no sudden assault might plan for exactly where he’d be.\nBen-hadad was diagonally behind the Keeper of the Flame, where he could\nwatch her and keep an eye on the two doors at the rear and side of the\nchamber. His crossbow was loaded, but pointed at the floor. Alone of the\nMighty, Ben-hadad was able to maintain an amiable air despite total\nvigilance.\nWith hand signals, Cruxer put the Mighty on high alert.\nThis time, Kip wasn’t sure why. Was Cruxer just that attuned to Kip’s\nown tension, or had he noticed something explicitly that Kip was only\nfeeling?\nWinsen, who’d been scouting the back of the room, kicked a shim under\none of the doors. The other swung out and had no easy way to bar it. Hand\non his belt, Win opened that door and poked his head through.\n“My appearance will be shocking, but I can see this will be necessary,”\nthe Keeper said.\nAs had been the tradition with other ancient titles, such as the Third Eye\nbeing known only by her title and never her name, the Keeper had also\nsacrificed her personal name in taking up her position. It was a tradition at\nleast as old as the Tyrean Empire, and it still saw wan reflections in modern\ngovernance—Andross was sometimes referred to simply as the Red. The\ndifference was that he was also known as Andross Guile.\n“Forgive me if I move slowly,” she said, “but I have no wish to provoke\nalarm.”\nKip didn’t know why his heart was gripped with fear. She’d banished all\nher attendants as soon as Kip arrived with his entourage, hot on the heels of\nLord Appleton’s message that the Keeper was to assist Kip in every way.\nSo only Kip could hear what Cruxer whispered: “She’s wearing plate.”\nLouder, he said, “Win, bookcase.”\nPlate? Under her clothes? Why?\nKip looked for it as she moved, though, and even then he could barely"

Cruxer really was damn good at his work, and the plate was only\npartial. To make it less obvious that it was there, perhaps? Because surely\nanyone who knew you were wearing an armored tunic would simply stab\nyou in the neck.\nAssassinations weren’t so common here. Or at least, not that outsiders\nheard.\nMaybe trading in your name made it impossible for anyone to know\nwho wore the veil?\nFor that matter, how sure was Kip that this woman was the real Keeper\nof the Flame?\nWinsen climbed up a bookcase, as if it were something people did, and\nthen stood atop it, strung bow and spare arrows in one hand, nocked arrow\nand string in the other, though pointed down.\nThe woman took a deep breath, bracing herself. She loosened the choker\nthat held tight the layers of veils from her brow around her face and head.\nThe outermost veil covered even her eyes, but the inner, tighter veils had\nsmall jeweled cutouts for her eyelashes—which told Kip that she wore the\nveils even while with her inner circle.\nSlowly, she removed her veils one at a time, doffing and folding each\nwith careful and identical motions. She’d done this many times. So if she\nwas an impostor, she was one regularly.\nAt the last veil, she bowed her head and reached up to the base of her\nskull. Her fingers worked at the knot where the band around her forehead\nwas tied.\nThe Mighty vibrated with tension like a bowstring drawn full to the lips,\nand held… held.\nSlowly, she lifted not just the veil, not just the band around her forehead,\nbut what seemed at first to be her entire scalp.\nNo, it was a cap, a wig into which the red hair was woven.\nRevealed under the wig, her natural brown hair was patchy, her scalp\nmottled by open sores. She set aside the veil and wig and lifted her face.\nAnd suddenly, even as he heard the sharp intake of breath through teeth\nbeside him as Tisis saw and stifled a gasp, Kip’s heart was moved not to\ndisgust or fear but to pity.\nThough she was not yet thirty years old, the Keeper’s face was covered\nwith weeping sores and distended by tumors. No wonder she kept herself\nwrapped like a corpse for the pyre—she would surely go to one soon.\nEverywhere, even where it was swollen by tumors, her skin gleamed. Little\npoints of gritty golden light burned within her distressed skin everywhere,\nas if an exploding shell had pierced her with a hundred thousand fragments\nof ever-burning shrapnel.\nIt had a fatal beauty to it, pulsing brightly in time with her every\nheartbeat.\nThe Keeper held herself defiantly, though, apparently impervious to her\nwounds and to Kip’s scrutiny as much as to her assured demise.\nIt was a resolve Kip knew well.\nShe wasn’t horrified at her own ugliness nor dismayed by the warm\ndeath humming glee in her bones.

She was stalwart despite what must be\nconstant pain: she was like a runner who’d be damned if she would falter\nthis close to the finish line.\nAnd Kip knew with his heart: This wasn’t a dying woman who\nhappened to hold an important position. This was a woman dying because\nof her position. This was the warrior who’d volunteered for a fatal mission;\nthis was a high priestess who’d offered herself for the sacrifice, approaching\nthe altar and the knife. But she wasn’t going to go quietly.\nShe unbuckled the fabric-covered plates from her forearms and then her\nbroad, heavy skirts, and stood in her simple tunic and trousers, creased from\nher overgarments.\n“Chi,” Kip blurted. “You’re a chi drafter, aren’t you?”\nPuzzlement flickered in her angry eyes. “Why would you say that? You\nhaven’t even touched chi since you got here. I’ve been watching your eyes\nand your soulbrand from the moment you arrived. I heard about the\nlightstorm out on the waters. They say you pulled apart paryl and chi\ntwisted into waterspouts, drafting both at the same time. I don’t know that\nanyone’s done that before. Or is that a lie meant to pass to legend?”\nSoulbrand?\n“Do you know a lot about lies… Priestess?” Kip asked instead.\nShe blinked as if struck.\n“I’m not here to give answers, but to hear them,” Kip said.\n“Not lies,” she said, defensive, bitter. “Secrets. Secrets we must keep\nlest the Chromeria put us on Orholam’s Glare.”\nKip had no idea what a masterful drafter of chi could do, but it would be\ninvisible to the Mighty, and to Kip—unless he acted immediately. The\ndanger hadn’t passed. Indeed, stripping a secret truth naked risked shame,\nand shame could spur violence.\nWhat he did next was exactly the wrong thing to do. It was exactly the\nopposite of what Andross or Gavin would have done, but Kip waved the\nMighty off.\nThough the Mighty barely shifted their positions, the air changed\nimmediately.\nThe Keeper noticed. The golden burning of her skin dimmed; her pulse\nslowed. But her shoulders slumped. “We only want to use the gift Orholam\ngave us,” she said. “Drafting kills every drafter. But our color makes us\nugly first, so ours is forbidden? Ours kills us faster, yes—in five or ten years\nrather than ten or twenty—but if we studied chi as every other color is\nstudied, could we not learn what is safe? Why can we not bring our gifts in\noffering to the Lord of Lights, too? Why can we not serve mankind openly,\nas other drafters do? You, Lord Guile, have a wealth of colors. If you never\ndraft chi again, you can serve with eight other colors. I have only the one.\nAre we chi drafters so monstrous that Orholam would have us destroyed?\nOr can God see beauty where the Magisterium sees only shame?”"

He looked down at his hands. He’d known,\nsomehow. That ugly heat in his joints when he’d drafted chi—it had felt like\nhe was cooking, like something was deeply wrong, deeply unsafe about the\nouter-spectrum color. With a sudden shot of hot fear like whiskey in his\nbelly, he wondered if the same death taking this woman was growing in his\nown bones at this very moment.\nGently, he said again, “Please. Tell me.”\nThe gathering storm of her righteous indignation frayed and scattered.\nHer lifted chin descended. The pulsing gold light slowed to a normal pace.\nA sigh released the last of her resistance.\n“Our ancestors thought our cancers were a sign of a god’s displeasure at\nsome sin they’d committed. The priests said they bore the tumors as\npunishment on the people’s behalf. They used their own suffering to control\nthe people—even as they desperately searched for cures. Over many\ngenerations of careful notes, they figured out that chi kills everyone, even\nour families, if we have them. The more chi we use, the faster we die.\nGenerally. Not always. This is my tenth year. It’s quite long, as we reckon\nsuch things. I’m lucky, most say.”\n“You use chi for the Great Mirror?” Kip asked. “I thought the mirrors\nwere controlled with superviolet.”\nShe inclined her head, and Kip couldn’t help but glance at features\nshaped as if by an angry child mashing clay. “May I put my raiments back\non?” she asked. “For your protection… but for my vanity, too.”\nFor my protection? What the hell does that mean?\n“Of course,” he said instead.\n“I’ll take you to the Great Mirror. It’ll answer your questions better than\nI can.”\nChapter 21\nThe warm, compassionate light of orange dawn had thawed Teia’s iced fury.\nA little. Karris was unworthy of Teia’s service, but Teia’d given too much to\nearn her position to serve poorly just because her commander was shit. She\nwas better than that.\nAnd to be fair, unlike Karris, Teia hadn’t had to kill any of her friends to\ndo her job. That had to take some getting used to, she guessed.\nSo before coming back to the Blackguard barracks, she’d dropped off a\ncoded note for Karris in one of their dead drops. Teia couldn’t bear actually\nspeaking to the woman right now, but Karris deserved to know her husband\nwas alive.\nShe was going to be furious that Teia hadn’t told her right away. But\nTeia would deal with that later. Or never.\nFor now, she needed to find a safe place, if only to sleep. She would\nneed to prepare, to hide whatever money and materials she stole—and she’d\nneed to steal, which she hated. She’d need a place to eat, and sew disguises,\nand wash laundry. She’d scouted extra places before, but none of those that\nshe’d already used would work. She had to start from zero.\nDisappearing completely was the only way to be safe.

She was exhausted and it was coloring her every thought with a\ngray stupidity and every movement with black-and-blue clumsiness. She’d\nbeen up since before dawn yesterday, and not five minutes of that time had\nbeen the pink, pleasant kind of wakefulness, where you could drift in an\nunfocused haze.\nThe first and most hazardous step of her preparations was stopping at the\nBlackguard barracks and her old bunk. Yesterday morning, she hadn’t\ngrabbed the extra coin stick and pistol and tailor’s kit she’d hidden under\nher bunk. She wouldn’t have needed them if she’d gone on the ship as the\nOld Man ordered. Now the danger of going back to the barracks was\noutweighed by all the dangers she would be able to avoid later if she had\nthe coins and pistol.\nSimply by selling the pistol, she could get enough coin to rent a room\nfor months in Overhill.\nAnd hell, she was already here.\nDespite the early-morning hour, Gill Greyling was seated on the side of\nhis bunk. He blinked slowly, unseeing, staring at his dead brother’s empty\nbunk. Stubble darkened his cheeks, and his uniform was wrinkled. He’d\nobviously been up all night.\nHer breath froze inside her. So it was true.\nNot that there had been much question, but it still seemed impossible.\nGavin Greyling? Dead? Gav?\nTeia’s earlier black rage was washing out with the dawn, and she was\nafraid what weaknesses the new day’s light would reveal.\nComing here was a terrible mistake.\nShe swallowed. Checked her paryl drafting, her invisibility, everything.\nIt was all still in place.\nAll right. Breathe. Breathe.\nThere was nothing for her to do here. She couldn’t give Gill any\ncomfort. Even if anything she said could make a difference—and it\nwouldn’t! it wouldn’t!—she had to make everyone think she was just gone.\nEveryone. No exceptions.\nThough it felt like a betrayal of her Blackguard brothers and sisters to\ntrust them so little, it wasn’t distrust… exactly. It was just that anyone could\nslip up, and any slip-up meant failure of her mission, and her father’s death.\nT? That’s pretty much the definition of distrust.\nFine. So I’m the asshole. But there are traitors loyal only to the Order of\nthe Broken Eye who sleep in this very room.\nTeia just didn’t know who they were yet.\nBut she would. She swore it. That was coming. And it would start with\nwhoever had that limp.\nShe crept invisibly into the women’s section of the barracks, carefully\ninspected the underside of her bunk, and silently slid open the little box\nshe’d nailed there.\nCoin stick, pistol, tailor’s kit.\nThough there was no one in here, she stood quietly, carefully.

All those who’d been on night\nshift should be coming in to sleep now. Instead, with Blackguards training\nall the Chromeria’s other drafters to fight, double shifts were more common\nthan ever. That work wasn’t as strenuous as the constant vigilance required\nof a Blackguard when guarding a Color or the promachos, but it wasn’t rest,\neither.\nIn the main barracks, she gazed once more upon Gill Greyling, looking\nhaunted on his bunk. There was no one with him. No one at all in the\nbarracks except the two of them.\nHe was too well liked for this. Maybe he’d demanded to be alone.\nTeia didn’t want to think that no one had thought to stay with him, or\nthat Commander Fisk hadn’t given anyone leave to do so.\nWar doesn’t strip dignity only from the dead.\nRed morning sun poured through windows, bloody light limning his\nsolitary, hunched figure. She turned sharply, a sudden urge to weep\nstrangling her. She stepped away.\nThe wood floor creaked under her shoe, and she froze in place. Heart\npounding, she looked over her shoulder.\nGill had tightened.\nHe sat up straight, looked around the barracks, eyes searching. There\nwas no one here.\nTeia was suddenly acutely aware that Gill wasn’t only a bereaved\nbrother. He was a fully trained Blackguard, relentlessly molded to be\nattuned to hidden threats. And armed. And now alert. If he charged her—\neven in her general direction—what was she going to do?\nFight him?\nImpossible! A single touch would be confirmation that she was here! A\nsingle glimpse of her would jeopardize everything she was trying to do\nagainst the Order. A single telling sound would reveal the existence of an\ninvisible intruder. He would report it, or at least tell someone, and anyone\nwho heard such a wild thing would tell others, and the Order would hear.\nAnd the Order would know who it had to be.\nCould she speak? Tell him? Trust him?\nNo. She trusted him. She did. She could trust Gill Greyling. But she had\nno idea how the man would behave in his grief. It might be one shock too\nmany. Talk of shimmercloaks? The Order? Traitors in the Blackguard itself?\nThat was at least three shocks too many.\nBesides, she had no idea how long they’d be alone, even if she dared to\ntry to brief him on secrets she’d been commanded to keep secret from\neveryone. She trusted him, she just couldn’t… trust how he’d respond.\nUgh. That felt ugly and false.\nShe had to get out of here.\nShe began lifting her soft shoe slowly, heart pounding. She could feel\nthe tension in the wood. There was no question: when she lifted that foot,\nthe floor would creak again.\n“Gav?” Gill whispered.\nTeia’s heart tumbled to the floor.\n“Gavin? Is that you?” Gill asked plaintively.\nOh no. No, no, no.\n“I can feel your presence. I know you’re here. It’s you, isn’t it? Little"

Little\nbrother…” His voice trailed off, and Teia saw him gulping convulsively\nagainst the threatening tears, joy and hope taking up arms against a tide of\ngrief.\nFor a long moment, neither of them moved.\n“Can you… can you give me another sign?” Gill asked.\nShe had to lift her foot. Gill was staring straight at her. She couldn’t wait\nhim out. Anyone might come in at any moment. Anyone who came in\nwould surely go straight to Gill to offer some comfort—and Teia was\nblocking the aisle, rooted to the floor.\nTeeth gritted, tears swimming in her eyes, she lifted her foot. The floor\nsqueaked a protest. She retreated. From the barracks door, she looked back.\nIt was as if a great weight had been lifted from Gill’s shoulders. He was\nstanding, his face radiant. “I knew it!” he said. “I knew you wouldn’t leave\nme…” His face twisted suddenly, a cavalry charge of tears of grief\nsmashing against the shields of a smile, and his last word was a whisper.\n“… alone.”\nHe wept then, and spoke to his dead little brother, and Teia couldn’t stay,\nand she couldn’t leave. Like a monster, she eavesdropped, and she knew it\nwas a profound betrayal of those brothers she’d loved.\nShe was unforgiveable. Irredeemable.\nShe slowly sank into the sticky shadows of the hall. Her home. Human\ngrief and human love and every species of human bonds and heart\nconnections had floated at her fingertips, sometimes pushing in, sometimes\nwaiting for her to reach out her hands and pull them to her once more.\nShe’d been pushing it all away for the last year, and now as if by long\npractice her muscles of rejection had grown immensely strong, her\nhumanity flown far from her.\nNo. No! This wasn’t what she wanted, was it? From the darkness of her\nshadowy perch in the hall, she only watched as two figures rounded the\ncorner of the tower’s circular hallway into view. Essel and one-handed\nTrainer Samite fell silent as they approached the double doors of the\nbarracks that they’d each gone through thousands of times.\nWith her hand hovering short of the door handle, Samite said, “Done\nthis shit too many times this year.”\n“But not with a kid Gav’s age,” Essel said.\nThrough her teeth, Samite addressed only the floor. “I don’t even know\nGill that well. It shouldn’t be me.”\n“It shouldn’t be you giving him comfort,” Essel agreed. “But right now\nit’s nobody at all.” Her tone was as soft and near as Teia felt cold and\ndistant. Essel hesitated one moment more, giving Samite a chance, but then,\nas the trainer failed to marshal her courage as she had never failed in battle,\nEssel didn’t reproach her. She only said quietly, “I’ll go in now. You can\ncome when you’re ready.”\nBut then Samite cursed quietly and opened the door. The two veterans\ndisappeared inside together."

        "text": "come when you’re ready.”\nBut then Samite cursed quietly and opened the door. The two veterans\ndisappeared inside together.\nIt was as if someone had held a long-lens up to each of Teia’s eyes—\nbackward. Every good thing Teia had ever wanted in life suddenly\nwhooshed as far away as Orholam’s Eye was to a woman pulled into the\ndepths of the sea, drowning unseen.\nTeia was exactly what she hated and condemned. She was Karris:\noffering those who deserved the truth a comforting lie instead, telling\nherself that her profound deception wasn’t a betrayal.\nIn the hall, she passed a mirror and couldn’t help but seek herself in its\neyes.\nFramed in a socket of rotting wood, with the tired, tarnished silver\neyeshine of an aging nighttime carnivore, the dull, distorted glass revealed\nnothing where Teia stood—it showed a nullity more profound than\ndarkness. All that was, still was, without her in the frame. Teia’s absence\nwas merely an empty bunk in the barracks, soon filled by another. She\nwasn’t even a name on the lists of the war dead, a last sound heard a last\ntime as it was read aloud to ears desperate not to hear some other name read\nout. She wasn’t even one last scribble on a page to be posted publicly and\nskimmed over by some bereft family wondering if they would never hear\nany word at all of a lost son. The hole within her that had expanded with\nevery murdered slave now reached beyond every bound of her body.\nShe was become absence itself.\nShe was more dead than Gav Greyling, who was still loved, who still\nhad one who spoke to him.\nNot so long ago, a fierce and fiery young Blackguard would have filled\nthat mirror. Teia had been—she saw only now—beautifully alive. So, so\nyoung. But not less because of it. She’d been vibrant, strong, passionate.\nPlayful.\nAn afterimage of her own old white-hot smile stole onto Teia’s lips.\nThen it cooled, darkened.\nSomeone had murdered that spirited girl and turned her into a ghost. She\ncould cast the guilt on others for that, but when she examined all the\nevidence honestly, she could still only see her own hand bloody on the\nknife.\n* * *\nWith her thoughts hanging as heavy about her head as a burial shroud, as\nshe left the Chromeria, Teia missed the low, slow scuff of rubber-soled\nshoes following her softly as a shadow.\nChapter 22\n“Beautiful, ain’t it?” a voice said behind Gavin. “And you and I’ll make it\nthrough the mist wall. Just wish I wasn’t going to drown before I reach\nshore.”\nGavin froze. He knew that voice. The view of distant White Mist Tower\nthat had so riveted him suddenly faded to insignificance.\n“I’m a little too late, aren’t I?” the old man continued. “You’ve already\ndecided what you want, haven’t you, oarmate? Then creation weeps at my\nfailure.”\n“What’s this?” Gunner demanded as Gavin turned.\n“Stowaway, Cap’n,” the first mate said. Pansy’s hard face twisted like\nold oak gnarling. “Sorry for interruptin’.”"

Pansy’s hard face twisted like\nold oak gnarling. “Sorry for interruptin’.”\n“Well, I’ll be!” Gunner shouted. He clapped his hands together, not once\nbut in a weird quick rhythm.\n“The men wanted to toss him overboard right off,” she said. “I thought\nmaybe a keelhaulin’ instead? See if this luxin hull stays as clean as claimed,\neh? Good for some entertainment, either way.”\nBleeding from his mouth and nose, one eye swollen, and with both arms\nimprisoned by sailors with blood on their fists and grins on their faces, was\nnone other than Gavin’s old holier-than-thou oarmate, Orholam.\n“No, no, no!” Gunner said, laughing. “This here’s one of my old rowers!\nWe go way back! You can’t throw him to the sea! Ceres’d spit out such\nstringy meat!”\nOrholam released a held breath, relieved. Apparently, he wasn’t quite as\ncertain of his prophecy as he’d claimed.\nGavin didn’t particularly enjoy the rush of warm feelings that flowed\nover him at the sight of the old coot, but they had lived and worked and\nfought together during the worst part of Gavin’s life.\nCorrection: the worst of my life up until that point. The cells under the\nChromeria had been worse.\nThe prophet dared a small smile at his old owner.\nGunner repaid the smile with interest, but there was an edge to that\nsmile that Gavin didn’t like.\n“Apologies for my tardiness, lord,” Orholam said, head drooping once\nmore. “I didn’t think they’d take to the beating with such gusto.”\n“I ain’t no lord,” Gunner said. “I’m better. I’m a captain. A legend. I am\n—”\n“I wasn’t talking to you,” Orholam said.\n“Oh, then I forgive you,” Gavin said quickly. The seed of an idea was\nsprouting in his mind. A prophet was a wild card to be snatched up as\nquickly as possible. Sailors were a superstitious lot. “But maybe—”\n“Wasn’t talking to you neither,” Orholam said. “You’re lord of shit-all\nnow.”\nGunner laughed at Gavin’s expression.\n“You’re not makin’ any friends, old man,” Gavin shot back. “And it\nseems to me right now you need some.”\nOrholam said, “‘Need’ is a strange word for this day. ‘Friend’ is even\nstranger.”\n“Stranger?” Captain Gunner said, stubbornly holding on to his glee.\n“What’s stranger is that the fate of a god is given into my hand, Orholam.”\n“Nor for the last time,” Orholam mumbled to the deck.\nCaptain Gunner roared, “Pansy!”\n“I’m still right here… Captain,” the woman said, at his elbow,\nnonplussed.\nFor the first time, Gavin’s guile spied a little wedge into which he might\nforce his will. So Pansy didn’t particularly love serving Gunner, huh?"

Psh,” Gunner said. “Keel’ this old boy? This old boy is\nOrholam hissown self. Orholam deserves spatial treatment.” He smiled. It\nwasn’t a kind smile.\nGavin saw Orholam swallow hard.\nOh, shit. Gavin’s plan, half-formed as it was, required Orholam. Alive.\nOffhand, Gunner said, “Strap him to the cannon.”\nHis confidence vanishing, Orholam slumped, propped up only by the\ntwo sailors holding his arms, but he made no attempt at escape, resigned to\nhis fate. Out here, at the center of the Cerulean Sea, where was there to run?\n“Wh-why do this?” Gavin asked Gunner.\n“Better question. Why not?” Gunner said.\nThe sailors draped Orholam over the cannon, hugging the barrel with\nboth hands and feet. They stopped when they saw Gunner looking at them\nlike they were complete morons.\n“What’re you thinkin’ I wanna do? Warm his tenders with a few shots?\nScald him to death through repeated firing?” Gunner demanded.\nThey looked back and forth at each other.\n“Uh… over the muzzle then, Captain?” one asked. “Yessir! Right!”\nUnder Gunner’s baleful eye, the sailors stripped Orholam to the waist. It\nonly took them a short time to figure out how to tie the old rower over the\nmouth of the big cannon: his butt supported by ropes, arms and legs lashed\ndown the barrel, facing toward the breech, torso strapped so as to cover the\nopening of the muzzle itself. The cannon’s round shot was nearly as wide as\nthe prophet’s skinny chest.\nThe sailors began taking lighthearted bets on whether the shot would\npunch a hole cleanly through him, or if it would tear the prophet in half.\nGavin suddenly felt the old lens displacement he’d felt when in the\nspace of a single hour he’d gone from a dignified discussion over tea in the\npalace at Ru during the Prisms’ War to joining his men at their fires, with\ntheir jokes about hilarious murders they’d committed that morning.\nIn the incongruities of war, sometimes you wonder, Am I even the same\nperson?\nBut these men weren’t soldiers. They’d not sacrificed their illusions and\nparts of their souls in order to pursue some noble ideal. He’d known that\nthese sailors weren’t good people; they were serving the Order of the\nBroken Eye. But hell, even Gavin himself was sort of serving the Order\nnow. Seeing that they were assholes made him feel a lot better that they\nwere on this suicide mission with him.\nLet ’em die.\n“Why kill Orholam, Gunner?” Gavin asked, louder.\nGunner looked at him sharply.\n“Captain Gunner, I mean. Sir,” Gavin said, suppressing a cringe.\nBut Gunner let it go, turning to Orholam instead. “My, my, my, I thrust\nout into the sea with all my charms, and what wonderous babes that old\ngruntin’ labia-clapper slides easy into my harms. Arms.”"

Arms.”\nHe spat into the sea, then examined the swollen, bloodied face of his old\nslave: the sailors had been none too gentle when they found him hiding\nbelowdecks.\nOddly, though, the prophet seemed to have already recovered his good\nspirits.\nMinus the beating, the last year of not being chained to an oar had been\ngood for Orholam. His cheeks weren’t so hollow, and now he owned the\nmodest tunic and trousers of a Parian tradesman. Any burnous or head\ncovering he might have been wearing earlier had been taken, though,\nsearched for weapons. The Order were big believers in paranoia.\nBut there was no mistaking Gavin’s old oarmate, the man whose real\nname he’d never heard. In all Gavin’s time as a galley slave, this man had\nspoken so rarely, and so infuriatingly full of religious platitudes, that he’d\nbeen dubbed ‘Orholam.’\nOrholam still had the reedy, strong arms of the oarsman he had been,\nand the bright eyes of the madman he doubtless still was.\n“You got nothing to say, my own li’l ora’lem Or’holam?” Gunner said.\n“You know Old Parian?” Gavin asked. Ora’lem Or’holam. Hidden\nOrholam?\n“Hidden no more,” Orholam said.\n“Shut up, you,” Gunner said. He addressed Gavin. “Good curses, Old\nParian. My mama taught me. She loved to curse. Said it was the mark of a\nmature mind, cursin’ fluently. Said every man should have fifty ways o’\ntelling a man to bugger a viper’s nest inside a cactus, and every woman\ndouble that many. I ever tell you about my mama?”\nHe couldn’t have forgotten. Gavin surely never would.\nGunner regarded Orholam through bushy brows. “Orholam! You’re a\nprophet. Prophet-size me what I’mma say next.”\nOrholam sighed. “Something about seeing as how I’m a stowaway, I can\npay for my passage by giving you a prophecy for free.”\n“I’ll be damned,” one of the sailors holding Orholam’s arms said.\n“So wait,” Gavin said. “Does that count?”\nThe sailors looked confused. The captain kept his face blank.\n“You asked him for one prophecy, and he gave you one. A true one, too,\nby the look on your face. So… that pays his passage, right?”\nGunner’s face looked like, while expecting brandy, he’d just quaffed\nbilge water.\n“If you’re getting one free glimpse into the future, it’s too bad you\nwasted yours,” Gavin said, “but he did give you what you demanded.”\n“That one didn’t take prophecy to figure out,” Orholam said, sighing.\n“I’m happy to oblige with another.”\nThe crew, at least, seemed excited for the show to go on.\n“How’d you do that?” Gunner demanded.\n“After Guile here and young Lord Malargos freed us all from… well,\nfrom you, Captain, I took an oath never to lie again. It’s been less pleasant"

It’s been less pleasant\nto fulfill than even I’d guessed it would be. When men ask my vocation and\nI tell them I’m a prophet… let’s just say, I get blindfolded and hit a lot.\nPeople ask me to say which one of them hit me. If I don’t tell them, they\nthink I can’t, and thus I’m a fraud—which often gets me a beating. If I do\ntell them, though, they tend to try it again to see if I simply guessed\ncorrectly once, or twice, or three times. Not a fun game for me.”\n“Good news, then,” Gunner said, seeming to have regained his footing.\n“There’ll be no games.”\n“I wasn’t implying—”\n“When’d you take that oath?” Gunner asked.\n“I said—”\n“You shut up! You’re a liar,” Gunner said.\n“I never lied to—”\n“Not another word!” Gunner said. He thrust out his hand toward one of\nthe sailors. “Linstock!”\n“No, wait!” Orholam shouted. “Please—”\nGunner punched him in the face so fast the older man didn’t even see it\ncoming. His face snapped back so hard Gavin worried his neck was broken,\nand blood sprayed into the air, and then down his mouth and chin as his\nbroken nose gushed blood.\n“Prophets are hard to ken, but Gunner is not,” Gunner said.\nThat actually was not at all true.\n“Interplat me this, prophet,” Gunner said. “What do you think I said\nwhen I meant not another word?”\nOrholam opened his mouth to speak, then stopped, confused.\nThe sailors looked the same. One of them held out the linstock with a\nmatch cord affixed in it to the captain, but the captain didn’t even seem\naware of him now.\n“What do you thean I mink!” Gunner bellowed, drawing back his fist\nagain.\nGavin darted between them. “He’s respecting you, Captain. Obeying\nyou. If he answers, he’d be disobeying your order to be silent. See?”\n“Ahhh! Stickin’ up for your whoremate. But… that’s true, ain’t it?”\nGunner said, stepping back. He twisted a bit of his beard and chewed on it.\n“My order to him did set the sails against the rowers, eh? ’Tain’t fair, that.\nAnd I do believe in a fair taint.”\n“Then it’s no wonder you enjoyed your time with Pansy’s mother so\nmuch, Captain,” Gavin said, deadpan.\nGunner guffawed as the sailors nearby chuckled or laughed aloud,\nthough Pansy did not. Then Gunner stopped abruptly.\n“You’re a crafty little cunt, ain’tcha, Guile?”\nGavin said, “Once upon a time, I was actually reckoned a big cunt.”\nGunner was not amused. “Don’t get above your station, wee little man,\nor we’ll make your lady parts more gapey than you’d wish, like Orh’lam’s\nare about to be.”"

Gavin gulped. If every\nattempt at humor was a risk, attempts at humor with a happily homicidal\nmadman were perhaps a risk not wisely taken.\n“Gapey Guile, they’ll call ya, eh, eh?” the captain asked.\nThe sailors chuckled dutifully, and then Gunner dismissed them to their\nwork. They left the forecastle like it was an order. As they went, Gunner\nwaggled his eyebrows at Gavin, grinning, suddenly convivial again.\nAha, Gavin had been speaking out of turn, so Gunner had merely been\nshowing them who was in charge.\nGavin had gotten off lightly for such an offense. He wasn’t even bloody.\nMy lucky day.\nNow Gunner gazed at the horizon. “No one hates the sea like a sailor,”\nhe said.\nHe patted the big cannon that dominated the forecastle. The damned\nthing—now with bonus prophet adorning the muzzle—was steel. Steel, not\nbrass. Gavin had never seen such a thing, always heard that steel couldn’t\nbe cast reliably this large. Either the Ilytians were making rapid advances in\ntheir metallurgy or every shot with this thing was risking a shrapnel-filled\ndeath for everyone on the forecastle.\nGunner hopped up on the cannon, his sentiment passing as quick as a\nwhitecap. “Queer, eh? Boomer this big, out front? Should be too heavy so\nhigh up, made o’ steel. Should make the ship squirrely as all hell, foulin’ her\ncenter of weight.”\n“But it doesn’t?” Gavin guessed. He had no delusions that Gunner had\nforgotten about Orholam, and whatever it was he had against the old man.\n“Lighter than possible,” Gunner said.\nWell, obviously not, Gavin thought.\n“Shoots true, too,” Gunner said. “Accurate within your arm’s stretch at a\nthousand paces. Greatest random is near thrice that.”\n“You name her?” Gavin asked, trying to anchor himself back on\nGunner’s good side.\nGunner had walked down the barrel until he was looming over Orholam.\nHe stood on one foot, and with his opposite big toe lifted Orholam’s chin to\nlook at him. But Gavin’s words distracted him. “Her? Her?! What the—how\ndumb are ya, Guile? Her! Him. C’mon. Cannons’re always he’s. Even you\nwith your inky fingers gorta know that!” He did hip thrusts out over the\nempty air. “Boom! Boom!”\n“Ah. Of course,” Gavin said.\nGunner held on to nothing. He stared at the sky, he stared at the sea, he\nstared at his crew. He squatted now and patted the side of his cannon as a\nsane man might pat a horse’s cheek. “Ol’ Phin gave him the\ncognomenclature The Compelling Argument.”\nGunner stood, and kicked a lever, then rode the cannon as it slid slowly"

And it’s a very fitting name.”\n“Captain, may I—” Orholam interjected timidly.\n“You a slow learner, boy?” Gunner blazed, spittle flying.\nOrholam swallowed.\n“You’ll get your chance to proffer a defiance.” Gunner’s eyes flicked\nupward. He tugged his beard. “Defense. ‘Defiance’ is good, though, eh,\nGapin’ Guile?”\nGavin nodded. “It works. It defiantly works.”\nGunner missed it. That intense focus on one thing at a time that served\nhim so well elsewhere meant the man often missed everything else.\n“Shaped shells, you ever heard a such a thing?” Gunner asked. “Fer a\ncannon. And old Phin left forms so’s I can make more. They gives me an\nextra two hunnerd paces, ackerate! BUT! I can use regular old round shot,\ntoo. And looksie this.”\nGunner showed Gavin a set of levers that popped out near the muzzle.\nGavin couldn’t even pretend to understand.\n“Puts spin on a ball, if you use a ball. Don’t work for the shaped shells,\nunmoors the putty,” Gunner said. More’s the pity? “Costs yer some\ndistance, but I can curve a cannonball. Up, down, or t’either side. Not\nmuch, mind you, and not sure what good it be—drop a ball tight o’er a wall,\nmaybe? Phin was prollaby havin’ fun. Showin’ off like he do. You wanna\nsee?”\n“Love to!” Gavin said. There wasn’t much entertainment out here, and\nGunner treated him nearly like an equal, as long as Gavin played along with\nhis whims. “But… um…”\nGavin motioned to the old man strapped over the muzzle.\n“Oh, I hadn’t forgot!” Gunner said. “You think I can curve it ’round\nhim?”\nOrholam’s body was entirely blocking the muzzle.\n“If it were possible, you’d be the one to do it,” Gavin said. “But… I’m\nafraid he’d just foul the spin and mess it all up.”\nGunner scowled. Orholam was nodding emphatically.\n“Eh, still worth a shot!” Gunner said. He began checking the cannon\nwith the unhurried efficiency of an old minstrel tuning her lute. Then he\nexamined the harness that strapped the old prophet to the muzzle, arms and\nlegs bound down the wide barrel, his belly and chest positioned to be turned\ninto mist.\n“It’s going to make such a mess,” Gavin said.\n“Ol’ Phin knew I love shit like this,” Gunner said as if he hadn’t spoken.\n“Curving cannonballs.

But… my luck was no\nbetter with them than it had been gambling.”\nYou tried to woo his daughters first, and then their mother.

Now, port or starbeard? I mean, I could go up or down, but it\njust look like I shot short or long to an ignorant layman like yerself.”\n“I don’t know, Captain.

Course, course.” Gunner turned to the bound old man, who was\nsweating profusely now. Gunner said, “You coulda helped me, a lot. With\nwhat you kin do.”\n“I did help you. Every day,” Orholam said. “Rowing?” He winced as he\nsaid the last, as if he couldn’t help himself.\n“Ahaha!” Gunner said, picking up the linstock and adjusting the match\ncord. “Funny, funny. I got me a sense of humor, too. Explosive one.

I meant the reef.\nWe’ll see and hear the reef itself within the hour.”\n“Really going out on a limb there, aren’t you?” Gavin asked, though he\nwasn’t sure why. He needed Orholam alive.

Maybe we can do that\nsometime when I’m not strapped to a cannon by an angry madm—er,\nMaster, uh, Master Gentleman?”\n“About me,” Gunner said, grabbing a handful of Orholam’s salted beard.\n“Proffer-size about me. Or you will see an angry mad master gentleman.\nAnd no lies this time!”\n“What’s this about?” Gavin asked.\n“Last time he told me I wouldn’t lose the blade!”\nOrholam said, “I said you’d live to give it willingly to Dazen Guile, not\nthat you’d keep it at all times between when I told you that and when you\nfinally gave it to him. And do you not wear it even now?”\n“I gambled because a what you said! And I lost! Twice!” Gunner said.\n“You can’t go making porphyries what don’t mean what people think they\ndo.”\n“Actually, I think that’s the main business of prophets,” Gavin said.\n“Not with me. Understand?” Gunner said to Orholam, as if it had been\nhe who talked back to him, not Gavin.\n“You’ll not die on the reef,” Orholam said, fearful. “I swear it.”\n“So we make it! We shoot the gap! I told you I’d be in the books, Gilly!”\nGunner expelled a big breath. “Do you see how many cannon I gotta use?\nStraight approach, or swinging ’round?”\nBut Gavin went to another tack. “Wait, wait. Not on the reef? So… does\nthat mean the captain’ll drown before he gets to the reef? He’ll be battered\nto death by the ship breaking up?”\nWhat was he doing? He needed the prophet alive.\n“No! No. He’ll live.” But there was a sudden hesitation in the prophet’s\ncountenance.\n“Orholam…” Gunner said, warning. “Tell me the whole truth.”"

Damn\nyou, no! I gave everything for this ship!”\n“What?” Gavin said. “No you didn’t. You gambled for it. And you didn’t\neven win. And it was my blade you gambled in the first place!”\n“Mine!” Gunner said.\n“So we’ll never make it past the reef?” Gavin said.\n“That’s… not exactly what I said,” Orholam said.\n“Are we going to break up on the reef or no?” Gunner demanded.\n“We’re going to…” Orholam suddenly looked very, very reluctant. “It’s\nill luck to speak… of them.”\nGunner’s dark visage turned green. “Nay,” he breathed. He spat in the\nsea. “Tell me.”\n“All eight,” Orholam said. “Within the hour.”\n“All eight what?” Gavin asked. He was afraid that he already knew.\n“Ceres’s sons,” Gunner whispered.\n“Aye,” Orholam said. “Soon now, I think.”\nThe captain made the sign of the three and the four. “No. There’s got to\nbe a way.”\nOrholam said,\n“Twenty-two there were, of the needed nine,\nWho swam, immortal, ’gainst the scythe of time.\nNow eight there are, of the needed nine,\nUluch Assan brings the end this time.”\nUluch Assan. That was Gunner’s birth name.\nGunner’s face darkened. “This is not on me! What was I supposed to\ndo? Let her kill us? I was a boy who begged onna the gun crew, not the\ncaptain o’ that vessel. It wasn’t my fault we sailed inta these waters!”\n“These waters?” Gavin asked. “You mean you’ve been here before? You\nhave! This was where you killed the—”\n“Don’t name ’em!” Gunner said. “It’s bad luck.”\n“This was where you earned your name?” Gavin asked.\nBut neither of them answered him.\nIt suddenly made sense. How else would Gunner have known the sea\ndemons were here, or the shape of the reef? Why else would Grinwoody\nhave chosen Gunner to pilot his ship here, rather than one of his own\npeople?\nOrholam said, “The dark ones live on light—”\n“What, like plants?” Gavin asked.\n“No, the imbalances in it,” he said.\n“What are you talking about, ‘the imbalances’?” Gavin said. “Prisms\ntake care of any color imbalances.”\n“You’re the first Prism to do that fully since Vician’s Sin,” Orholam\nsaid. “Since that time, the… the dark ones have been tolerated by the\nChromeria for what they do. In subtle ways and explicit when necessary,\ndrafters have been forbidden to harm them.”\n“But why? How’s this fit with balancing?”\n“It’s really hard—” Orholam coughed unconvincingly. “It’s hard to take"

How’s this fit with balancing?”\n“It’s really hard—” Orholam coughed unconvincingly. “It’s hard to take\na breath tied like this. I’m not sure if I can answer—”\nGunner lifted the burning match cord on the linstock close to the old\nman’s face and then began moving it toward the fuse. “What if I say\nplease?”\nOrholam cleared his throat. “Most of the bane form here, and spin out\nthrough the sea. The dark ones devour the bane. Generally when the crystals\nare small and harmless. The bane only become truly dangerous when wights\nfind them, because the bane can be used to amplify wights’ powers. But\nwhen the bane are small, they’re just food for the dark ones, forming\nconstantly—just a consequence of magic in our world. Even a Prism\nbalancing only minimizes how many appear. So in certain ways, this is your\nfault, too, Guile.”\n“Mine?!”\n“See! I told you this wasn’t on me!” Gunner said.\nOrholam said, “With you balancing in truth, there were fewer bane, so\nthe sea—err, so the dark ones had to go swim far from here to find other\nfood. With them all feeding at the far corners of the seas, their net was\nspread too thin here to catch the sudden surge of bane that erupted once you\nso suddenly stopped balancing.”\n“So it’s kind of both of our faults?” Gavin asked. “How do you know all\nthis?”\n“I’m a prophet. Knowing is what we do. It’s not all about the future. In a\nworld like ours, it’s just as often about the past.”\n“Fine, then, no answer is fine,” Gavin said. Maybe Orholam had been\nsome kind of historian before he’d been captured and press-ganged, chained\nto his oar. Maybe he’d once had access to books Gavin had never known.\n“What was that about ‘the needed nine’?”\n“Can you cut me loose yet?” Orholam asked. “It would be so much\neasier—”\n“No!” Gunner growled.\n“Nine of the dark ones survived into our era. Nine were enough to\ndevour all the bane that formed. On the day Uluch Assan killed the ninth,\nDazen Guile’s gift awoke.”\n“My gift? Drafting black, you mean.”\n“I’m not going to be more specific.”\n“But you know.”\n“Oh yes. I kept misunderstanding what I needed to do and say here until\nOrholam revealed it all to me. But you don’t deserve the same treatment.\nYou haven’t acted with the same obedience I have. You’ve distanced\nyourself from the truth, so the distance between you and the truth is your\nfault, not mine. Regardless, one might say, in a way, everything here—the\nwar, the False Prism’s War, all the death and misery and destruction—was\none man’s fault.”\nHe called it the ‘False Prism’s War’ rather than the Prisms’ War. Fuck\nyou, Orholam. “I’m tired of taking the blame for everything,” Gavin said.\n“He warn’t talking ’bout you,” Gunner said. There was a weariness in\nhis voice."

That’s why you\nget to be here now. You wanted the ultimate test for your gifts? It’s coming.\nYou want to be a legend? Maybe that, too. But your Name in history\ndepends on what he does.” He waggled a finger, but his arm was tied to the\nbarrel, so it wasn’t clear where he was pointing.\n“Me?” Gavin asked. “Gunner’s legend depends on me?”\n“As does my own life.”\n“Your life?”\n“Yes, but I’ve given up on that. Doesn’t matter. You’re not that man,\nGavin Guile. What does matter is that if you don’t succeed, Gunner will die\nout here.”\n“I thought you said I live!” Gunner protested.\n“Today. But if Gavin—well, this Gavin, since one is supposed to be very\ncareful with words when giving prophecy—if this man here fails, you’ll\neventually despair, drink seawater, and try to swim home. I think you drown\nwhile fighting sharks. Regardless, they eat you before or after you drown or\na little of you before you drown—your left foot?—and then the rest of you\nafter.”\n“Do I put up a good fight?” Gunner asked. He was standing delicately\non his right foot as if the deck were covered in broken glass and he didn’t\nwant to put down his left foot. He made little fists with his toes.\nOrholam twisted his mouth, a man trapped between his morality and his\nmortality. “For a man who’s cooked in the sun for days without shelter and\ndrunk seawater… you certainly, uh, give it your all.”\n“All of ’em are here?” Gunner asked.\n“All eight,” Orholam said.\n“Do I kill any afore they get me?” Gunner asked.\n“You don’t kill any of the dark ones, and they don’t get you,” Orholam\nsaid.\nGavin expected Gunner to rage at that, but he got very quiet instead. He\nremoved the match cord from the linstock. Stubbed it out on the great\ncannon, then buffed out the black smear with his coat sleeve.\n“He’s a beaut, ain’t he?” Gunner said. “Makes me almost want to turn\npirateer again, just to get the chance to try him in battle. Curved shots? Hell,\nhe’s got two dozen other tricks that are even better. I sailed out a few\nleagues from the Jaspers and popped off as many shots as I could for weeks,\ngetting my mastery up.

That deserves rewardin’.”\nHe cut Orholam free.\nPerhaps wisely, Orholam kept his mouth shut now, even as he rubbed\nfeeling back into his legs and arms.\n“White Mist Reef ain’t like the Everdark Gates,” Gunner said. “Men\nhave shot the Gates afore. There are ways through. You need luck and a\nchart and a great crew, but it can be done. It’s special, sure, but not\nlegendary. But no one’s made it through White Mist Reef. At least, none\nwho’ve also made it back. No one. I thought if anyone could do it, it’d be\nyou an’ me, Guile.”\n“I suppose it would,” Gavin said, uncertain where this was going.\n“Magnificent critter, she was. We named her Ceres, said the whole sea\nmust be hers. She followed us half a week while Captain scouted the reef,\nand seemed well-nigh content to hold back, until we tried to shoot the gap.\nThen she boiled the seas with her fury. We’d been expectin’ it. Plan was to\ndistract her with the shock and sounds of the rafts blowin’ up in the waters\n’round us. The gun captain was a fool, though. Didn’t set the fuses right.\nGot the timing wrong. Wouldn’t listen when I told him. So when it all went\nto shit, I pushed him out a gunport and took charge. I walked our shots right\nin a line to the last raft, heavy-loaded with black powder. Six hundred paces\nout. My timin’ never been so good. Ceres came up from beneath and just as\nshe lifted that raft up inta the air in her jaws… My shot hit the barrels of\nblack powder.\n“For half a minute, I felt like a god. Everyone cheered. And then I felt\nashamed. I watched that great beauty bubble and bleed and sink with her\njaws all blown four directions, and the other dark ones stopped their circlin’\nand came fast to their dead sister. They tried to prop her up in the water. I\nswear, they grieved. And I knew then that what I done was wrong. I knew I\nwas acurst. Been runnin’ from Ceres’s vengeance ever since.”\n“Why did you come back?” Gavin asked.\n“A man gets tired a runnin’, Guile.”\nGunner disappeared then, and left Gavin and Orholam bewildered on the\nforecastle. “It’s not a death sentence,” Orholam said. “Well, not\nnecessarily.”\n“Shut up,” Gavin said.\nGunner reappeared.

Orholam\nimmediately began helping Gavin tie the long blade to his back with the\nvery ropes he’d been bound with moments before. Gavin didn’t even think\nto ask why.\n“Well, look at that,” Gunner said. Inexplicably, his bright mood had\nreturned.\n“Land ho!” a voice called from the crow’s nest. The sailor hadn’t even\nfully climbed the rigging to get in the nest, the clouds had parted so\nsuddenly.\nIt was a bright spring day.\nThe sound of the surf rushing through the teeth of the coral came to\nthem.\n“Behold,” Orholam said. “White Mist Reef.”\n“We go down fighting,” Gunner announced.\n“‘Old age hath yet his honor and his toil’?” Gavin quoted.\n“Old farts always did like them lines,” Gunner said. “‘Though much is\ntaken, naught abides.’”\n“I don’t think that’s how that—”\nA shout rang out from the crow’s nest: “Creature, hie!”\n“Critter? What critter?!” Pansy called from the wheel.\nGunner and Gavin cursed in concert.\n“Reef ho!” the lookout shouted. “And… a spout? A spout! It’s a whale!\nA great black whale!”\n“Aha!” Gunner said. He danced in a little circle, then waggled a finger in\nfront of Orholam’s face. “So much for that, eh? Sunk by a sea demon?\nEveryone knows whales and the dark ones won’t tolerate each other—hair\ngoat, a whale here means there can’t be no—”\n“More whales! A full pod, sir!” the lookout cried.\nGunner laughed aloud, delighted. It was an infectious sound. “A pod!\nThat means they’ve driven away the—”\n“No. Wait.” The lookout’s voice dropped so low Gavin could barely hear\nit. “No, that’s not possible.”\n“Report!” Gunner shouted. “Damn your poxy orbs! Report!”\n“Sea demons! Three—maybe four sea demons. Closing on the whale,\nfast.”\nThe news settled on the crew like a burial shroud.\n“Permission to go unchain the oar slaves, Captain?” Orholam asked,\nbreaking the silence. He muttered. “They won’t stop rowing, I can promise\nyou that.”\nGunner didn’t answer him, still stunned by the news.\nOrholam said quietly, “They all die regardless, but it’ll give ’em hope.\nIt’s no small thing to give a man facing his doom.”\n“Permission denied,” Gunner said, snapping back into action. “You!” he\nshouted at a man. “Get me a pack. Stuffed with rations and water and\nbrandy. Much as you can carry. Get back soonest. Gun crews! Stations!\nGunports open!”\nThe rattle of commands didn’t stop.

Of course, it was\nsuperstitious nonsense, prophecy. Of course it was.\nBut when his fate flies from his own hands, a man takes comfort where\nhe can.\n“Oh, aye, some of us,” Orholam said. “Gods have always been fond of\nprophets and madmen.”\n“And emperors?” Gavin suggested.\nOrholam said, “I don’t see any of those here.”\nChapter 23\n“You strike me as decent and fundamentally honest,” Kip said, staring not\nat the Keeper but at the mechanism filling the great white oak tree towering\nabove them.\n“Thank you,” the Keeper of the Flame said.\n“Fundamentally honest, but you’re not being honest now,” Kip said, as\nif merely clarifying.\nHe pretended to ignore her, examining the Great Mirror. He’d never seen\nsuch an odd collision of materials. Nested metal frames on three axes were\nsupported by limbs that had obviously been grown for the task, and the\nfoliage itself had been husbanded so as to leave gaps for the light to come in\nand go out.\nKip had held suspicions that some things in the natural world were\nshaped by luxin as much as human drafters were. The extinct atasifusta\ntrees were the most obvious candidates, but sea demons were said to be\ndeeply entwined with magic, too, and his Night Mares said there was a\nspecial feel to giant elk, giant grizzlies, giant javelinas, and certain other\nanimals. Certainly this tree was larger than any white oak he’d ever heard\nof.\nShe spoke up. “Perhaps you misread my discomfort. This entire area is\nvirtually aglow with chi. Unless you and all your friends wish to get the\nsame cancers that are killing me, we must keep this very brief.”\nThe Keeper was once more ensconced in her golden armor and veils, so\nKip was studying her more covertly: heeding her vocal inflections, her\nstance, where her feet pointed, her crossed arms, her chin tucked as if he’d\ngo for her throat. For all that she’d said she would answer their questions,\nshe had secrets here she was protecting.\n“You’ve survived ten years of working with chi constantly. Are we to be\nfearful of dying after a quarter hour?” Kip asked.\n“Chi is as unpredictable as a mad old bull, my lord. It’s wisest to stay\nout of the corral.”\nAround him, the Mighty shuffled uneasily amid the verdant low\nunderbrush of the old-growth forest here so oddly atop a palace, complete\nwith mossy boulders and fallen tree limbs dissolving into the ground to feed\nmushrooms.\nOn a sudden hunch, Kip tightened his eyes all the way to chi. “That’s\nwhy you wear the armor,” he said. “That’s what you meant when you said\nyou’re not safe.”\nThe Keeper’s body itself had become so infused with chi that it"

She had become a living lantern of lethal light. That was the\nreason for the heavy armor she wore—not to keep attacks out but to keep\nthem in.\nNo wonder she didn’t want anyone to stand close. No wonder others\nfeared her so. No wonder the Chromeria feared chi and its drafters. Like\nparyl drafters, chi drafters could kill invisibly, but unlike their paryl\ncounterparts, they did so unwittingly, unknowably, uncontrollably.\n“That’s correct,” she said stiffly.\n“You may have given us a cancer already,” Kip said.\n“Yes.” Bitterness leaked through her clipped tones. It wasn’t enough that\nshe was dying, disfigured, and in pain, but she must be avoided by even\ncaretakers, worse than a leper.\nKip didn’t fight the sudden wave of fear that pushed through him, but\nneither did he step farther away. He looked for the seed of compassion he’d\nfelt for her instead. He took a slow breath, choosing to see her as a brave\nand noble woman while ignoring himself. “You’re a good person, strong\nand brave,” Kip said, “so—”\n“Are you mocking me, my lord?”\nOh, she was angry. Right on the edge. Or she was terrified.\n“Actually,” Kip said, “I was using this tricky rhetorical device we learn\nin the hinterlands of far Tyrea where I was born. We call it a ‘compliment.’”\nShe didn’t seem to know how to take that.\n“So…” Kip said, “since you’re that person. I can only figure that you’ve\ndecided that deceiving me is the right thing for you to do. Can you help me\nunderstand why?”\n“Excuse me?” she said.\n“Answering a question with a question is a classic telltale of a lie.”\n“I haven’t lied!” she said. “What do you want of us, Guile?”\n“Your secret is no secret,” Kip said. “You use the Great Mirror to pass\nmessages to Green Haven. That’s a stunning distance for a simple beam of\nlight, so you can’t be doing it directly. You’ve got to be using other smaller\nmirrors in between. Relay stations, like bonfires on hilltops. That’s the only\nreason you’d need three axes for this mirror, so you could move the beam\nelsewhere in case one of those hilltop mirror stations is taken or needs\nrepairs. But then it occurred to me that if you have mirror stations already,\nthere’s no reason you’d only communicate with Green Haven. With a few\ndozen stations, you could reach the entire satrapy. A message could be\nrelayed from one end of the satrapy to the other in the course of a night.\nThis is what I want from you—I want to use your network. I have people\nfar afield. If I can reach them, I can coordinate this satrapy’s defenses in\nways the Wight King couldn’t hope to counter. He’s blockaded the Great\nRiver. Do you know that?

Even if I could only get a message halfway\nacross the satrapy but on the other side of the blockade, we could—”\n“It’s gone,” she said.\n“What?”\n“There was such a network, long ago, before the Blood Wars. It was a\nhuge defensive advantage—but the Ruthgari realized it, too. They murdered\nany chi drafters they could find and destroyed the mirror holds. Chi drafters\nhave always been short-lived, and many of those few people who can learn\nto draft chi choose not to, given the costs. So we were always rare. The\nnetwork fell centuries ago. A few mirrors still remain, some buried, hidden\nby their old keepers for the day when all could be restored, but they’ve no\none tending them now. Where they’re known at all, they’re mere curiosities.\nMessages are only possible between here and Green Haven now, the old\ncapital and the new.”\n“Why is it a secret, then?”\n“We’re not supposed to have it at all. The Chromeria wanted us to shut\ndown all our defenses. They required it, but with the Ruthgari raiding, our\nancestors broke that part of the treaty immediately. All this was centuries\nago, mind you. The Chromeria didn’t care, as long as we kept our defiance\ndiscreet. That need for discretion and their long revulsion for chi drafters\nhas enforced us keeping a low profile. An overly zealous Magisterium or a\nhostile Prism could mean our deaths.”\nThere was still something she wasn’t telling him. “You use chi to adjust\nthe mirror’s positioning?” A yes-or-no question.\n“We can use it for all sorts of things. Sending the beam of the signal, of\ncourse, being the most important,” she said.\nNot a direct answer. “You use chi to adjust the mirror’s position?” he\ninsisted.\nShe hesitated.\nThat was the problem with an unpracticed liar. She hoped to mislead Kip\nwithout lying outright. She hadn’t considered exactly how far she was\nwilling to go to hide her secrets, or what Kip was likely to already know.\n“I thought it went without saying,” she said.\n“Odd thing to lie about,” Kip mused.\n“Are you quite dense?” she asked.\n“Again a question in reply to a question,” Kip said, as if commenting on\nthe weather.\nIt was strange. What was it that allowed him to react so differently to her\nthan to the Divines? She was lying to him. She’d just called him stupid. But\nhe was able to see that this wasn’t about him at all, so he didn’t need to win\nhere.\nStranger still, without him pushing back, she had nothing to push\nagainst, and she was falling over.\nShe said, “The Mirror has to be adjusted for weather conditions—some\nof which we understand and others we don’t,” she said. “For example, the\nlight will travel differently after or during a rain or on a very humid day.\nOther times, it seems some quality of the sunlight itself changes how clearly\nthe beams travel over these great distances.

So minute movements are\nnecessary even with our well-known target of Green Haven. Using even\nsmall amounts of chi repeatedly is, as you’ve seen, quite hazardous.”\n“Still hiding. Still deflecting,” Kip said.\nA perfect black globe broader across than Kip’s shoulders rested in the\ntrunk of the vast white oak itself, sunk into the wood—but leaving no\nrupture in the living wood, nor any oozing sap from a wound, nor any sign\nof the bark curling around it the way a natural tree might grow around a\nfence post. It looked as unnatural as if an image of a sphere had been\nsuperimposed on the tree trunk.\nInset around it were a number of similar black, featureless plates, only\nthe oils of past fingers proving they weren’t illusory.\nBut Kip wasn’t drawn to those. Instead, he set his hands directly on the\nglobe, and extended his will into it.\n“What are you doing?” the Keeper of the Flame asked. “Don’t touch\nthat!”\nHe ignored her.\n“You could die!” she said. She turned to Cruxer. “He could die! You\nhave to stop him!”\nNone of the Mighty moved.\n“We could all die if he does the wrong thing!” she said.\nShe reached a hand out to grab Kip, but suddenly found her arm held\nimmobile.\n“Then whatever he’s doing,” Cruxer said, his voice calmly professional\nbut his grip on her arm unyielding, “I suggest you don’t louse it up.”\nA touch of superviolet, and suddenly, above them, the vast shining disk\nthat was the Great Mirror wobbled.\n“Like I thought,” Kip said. “You don’t use chi to move the mirror. So\nwhat do you use it for?”\nThe mask hid all but a bit of her shaking her head. “Chi is more\nenergetic than any other color. It can go farther, with less diffusion.

All the way from here?!”\n“Yes.”\n“Show me.”\n“I can’t.”\n“You didn’t get cancers doing nothing.”\n“There’s… procedures.”\n“There’s something in here, inside this globe. I can feel a hollow. Open\nit for me, would you?” Kip asked.\n“I can’t do that.”\n“Won’t,” Kip corrected. “No matter. Big Leo, you think you can smash\nthis thing open with your chain?”\nBig Leo grunted and slid the heavy fighting chain off his shoulders. His\nvoice low and emotionless, he said, “Happy to try.”\nWinsen turned to Big Leo. “You know, if you do break it, they’re gonna\ngive him the credit, right? We should never have named him Breaker.”\n“Eh. I’m all right with that,” Big Leo said. “Long as I get to use my\nchain.”\nO’s beard, but he played the big dumb thug beautifully when he wanted\nto.\n“You can’t—no!” the Keeper said.

She moved her body between Big\nLeo and the black globe.\nKip lifted a hand, and Big Leo stopped. “Keeper,” Kip said, “I couldn’t\nhelp but notice the band of trees all the way up and down the sides of the\npalace, all the way up to this one at the crown. Tell me about that. Seems\nlike a lot of work. Why not just have the tree alone up here?”\nHe knew the answer. The locals said that beneath the surface, the roots\nof every tree in the city were connected with those of every other.\nIt might not be literally true, but it was a metaphor important enough to\nthe old Foresters that they’d built an earthen ramp up and down their entire\npalace. The ancient kings and queens of this realm had wanted to proclaim\nthat they were connected with all their people.\nShe seemed thrown off balance by his abrupt change in topic. “It’s,\nit’s… Trees are communal, Lord Guile,” she said. “The roots interlace,\npassing along needed nutrients and even physical support to one another,\nand especially to the tallest specimens. With the high winds up here, a white\noak alone wouldn’t stand for a year.”\n“Huh,” Kip said. “Helping each other, passing along what’s needed,\neven at some cost to themselves, so they all might thrive. United against the\nstorm. It’s almost as if there’s a lesson we could learn from that.”\n“The trees support one another, Lord Guile. The largest don’t only take,\nthey also give.”\n“And you don’t trust me to protect you. I don’t blame you. You’ve given\nyour life to be the Keeper of the Flame, and you’ll do anything not to\nbecome the Loser of the Flame.”\nShe folded her arms. “You already know, don’t you?”\nHe said nothing.\n“How?” she asked.\nHe drew in some superviolet and drew a line hanging in the air between\nthe black orb set in the tree trunk just over a natural boulder and to the wall\nof the gatehouse. The color difference was barely perceptible to the naked\neye. “Chi shadows,” Kip said. “A lot more than you can draft unaided. And\nthey’re more intense off to the side, as if they hadn’t been diffused by\npassing through the Keeper’s body in the same way.”\nHer chin lifted, as if to offer another lie, but then descended. She\nsuddenly had the air of one watching her life’s work die, her legacy tainted,\nher order headed for genocide.\n“They form all the time, you know,” she said. “I don’t think there’s ever\njust one, despite what the Chromeria says. They’re like lightning strikes,\nlittle discharge points for magic. And then they dissipate, usually. Unless\nsomeone with the right knowledge can get there first. Then she can stabilize\nit, build it if she wants. It calls to drafters, even over enormous distances if\nyou grow it large enough.

You have more than one?”\nShe sighed surrender. “There’s another in Green Haven. But you have to\nunderstand… they’re dangerous—very, very dangerous—but they’re not\nevil. Some of us even believe the Chromeria secretly has seven of their\nown, if not nine. How else have they gathered drafters for so long? But my\nlord, the Chromeria will kill us all if they find out we have it. Call us\nblasphemers, heretics, apostates, pagans. Blindfold and burn us, or put out\nour eyes, or put us on the Glare. All we’ve wanted is to be accepted back\ninto the fold.”\n“No. You wanted to keep power, too.”\n“We save lives with our training!” she protested.\nAnd yet here she was dying, and dying young.\nBut she went on. “We’ll be anathema. No one will be allowed to draft\nchi ever again, on pain of death. That’s what it means, if you tell them.”\nShe sighed again, but something about her seemed relieved. An honest\nwoman indeed. But then, chi was ever so good at exposing secrets; Kip\nshouldn’t have expected a chi drafter would love keeping them.\nThe Keeper walked to the globe. She touched it, and it opened like a\nflower. She reached a gloved hand inside and pulled out something smaller\nthan her thumb. The air around her hand shimmered as if she held an\ninvisible fire, but as she moved it, it spat out sparks of liquid-gold fire. The\nthing itself was hard to see at all from this distance, but it was much smaller\nthan he’d expected. Kip had seen larger stones set in women’s rings.\n“Is that…” Cruxer started. “Is that solid chi? I didn’t think such a thing\nexisted! Chi luxin?!”\nShe shook her head. “Lord Guile,” the Keeper said, her voice taking on\na formal tone, “Luíseach, you have come to bring light, which means\nbringing shameful secrets to the light. Here is both our light and our\nshameful secret. Behold that which slays us, and that without which this\ncity and my order is nothing. Behold the chi bane.”\n“Excellent,” Kip said. “I’ll take it.”\nChapter 24\nGavin had charged toward a likely death several dozen times. This was\ndifferent.\nIn the early part of the Prisms’ War, the hours before every battle had\nbeen exhausting: the anxious mental rehearsals and the fears of cowardice\nand shaming himself publicly, the fears of death, and worse—in the mind of\nthe young man he had been—the fear of living maimed or broken, which\nhe’d thought were the same thing. There had been the righting of\nrelationships: Just, you know, in case. There had been the writing of wills.\nThere had been the selfish prayers; it was the closest he’d ever come to real\npiety.\nFor all the damnable emotional and mental sweat of it, it had served one\npurpose at least: the heightened state of fear and exhilaration had come\neffortlessly, giving incredible energy and even strength, allowing him to"

It felt oddly like a loss.\nFear and excitement were gone, replaced with a butcher’s efficiency.\nToday’s fight was today’s work. I know what to do. I know what I control\nand what I don’t.\nAnd while he always knew the possible costs, he’d had little time or\nenergy to get worked up about it. There were things to do, things that would\nkeep him alive.\nToday was different. This was different.\nHe had nothing to do. He could only listen to the call of the overseer\nbelow his feet, keeping the slaves’ rowing tempo. Eighteen months ago, that\ninsistent beat would have meant terror and torn calluses and burning legs\nand lungs and new manacle cuts and blood. It now meant only the passage\nof time.\nHe had none of the old careful mental cataloging of his arsenal of luxin\nweapons to decide what best would match this much available light, this\nenemy, this battlefield, this likely enemy tactic. He had no generals to\nconsult, no messengers to hear out or to send out, no scouts’ reports, no\norders to give, nor anyone who would listen to them if he tried.\nAs their galleon, the Golden Mean, shot across the waves, driven by\nboth oar and wind, Gavin had no one to pick out of the enemy line and say,\n‘That one shall be mine first.’\nAll there was to do was wait, powerless.\nGavin’s chest went tight as the rowers’ drums, pounding, pounding.\nThere should have been some kind of towering storm. There wasn’t.\nToday was the kind of day that makes landsmen romanticize the lives of\nsailors. The sun blazing overhead, the sea light and bright and clear and\nshallow. Blinding azure and turquoise and sapphire, Gavin guessed. And\nmany other jewel colors denied him now.\nHe wished he could see them just one last time.\nUnder Captain Gunner’s direction, the ship was circling in toward White\nMist Reef, following the sea demons following the great black whale.\nThe sea demons hunting the whale hadn’t noticed the little ship behind\nthem yet, so it was a race against time to see if Gunner remembered\ncorrectly.\nHe was trying to remember the placement of a gap, Gavin never said\naloud, from two decades ago. Gunner hadn’t been the navigator back then,\nnor the navigator’s boy. He’d been belowdecks, swabbing the cannons clean\nof burning embers that could ignite the next shot while it was being loaded.\nEven if he remembered where the gap had been, there was no guarantee\nthat in all those years the reef hadn’t closed.\nGunner swore that White Mist Reef was a barrier reef with several gaps\nin its great circle. But if they didn’t find one wide enough for the Golden\nMean before one of the sea demons noticed them, they were dead.

There were more like six.\nHard to tell from five hundred paces.\n“Is that the gap?” Gunner shouted up to the lookout in the crow’s nest.\n“No, sir!”\nGunner swore. He had good eyes, but White Mist Reef defied man’s\nvision. The barrier reef itself rose from the sea floor to within a few hands’-\nbreadths of the surface of the water. Stubborn coral had tried to grow\nhigher, and their bleached skeletons were sometimes visible in the troughs\nbetween waves, white tips on the great claws that would tear a ship’s soft\nbelly open.\nDriven by the cold currents blasting through the Everdark Gates into the\nwarmer waters of the Cerulean Sea, the trade routes and currents and storm\nsystems of the Seven Satrapies had always traveled clockwise around the\ncoasts of the Seven Satrapies like a great wheel—or perhaps, having been\ncreated later than the currents, clocks moved storm-wise. So if the entire sea\nwere an irregular wheel, here was the axle.\nGunner’s teeth were bared. He shouted every command, even to those\nclose by. A chase at sea is a slow chase, and their boat, fast as it was, was no\nmatch for the sea demons and the whale. They only kept them in sight\nbecause the massive creatures were fighting.\nThere wasn’t much for Gunner to do. If he fired his guns now, he’d bring\nthe sea demons’ attention, but if he left the gun crews to steer the ship\nhimself, the sea demons might be upon them before he could return. So he\ndodged from one station to the next, checking and rechecking wicks and\nordering adjustments to the trim and the wheel through hand gestures to his\nfirst mate, and then flying up to the forecastle to check The Compelling\nArgument again and again.\nOrholam had disappeared not long ago, but now he was suddenly at\nGavin’s shoulder, with a powder horn. “Nabbed it from the captain’s\nquarters,” he said. He pulled a musket ball pouch off the strap, though.\n“This, however, you won’t be needing.”\nThat’s right. The baffling musket of the Blinding Knife didn’t need to be\nloaded. It magically made its own shaped shells, turning light into luxin as\nif it were a drafter itself, only requiring a flint piece for the snap-cock jaws\nand black powder for every shot.\nGunner had blown an apple out of Gavin’s mouth at forty paces with this\nrifled-barrel musket.\n“What about you?” Gavin asked. “What are you doing?”\nFor some reason, Orholam was stripping off his tunic, but he had no\nrations or water. “Terrible swimmer,” Orholam explained.\n“Thought you said you were going to die. Are you trying to defy your\nown prophecy?”\n“I told you the most likely thing. I’m just trying to do my part to make\nthe less likely thing happen. But it ain’t really on me.”"

But it ain’t really on me.”\n“No, I imagine the sea demons have something to say about it.”\n“Them, neither,” Orholam said. “My fate’s up to you. And my own poor\nswimming. You’ll have a chance to save me. But you won’t. I don’t blame\nyou. You’re just not that man. Still, I don’t want to die, so you can’t blame\nme for trying.”\nGavin had no idea what to say to that.\n“You know who they are, don’t you?” Orholam asked, as if they hadn’t\nbeen discussing his death.\n“‘They’?”\n“The sea demons. They’re you. Or what you would be if you only knew\nhow.”\n“They’re me? Well, fuck me, then.” He began checking the action of the\nmusket. Twist here and pull? “Can you tell me how to kill them, or not?”\n“You know, I thought your problem was a lack of honesty. But your lack\nof compassion is worse.”\n“Compassion? For monsters?”\n“They suffer, Dazen. For their broken oaths and cowardice, they have\nreaped unending centuries of isolation and madness and pain.”\n“Glad to see you’re back to being cryptic. Kind of missed it,” Gavin said\nwith a little shake of his head. “But what the hell are you on about?”\nKarris, I’m spending my last day with fools and madmen and traitors,\nand I’m afraid I fit right in.\nOrholam said, “They’re what happens when immensely talented and\nimmoral drafters find an animal that’s trusting and easy to soul-cast.”\n“They’re what? What?”\n“The sea giants were gentle creatures, so deeply attuned to luxin that\ntheir very bones react to it, intelligent, and nearly immortal. And they’re\nnow extinct, thanks to your predecessors. What’s a Prism to do to escape his\nown Blackguards and his mortality itself?”\n“Throw himself into a whale? Come on.” Through curiosity or\ndesperation or madness, drafters had will-cast almost every kind of animal\n—but soul-casting was another level entirely.\n“No, no. Whales are far too willful, and too smart to trust men.”\n“Nobody’s ever successfully soul-cast themselves,” Gavin said\ndismissively.\n“Depends what you mean by ‘success.’”\nThinking you could do magic better than anyone else had ever done it\nbefore? That attitude wasn’t exactly uncommon among drafters; it must be\nnearly ubiquitous among Prisms.\nGood thing I’m not like that.\n“This can’t be true,” Gavin said. “Of all people, I would know if it\nwere.”\n“You? You don’t even know how a Prism is made!”\n“Made? You mean ‘chosen.’”\n“Time’s up,” Orholam said, his eyes perhaps sensing some change in the\nsea demons that Gavin’s did not. “It was a pleasure to pull the same oar for\na time, Man of Guile.”\nThe old prophet stepped over and spoke to Gunner in hushed tones.\nGunner nodded. “Guile! You sees in lightsies and darksies, yes?”\nBlack and white? “Yes, Captain,” Gavin said."

Maybe you kin see what others cain’t.”\nSo Gavin slung the gun-sword over his back and began climbing the\nrigging. He’d regained enough strength for this, anyway.\nBut he wasn’t even all the way up to the crow’s nest when he saw\nsomething alarming.\n“The whale!” he cried. “The whale’s turned. It’s headed straight this\nway!”\nGavin hauled himself into the crow’s nest and flopped in awkwardly.\n“Ten points a-port!” Gavin shouted. “Twelve hundred paces out!” He\nwas pretty good at distances, but it was a guess.\nAlmost as soon as he’d called it, Gunner cut to starboard. It was nice\nthat a whale had been distracting the sea demons. But in the old tales,\nwhales themselves had been the death of many a crew.\nOn the sea, no stranger is your friend.\nAnd then Gavin saw it. “Gap!” he shouted. “Four hundred paces!”\nBut it was as if the sea demons themselves could hear his puny cry.\n“They’re turning!” Gavin shouted. “A thousand paces out now!”\nBelow him, Gunner was standing on the barrel of The Compelling\nArgument again, looking forward, though this time he had the fore skysail\nstay in his hand to keep his balance. He hopped down, and his hands\nbecame a blur on the whirling gears and pulleys. But Gavin could see that\nthe great cannon was aimed wide of any of the sea demons.\n“Captain—” he began.\nBut the roar of The Compelling Argument obliterated all else. The\nconcussion made its own ring on the waves below it, and the sound and\npressure knocked even Gavin backward, luckily into the crow’s nest.\nHe pulled himself to a seated position in time to see a great explosive\nshell hit the water hundreds of paces to port from the sea demons. Water\ngeysered around the impact.\nMost impressive. Gavin would have applauded the sheer power of the\nthing if there weren’t seven monstrous leviathans bearing down on them at\nthis very—\nFour. Four leviathans bearing down on them. What?\n“Three of ’em peeled off, Captain!” Gavin shouted. “Headed for where\nthe shell hit!”\nThat was it. Sea demons felt vibrations in the water. A distant cannon\nblast above the water was certainly felt, but an explosion in the water must\nhave doubled or trebled its volume to those creatures.\n“They’re steaming hot!” Gavin shouted. “Four hundred paces. Our gap’s\nin a hundred!”\n“Whale ta port!” someone shouted below.\nAnd so it was.\nLike some kind of damned sheepdog loping easily alongside them, the\nwhale was boxing them in, holding them tight to the reef. The open sea out\nbeyond it was no option now.\n“Cap’n!” the mate Pansy shouted. “We gotta swing wide!”\n“No!” Gunner shouted, not even looking up as he cranked The\nCompelling Argument low to port."

Gunner was gonna shoot the whale. Why was he going\nto shoot the whale?\nAs the big gun finished coming around, Gunner hopped up on its barrel.\n“You’re right!” he shouted to the whale as if they’d been conversing.\n“Fine! Damned if you ain’t right!”\nSwinging the boat wide was the only way they could make the right-\nangle turn to shoot the narrow gap in the reef. But the great black beast\nwasn’t allowing that.\nGunner shouted, “Eight points port, on my mark, then full starboard on\nmy mark. Got it, mate?!”\n“Aye, Cap’n! Eight points port on mark, then full starboard on mark.”\nBut Gunner had already disappeared below, bellowing orders to his gun\ncrews.\nGavin threw a curse at the whale. This great, stupid fish might as well\nhave been Andross Guile, hemming them in, denying them any real choice,\nmaking it look to any observer like they’d willfully rammed their own ship\ninto the reef.\n“Gap in seventy paces, Captain!” Gavin shouted. “Two sea demons at\ntwo hundred! Coming full speed in!”\nThe damned whale had disappeared.\nThanks, buddy. Stayed just long enough to get us killed, didn’t ya?\nBut the water here wasn’t deep enough for it to dive out of sight, and\nGavin found it again quickly, veering out toward open sea.\nEven as he threw one last mental curse to it, it veered back, straight\ntoward the gap in the reef itself.\nNo, not at the gap, but on an intercepting course with the two remaining\nsea demons, who were flying like twin arrows at the Golden Mean—the\ninterception point just happened to be right at the mouth of the gap.\nThe gap in the coral between the open sea and the protected lagoon\ninside was wide enough for the ship to pass through in ordinary\ncircumstances: approached dead-on, with sails stowed, maneuvering by oar\nand with polemen on the decks. Normally, even in this light midafternoon\nchop, with care it would be perilous but possible.\nBut cutting a right-angle turn, under full sail and full speed? A single\nwave, a single untimely gust of wind could blow them into the teeth of the\ncoral on either side.\nThere was nothing else for Gavin to say. Gunner could see it all for\nhimself now. He was standing again on the barrel of his big cannon,\ndancing from one bare foot to the other because of the barrel’s heat. But\nthere was nothing comical in the utter concentration on his face, looking at\nthat gap, and the oncoming sea demons, and the whale streaking in from the\nside. He’d readied the orders.\nNow it was just a matter of timing, and Gunner was the best in the world\nat that.\n“First mate… mark!”\n“Mark!” she shouted, her hands spinning the wheel and then stopping it\nprecisely."

The whale was maybe going to reach the sea\ndemons just before they reached the ship, but where would the collision\ntake them? Would the whale intercept both of the sea demons, or only one?\nWhat waves would crash into the boat?\nOut only another hundred paces, the other sea demons had doubled\nback. Even if the whale took out both of the first two of them, if Gunner\ndidn’t get the ship through the gap in the first attempt, those others were\ngoing to demolish them.\nSailors on deck were praying, muttering, waiting with their hands on\nlines for their orders. Orholam had now stripped off all his clothes as if\npreparing for a swim. He saluted Gavin with a flagon of brandy and drank a\ndeep draught. Crazy old bastard.\nOn the sterncastle, the first mate’s forehead glistened with sweat, stance\nwide, knuckles tight on the wheel. She had all the look of a grizzled veteran\nwho was terrified despite being a grizzled veteran.\nGavin looked up. The gap yawned before them, but there was no way\nthey could make the turn.\n“Reef the main now!” Gunner shouted. “First mate, now! Starboard\noars, stop! Port oars, double-time, now, now! Second mate, on my—mark!\nMark! Now!”\nIn quick succession, the first mate spun the wheel hard in toward the\nreef; the mainsail went half; and the starboard oars stopped, dragging water,\ncreating a pivot point while the port oars kept pulling. A rattling chain drew\nGavin’s eyes to the rear.\nThe second mate had dropped the starboard anchor.\nIn the shallow water, it hit bottom and caught immediately. It was as if\nthe ship had hit a wall, first jerking almost to a stop, timbers groaning,\nseams straining, men thrown from their feet, but then with too much\nforward momentum to stop, it slewed hard to starboard.\nAs the deck rolled, spraying a fan of water out, the crow’s nest\nwhipsawed back and forth. Gavin crashed into the railing, his feet actually\nrising off the wood for one terrifying moment before the motion ceased and\nthen started the other way, with Gavin dropping into the nest and then\ncrouching down as low as he could, bracing the railing against his shoulder\nto keep from being thrown overboard.\n“Anchor free! Anchor free!” Gunner was shouting. “All oars full! First\nmate!”\n“Yessir!” she shouted, already making corrections.\nSome mechanism snapped loudly under the forces on the anchor—but\nthe chain spun away and the deck surged up and forward.\n“Sails full!” Gunner shouted, though they weren’t ten paces from the\nreef—and they weren’t aligned with the gap.\nUnbelievably, they’d actually cut the corner too tightly.\nThey were going to hit the reef. But then Gavin saw that the boat was\nstill drifting sideways, its momentum in the waves carrying it toward\nalignment with the gap."

It would tear off the prow easily. Even if it didn’t,\nthe crash would stop them dead in the waves as the sea demons arrived.\n“Starboard guns…” Gunner shouted. “Now!”\nThe starboard guns all fired simultaneously, the hull shivering from the\ncombined shock of the blasts, nudging the ship half a pace farther to port.\nThe sails filled with a snap as the ship rolled back on an even keel.\nGunner was shouting to oarsmen, trying to get the starboard oars to lift\nfrom the water before they snapped off, trying to get them to push off of the\nreef as if they were polemen. He was demanding the port oars start pulling,\nbut slowly so as not to drive them starboard. He had to repeat an order to\nthe first mate, because he was already shouting his next at a gun crew and\ncranking The Compelling Argument himself.\nOrholam’s beard, they were going to make it!\nThen Gavin’s eyes rose to the sea to starboard—which had been behind\nthem before they’d turned. Like a war-blind green recruit distracted by what\nwas happening in front of and to each side of the ship, he’d not looked\nbehind the ship in several minutes.\n“Pull!” Gunner was shouting. “Damn your eyes, pull!”\nJust behind the ship, the twin streaking lines of boiling waters of the sea\ndemons and the black behemoth collided. Hot water sprayed over the decks\nas the huge beasts breached, and then as they crashed back into the sea,\nlanding partially on the black whale, driving its great head into the coral,\nbut then the sight of them was lost.

But to Gavin’s eyes it wasn’t red, but burning\nwhite-hot, steam boiling from it.\nThe convulsing, gulping mouth of this greatest of the sea demons was\nthe long-pursuing mouth of hell itself.\nAt the last moment it closed its great cruciform jaw to bring its head like\na bony war hammer up and against the stern on the starboard side.\nThe collision lifted and crumpled the ship against the reef. Gavin saw\nthe coral punch in the portside hull, tearing forecastle from deck as wanton\nboys fighting over an old book might tear off a cover.\nThe flexing mast, first bent from the shock of the collision with the sea\ndemon and then loosed with the shock of the collision with the reef,\ncatapulted Gavin skyward. His three-fingered hand hadn’t a prayer of\nholding him. He twisted out into the air hopelessly, as sea and sky spun fast\nbeneath him.\nAnd then darkness opened its maw and swallowed him.\nChapter 25\nTeia was being paranoid. She was sure of it.\nPretty sure.\nThe best thing about the near-total invisibility that the shimmercloak\ngranted her wasn’t the invisibility, not today. It was the ‘near-total’ part.\nTotal invisibility might allow her to relax. Instead, using the cloak here took\neverything Teia had: constant drafting to maintain the paryl cloud necessary\nto defeat any errant sub-red who would otherwise see a warm ghost passing\nby, will to activate the cloak, skill to follow how the cloak split the light\nhitting it at each moment, bending it around her form. Most Shadows—the\nOrder’s shimmercloak-using assassins—wouldn’t do that. Couldn’t, maybe.\nTeia had to keep moving, and that meant she had to pay attention to any\nplaces where sources of paryl light weren’t available. Those were rare, but\ngiven that being stuck with no paryl meant discovery, and discovery meant\ndeath, it was still important to look out for. Using the cloak while dodging\nall the churning humanity that shot through the Lily’s Stem and into the\nturning flower that was the Chromeria itself took all her vigilance, all her\ndexterity, all her athleticism at moments that couldn’t be predicted. That\nwas the gift: not thinking.\nIn this past year, she’d adjusted to the quick glances necessary to keep\nher eyes unseen, to the dodging and darting while keeping the cloak tight\nabout her form so her feet wouldn’t show. She knew when to be visible and\nwhen to disappear, when to gather luxin and pack it so that she’d never be\nwithout if she had to dodge indoors or to some dark area where paryl was\nscarce.\nBut there was something in one’s mind that refused to believe one was\ntruly unseen. It was too unnatural. When eyes crossed one’s face, something\nin the mind fiercely held that one had been ignored but wasn’t actually\ninvisible.\nThus, the paranoia that popped up at irregular intervals—a sticky, oily\nfeeling, like a predator’s eyes were on you in your bath.\nAnd right now the feeling was strong.\nThe entrance to the luxin bridge called the Lily’s Stem was a natural\nchoke point. Here half a dozen of Andross Guile’s Lightguards stood watch."

Here half a dozen of Andross Guile’s Lightguards stood watch.\nThey were thugs one and all, armed with muskets and blunderbusses\nsmarter than most of them. Less conspicuously, four Blackguards would be\nsomewhere farther back. Teia took her time finding them, hanging to the\nedges of the crowd so she wouldn’t be bowled over while she searched.\nBeing terrifically short was terrific when you wanted to disappear in a\ncrowd, and horrific when you wanted to find anyone else.\nShe found them all, and knew them all. Not one was a sub-red or\nsuperviolet.\nSo she should relax a little.\nBut she couldn’t. She kept flaring her eyes to paryl, kept circling, kept\nsearching, searching, gnawing on that feeling like she was one of those tiny\ndogs trained to run in a wheel that turned a spit for cooking, and she’d been\nthrown an ox bone and couldn’t crack it open with her weak little jaws.\nShe couldn’t draft paryl or keep the cloak working forever, though.\nFine, I’m afraid. Since when has that stopped me?\nShe moved, slipping into the stream of humanity passing gushing into\nand then out of the Lily’s Stem. The waves battered the covered luxin\nbridge as effectually as her fears. She moved fast, as fast as she could,\nriding right at the edge of foolhardiness. If her worst nightmare was true,\nand she was being pursued by some other Shadow, sent to murder her for\nher disobedience and to reclaim their Fox Cloak, they’d have a hard time\nmatching this pace. Teia was damn good at this now.\nComing upon the exit of the bridge, she slipped into the back of a\nnarrow wagon transporting empty tun and hogshead barrels from the\nChromeria’s larders. She wedged herself into a narrow spot where she could\nonly see the sun, and thus not be seen herself, and let her invisibility go.\nWithout the paryl in her, it seemed the rational blue light from the luxin\ntunnel did much less to ease her. She felt shaken, jittery, a runner wobbly\nlong before the last lap.\nShe had leagues to go yet before she was safe.\nShe pulled herself together, removed and rolled up the master cloak, and\nput on the Fox Cloak; loosed her belt, letting out the extra folds of her tunic\nto make a simple dress, colorful banding already stitched to it; pulled up her\ntrouser legs and bound them at each knee; flipped her belt over to the\nopposite side, red for black; and rolled her sleeves up and her tall boots\ndown. She donned a large necklace and bound her hair tight and pulled on a\nwig of wavy brunette.\nFear is a tortoise; its jaws will snap you clean in half if you let it—but\nit’ll only catch you if you don’t move, Teia’d learned.\nTeia moved too fast for fear to follow.\nRight now, she was just a lazy serving girl hitching a quick ride so she\ndidn’t have to walk. A little innocent mischief. She emerged from the\nbarrels and slipped from the back of a wagon as it passed through a knot of\npeople near an intersection."

She emerged from the\nbarrels and slipped from the back of a wagon as it passed through a knot of\npeople near an intersection.\nIn moments, she was better than invisible. She was anonymous.\nUnremarkable. Unseen.\nThe bright, rich districts—where the Chromeria’s every be-serifed whim\nwas captured by bespectacled scribes in official green ink and stamped with\na reeve’s seal and enforced by women armed with abacuses and bad\nattitudes and wearing ridiculous plumed hats—soon yielded to\nneighborhoods ruled by attitudes as foul and condescension as thick, but\nwielding tools sharper than a quill that writ decrees in a redder ink.\nBut Teia couldn’t tell the difference between green and red anyway, and\nhere her heart quieted some of its panicked thunder as of a summer squall\npassing into the distance.\nShe didn’t let down her guard, of course. It was still a dangerous\nneighborhood, and the slight but perilous possibility of having picked up a\ntail was still present.\nHer goal now was a series of blind alleys she’d discovered in a slightly\nnicer neighborhood nearby. The alleys led to… well, to nothing. Situated\nhere on the dark side of Weasel Rock, the neighborhood wasn’t the kind to\nattract passersby, but not quite a slum, either. The locals would avoid a dead\nend, but they also wouldn’t allow any gangs to take up residence.\nTeia could hide and wait for an hour or two for any pursuit. If none\ncame, there was a spot where she could climb out of the alley to a rooftop in\ncase her highly hypothetical pursuer followed this far, actually knew that\nthis alley was a dead end, and tried to wait her out.\nYou poor bastards, she thought. You have no idea how good I’ve gotten.\nNo one’s chasing you. They don’t know there’s anyone to chase. The\nOrder doesn’t even know you’re here, T.\nFrom little contextual clues, Teia’d guessed out that Murder Sharp was\nthe best of the Order’s Shadows. And further, that he was gone, which could\nmean he’d be gone for months yet. That meant any Shadow who might\npossibly come after her was second-rate. She was just being paranoid.\nIt was easy to impute legendary status to these people, but Teia had seen\na little glimpse behind the façade. Anyone can kill if you give them\ninvisibility. And the Order had to take those who were (1) murderous, (2)\nloyal, (3) able to split light, and (4) able to draft paryl.\nThat couldn’t leave that many candidates.\nMartial prowess, intelligence, flexibility? None of those could even\nmake the list of requirements.\nBeing a bit scared made her careful, and that was good when the stakes\nwere so high, but she couldn’t make them out be to gods or something.\nShe’d take up a position around the third sharp corner, she thought. Just\nin case she was a bit slow to take down her opponent and there was a fight.\nA brief fight. That she would win.\nStepping around the corner, she saw the briefest hint of distortion like a\nfloater in her eye, so close she couldn’t focus on it—and she ran nose-first"

She reeled back, but instead of trying to\nkeep her feet, she flopped to the side, her body reacting faster than her\nmind.\nSomeone! Not something! her mind shrilled. Paryl! Move or die!\nRolling, desperate, eyes streaming at the blow to her nose, Teia jumped\nto her feet, her hand stabbing down into the gun pouch at her hip, slipping\nover the smooth ball handle of the pistol.\nAnd then someone unseen cuffed her upside the head, like she was a\nchild, not an assassin. An arm circled around her chest and another around\nher neck, and as he tightened that arm on the sides of her neck—a\ndangerous move no Blackguard would use, because though it was meant\nnot to, it could kill—she heard a voice, his voice.\n“All my work, and you throw it away at the first tough job. You’re such\na disappointment, Adrasteia,” Murder Sharp said.\nThe blackness was rising even faster than her terror, but Teia clawed at\nthe pistol in its pouch. His foot was right next to her own, and there would\nbe no time for aiming carefully before she lost consciousness.\nHer straining fingertips brushed the polished-smooth pistol butt, and\nfingernails tore as she scrambled to lift the heavy, slick weapon up to her\npalm. But she did it. She did it faster than cowardice and a heartbeat before\nunconsciousness could claim the laurel crown. With a hot lead prayer, she\npulled the trigger.\nNothing happened. Like a runner tripping within steps of the finish line,\nshe wondered what might have betrayed her—a faulty flint? a broken\ncockjaw?\nBlackness triumphing, her hands began pulling at his forearm like she\nwas some moron who’d never trained against such things. Her knees\nsagged. It was too late to do all the right things. She was too weak for the\nchin turn, too…\nHer last thought swam through the gathering wet darkness like some\nunseen loathsome sea creature sliding against her bare toes on a midnight\nswim: There’d been no mechanical failure. Teia had failed.\nShe hadn’t cocked the pistol.\nThere was no way to try again. She was out of time and strength. There\nwere no second chances here.\nShe slumped into the wages of that mortal sin: losing.\nChapter 26\nGavin knifed into the waves—tumbled, spun deeper. Black spots swam in\nhis vision. He stabbed his hands forward and racked water back, back. It\nwas several long strokes before he realized he was pulling himself deeper,\nlike a disoriented eagle trying to swim, as if its pinions could beat the waves\nrather than the air.\nHe turned toward the greater light, and pulled for the sky.\nHis progress slowed. His chest convulsed. Vision darkened.\nAnd then his hand pulled weakly on the air, and he bobbed to the\nsurface. He gasped in a great breath, caught some wave with the air he\ninhaled, and coughed. He floundered, slapping at the water, gulping in air,\ntrying to see."

First he saw the remains of the ship, torn to pieces, part of the\nforecastle still perched on the reef it had been dropped on, the rest shearing\naway into a flotsam of broken wood and broken men and women.\nFlung from the highest height, Gavin was the closest in toward land, but\nhe saw others, their heads dotting the waves, yet alive. Some screamed with\nfear or injury, some clung to bits of crates or decking. Others danced to the\nsea’s cruel, silent song, bobbing without a word, drowning: for the\ndrowning haven’t the breath to spare for screams.\nCeres hated anyone to interrupt her dancers, so in his terror, a drowning\nman would often force his rescuer under the waves himself, and Ceres\nwould claim two victims rather than one. Fully half of the distance back to\nthe ship from where he was now, Gavin saw Orholam, wet hair streaming\nover his face, hands plunging down and down, frenetic—dancing to that\ntune.\nIt took a strong and healthy swimmer to dare pull a man away from\nCeres’s fatal song. Gavin felt neither. He looked at the shore calling him.\nThen he saw the fins cutting through the water.\nThen he felt the stinging on his back. He was still wearing the gun-\nsword, and in the fall, it had cut him. He was bleeding into the water; he\nhad no idea how badly.\nBut he knew how blood called sharks.\nOrholam bobbed up, up, up arrhythmically. He’d known he was going to\ndie. Had accepted it as far as he could. Come to peace with it. You’re not\nthat man, Gavin Guile.\nGavin kicked off toward the old man.\nHe cursed himself with every stroke. What the hell am I doing? I don’t\neven want to save him! I need to get my ass on that island so I can save\nKarris! I am more important than this old shit-brained—\nA sailor clinging to a broken spar nearby screamed and kicked at the\nwaves. Something slashed through the waters, and he screamed louder,\nlifting a bloody stump of a knee from the waves. He scrambled to climb\nfully onto his bit of spar, overbalanced, and fell into the water.\nBut Gavin was close now. He was committed. And—\nOf course the old prophet went down before Gavin reached him.\nGavin dove and snatched at the disappearing form under the waves,\ncaught something, and hauled him up by his beard.\nThe old man spit water into the air as they broke the surface. Alive.\nDamn!\nBut if it had been bad luck to reach the old man as he was on the verge\nof losing consciousness, now it was good—he didn’t fight as Gavin pulled\nhim into a weak grip with his left hand and kicked for shore.\nBy the time they made it to the shallows, all the screams had stopped,\nthough in two places the sharks still churned the waves white in their\nfrenzy.\nGavin stood, though his legs were wobbly and even the gentle sloshing"

Come\non,” he told Orholam.\nBehind them, still halfway out to the wreckage, Gavin saw a swimmer\ncoming in, cutting strong and fast past dead bodies floating in the waves\nand heedless of the sharks.\nOrholam stood, wheezing and spitting, and Gavin began hauling him\ntoward the shore.\nThe figure resolved into the form of Pansy, the first mate, her hair still\nstuck in those iron-hard glued points. She was such a fast swimmer, Gavin\ncould only wonder where must she have fallen to have not made it to shore\nbefore them.\nThey made it to water that only came up to their thighs, and Orholam\nsaid, “Please, please, let me rest.” He leaned over, but Gavin pulled him on.\nComing up behind them, Pansy stood at last. She cleared the water from\nher eyes and heaved great, deep breaths. She leaned over, hands braced on\nher thighs, face barely clear of the waves.\nIn between breaths she said, “I don’t… I don’t think I want to be a sailor\nanymore.”\n“Let me rest!” Orholam said, slapping at Gavin’s hand.\n“I mean, not that I have any choice in the matter,” she said, turning to\ngaze at the wreckage. “Seeing how a trip home is pretty much—”\nShe cut off abruptly, and Gavin heard a sharp intake of breath.\nHe saw the shadow streaking through the shallow water a moment after\nshe did. Pansy spun and tried to leap forward through the waves, half\njumping out of the waves and half swimming, clawing at the water, but the\nshark hit her hard and she crashed sideways through the water.\nThis time, Gavin didn’t even think to save anyone else. He plunged\ntoward the shore, wild with fear, lifting his feet free of the treacherous\nwaters with strength he didn’t even know he had.\nAnd then he collapsed onto the dry sand.\nFrom his hands and knees, he saw a dark stain spreading in the water,\nthen a glimpse of torn flesh as another shark appeared and ripped at what\nhad been Pansy only moments ago.\nMoments later, Orholam trudged up next to him and dropped heavily\nonto the sand.\nTurning from the sight of the sharks at their feast, Gavin crawled to\nshade, curled into a ball, and closed his eyes.\nChapter 27\n“Karris Shadowblinder.”\nNothing. Maybe it had been written the other way.\n“Karris Atiriel,” Kip whispered, watching the cookfires flicker in the\ndarkness far below. “Anselm Malleus. Eva Ultafa.”\nWith only Big Leo as bodyguard, Kip had climbed to the top of\nGreenwall. There, atop the massive living wall, on a magically grown\nwalkway of well-nigh immortal branches and foliage that was evergreen, he\nsurveyed those who had become his people, both inside the city of Dúnbheo\nand in a crescent on the shore of Loch Lána around it."

One should weigh carefully whether the work you did\nby that light benefited the community more than the beauty you stole from\nthem to do it.\nWith the urgent preparations to march, tonight there were more lights\nvisible than usual, but with a cloudless sky, the scarce few lanterns of the\ncity still barely dimmed the glory of the stars.\n“Gaspar Estratega. Helane Troas. Viv Grayskin,” Kip murmured. The\nstars, those æthereal fires above, called to the terrestrial fires below, like to\nlike, and mirrored the thaumaturgical lights of Kip’s war map. The vast\nbeyond comprehension and the small beneath notice existed at once, in one\ncity, one room, one mind.\n“Zee Oakenshield. Telemachos the Bold.”\nAll this, all the people below, would move at Kip’s word. Though\nwithout mastery of all he should have mastered to deserve such obedience,\nhe was their master. Where he said to go, they would go. They would live\nand fight and die by his will—and despite his desire, for there was no path\nKip could see by which none would die, no matter what he did.\nAt most, he might make there be fewer deaths. At best, he might make\nthe deaths purposeful. At the end, he might make their deaths buy victory\nand peace and some meager measure of justice, some semblance of\nstability, for a time.\nThree years ago, Kip wouldn’t have believed anyone would ever follow\nhim. A year ago, he wouldn’t have believed so many would. Now he only\nprayed that he would lead them well enough.\nHell, three years ago Kip never would have believed any woman would\never want him, much less one remotely like Tisis.\nSo why was he here, walking in the cold, trying to solve a gift as if it\nwere a problem?\n“Garibaldi Phlegethon. Euterpe Tamazight. The Chartopaíchtis.”\nWas that it? Had it seemed too easy to become satrap? Like a gift rather\nthan an adroitly seized reward?\nIn hardly more than a day they’d have the big signing ceremony, and the\narmy would march. People standing around while he signed a bit of paper?\nKip hated that sort of thing. He’d insisted it be a small ceremony.\nTisis had suggested perhaps a large ceremony would be preferable,\ngiven that becoming a satrap was kind of a big deal, and many witnesses\nwould be better than few.\nBut knowing that he had to assert his independence and indomitable will\nor lose the respect of his men, Kip had defiantly insisted on a large\nceremony.\nThat showed her who wore the claws around here."

Kip, the louse-up from Rekton?\nKip, who’d started this whole cataclysm by killing King Rask Garadul and\nallowing the White King to take power unopposed?\nPeople believed in Kip.\nBut maybe they believed because they had to. He’d fooled them, and\nthey clung desperately to him as the drowning do, ’cumbering his arms and\nlegs, pulling him down.\nWhat had his father Gavin said?\n‘Kip, you’re not the Lightbringer, because there is no Lightbringer.

He was going to\nfall, and he was going to take all these people he loved with him.\n“I believe,” Big Leo said suddenly. His voice was a low rumble in the\nhalf-light.\n“What?” Kip asked, turning to the big man, as if the words hadn’t cut his\ndarkness in twain.\nBut Big Leo didn’t meet his eye, instead searching the darkness for\nnonexistent threats. His voice rumbled lower. “Nothin’ else to say.”\nKip studied the darkness, but saw nothing.

Big Leo gave him time. “That person would\njust be invisible.”\nBig Leo sighed. “And who do we know—”\n“Oh! Oh, so someone like Teia. Not invisible all the time, necessarily.\nSomeone who can use a shimmercloak. Hmm.”\nIt occurred to him then that he couldn’t use a shimmercloak.\n“Yeah, that would be too bad if that were true, huh?” Big Leo said.\n“Since you can’t use a shimmercloak.”\n“You’re doing wonders for my confidence, big guy.”\n“Don’t worry about it.”\nKip, of course, was suddenly very worried.\nBig Leo said, “Lightsplitting is supposedly one of the gifts bestowed by\nOrholam during the installment of a Prism. So those who think you’re the\nLightbringer, and who also believe that interpretation, simply think you’ll\nbe installed as Prism sooner or later. Not really a big leap to think the\nLightbringer would also be a Prism, eh? But usually—and maybe this is just\nbecause these scholars didn’t know about shimmercloaks—usually the\nphrase is taken as a, uh, what do you call it, idiom. A man unmirrored could\nbe a man unequaled. There’s no one out there exactly like him, right?”"

It’s pretty good—”\n“No, it’s not. It’s a stupid descriptor. It’s redundant. He’s the\nLightbringer. Of course he’s unequaled. You don’t need to say he’s the most\none-of-a-kind unique Lightbringer out there. In a set of one, he’s the most\none of the whole set? That makes no sense. There’s just one.”\n“Prophecies can’t have filler?” Kip asked.\n“That’s… actually a good question.” Big Leo looked troubled. He\nstarted to turn away.\n“No, wait. What were you going to say before?”\nBig Leo stopped and seemed to chew his next words. “How I took it was\nthat it could mean he’s unequaled, or it could mean he’s honest, because\nevery reflection imparts loss and distortion from the original, or it could\nmean he’s different. He’s true… in that he is his own self. Every mirror\npresents a flattened, pale copy, an image of a real thing. So maybe the\nLightbringer is simply not like other people. In every set, he’s the odd one,\nthe exception. You know, like maybe he’s the noble who’s not a noble, the\nbastard who’s not a bastard, the Tyrean who doesn’t quite fit with the\nTyreans, the Blackguard who doesn’t quite fit the Blackguards, the\nunschooled kid who somehow got educated, the poor kid who got rich, the\nrich kid who doesn’t act rich, the full-spectrum polychrome who’s sort of\nChromeria-trained and sort of not trained at all, the guy who’s entitled to\nthe highest horse but barely knows how to ride, yet always somehow gets\nwhere he needs to go, and fast.”\nI’d like to think ‘barely knows how to ride’ has been mostly remedied in\nthis past year, Kip thought. But he didn’t say it.\nHis tongue still escaped his control with some regularity, but not as often\nas it used to.\n“And?” Kip asked. Big Leo obviously wanted to know that he had Kip’s\nfull attention.\n“Brother, we need the Lightbringer. Desperately. This army, this satrapy,\nall the satrapies, the Chromeria, your friends. We all need you to be the\nLightbringer, and those of us who stand with you here? We’re betting our\nlives that you are. And that’s why you’re pissing me off.”\n“Huh?”\n“You think you were powerful against Daragh the Coward or against\nAmbassador Red Leaf or with the Divines? You were stronger by far when\nyou saw the Keeper and took pity on her, or when you saw Conn Arthur and\nshowed him even greater pity by showing him none.”\n“Sure pissed off Cruxer,” Kip said. The commander had said, ‘You can\nforgive a man who breaks under a charge once out of weakness, but a man\nwho lies to you day after day after day? He’s not only a coward, he’s\ndisloyal. You’re making a huge mistake.’"

I’m trying to lecture you.”\n“Please, proceed,” Kip said, grinning.\nBig Leo held his gaze until Kip’s grin collapsed, then said, “Andross and\nGavin couldn’t have done what you did—because they’re men invested in\ntheir own greatness. It makes them small next to you. Breaker, you didn’t\nget this far by being like anyone else. So.

Who else am I supposed to emulate if not the\nbest and smartest people I know? And last and least true: I’m not trying to\nbe them!\nBut instead of giving breath to any of it, he nodded, taking receipt of the\nwords, a silent promise to think on them.\nBut Big Leo kept staring at him.\nBig Leo kept staring at him.\nIt got awkward.\n“Big Leo, do you want to know what I like about you?”\nThe big man pondered, eyes still locked on Kip.\nThen, just as Kip was about to tell him, Big Leo said, “No.”\nHe walked away.\nEventually, Kip turned back to his stars and his fire and his map, but\nnone of them cast the light he needed.\nHe went to his room, but he didn’t wake Tisis. He knew he should wake\nher, to talk, if not to make love. He should share the yoke that had settled\nheavy on his heart. But there weren’t even two hours until he must wake.\nHe let her lie and told himself it was love.\nIn the place of rest, instead he dreamed.\nHe dreamed of Andross Guile.\nChapter 28\n~The Guile~\n40 years ago. (Age 26.)\n“I hope my art isn’t boring you?”\nHaving only recently taken over as the head of my family and thereby\nmade the lord of a house in crisis, my greatest expenditure in coming this\ndeep into the Atashian highlands is in time. And this buffoon—whom I\nhope to make my father-in-law—is only making things worse. I’ve seen\nrocks worn down to nubs by the lapping of the sea’s waves more quickly\nthan this man moves us through his art collection.\n“No indeed!” I say, and it’s true. The art isn’t boring me.\n“Just a few more pieces before we return. We simply must get back in\ntime to see the fire dancers begin, young ’Andross. It’s a treasured tradition\non these brisk autumn nights!”\nLord Dariush gives ‘Andross’ the old aspirative at the beginning, so it\nsounds almost like ‘Handross.’ When I first arrived, Lord Dariush told me\nhe is a casual student of languages, and he loved that my name hearkens\nback to a rare dialect of Old Parian."

        "text": "sounds almost like ‘Handross.’ When I first arrived, Lord Dariush told me\nhe is a casual student of languages, and he loved that my name hearkens\nback to a rare dialect of Old Parian.\nIn the full week since then, I’ve deduced that by ‘casual’ he means he’s\nfluent in six dead tongues, and has done his own translations of several\nancient masterpieces. He derides his own efforts as derivative, an idle\npastime not worth the parchment he scrawls them on: ‘Still, it keeps me out\nof trouble. Some hunt fowls, I hunt vowels.’ He’d laughed. I’d chuckled\nalong dutifully.\nAn affable man, if inclined to laugh at his own jokes. By all reports, he\nis well loved here.\nHe is the first obscenely wealthy person I’ve met of whom that is true.\n“You do love your traditions here, I’ve noticed. What is this?” The\nDariush family has an art collection of wildly mixed quality, a common\naffliction among the newly rich: astonishing masterpieces cheek-by-jowl\nwith quirky oddities and total garbage likely painted or drawn by family\nmembers.\nThis piece is a very nice facsimile of a Gollaïr. I’ve never liked his work\nmyself. He discovered a technique of imbuing pigments with mildly\nunstable luxin, making them astonishingly bright—and then used the paints\neverywhere in his art with no sense of proportion and only moderate skill.\nA second-rate natural scientist and a second-rate painter, Gollaïr’s real\ngenius had lain in getting others to believe he was a genius. He had amassed\na large entourage, a vast fortune, and a golden reputation.\nThen his pupil, Solarch, had shown what one could actually do with the\ntools Gollaïr had invented.\nNo Solarchs still survive. It emerged years after his death that Gollaïr\nhad dedicated himself to destroying the young artist in every way. Even\nSolarch’s eventual suicide had been suspicious, with some saying that\nperennial bogeyman the Order of the Broken Eye had been hired for the\njob. Before Solarch’s early death, Gollaïr had secretly, through many\ndifferent agents, bought up every last one of the young man’s paintings.\nThen he’d burned them all before the young man’s eyes.\nStill, artists being assholes? What else was new?\nLater painters had built on his discoveries, so Gollaïr was still\nconsidered important, but mostly only to those who cared about the history\nof art, not the art itself.\nLater counterfeiters succeeded in making the luxin pigments stable, and\nactually made better paints than Gollaïr ever had. So, oddly, the counterfeits\nlasted longer and now looked much better than any of the originals did. This\npainting still shone—thus, a counterfeit.\nEven if it weren’t a counterfeit, though, I certainly wouldn’t hang his\ngaudy garbage on my walls.\n“You’ve been staring at this one for quite some time,” Lord Dariush\nsaid. “I’m so glad. It’s one of the real prizes of my collection. What do you\nthink?”\nI really should have divided my time between more paintings if I was\ngoing to let my mind wander. He called it ‘one of his real prizes’?\nUgh."

Please say you know it’s a counterfeit and you\njust like it. Bad taste I can deal with.\n“Oh yes! An original! You know Gollaïr? Not many people do now.”\nShit. I only wish I could say it aloud. I dream of the day when I have so\nmuch power that my sons may say aloud what they actually think.\nI purse my lips. “I’m afraid I don’t like his work at all, actually. My\napologies. So much of art is subjective, though.”\n“Is it?” Lord Dariush asks.\nPlease don’t try to convince me this trash is objectively good. I hurry on.\n“I certainly appreciate its importance, and I’m dazzled that someone could\nmake luxins that still shine, what, two hundred and fifteen years later or\nsomething?” It’s the closest I can hint at questioning if he’s certain it’s not a\nfake. I shouldn’t have done it, but I can’t help myself.\n“Sounds about right,” he says.\nSo he doesn’t know it’s a fake.\nA counterfeit, as the prize of his collection. It makes him look a fool,\nand I’ve come so far and invested so much of my precious time that I don’t\nwant to believe it. I can’t marry into a family of fools.\nI won’t do that to my sons or the rest of my line. A man has a duty.\nBut it just doesn’t fit. Lord Dariush came from nothing and is now one\nof the three wealthiest people in the world. A bad judge of art I can believe,\nbut a fool? Has he just been the largest fish in an inbred backwater up here?\n“You really don’t like it?” he presses.\nI flash an awkward acknowledgment. “Maybe my judgment of the work\nitself is unfairly low because of what they say he did to that young artist—\nwhat was his name?” Maybe. And maybe I’d rather not be trapped talking\nto you out of politeness, old man, and would like to see the woman I had\nintended to make my bride.\n“You really don’t remember the young artist’s name?” he asks, teasing.\nSo he hasn’t forgotten about the Guile memory. So many people do, no\nmatter how they’ve heard it lauded.\nI wince and offer a rueful grin. “Solarch,” I say. “Gollaïr ruined him,\nright? Drove him to suicide?”\n“Or had him murdered,” Lord Dariush says. He waves dismissively.\n“Does that change your judgment of his work? Would you praise mediocre\nart crafted by someone because they are morally good? Or denigrate\ngreatness because its creator was errant?”\n‘Errant’ isn’t the word for a man who sets out to destroy a pupil who\nrightly looks to him for protection and friendship. “These are really deep\ncritical waters,” I protest.\n“Or these are real critically deep waters,” he says.\nNot dumb, to shoot that back so quickly.\nMaybe a fool, but not dumb. Dim people ride a mule to their\nconclusions, bright ones a racehorse—but not always in the right direction."

How did I get backed into having this conversation\nanyway?\n“Growing up, I had a friend whose mother fancied herself a singer. A\nstrangling cat would make more pleasing noises. She was… wretched. But I\nliked her very much. So. If I can like a person but hate their art, I can do the\nopposite as well. Those who can’t do so reveal their own limitations, not\nArt’s. So no, I don’t think Gollaïr’s villainy makes me judge him more\nharshly. I think his art deserves harsh judgment. But I understand he was a\nlocal here, and thus nets a bit more praise on that account. Just as every\nparent thinks their child is especially gifted, though at least half must be\nwrong.”\nLord Dariush weighs me, curious. “Am I in that half?” he asks. It isn’t\nclear whether he’s speaking about the painting or about his daughter. A\nmoment later, I see that the ambiguity was intentional.\nWell, shit. Trying to avoid a ditch, I seem to have fallen into a pit\ninstead.\nBut you know what? To the seventh hell with him. All these games.\nSeven days here, and I’ve only seen Felia from afar, while her widowed\nelder sister, Ninharissi, and her mother and even her little brother have\nvetted me. These cretins and their traditions.\n“How much honesty do you want?” I ask.\n“More,” he says, his eyes fierce.\n“More? Do you think me dishonest, or guarded?” I ask, dragging that\naccusation out like a worm to writhe in the hot glare of Orholam’s Eye.\nVery well, then. I can use the tool that’s fit for the job, even if it’s honesty.\nBut I go on before he has to answer. “Felia is clearly possessed of superior\ngiftings when compared with all the people in the Seven Satrapies, else I’d\nnot have trekked so far. But whether you think she is especially gifted\namong the circle of other eligible young women of our class, that I do not\nknow, nor to what degree you believe so. Certainly, I should hope a father\nwould see what is laudatory in his daughter.”\nAnd I expect it here, where there is a traditional bride price to be\nnegotiated.\nHe doesn’t blink, nor back down from his accusation of me giving him\nhalf truths. “One might do well to remember, then,” he says, “that the\nfeelings that affect our judgments that impact the value we place on what\nwe’re about to lose also affect the price we wish to exact for that loss,\ndepending on our affection or disaffection for our counterpart.”\n“I’m not sure I follow.” Actually, I do. I just don’t like what I’m hearing.\n“If I might inflate the bride price for my beloved daughter because of my\nlove for her—perhaps even while believing my judgment is objective—how\nelse might my other feelings factor into a negotiation?”\nI’m not sure if he’s heading for a subtler point here, because this seems"

No wonder he’s rich.\nI see it now. Frustrate me with delays and promises while he knows I\nneed to be elsewhere, and raise the stakes of my own time investment. The\nlonger I’ve spent here, the harder and harder for me to walk away empty-\nhanded. I’ll be more willing to compromise—without him even having to\nbroach the subject.\nThe manipulation of my emotions is lovely! Wonderful! Brilliant!\nIt’s exactly what I’ve been hoping to add to the Guile line. I might even\nlearn a thing or two from Lord Dariush.\nWell. Unlikely.\nBut now I know the game.

No, you want me to open the door to the henhouse so you don’t\nhave to go to all the work of wriggling under the floorboards is all.\n“It really is sadly terrible, isn’t it?” he asks, pensive, staring at the\npainting.\n“Huh?” I ask.\n“Poor brushwork, uneven tone, what should be complementary colors\never so slightly off.”\nI say nothing, disconcerted. It seems safest.\n“But it’s not a forgery,” Lord Dariush says. “Gollaïr spent years figuring\nout his luxin pigments. He originally intended simply to sell his paints to\nartists, not use them himself. He knew he wasn’t a good painter. But he\nworked up a few demonstration paintings with garish colors, intending them\nonly to show what was possible—and they caused a sensation. People\ncalled him a genius, and he quite liked it. He started acting the artist, hoping\nonly to buy time, but the worse he behaved, the more he was hailed. The\nmore he demanded, the more he was given. He very quickly trapped\nhimself. He was a barely competent drafter with poor color differentiation.\nBut he couldn’t get secret tutoring to become better at either drafting or at\npainting, because he was famous for both.

Not a figure\nstudy—Gollaïr knew he could never match Solarch on that—but a\nlandscape using the boy’s sense of color and much better luxin-work.

But it still has all the same\nfundamental flaws of his other work. It was the best thing he ever did, but\nhe never sold this last painting. He never even showed it. After he finished\nit, he retired to his estate and watched his reputation wither. He never\npicked up a brush again. It’s said—but this part I don’t know for certain—\nthat every day he went to see this painting and his last Solarch. He kept\nthem side by side, a reminder of what was and of what could have been.”\n“That’s a… great story,” I say blandly.\n“You don’t believe me?” he asks, offended.\n“How much honesty did you say you wanted again?” I ask.\nHis eyes harden. “Don’t insult me.”\n“A secret painting, made years later,” I say in the same monotone.\n“Thus, it’s no wonder that it is slightly different in style, and features\nclearly superior drafting than all the others, or that it’s unknown to scholars.\nThus it’s not just a very odd Gollaïr; it’s the best Gollaïr! It’s unique,\nprecious, and has such juicy history attached to it. In truth, Lord Dariush, I\ndon’t know whether you’re telling me a tale, or if someone told you one and\nyou believed them.

It was the only way Ironfist could be safe. It was the\nonly move left open to him.\nBut… marriage? He didn’t…\nNo, surely not.\nOh God. Karris hadn’t exactly sent the assassin who’d killed his sister,\nbut she had allowed it, and Teia wouldn’t have been serving the Order at all\nif Karris hadn’t allowed it. It was a fairly thin line between Karris and that\nparticular blood guilt.\nShe took a deep breath. She should put her feelings aside now. She had\nto make plans. She had to take meetings. A full day awaited her.\nAt least, Karris hoped it did. She felt as if the earth had swallowed her,\nas if all her selfishness and shortsightedness was rearing up to strike her\nwith poison condemnation.\nShe’d never done well alone, and now life had stripped away everyone\nfrom her. The burdens of her office meant that even amid those she loved,\nshe was alone.\nShe took another breath, remembering a lovely day long ago when she’d\ngotten distracted and double-charged a musket in Blackguard drills. It had\nblown apart in another nunk’s hands, though luckily it hadn’t wounded him.\nKarris had gotten dressed down in front of everyone. Then she’d had a\nbruising quarrel with Samite, who hadn’t stood up for her.\nShe’d been hiding in her bunk having a cry when none other than Orea\nPullawr had pulled the covers back.\nKarris had wanted to curl up and die already, but then being found like\nthat, by the White herself?\nOrea had said, ‘Karris, isn’t it? Child, do you know what tears and kisses\nand fine underthings have in common?’\nThe question had baffled her so much she’d stopped crying.\n‘They’re best enjoyed in bed.’\n‘I was trying to—’ Karris began mumbling.

She’d said she’d do anything, and she’d meant\nit.\nIf the terms for peace and an alliance against a mortal threat were so\nsimple, how could she possibly refuse to marry Ironfist?\nThis was how.\nThe note read: “Gavin kidnapped by Order. In grave danger. But alive.\nI’m certain.—Teia”\nSuch short lines bringing such bright news shouldn’t have the power to\ntear a woman’s heart in two.\nBut they did.\nNo proof was offered.

She couldn’t even offer Teia’s word that Gavin\nwas alive without betraying Teia’s mission and jeopardizing her very life.\nEven if Karris made the girl come before Andross Guile and swear it all in\nperson, Andross wouldn’t believe her. Even if he believed her, he wouldn’t\ncare. Andross Guile didn’t know anything about love; he loved only power.\nHe didn’t care about honor; he cared about survival. If the cost to buy\nIronfist’s army was Karris committing bigamy, Andross would say that that\nprice—betraying her office and dishonoring her husband and her old friend"

If Karris tried to tell the truth, she would shame Ironfist, get\nTeia killed, and doom the empire.\nThe Blackguards sometimes repeated an old saying that sounded like\nbluster from those who didn’t live and die by it. It was what they said when\na brother or a sister had to take a battlefield Freeing: Death before dishonor.\nNow, to those who counted on her, one way or another, no matter what\nKarris did, she would bring death and dishonor both.\nShe sat on the bench and felt as if the world had slipped out of joint.\nIronfist had been a dear friend. A man she’d admired and appreciated for\nso long in so many ways that what began as a political marriage could\nbecome more in time… if it weren’t based on deception. If it didn’t shame\nand dishonor them both.\nBut how could she say no to him? Acceptance was so obviously the right\nthing to do on every conceivable level that her rejection would make him\nlose face. It would seem a profound personal rejection. It would shame him,\nand he wasn’t only her former friend. He was a king.\nRejecting him had consequences far beyond her.\nBut how could she not reject him? She was married. To a man she\nloved. To a man she’d waited for without any hope offered, waited and\nwaited… until yesterday. And now she was going to give up on him, again?\nHer own happiness was the last thing she could think of. She was the\nWhite.\nShortly before she’d died, Orea Pullawr had once asked Karris not to\nhate her. Karris still didn’t know what for, but apparently there were hard\ntruths in that mysterious bundle of papers the Order had stolen. But maybe\nthe papers were irrelevant now. She understood what Orea had meant.\nNot so long ago, Karris wouldn’t have believed it was even possible to\ndo the wrong things for the right reasons. Now she knew she would do\nthings for entirely unselfish reasons, knowing she would regret them bitterly\nafterward.\nShe was the White now.\nThe White didn’t wait for a man to come save her.\nThe White was the one who came to save.\nShe didn’t seek her heart’s desire instead of doing her duty; she made it\nher heart’s desire to seek her duty.\nSo. ‘Big-girl pants.’ Thank you, Orea. The burden you left me is heavy,\nbut a White Oak stands strong in the storm.\nKarris had until Sun Day. She could search for Gavin until then. If she\ncould produce him, she wouldn’t have to remarry. Couldn’t. If she found\nhim, Gavin would forgive Ironfist’s betrayal, and Ironfist would trust\nGavin’s word that his absolution would hold. Peace and alliance were still\npossible. The rift could be mended. Wounds healed.\nShe would have to destroy the Order before Sun Day, though. Utterly, if\nshe hoped to live in peace. If they ever hoped to be safe again.\nIf she failed, when Sun Day came, she would do what she must. What\nthe innocent lives she safeguarded demanded of her. She would keep her"

What\nthe innocent lives she safeguarded demanded of her. She would keep her\nmouth shut and marry, thus dishonoring two men, herself, and the office\nthat demanded purity.\nBut then, once her people were saved?\nWhat moral authority had a White who had stained her robes dark with\nbroken vows? How could that which was white hide a stain?\nShe wouldn’t try. She wouldn’t heap deceit upon deceit. Her people\nwould live, but having proven herself unable to live with honor…\nHer mind flashed suddenly to her father. In that horrible fire, the White\nOak family had lost not only all her brothers and the estate itself, but also\ngoods worth more than the indebted family could ever repay. Despite her\nattempt to elope with Dazen, Karris’s engagement to Gavin Guile must\nhave looked like the only way to save the family. Gavin had known it, too,\nmocking him, talking in front of him in the most disgusting terms about\nwhat he was going to do with Karris—who drank herself into a stupor that\nnight, hoping to make herself insensate. The eldest Guile son had done all\nhe’d promised, too. Then he told Karris she wasn’t good enough for him,\nnot smart enough, not pretty enough, too boring, sexually dull. He told her\nhe didn’t care about her family’s lost fortune—but that he could never\nmarry a woman so far beneath himself in every other way. She hadn’t\nfought him then, not even when he threw her out into the cold, clothes torn,\nhair disheveled, tear-streaked and drunk, only making it home when a street\nmerchant steered her away from a wrong turn into a bad neighborhood and\ngave her something hot to drink.\nShe’d known she was pregnant immediately, because she had to be,\nbecause it was her worst fear, and she’d confronted her father, turning all\nher rage on the man who’d gambled her honor and his own and had lost.\nHe’d not defended himself. He’d quietly put his affairs in order and then\nhe’d blown his head off.\nShe’d hated him for his weakness, but the young find it too easy to hate\nthe weak.\nHow can a man live without honor? How can a woman?\nHer father had wagered her in order to save his own fortunes; she would\nwager herself to save the very lives of her people. That made them\ndifferent, even if she had to take the same exit.\nBut perhaps she would finally be able to forgive him, if it came to that.\nBut it wouldn’t come to that. She would make sure of it.\nSo. I have until Sun Day.\nKarris felt oddly invigorated. She had a little more than a month to\naccomplish everything she could in her life, or nothing at all.\nShe was deep in the muck. It felt like quicksand sucking at her boots,\nbut no matter. She was gonna fight like hell.\nChapter 30\nAs sensation returned to her dull carcass, Teia probably should’ve had some\ngratitude that she was waking up at all.

That game was finished. And maybe every\nother one, too.\n“Master? What the hell, Master?” she said. It was her last card. Not a\ngood one.\n“Master? Master.” Behind her, his voice low, Murder Sharp seemed to\nbe chewing on the word. “No, Adrasteia. You needed a master.” He sounded\nsuddenly mournful. “I couldn’t be that for you. You needed me, and I was\ngone. The war called me away, and you went astray without me.”\nShe hadn’t been blindfolded. Why not?\nIt could be a mistake. Sharp was fearsome, but he wasn’t very smart.\nAs if he could read her mind, Sharp suddenly grabbed her at the ropes at\nthe nape of her neck and breathed into her ear—soft, trembly breaths\nsmelling of mint leaves and darkness.\n“What—what are you doing, Master Sharp?” It wasn’t one rope around\nher neck, it was at least six, and they all bobbed with her fear.\nShe should be looking at the room, establishing exits, figuring what she\nmight grab as a weapon—but her world had collapsed to a bubble of this\nman’s breath and all the kinetic potential for violence in him, like a boulder\ntipping at the edge of a great cliff held back only by her attention on it.\n“Anything. I. Want,” he said.\nShe’d already forgotten her question.\nHis canine tooth closed gently on her earlobe, his stubble scratching her.\nAgainst her very will, gooseflesh raised across her arms. He wasn’t the kind\nof man to—He was just tormenting her. Maybe if he was so amused, she\nhad some hope.\nHe bit down hard and she yelled. She pursed her lips and cursed\ninwardly.\nSharp chuckled, pulling back. He didn’t seem alarmed in the least,\nwhich told her that wherever they were, no shouting was going to bring her\nhelp.\n“Oh, Adrasteia,” he said. “Sweet, stupid child.” He grabbed the ropes\nagain and lifted her. She’d assumed her limbs must be bound to the chair.\nThey weren’t. Instead she was cocooned in ropes on top of the chair, so she\nstood with his motion, ready to lunge and drive her head into his face, but\nhe kept her high and in front of him.\nHe stood her to her tiptoes and walked her straight to the wall, still\nlifting higher, so she had to strain higher simply to breathe. On reaching the\nwall, he lifted her off her feet and settled the rope over a hook.\nTeia gagged. The many ropes around her neck weren’t a noose designed\nto choke the life out as quickly as possible, but they were holding her entire\nweight. Her elbows were bound behind her back, and her feet bound\ntogether, straining to reach the floor.\nSharp’s frowning face came into view as her body turned. “Thought I\nestimated that right,” he said. He examined the ropes behind her back in no\napparent hurry to save her fucking life, thank you very much. With a finger,\nhe thrummed the ropes here and there, checking the tension."

You gettin’ fat?” he asked.\nShe choked.\nHe blew out a breath and stepped behind her, his fingers tugging.\nIt was her chance. He wasn’t looking at her eyes.\nBut he was already done. Her toes brushed the floor, and then touched.\nThe first hiss of air slipped into her lungs, and then a slow but adequate\nbreath. The ropes around her diaphragm didn’t allow a full gasp,\nheightening the sensation of suffocation. But Teia’d learned something of\ntorture, and she knew that sometimes the mere suggestion of suffocation\nwas far better than the reality of it.\nTeia breathed, and did nothing but breathe.\nHe was looking into her eyes again before it occurred to her to draft.\nShe’d missed her chance. He was too strong for her. Too canny.\nHow do you move too fast for fear to follow when you can’t move at\nall?\n“I told you, Adrasteia. Disobedience isn’t an option with the Order. I\ntold you…” With eyes cold as the deep currents under her feet and brittle\nvoice cracking like springtime ice under her, he said, “It’s the Order of the\nBroken Eye, not the Suggestion of the Broken Eye.”\nShe couldn’t bear his disgust, or for him to see her fear.\nLooking away in defeat, she saw this wasn’t his lair. He had none of the\naccoutrements that would suggest it was even a safe house. It was just an\nempty dump. Except that he’d spread out his gear on the floor and there was\na sheaf of parchments lying on his carefully folded shimmercloak.\nNext to the parchments, which were bent from having been rolled, she\nsaw a green or red ribbon.\n“Recognize those?” he asked.\nThe White’s papers. They were what had gotten Teia into all this.\nShe shook her head.\n“You naughty, naughty girl,” Murder Sharp said, like she was a dog\nwho’d shat on the rug. “I got suspicious when you insisted on taking them.\nYou were her cat’s paw all along, weren’t you?”\nHe’d seen her eyes stick to that package. She’d given herself away the\nday they’d kidnapped Marissia? Damn, damn, damn. “Why do you have\nthem?” she asked carefully. Speaking wasn’t fun with this much pressure on\nher throat. “I thought the Old Man owned you, heart and soul, blood and\nbone.”\n“I never disobey an order the Old Man gives. But sometimes it’s weeks\nbetween when we can meet. Months. We can’t be too careful. So I had to\nopen the papers to make sure there were no traps, or plans we needed to\nknow immediately. And then… I got curious.”\n“And?”\n“And what I found… troubled me. But you have no idea, do you?”\n“About what? I’d love to hear it.” If only to stay alive a bit longer,\nthanks.\n“They murder people. Just like we do—to keep power, you know?

At first I\nfelt such glee, reading Orea Pullawr’s explanation in her own hand, the last\nconfession of a woman who pretended to be so holy. Perhaps when I came\nto kill her, I was the hand of justice come to repay her many sins. She struck\nsuch a mournful tone. So apologetic. So desperate to explain. I despised her.\nBut then I read more.”\nHe scrubbed his hands through his short, fire-red hair and sat down on a\nfootstool. It was the only furniture in the house, if a house it was.\nSharp lit a candle with a finger and thumb and a bit of sub-red. It hissed\nand spat oddly. He peered closely at her, and she knew that if she flared her\neyes to paryl, he would kill her instantly.\n“In the past two years,” Sharp said, “I’ve seen the Chromeria try to do\nthings the old way, balancing the colors by decree. Telling the reds to draft\nmore, the blues to draft less, waiting a year. Seeing how many storms kill\npeople where, and what happens to the crops or the animals or the forests\nhere and there and everywhere. Everyone gets poor, people starve to death,\nand the storms rage anyway. Only… a bit less frequently. But if that’s the\nonly way to save things, even if everything else they say is lies, even if the\nChromeria’s being led by hypocrites and monsters… what if their way\nreally is better? Better to kill a few here, where they feel it, than to let\nhundreds or thousands die throughout the satrapies, isn’t it? We Braxians,\nwe say our way’s better: assassinate a few to save many, but how’s that\nmake sense? If the Chromeria is doing it all wrong, I suppose, turning Atash\ninto desert so Tyrea can bloom, that’s bad, right? But the records show we\ndid the same. I mean the opposite. All we did was make sure that the\nthousands who died weren’t ours. Who’s the monster then? Maybe our way\nwas best against the nine kings, but now?”\nSharp was not a good storyteller. Teia couldn’t even tell when he was\nreferring to which side.\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Teia said. “Can you start\nfrom the beginning?”\nHe shook his head, paused. Checked a denture as if it had felt loose.\n“The Order ruined me,” Sharp said. “Lied to me. Broke me in the worst\nway—they made me break myself.” He reached into his mouth and took out\nhis bottom set of teeth. He sat on the little stool and squinted at the teeth in\norder. With a tiny brush, he scraped away some tiny imperfection, wiggled a\ncanine. He clucked his tongue between his jagged natural teeth, displeased,\nand tended to the rest of the dentures.\nBut he kept glancing up, noting her eyes at unpredictable intervals. She\ncouldn’t draft without getting caught. Dammit. She had to wait until he was\nmore distracted.\nHe said, “It’s a funny thing, you know, you and I.”"

That she hadn’t dared—that she might have missed her last\nchance through her lack of courage was infuriating, sickening, terrifying.\nHe dried the dentures and daubed paste from a jar along the length of the\nteeth channel with a tiny brush. Then he glanced over, quickly.\n“It’s funny that we both kind of want to be the other person—but only\nkind of,” Sharp said. “You want to be a master of paryl. A killer. You’re a\nbrittle weakling, and you want to be strong. You want to be scary. But only\nkind of, because you don’t want it badly enough to do what you need to\nbecome who you want to be. Me, I’m strong, but… I kind of want to be a\ntraitor like you.”\nIt was like a rope thrown toward a drowning woman.\n“It’s never betrayal to do what’s right,” Teia said.\nHe barked a laugh. “Think the Old Man would agree?”\n“It’s not too late for you,” Teia said.\nHe tamped his gums and broken teeth dry by biting a towel. Then he fit\nthe dentures back into his mouth. He pressed firmly on them and waited a\nmoment. He sighed. “Oh, girl,” he said. “Your naive-it, naïveté? naiveness?\nis a blindness worse than your shitty color-blind eyes. Do you know how\nmany men I’ve killed?”\nHe was looking directly at her now. There was no chance to draft unless\nhe turned away again.\n“I—”\n“Twenty-seven slaves, in my training. If you count those. They started\nme with worn-out old men. I knew those poor bastards’d soon be on the\nstreets, dying, begging, miserable. Unwanted, uncared for. Not so hard to\nend a life that was gonna look like that. You’re doing ’em a favor, aren’t\nyou? The Order worked me up from there, breaking me in until I was like\nan old, dependable pair of work boots.”\nIt hit Teia like a punch in the stomach. She’d thought her training\nmethod was coincidental, that old slaves were the cheapest.\nIt was no coincidence. It was all by design.\nThey’d been chipping away at her conscience deliberately, by degrees.\nAnd she’d helped them. Justifying it at every step. A victim, but a victim\npartaking in the evil done to her. Breaking herself. Sometimes she’d looked\nforward to trying out new paryl tricks on her victims, hadn’t she?\nExperiments.\nThey’re gonna die anyway. I might as well learn something from them.\nSomeone’s going to kill them. Might as well be me. It’s better that it’s\ndone by me, because…\nBecause why, exactly?\nSomeone’s gonna do evil, might as well be me.\nAnd if everyone in the world said that, what kind of world would it be?\nDeath had been certain for any one slave who’d stood before her.

Or the next.\nWhat if everyone in the world said, ‘Someone’s gonna do evil—but it\nwon’t be me’?\nBut Sharp was still talking. “They gave me reasons at first. You know,\nthis one had done this terrible thing, this next had done something worse.\nFrom old slaves to young, young slaves to bad old free men, old free men to\nyoung free men to bad old luxiats to… to anyone, without question.\nWithout remorse.\n“Eighty-nine kills now in more years than I want to remember.

Like I’m\ndoing now, I guess.\n“Last year, I killed Arys Sub-red in her very birthing chamber. We’d\nmade love that morning.” He smiled with real fondness, then shook himself.\n“Not that she loved me. I’d been very clear that I was willing to be good\ncompany and an attentive but temporary bedmate and no more. But she\ntreated me… respectful. Honorably, I guess. You don’t get that so much. We\npassed some of the sweetest hours of my life in each other’s arms. I was…\nuh, fond of her, I guess, in a way I’d not thought I could be after…\nwhatever. But that morning I threatened to strangle her newborn’s first\nscream if she said the wrong thing. I would’ve done it, too.” He shook his\nhead. “What kind of man does that? Not a whole one. Not a man at all.”\n“You can still—”\n“No!” he barked. “There is no redemption for men like me. And if there\nwas, if some god would erase my crimes, I wouldn’t want to serve a god so\nvile. Some things can’t be forgiven. Shouldn’t be. I’ve sworn the oaths. I’ve\nlived them. I’ve drunk of the communal bloodwine. So I’ve this much\nhonor left to me, this much at least. At least I obey.”\nHe slapped her face, shooting black stars over her vision, and then he\npulled a blindfold over her face.\nShe heard him pull up the chair within a few feet and sit.\nAnd as he sat with a great sigh, she could only hope he was dumber than\nshe thought, because if the greatest evidence Murder Sharp held on to of his\nown goodness or honor was that he obeyed the Old Man, then every\nmoment he let Teia live was an argument against all those things.\nIf he realized that her continuing existence undermined the very last\nthing he valued about himself?

She’d just come in from one of\nher meetings with her spies, and was wearing attire for the forest, not the\npalace.\nThe windows of the privy council chamber were dark. Even the most\nardent art aficionados had gone home. Kip had only three meetings left\nbefore he could call it a day. He’d been seated so long, his butt was going to\ncome out of his chair square-shaped. Ferkudi’s report on provisions was\nnext: boring, but necessary information, doubtless with money requests\nattached.\nWhat was after that, another banker to beg for a loan?\nKip sighed, then realized everyone was waiting on him. Not least his\nwife. “Please, please,” he said.\nHe was not used to this ‘lord’ business.\n“I could use a few more minutes with these numbers anyway,” Ferkudi\nsaid as he and some subordinates and scribes and secretaries and the rest\ncleared out of the room.\nOnly Cruxer stayed in the chamber, with some of the Mighty’s nunks\noutside. The man had to be even more tired than Kip, but he wasn’t ready to\nleave Kip alone with anyone other than the original Mighty yet.\n“They told me what you did,” Tisis said.\n“They did?” Kip asked stupidly. Which ‘they’? What thing?\nHe really probably shouldn’t be making decisions when he was this\nexhausted. He’d stacked the easy meetings up for the end of the day, but\nstill.\n“They did. Come with me,” Tisis said.\nAs Kip stood laboriously, Cruxer paused in his checking the windows.\nThey’d just cleared the room, and now they were leaving it? He made to go\nwith them.\nTisis waved him off. “Sorry,” she said. “Won’t be long.”\nShe took Kip’s hand and pulled him toward the room’s closet. She\npulled out her ponytail. “I’ve been thinking about you all day,” she said.\nKip’s exhaustion was vanishing by the moment.\nAs she opened the closet door, she said, “Have you been thinking about\nme?”\nWith one meeting after another, all day long, each demanding total\nfocus? He’d barely thought about her at all. But that didn’t feel like the\nright thing to say at the moment, so he slid his hand up her cheek into her\nnewly loosed blonde hair and pulled her head back to kiss her as he joined\nher in the little closet.\nShe snaked away from him after a moment to close the door behind\nthem. It plunged them into darkness.\nKip’s heart suddenly leapt with fear, all desire forgotten.\nLocked in a closet. Helpless. Rats swarming.\nA mag torch snapped, and they were bathed in green light. He saw the\nlook of brazen desire on his wife’s upturned face at the same time that she\nsaw the terror on his.\nHer hand paused from removing her belt, and she cringed. “Oh, shit!\nHow’d I forget? Oh, honey, I’m so sorry. I’ve ruined it, haven’t I?”\nKip took some deep breaths.

His throat was tight. “Help me forget the\nwhere and remember the with-whom?”\nHer smiled broadened, and there was nothing in all the world that could\nquicken his pulse like a devious, confident grin on his beautiful bride’s face.\n“Draft a little green?” she asked.\n“Green?!” he said, trying to keep his voice down. “The last time we tried\nsome green in bed, do you remember what you did?”\n“Just a little!” she whispered. The whites of her eyes were already\nswirling with green. More than a little, and she was shimmying her hips to\nremove her trousers.\nBut he didn’t use green. Green was all wildness—which could be\nwonderful if one was looking to overcome shyness in the bedchamber—but\nthat which is wild hates being caged, and Kip already felt near panic.\nIt actually took Kip several bifurcated minutes to forget the close\nconfines of the closet. Then, as they made love in the tight space, her head\nbent back, her hair filling his nostrils with her scent, his hands on her hips,\nthen on her still-covered breasts, her body pushing eagerly against him,\nslowly, slowly, that old grimy rat-infested closet’s echo faded like bad\nmusic heading into the distance as blissful tones of a new song began close\nby.\nAnd when they’d finished—as quietly as possible, for Cruxer’s sake—he\nheld her still against him and marveled. In the postcoital clarity, he was\nfilled with such love for his wife that fear had been cast out.\nThe closet had been transformed: no more a trap, no more an echo of the\ndarkest moments of his childhood—it was just a little room. Hemmed in on\nthree sides, he’d wanted to bolt for the exit, but if he had, he’d have missed\nout on this.\nHe spun Tisis around and kissed her passionately.\nShe squeaked, surprised, but then leaned into him, her hand reaching\ndown between them as she made a little moue that asked, ‘Again?’\nHe pulled away from her lips. “I’d love to,” he said.\nShe’d tilted her hips, but didn’t press onto him now as she heard his\nhesitation.\nNor did he push forward. He’d meant to pull away from her hand as\nwell, but didn’t. “Do… you want to?” he asked.\n“I’m more than willing,” she said. “But I’m also certainly satisfied. I was\ntrying to be quiet for Cruxer’s sake.” Her face went through several fast\nexpressions. She said, “You’re confusing me.”\n“You gave me a thought,” he said. “A breakthrough, maybe. But part of\nme is screaming that I’d be a damned fool to—”\nHe cut off as she pushed deep onto him, pushing him off balance until\nhis back hit the wall. Her eyelids fluttered for a moment, and then her eyes\ncleared and she looked up at him sweetly. “My lord,” she said, “thank you"

Now I believe you have others to attend to.”\nShe pulled away and threw her clothes into place before he could stop\nher.\n“You are merciless,” he said. “And I adore you.”\n“What was your breakthrough?” she asked, pulling her belt on.\n“Huh? Oh, oh, right,” he said.\nShe sighed.\n“What do you think is my greatest weakness?” Kip asked.\nTisis paused in pulling her hair back into its ponytail. “For real?”\n“Yeah!”\n“You’re really going to ask that, right after we… had a moment?”\n“Fine, fine, what’s my greatest strength?”\n“You have lots of great strengths—”\n“No, I’m not hunting for compliments,” Kip said. “It’s what you’ve said\nbefore.”\n“You mean that you see with your heart? That you have compassion—\ncould you put that away now?—that you have compassion that allows you\nto understand people, even in moments where another man would be sunk\ninto his own needs and plans.”\n“Right! And thank you,” Kip said, getting his own clothes back into\nplace. “So the flip side is my great weakness. I see the small stuff, and I lose\nthe big.”\n“The small stuff is the big stuff,” Tisis said.\n“With people, yeah. But not as a leader. Hey, you mind if I open the door\nnow?”\n“Do I look like I just had amazing sex?” Tisis asked.\nKip hesitated. “This isn’t a trick question, is it?”\n“Let me rephrase. Do I look like I just had sex in a closet?”\n“Still not tracking.”\n“Do I look rumpled, Kip? Do I smell like—”\n“No—oh, and yes. You and me both, actually.”\nShe scowled, then gazed at the green mag torch. She drafted a little.\n“Okay, fine, now I don’t care.”\n“You know, you really shouldn’t—”\n“Please lecture me about how much I’m drafting,” she said sharply.\nHe shut his mouth. “Pot, meet kettle. Objection withdrawn.”\n“Go on, now,” she said, opening the door.\nOut in the fuller-spectrum light of the room, she definitely looked like\nshe’d just had sex. Hair not all tucked into her ponytail, cheeks flushed,\nclothes a bit askew.\n“Mirror’s right there,” Cruxer said, otherwise stony-faced. “And General\nAntonius is here to present tomorrow’s training regimen and the daily\nreport.”\nTisis groaned. For all her earlier bluster, she was mortified when it came\nto her cousin learning anything about her sex life. They’d grown up\ntogether.\nThe call of a million duties delivered one after another, each somewhat\ndifferent, and yet always stultifyingly the same, threatened to pull Kip back\ninto their games.\n“Ask him to wait,” Kip said.\n‘Thank you,’ Tisis mouthed, as Cruxer did so.\nKip sat silent, though.\nHe was being played.

Nothing here—or at least very little—was\nby accident.\nThe thoughts swirled: an ambassador sweats when he shouldn’t, and\nthen doesn’t when he should. Assassins fail at a job that should have been\neasy. A drafter wears armor, not to protect herself from her enemies but to\nprotect her friends from herself. A map doesn’t report what it should, and…\nmaybe…\nWhat if it also did show what it shouldn’t?\nKip walked over to the map table.\nHe blacked out half a dozen of the blooming lights behind them—\nrefugees’ and scouts’ reports that had come from the Great River behind\nthem, reporting about various events, but that altogether told them the river\nwas open when it actually hadn’t been.\nIt had only taken six reports to lead them astray, because they didn’t\nexpect more: bandits were enslaving everyone in that area they could grab.\nNow he ran the map backward and forward without those six reports,\nand saw a dark area in the map, right behind them, a shadow that they might\notherwise have feared.\nKoios had done that.\n“These are the bad reports,” Kip said. “These are the refugees who are\nspies.”\nTisis was standing at the map table with him. “Yeah, these three for sure,\nand I’m checking into these ones now.”\n“They are,” Kip said.\n“How do you…?”\nBut he barely heard her. This darkness on the map had hid an enormous\nthreat. What if there were another?\n“Something’s missing,” Kip said. “Something… Cruxer, was there ever\nany emissary from the White King? Someone that the soldiers stopped?\nAny news of someone being waylaid by angry townspeople?”\n“Uh-uh,” Cruxer said.\n“Why would there be?” Ben-hadad asked. Kip hadn’t even noticed that\nBen had come back into the room. “We just routed them. And then they\ntried to assassinate you.”\nKip said, “There should be an emissary here to distract and confuse us.\nTo sow discord if any could be sown. Not least, to try to see what condition\nthe city’s in.”\n“Koios surely expected you to execute anyone he sent,” Cruxer said.\n“Lawless men expect lawless treatment.”\nKip shook his head. “He doesn’t mind sacrificing people. It’s something\nelse.”\nHe looked at the map again. Advanced it. Rolled it all the way back to\nthe battle of Ox Ford, nearly two years ago now. Advanced it again.\nThe reports lit up, beacons against a night of ignorance, cairns on a\nclimb with precipices on every side. He squinted until the lights blurred,\nnew lights appearing and old fading away as the reports aged and the map\nadvanced time. It was like clouds passing over a night sky, blotting out the\nstars and revealing others. But some places stayed ever-black, little bits of\nthe evernight, of eternal ignorance and blindness.\nIf you screened out a few reports, which could well be there to distract,"

But some places stayed ever-black, little bits of\nthe evernight, of eternal ignorance and blindness.\nIf you screened out a few reports, which could well be there to distract,\nthen… the darkness had a shape.\nThere was an area of coastline almost entirely dark.\n“What were those four reports? Here?” he asked Tisis.\nShe went back to the very beginning of one of her folders and told him\nsome names. They had no meaning to him.\nHe pursed his lips.\nShe said, “But that was when I was just getting my networks set up. I\ndidn’t have many sources yet.”\n“Whose lands are those?” he asked.\nShe hadn’t written that down, but she knew this satrapy well. She\nsearched her memory for a few moments. “These ones are Red Leaf lands, a\nforest and farmland. This is Conal Briar Wood’s estate, and this is old Aoife\nBracken’s grazing land, if she’s still alive and it hasn’t shifted to her\nstepson’s family, uh, they’re… Petrakoi? Alexandros Petrakis. Yeah.”\n“Shit,” he said. He’d been hoping there was some connection with\nsomething, anything.\n“Kip, they’re both retainers to the Red Leafs.”\n“Shiiit,” Kip said.\nHe darkened those four lights on the map, and now there was a blank\narea, east of Ox Ford. “What’s this town near the coast?”\n“Azuria, or maybe Apple Grove. Azuria Bay used to be a port until the\nharbor silted in. The moorage was a bit of a way up the river, can’t\nremember the name. But it didn’t generate enough revenue for the locals to\nbe able to afford dredging it, and there are a lot of rocks farther out that\nmade captains leery of it in the first place, so it slowly shriveled up and\ndied. Apple Grove is the next village over, maybe a league away?”\nKip chortled.\n“Oh ho. Master Danavis would be so disappointed in me. Cruxer, what\ndo you do when your enemy is making a mistake?”\n“Don’t interrupt them,” Cruxer said. “You taught us that a long time\nago.”\n“Tisis, show me the language you’ve worked out with Ambassador Red\nLeaf.”\nHe looked it over and clapped his hands. Good play, enemy mine! It\nalmost worked.\n“Well, you were wrong, Commander,” Kip said.\n“How so?”\n“The White King did send his emissary. Ambassador Red Leaf is a\ntraitor.”\n“What?!” Tisis asked. “But he gave us everything!”\n“Everything to snare us,” Kip said. “Commander, what message do you\nthink those assassins were sending when they failed on purpose?”\nCruxer’s brow furrowed. He still didn’t buy that they had.\n“Look,” Kip said. “Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that they intended to\nfail… but didn’t intend to die. What would you take from that?”\n“Uh…‘Don’t mess with the Order, or we’ll get you next time’?”\n“Right. So where’s the last place you’d go if you didn’t want to run\nafoul of the Order?”\n“Braxos?” Cruxer asked."

It’s not like the Order publicly lets anyone\nknow where their headquarters are.”\n“You’re not really helping me here,” Kip said. “How about if I said I\nwanted to go to the Chromeria? Would you be more or less afraid of the\nOrder than if we stay here?”\n“More, definitely.”\n“Thank you!” Kip looked at the treaty. “And this treaty commits me to\ntake all our troops to lift the siege of Green Haven—and go with them\npersonally.”\n“But that’s where we want to go,” Cruxer said.\n“Right. Or we could stay here. There’s a million reasons to stay here. A\nmillion problems to solve. A bandit army, for one. And what were they\ntrying to do—before Daragh the Coward so kindly betrayed Koios and\nhanded them over to us?”\nCruxer said, “Trying to trap us in the city so we couldn’t go help lift the\nsiege?”\n“No,” Kip said. “They don’t care if we tried to lift the siege or if we\nfought here. They’re armor, see?”\n“‘Armor’?”\n“But not just any armor! We thought they were blocking the Great River\nto keep out new threats from without—reinforcements and supplies and\neverything else. Now, it does do that, but that’s not the main purpose. The\nWhite King hasn’t thrown his whole might at Green Haven. Why not? He\nsplit his forces rather than overwhelm the city. Why? Because if he took the\ncity, we would know that we had no chance of taking it back. So we\nwouldn’t even try. See?\n“He didn’t block the river to keep things from coming in. His blockade\nis to keep something dangerous from going out. Do you see it now? We’re\ntrapped in a closet. Three walls, one door—and he knows what I’m going to\ndo: either stay in here afraid, or rush out the door he shows us. He doesn’t\ncare which!”\n“What do you mean?” Cruxer said. “Of course he cares!”\n“I’m not saying he doesn’t have preferences. He’d love for us to sit in\nthis city and do nothing so his people can take Green Haven. But even if we\nsave Green Haven—even if we push his forces out of Blood Forest entirely,\nhow can we hold it if he holds the Great River and the rest of the Seven\nSatrapies?”\n“Orholam’s hoary head,” Ben-hadad said. “That harbor. Cruxer, what do\nwe know about the bane? I don’t mean religiously. I mean practically, for\nwar.”\nCruxer scowled. “They lock down drafters of their color.”\n“And one other thing,” Kip said.\nBen-hadad looked at him, horror dawning. “Oh no… They don’t need a\nnavy, just some supply ships and barges. That’s why a little harbor could\nwork.”\n“What? What do you mean?” Tisis asked. “What’s the one other thing,\nKip?”"

What do you mean?” Tisis asked. “What’s the one other thing,\nKip?”\n“The bane float,” Kip said. “At least, the one at Ru did. So what if the\nother can as well?”\n“Plenty of lumber around Azuria to help support the heavier ones, if\nneed be,” Ben-hadad said.\n“You’re telling me…” Cruxer said.\n“They’re going to invade the Chromeria,” Ben-hadad said. “Barges for\nten or twenty thousand men and drafters and wights and food, and they\njust… cross. The Chromeria is surely using skimmers to scout now, but any\nskimmers that get close enough to spot the bane would simply die in the\nwater because the drafters powering them couldn’t draft. The Chromeria\nmight only get a couple days’ warning.”\n“And it wouldn’t matter anyway,” Kip said. “The Chromeria’s defensive\nplans rely on drafters to do most of the fighting. If none of the drafters can\ndo anything because the bane neutralize them… they’ll panic. Everyone\nwill. With drafters and wights and even five thousand warriors, the White\nKing could take the Jaspers in a day.”\n“Well, that’s fuckin’ terrifying,” Big Leo rumbled, coming in the door.\n“Doesn’t do us much good, though, does it?”\n“Sure it does,” Kip said. “If we know what he’s doing, we have a chance\nto stop him.”\n“How?” asked Big Leo.\n“Gimme a break, man,” Kip said, “I just figured out his plan. Give me a\nsecond or two to come up with ours, maybe?”\n“Maybe we go scuttle the bane before they can leave?” Big Leo asked.\n“Yes! A surprise attack. Move fast through the forest, descend on him\nlike the raiders we are.” Kip started to warm to the idea. He could stop the\nWhite King and not abandon Blood Forest. “We could send along the bulk\nof the army to relieve the siege at Green Haven, shoot down there by small\nrivers and streams, maybe reunite with the Night Mares and—”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said. He looked over at Big Leo. “If they have the\nbane… then they have the bane. We’re drafters. All of our elite warriors, all\nthe Night Mares—we’re all drafters. The bane can immobilize drafters of\ntheir color. If they have all the bane, we’re the last people who could stop\nthem.”\nIt hit them all like a punch in the gut.\n“We haven’t lost. Not yet,” Kip said. “I won’t believe it.”\nTisis came beside him and took his hand.\nHis heart plunged.\n“We haven’t,” Big Leo said. “But maybe the Chromeria has.”\n“I guess that makes our decision for us,” Cruxer said. He looked ill. “We\ncan send messengers. Maybe see if they get around this navy to go warn the\nChromeria.”\n“It won’t make any difference,” Big Leo said, “but we owe it to them to\nlet them know what’s coming. Maybe they can flee.”"

Maybe they can flee.”\n“You know damn well they won’t,” Tisis said. “Andross Guile won’t\nbelieve someone’s thought of something he hasn’t.”\nAt the Battle of Ru, everyone in the Seven Satrapies had seen what one\nbane could do—or could almost do. But they’d killed that one. Maybe that\nhad lulled them all into a false complacency. No one could imagine that\nanyone could assemble seven bane together without anyone finding out\nabout it. No one could imagine organizing large-scale warfare without\ndrafters at the center of the strategy.\nKip said, “Fine, so let’s say we give up the Chromeria for lost, which\nmeans we’re giving up on the Seven Satrapies entirely. Then let’s say we go\nfree Green Haven, and have total success. Then we have… what? until next\nspring at best for the White King to regroup and attack us? We have until\nnext spring to figure out how to win a war against drafters and wights and\nthe bane—without using drafters, not even ourselves?”\nHe looked from face to face, but they all looked as gray and hopeless as\nhe felt.\n“And if the Chromeria falls,” Cruxer said. “All the fleeing drafters are\nno help to us. We can’t even help us.”\n“We’d have to retreat before every battle, leaving the munds to do all the\nfighting—against wights and drafters. They’ll be slaughtered. We could\nfight a guerrilla war, but we’d have to be willing to give up every city, every\ndecent-size town, and every person not able to travel fast and live off the\nland. There’s no endgame there except hoping Koios simply decides it’s not\nworth it to kill us. Anyone here think Koios will give up before we’re all\ndead?”\nEvery face was grim.\nTisis said, “You’ve been awfully quiet, Ben. Any ideas?”\nHe fidgeted with his flip-up spectacles. He chewed on his lower lip.\n“Not for an attack, but maybe… maybe for a defense?”\nChapter 32\nKarris White Oak had never felt so alone. She didn’t know how long she\ncould stand this.\nShe lifted her head from the prison of her folded arms at some sound\nfrom outside her rooms. She’d fallen asleep at her desk after another too-\nlong night of studying and making plans and drinking too much kopi.\nKarris’s room slave, Aspasia, wasn’t confident enough in her position to\nmake her go to bed. She had merely draped a blanket over her mistress’s\nshoulders. It had fallen off.\nConstantly surrounded by the Blackguards, who had been her family for\nnearly two decades, now Karris couldn’t let herself trust any of them. She\nstood slowly, body aching, and wondered if it was only the night-sleeping at\nher desk, or if she was getting old. She moved toward her bed, not\nbothering to undress as she glanced at a water clock. It was still two hours\nuntil dawn. She could get an hour of real sleep, anyway.

Then the day’s\nduties would accost her once more.\nBut she had barely slipped under the cold blankets when she heard a\nvoice. The same voice that had wakened her, but now impossibly loud.\n“Want to know your problem, Highness?” Samite said.\nLet this just be a bad dream, Karris thought.\nHighness wasn’t one of her titles. “Not enough sleep,” Karris said, not\nopening her eyes. “Please go away.”\n“You’ve got tits again. Never thought I’d see it.”\n“Excuse me?!” She opened her eyes. Samite was not alone. She closed\nthem again. She was in no place to deal with people right now.\nGill Greyling’s usually welcome voice intruded. “She’s trying to be\npolite. She means you’re getting fat.”\n“Ahem,” said Commander Fisk. What the hell. When had he come in?\n“Excuse Gill. He meant soft.”\n“Chubby?” asked Essel.\n“Chubby?!” Karris said. “My clothes still fit!” A little less comfortably,\nmaybe, but still.\n“Flabby?” asked Buskin.\n“Tubby,” suggested Vanzer.\nWhat was this? Had all of them come? It was mortifying. Karris peeked\nfrom beneath her pillow. Orholam’s granite belly, there were a dozen of\nthem.\nKarris stared daggers at some new kid she didn’t even know. He\nswallowed. “I, uh, I hadn’t noticed any change, High Lady.”\n“Hasn’t been around long enough to know how tough you used to be,”\nVanzer said. “Sad.”\n“Long time ago,” Essel said.\n“Weren’t they calling her the Iron White? More like the Hungry White,”\nGill said.\n“You can’t—you can’t talk to me that way,” Karris said plaintively.\n“Bet she can’t even do five pull-ups these days,” Samite said.\n“Excuse me!?” Karris sat bolt upright. She’d once matched the women’s\nrecord for most pull-ups.\nHalf an hour later, she’d done those five pull-ups. Barely. And knew she\nwas going to pay for it for days. And pay for everything else, too, training\nwith the Blackguards. It was all coming back fast, though, and she realized\nhow much she needed it. The clarity it brought.\nIn her time as White, she’d come to think of the hours spent training as\nhours lost—but now, again, she realized she accomplished more in the\nhours she still had than if she’d only worked.\nNow, in the dawn’s light, she sweated at the rear of a line of\nBlackguards, doing an advanced form. Standing on her left foot, she\nsnapped out a side kick, sharp and crisp, holding her balance as she then\nspun and slapped her right elbow into her left hand, exactly at the moment\nfifty other Blackguards did. Kick, land on the opposite foot, kick again.\nShe wasn’t a mind, housed in a body; she was body and mind united.\nDammit. How had she forgotten?"

How had she forgotten?\nHer Blackguards loved her. They saw her. She didn’t know exactly what\nshe needed to do, but she knew she needed to fight for them. She needed to\nbe worthy of these magnificent men and women.\nThe thought carried her through the rest of the morning’s duties. She’d\nbeen elevated not to be honored but in order to serve. So this afternoon,\nshe’d buried her reason for walking down this hallway amid a half dozen\nother tasks that took her to half of the towers of the Chromeria and even\nbelowground, making numerous stops as if they were spur-of-the-moment\ndecisions to check in on old friends, even to minister to an elderly luxiat\nwho’d broken her wrist in a fall. All of it had been to bring her to this door,\nflanked by the new, short, and burly Blackguard who’d just been assigned\nto her detail, a kid named Amzîn.\nBecause she didn’t know him, she didn’t trust him. It had almost made\nher abandon her plan. To keep secrets, she had to trust no one, had to make\ntoday’s stops seem casual. And she couldn’t do that while checking the\nguard roster or requesting someone she knew.\nStill, it put her alone, with a stranger. The young man who was supposed\nto be protecting her could well be a spy for the Order of the Broken Eye.\nShe could just go by this door. Pass it off as nothing. A whim.\nIn one of the stranger perquisites of her office, this little room was\ntechnically hers, albeit low in the bowels of the green tower, and thus much\ntoo far away from her apartments for her to use frequently as a second\noffice or library. In her time as a Blackguard, she’d learned that previous\nWhites had sometimes used this second room as a discreet place for\nassignations. Karris was using it to tuck her own little secret away from\nsight.\n“Do you want me to open the door, High Mistress?” Amzîn asked.\nO sweet Orholam. He was just a kid! Built like a stump and as plain as\nthe day was long, Amzîn had an incongruously high tenor voice. Seemed\nembarrassed about it, now that Karris had let her surprise at it show.\nShe owned everything in the room before her, including the person, so\nshe had every right to go straight in.\n“Knock, please,” she said instead. It was a weird situation already; she\ndidn’t need to make it weirder.\nAmzîn knocked too hard and rattled the door on its hinges. He actually\nflinched. Apparently didn’t know his own strength.\nKarris pretended not to notice.\n“Please don’t knock my door down!” a young man shouted from within.\n“It’s unlocked!”\n“Apologies, High Mistress,” Amzîn mumbled.\nKarris waved it away.\nThey stood for a moment longer, then Amzîn suddenly realized that by\nhis training, he was supposed to open the door and go in first to assess the\nroom for threats, and instead he was standing around. He blurted out, “Oh,"

You’ve saved me all the effort of getting down gracefully in all this\nregalia.” Facing Karris, Quentin lay himself prostrate, stretching out his\nhands toward her feet. “High Lady. Gracious One.

A Blackguard was supposed to be\nwell-nigh invisible to his wards, and he was failing. Horribly.\n“Why don’t you take position out in the hallway? I think the threats to\nmy health and well-being are much more likely to be out there… if you\nare.”\nHe seemed at first relieved, and then at the whipcrack of the last words,\nstung. His face went from wounded to stoic quickly, though, give him that.\nKarris wanted to be forgiving, but she’d been a Blackguard. Second-best\nwasn’t good enough, and if this kid couldn’t get better fast, she was going\nto be riding the watch captains for their bad judgment in promoting him.\nBesides, she wasn’t going to get close to another Blackguard kid.

At least until it seems like it’s becoming a contest.”\n“How’s that?” Karris asked.\nHe unfolded the tale succinctly.

He was a convicted murderer, but oddly also the most\ndevout luxiat they knew.\nAmong the young luxiats at least, he’d become an important figure.\nHe thought he was merely an oddity, like a good-luck charm to them,\nbut Karris knew he was becoming more than that. The young luxiats gave\nhim alms.\nAnd then, as Quentin’s new reputation spread, so, too, did strangers.\nIt made him enemies among the older luxiats, who’d hated him already\nfor rubbing their own shortcomings in their faces and now hated him more\nfor being so apparently righteous, and admired (a convicted murderer,\nadmired!) on top of it all.\nWhich now helped her understand what he meant about the donated\njewelry he wore becoming a contest. As luxiats or lords gave to him, and\nsaw their piece soon thereafter being worn, they might feel proud of it, but\nsoon it would be gone—sold for another’s bread. His wearing of it was to\nbe a reminder that they didn’t own it any longer, and if that stung, then\ngood. If they gave without feeling a pinch, how did that help them learn to\nsacrifice? His no longer wearing it would be a further sign of how Orholam\ngives gifts, not that they may be hoarded but that they may be used. If that\npained them, too, then that was good as well.\nIf, on the other hand, seeing him wear their jewelry started to give lords\nbragging rights, he would stop, and that could pain them, too.\nHe continued his studies—Karris had ordered him to do that, mainly so\nthat he must always be among the luxiats—but he also volunteered in the\nworst precincts of Big Jasper, where he worked at charity hospitals and fed\nthe poor, often helping in the sculleries himself. He’d been beaten and\nrobbed several times—the gold clothing was the sign of an easy and\nlucrative mark. Once he’d been hit so hard he’d lost his hearing in one ear.\nBut he had no fear whatsoever, nor would he countenance stopping his\nwork.\nOf all people, white-bearded High Luxiat Amazzal had put a stop to the\nmuggings.

Karris’s agents had reported that the old man had gone into\nOverhill himself, in plain clothing nearly as old as he was. He’d shown\nsome toughs something (her agent couldn’t see what) that made them very\nnervous. Then old High Luxiat Amazzal was taken to a building where\nsome very powerful people with illegal interests were reputed to spend time\ngambling together. After half an hour, he left.\nShe got a note the next day from Amazzal: “Certain wayward sheep\nfrom my old flock have contacted me. They’ve noticed young Quentin’s\ngood works and wish them to continue. They tell me that henceforth, as\nwell as they are able, he will be protected.”\nIt was an odd construction—like it was their idea, not his. Like he hadn’t\npaid for it with some kind of coin or another. But he hadn’t been summoned\nby them, Karris was sure of that. She’d deployed a dozen spies on Amazzal,\nsearching his offices, delving into his finances, following him everywhere\nhe went, intercepting his correspondence and looking for codes, and noting\nevery book he touched in case it was being used as a cipher key. Amazzal\nhad been one of her prime candidates for being the Old Man of the Desert,\nthe head of the Order of the Broken Eye.\nInstead, his only secrets appeared to be secretly doing good works and\ndepleting his own family fortunes at a rate that suggested he hoped to die\nwithout so much as a danar to his name. Though Amazzal looked the part\nperfectly, with his flowing beard and imposing voice, he wasn’t a great\nHigh Luxiat.\nBut it looked more and more like he was a good one.\nNice as it was to find out that some men who appeared to be good\nactually were good, it also meant that in surveilling him, Karris had wasted\ntime and resources.\nShe was running out of both.\n“I’ve something very hard to ask of you,” she said.\n“I’m your slave, by law and by choice. You needn’t ask,” Quentin said.\nDamn he was a weird kid.\n“It’ll be difficult and dangerous. It would put you in the company of a\nhardened murderer.”\n“I’m a murderer myself,” he said.\nNot a hardened one. “Any misstep could mean your death, and others’.\nIt may be too hard for you.”\n“It won’t be more than I can handle.”\n“You trust me too much,” Karris said.\nHe laughed suddenly. “I don’t trust you at all!”\nShe stepped back, offended. She was the White. And Quentin’s owner.\n“I’ve offended you. I’m sorry,” he said. “But you misunderstand. I mean\nI don’t place the locus of my trust in you or on your judgment, but in\nOrholam alone. You needn’t take on His burden. Being the White would be\ntoo much for anyone to bear alone!”\nShe got it then, though he was so intelligent that he forgot that others\nweren’t as quick as he was. He didn’t need to trust her, because he trusted\nOrholam, who had put her in her position. Her choices mattered… but also"

She said, “I’m sending you to someone who’s killed a\nlot of innocent people—I don’t know, twenty, twenty-five? All dead at my\nbehest.”\nQuentin blanched. “You’ve ordered twenty murders?”\n“I’ve ordered my agent to do what was necessary to accomplish what\nhad to be done.”\n“To what end?” His voice, not low to start with, pitched squeaky.\nTo what end? It was the kind of archaic phrasing you’d hear from a kid\nwho’d grown up with a wide variety of friends: friends writ on papyrus,\nfriends writ on sheepskin, and friends writ on wood pulp—but not many of\nflesh and blood.\nKarris said, “I want you to be her handler.”\n“Her—what? A handler? Me?”\n“But I want you to do something harder than that. I want you to be her\nfriend. Orholam’s told me that you both need one, desperately.” Almost as\nmuch as I do.\n“Who are we talking—wait, you can’t be serious.”\n* * *\nKarris stepped out of the room a minute later. Her young Blackguard Amzîn\nwas waiting, precisely where he was supposed to be, with perfect posture\nand alertness.\n“Good kid,” Karris said, closing the door behind her.\nShe saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes. She gave him leave to speak\nwith a gesture.\n“Isn’t that the luxiat who murdered that girl?” he asked.\nShe nodded. “Sad story, huh? Promising young talent gets elevated too\nhigh too soon. Ends with a young woman with a bullet in her throat.”\nAmzîn got a pained look on his face, but it was the wrong kind of pained\nlook. He could tell she was doing more than repeating the facts, but he had\nno idea why.\nShe said, “You and me, Amzîn. You’re the promising young talent. Let’s\ndo our best not to reprise the part where someone takes a bullet because of\nit, eh?”\nChapter 33\n~The Guile~\n40 years ago. (Age 26.)\n“This,” Lord Dariush announces, spreading his arms grandly, “is the world’s\nlast surviving Solarch!”\nHe is so proud that I almost burst into inappropriate laughter.\n“No,” I say, but with not nearly the true degree of horror I feel. I infuse\nmy disbelief more with ‘No, really? How’d you manage that, you brilliant\nman?’ than ‘No, no, it’s not.’\n“Oh yes!” he says. He is delighted.\n“This?” I allow myself, for anyone would have doubts, not just anyone\nwith a brain.\nAnd here, moments ago, I had hoped for this man’s daughter to breed in\nsome emotional brilliance to the Guile family line.

You’ll see.”\nI’m never going to want to look at another painting in my life.\nBut, dutifully, I lean close and pretend to be enrapt.\nI didn’t come to Atash for art appreciation—unless one wishes to call\nenjoying the nude figure of this man’s daughter ‘art appreciation.’\nAlas, there’s not only been none of that, but I’ve barely even seen the\nwoman I’ve come to woo and wed.\nIn a full week, I’ve seen more of her sister, Ninharissi, than I have of\nher, and when I have seen Felia, it’s been at dinners—where I wasn’t even\nseated next to her.\nMy pique is nearing the level of rage.\nI’ve figured out why he’s kept me from her now—it’s all part of his\nmaneuvering for these barbaric bride-price negotiations these savages\npractice—but it still rankles me.\n“Speaking of definitions of words,” he says, “how did your parents come\nto bestow such a name on you?”\n“You’ve been wanting to ask that for days, haven’t you?” I ask, as if\namused.\nI’m not. I think I’m coming to hate this man. I turn briefly away from\nthe painting. Honestly, I’ve not caught even two details about it, I’m so\nfocused on not letting my rage bleed through.\nI shall need to take a break from drafting red, I think.

It means Judge Bright (or\nLight) Who Possesses Much Good (or Many Goods). ‘Judge’ placed first to\nhearken back to when petty kings (called ‘judges’ here) had ruled Atash.\nJudging—literally ‘bringing justice’—was what Atashians understood as\nsole reason to have kings. It’s something they’re still quite proud of,\ncenturies after the fact, believing it denoted some deep truth about their\nnational character: here rulers were established in order to serve the people.\nFunny how that didn’t last. Denying reality only works as long as\nenough powerful people see a benefit in playing along.\nSo Lord Dariush—his name was usually shortened from Dârayavahush\n—had a name that meant the Rich, Smart, Good, and Perceptive (or Able to\nSee through the Surface of Things to the Truth) Bringer of Justice.\nI’m sure the other children had no problems with a boy named that.\nHere I’d been angry at my mother that my name so easily devolved into the\nsarcastic ‘Handy Andy’ after a sudden growth spurt out of my youthful\nrotundity had left me clumsy—a good trade, I’ll grant. Clumsiness can pass,\nfat is forever. ‘Randy Andy’ came after my first failed attempt at wooing a\ngirl. (Quoting ancient Parian poetry, spoken of in my beloved books as\nbeing such a strong aphrodisiac that many kings had banned it, was not, as\nit turned out, appreciated by the puzzled thirteen-year-old target of my\naffections, neither in the original language nor in the best translation I could\nfind.) ‘Glossy Rossy’ came during the same lovely oleofacurating pubertal\nyears, and ‘At-a-loss Andross’ was from my first fight at age fourteen, when\na lout called me Fart Eater and I’d asked what ‘Fart Eater’ even meant.\nIt would not be the last time the human race disappointed me. I’d\nlearned then that reflecting the vacuity of the congenitally un-self-aware\nback to themselves will not inspire a philosophical awakening.\nAs it turns out, ‘Do you see how stupid that is?’ is a question you can\nonly ask an intelligent person. Or more precisely, an intelligent person who\nis acting, saying, or believing something stupid. Thus, either one who is\nintelligent but not brilliant, or one who is young or uneducated or\nunequipped with formal logical apparatus.\nI was indeed at a loss in that fight: lost in thought, thinking these things.\nThen, coming to strategic grips with my intellectual discovery and\nrealizing that the present situation called for a different type of solution\naltogether, I punched the lout across the nose.\nThen I sat on his chest, grabbed a handful of his hair in my left hand,\nand said, ‘That’s Right-Cross Andross to you.’\nThen I’d demonstrated my right cross again, careful to hold his head\ntight so it didn’t rebound off the cobblestones. I wanted to teach him and his\nfriends a lesson, not kill him.\nI’d been so disappointed that ‘Right-Cross Andross’ hadn’t caught on.\n‘Cross Ross’ had."

That still stung—the failure, not the sophomoric onomatopoeia.\nYou know, on second thought, best not to remember the teen years.\nThe Guile memory is not always a gift.\nFortunately, though far-ranging, my mnemonic vacation has been brief.\nNor is Lord Dariush one to hurry. And I had the good sense to drift while\nfacing his little painting.\nOn actually studying it, I now wish I’d begun with my examination first\nand let my mind wander later.\nBarely a foot square, the painting is prominently displayed where one\nmust view it on the way to the solarium gallery’s exit. The technique and\ncolors and sensitivity are exquisite, and the style so idiosyncratic that one\nmight see any painting by this master and know it to be his, regardless of\nthe subject.\nBut the subject.\nWhat in Orholam’s lowest hell?\n“What… is… this?” I can’t help but ask.\n“Some say that Solarch was a Mirror, and this is meant to be art for a\nCard, though I’ve seen no corroborating evidence of that.”\nI don’t think that can be true. This is merely genius. As tragically\nmisplaced and misapplied as it is undeniably, bafflingly superior.\nThis is a painting that would cause contemporary critics to scoff, his\npatron to grumble, and his competitors to throw down their brushes in\nagony and vexation.\nBreathed by the greatest wordsmith ever to turn a phrase, this is a\npoem… about a bowel movement. This is the greatest composer of all time\nmaking fart jokes instead of penning concertos.\n“It’s… cute?” I say.\nI can’t take my eyes off it. The more I look, the more baffled I am.\n“Cute, yes,” Lord Dariush says. “Fat and rather adorable, isn’t it?”\nThe abuse of talent is so outrageous, I can’t help wondering if it’s\npurposeful—perhaps Gollaïr, so certain that his own talents were being\noutstripped, had commissioned this piece simply to waste a few of\nSolarch’s days on earth.\nSome great painters can dash off a masterpiece in a day. Other styles\nrequire a year or more. This has the hallmarks of the latter. The paint so\nthick it gives a depth to the image, the colors balanced not only against each\nother, but also within the image so as to guide the eye from one pleasing\nline to the next.\nIt is a lovely travesty.\nIt is as if the fastest racer entered the great hippodrome of Aslal for the\nfinal laps of the mountains-to-sea race that caps the novennial Philocteian\nGames, and as every tribe in Paria cheered, he started skipping, backward,\neven as the other runners caught him up and passed him by to take the\nlaurel crown.\nOne might skip quickly, even backward. Such speed might astound, in\nits own witless way, but… why?\nWhat a shame."

If he’s actively\ndelusional, I’ll have to leave, regardless. We’ve enough madness already in\nthe Guile family line without me breeding more into it by marrying his\ndaughter.\nLord Dariush is engrossed in his viewing. “Dragons are vulnerable in\ntheir youth, but then they spring up seemingly all at once, terrifying in their\nmight. Cuddly, though, huh? Little round belly and all!”\nHe chuckles, then tears his eyes away from what is clearly his favorite\npossession of everything he’s shown me in the last week.\n“What?” he asks suddenly, “Oh, a real animal? Oh, no. I mean, not to\nmy knowledge. Maybe in the mists of time? But no, it’s uh, it’s uh, merely\nan important bit of our highland mythology. You see… hmmph. Do you\nknow anything about scale-bearers? You know, serpents, lizards, geckos,\nthe color-changers—some call them ‘reptiles’ now?”\n“General knowledge,” I say. “I’ve certainly seen snakes and\nsalamanders, of course, but nothing specialized.”\n“Well, the sub-reds of Atash have studied them for centuries. Find them\nquite fascinating. They classify them as exotherms, whereas you and I and\nmost animals are endotherms. We make heat internally; reptiles absorb it\nfrom their surroundings. If you believe heat to be a species of light, then\nanimals who absorb it rather than give it off are rather suspect indeed. They\nare like little pits of darkness, light-devourers. Some say this is why men\nhave always hated snakes.” He waves it away. “But that’s neither here nor\nthere. My highland ancestors knew about exotherms and endotherms, and\nit’s a factor in the tale.”\n“Go on,” I say. Now I’m actually interested. A little.\n“We humans, we’re social. Sometimes we’re scolding squirrels, or\nmonkeys shrieking and flinging excrement. At better times, loyal dogs or\nwolves hunting together to take down prey that none of us could face alone.\nLike other endotherms, we care about our pack, in our cases the family, the\ntribe, the satrapy, even the empire. We care deeply about our position within\nthose groups. We are zoon politikon, social animals. There’s great strength\nin this, of course. A man alone in the wilderness will have trouble even\nsurviving. We care for our sick, our elderly, and our children. But there’s\nwaste and danger to living in society, too.

Today, in one, a man is\nmocked for darkening his eyebrows with kohl. Across the river, his twin is\nconsidered brutish for not doing so. The former is considered barbaric for\ngrowing his beard, the latter childish because he lacks one. We go along\nwith things that make no sense. This year our cloaks are worn so short they\nno longer keep us warm. Next year they’ll be so long they’ll make it\nimpossible to run.\n“Reptiles stand at the antipodes from this. They care nothing for what\ntheir sisters love or their fathers hate. They seek out company only when it’s\ntime to mate. There are some few men and women like this, of course, the\nbroken ones, those born soulless, who possess neither empathy nor plans,\nnor can even be taught to feel much beyond their immediate fear, hunger, or\nlust. But most of us aren’t like that at all.”\nLord Dariush gestures to the painting. “See the fur? In our stories, the\ndragon is the wisest of all created beasts, for he has a dual nature: neither\nthe blindnesses of the cold-blooded nor the weaknesses of the warm. Thus,\nwe highlanders seek to emulate our ‘dragon.’ We discern when it is time to\nbe a monkey of the tribe, and when it is time to be the cold lone serpent. Or\nwhichsoever animals you will, given a particular circumstance.”\n“How do you know when to be which?” I ask. “Does the monkey in you\nget to decide, or the snake?”\nLord Dariush gives me a long appraisal. “You see the crux of the\nquestion. Quickly, too.”\nWas there, then, no answer? Or was it a stupid ‘We muddle through as\nbest we can, with our shitty metaphors and backward culture’?\nLord Dariush waits a moment longer, then he says, “Intriguing. You see\nthe crux of the matter, but not the heart of it. You are so very, very fast to\nsee the weakness in a system, but slow to go further to seek a charitable\ninterpretation for it.”\nThat stings. “Was this a test I’ve just failed?” Bugger your art, old man.\n“Yes to the failure. No to the test. Tests are designed. This was\ninadvertent. Another slippage of your mask, I think.”\n“Putting one’s best foot forward is hardly the same—”\nAnother slippage?\nDariush interrupts. “Hold that thought. I know you won’t forget it. Back\nto the dragon, if you would, and my silly, backward tales.”\n“I never—!” I protest.\n“No. You didn’t. I withdraw that last.” Dariush clears his throat. “The\npart that decides which nature to indulge or to express, the weak faculty that\nstands at the fulcrum between the dog and the serpent?

I’m not sure if it’s because it’s the most accurate way to\nthink of this or merely the most charitable, but I do have ‘cooler’ blood in\nmy own veins than most men do.\nBy this account, that doesn’t condemn me as ‘reptilian.’ It makes me a\nbit of a dragon.\nMuch better. Much.\nLord Dariush goes on, though, musing now. “Sadly, the part of the myth\nthat suggests that the whole of it is unreliable and infected by the old\nlegends from the rest of the satrapies is that one day, they say, naturally, our\nDragon, our very own Bringer of Fire will come.”\n“Bringer of Fire?” I ask. “Not the Bringer of Light?”\n“It’s a very clear distinction in our old tongue. But yes, clearly, that’s the\nidea it parallels, to the point that it’s become associated and confabulated\nand subsumed within the Lightbringer myths, like two lines of smoke from\nadjacent campfires, driven together by the winds of the Seven Satrapies’\nshared history.” He sighs. “It’s a very seductive idea, though, isn’t it?”\n“What’s that?”\n“A Lightbringer coming. Or a Bringer of Fire. A Luíseach. That your\npeople’s ideal man or woman, whether warrior or trickster or hero of\nwhatever stripe you value most, will come and kick everyone else’s asses?”\nHe grinned as if to say, ‘Humans, huh?’\n“He comes just in time to save the highlands, I suppose,” I ask, “like the\nLightbringer and the Luíseach respectively? The mythoi really are catholic,\naren’t they?”\nHe shakes his head. “No to the ‘saving.’ This is where things get\ninteresting to me, because that’s different here. The Dragon won’t come in\ntime to save us. He’ll be too late. He comes only to adjudge and avenge. So\nthough our prophesied figure could actually be the same man as the\nLightbringer, to us it won’t matter. Thus when we highland Atashians toast\neach other in seasons of danger, we say, ‘Here’s to not living in the time of\nthe Dragon.’”\nSeeking to counter his earlier impression of my lack of charity, I try\nsome light flattery: “I guess when you know your hero isn’t going to come\nin time to save you, it does encourage self-reliance.” The highlanders are\nwell-known for their prickly, stupidly independent spirit.\n‘Self-reliance’ is the kindest way I can think of to put it.\n“That’s how we like it,” he says. Defensively.\nI was trying to be nice.\n“A people with calluses, indeed,” I say, expecting him to finish the old\ntruism.\nFelia shares her father’s love for translation and history, so from her\nletters I know it’s ‘a people with calluses.’ There was a famous sloppy old\ntranslation (famous among that oh-so-wide circle of Atashian historical"

A more faithful translation—‘a\npeople with calluses, unified, rejoicing in the soil’—implies instead a\npeople near to their work and to the land, who loved their labors and\nabhorred class distinctions. It’s far more flattering.\nBut if I’d hoped to score any points with the reference, I’m\ndisappointed. He misses it.\nHe says, “The gentlest people I know have callused hands. Would that I\nhad more on my own. But I know no people more full of joy or love than\nmine are.”\nI try to clarify, but he offers no opening, saying, “I attribute that joy and\nlove at least partly to this: When you know that when the end comes, it will\ngo poorly for your people, it encourages you to suck the marrow from the\nbones of life. Where other nations pile coin and stare greedily at what others\nhold, we long for the treasure of time and spend it as others spend gold. We\nsing and dance and play. We embrace and make love each day. We wrestle\nand we sport and we ride. Our children learn to hunt and mend, and to fight\nso they may have hearts of courage at the end, and might.”\nThe regular cadence of that tells me it likely comes from something else\nAtashian and probably renowned, but my studies haven’t been so deep.\nPerhaps it’s another test I’ve failed.\nIf so, it’s an excuse for rejecting all suitors, not a test. Surely no one else\ncould do better than I. Maybe no father wants to make it easy on a suitor.\nI see now I was arrogant, though, too soon to believe that this man\nwho’d amassed one of the largest treasures in the Seven Satrapies would be\na fool. A bumpkin perhaps, perhaps a man somewhat dulled from the keen\nsharpness of his prime, but not a fool. And if he wishes to reject my\ncourtship in order to slake his pride, he is well on his way.\n“You said we need to get back for the fire dancers?” I prompt, giving up\non the painting, and so much more besides. Why is Felia even allowing\nthis? Subjecting me to a week of this horseshit? Is she that weak, or is she\nsimply not interested in my bid for her hand? It seems she isn’t who she\npretended to be in her letters at all. I expected more of her than this, else I’d\nnot have wasted my time.\nGrumpily, he says only, “Indeed. Ninharissi will be waiting for us.” He\nsets off with long strides, not looking to see if I’m following.\nNinharissi, not Felia. Again.\nI go after him, but I can’t help but give one last look to the fat, round\nlittle dragonling hunched happily in a hairy, soft-scaled ball that is Oh So\nImportant to these people."

What a strange, primitive people.\nIf nothing changes my mind tonight, I’ll leave tomorrow. I can’t stand\nthis family, their food, their idiot stories, their queer music, this rubbish\nthey call art.\nLo, ye mortals! Behold the mighty Dragon!\nDragon, my ass. It’s risible. It doesn’t look anything like a dragon. It\ndoesn’t look like a monkey-lizard or scorpion-dog or anything else\n‘formidable.’ The ridiculous little fatty looks like a turtle-bear.\nChapter 34\n“It started up here,” Ben-hadad said as all of the Mighty followed him out\nonto the rooftop garden dominated by the massive white oak heart tree. He\ngestured to the tree. “Tell me, what do trees need?”\n“Can’t you just tell us your big discovery?” Winsen asked.\n“No, no, look, this is not me being brilliant—this time, I mean. Just play\nalong. What do trees need?” Ben asked.\n“Soil,” Ferkudi said. “Hard to grow trees in the air.”\nBen opened his mouth, closed it, then allowed, “Yes. Yes, I suppose\nthat’s true. But what else do they need?”\n“Air?” Tisis asked.\n“Well, sure, that too.”\n“Water?” Big Leo asked.\n“Enough! Light! Trees need light. They need leaves. They need leaves to\nget the light, to grow, to survive, right?”\nEveryone shrugged or nodded noncommittally.\nBen-hadad was clearly frustrated that they weren’t the least intrigued.\n“Fine. Look at the tree. Look at where the branches are. More importantly,\nlook at where they aren’t.”\nKip and Tisis were the only ones who appeared to be seriously trying to\nfollow him.\nThe others seemed to be enjoying tormenting him a little. Ben’s intellect\nwas a wonderful addition to the team, but his arrogance about it—even if it\nwas earned—sometimes piqued resentment.\n“Not even you, commander?” Ben asked.\nCruxer was standing with arms folded, patiently waiting for the\npunchline. “You’re the resident genius, Ben. I’m sure you’re going to give\nus something worthwhile, but there’s really no need for me to duplicate\nyour work, is there? So speed it up, huh? I’ve got nunks who need training.”\n“The branches grow naturally,” Kip said, “but the smaller branches and\nleaves are only allowed in certain quadrants. By design, surely. A trade-off\nbetween not blocking the mirror’s signals and allowing the tree to get\nenough light to stay alive, right?”\n“Almost!” Ben-hadad said. “I mean, yes, as far as it goes. See here?” He\npointed to a plaque mounted on a rock near the trunk. “I can’t read the\nwords, but I was able to figure out that these symbols are numbers. They’re\ncoordinates, and once I realized that, I was able to take a known—the Great\nMirror at Ru, actually, and—”\nCruxer cleared his throat.\n“Right,” Ben-hadad said. “Not important.

But it was pretty ingenious\nhow I—”\n“I’m sure it was,” Kip said quickly.\nBen-hadad got the point. Kip could see him mentally skipping ahead,\nwith some reluctance.\n“Anyway, these coordinates are ancient cities: and the leaves on this tree\ndon’t grow in the line of sight between them! These smaller numbers are\ntowns and lookouts within Blood Forest. So by cross-referencing, we can\nfind those places now. Maybe some have mirrors still. We can build our\nscouting web.”\n“That is great news,” Kip said. But it doesn’t really merit gathering all\nthe Mighty, does it? “Great work.”\n“That’s it?” Winsen asked, unimpressed.\n“That’s not enough?” Ben-hadad asked. He looked from face to face.\n“I hate to side with Winsen on anything,” Tisis said, throwing him a\nwink. He beamed. Oddly, he’d started becoming a big fan of Tisis recently,\nand she’d decided to cement that, if only because he was such an asshole if\nhe didn’t like you. She went on—“But I kind of expected more of a man of\nyour towering intellect, Ben-hadad.”\nKip looked at her. Siding with Winsen but then still giving a backhanded\ncompliment to his perennial antagonist? Nicely done!\n“And you’d be right to do so,” Ben-hadad said triumphantly. “Because I\ncalculated the angles the mirror would have to move to in order to send or\nreceive signals from every one of these coordinates.”\n“When did you do this?” Cruxer asked.\n“While Kip was chatting with the Keeper and we were all just standing\naround.”\nHe’d done all this… in his head. Holy shit, Ben. If I get you killed, all of\nhistory is gonna hate me.\n“Almost there,” Ben-hadad said. “None of these coordinates require an\nangle of less than minus five degrees. Look at where the leaves aren’t!”\n“Huh?” Big Leo asked. “I’m still kind of reeling from all the trap stuff\nBreaker just told us. Can you pretend I’m dumber than you know I really\nam?”\nFerkudi said, “He means the mirror can point down. The tree has been\ngrown specifically so the mirror can aim much lower than that.”\nKip cracked his neck to one side, thinking. “But the tree’s ancient. What\nif this is just an accident of its growth? Like, they had to prune it or\nwhatever, and because of that some branches grew lower because they cut\noff all the higher branches?”\n“I thought about that, and by—well, it doesn’t matter how—I figured out\nit wasn’t that. Any of you see the empty iron frames on Greenwall?” Ben-\nhadad asked.\n“To hold burning pitch or whatever?” Kip asked.\n“I sent servants looking in the old storerooms, and do you know what\nthey found?”\n“I know you’re going to tell us,” Cruxer said sternly. “And quickly.”\n“Mirrors,” Ben-hadad said. “The Great Mirror can aim down, but in\neach sector there are branches growing that, if you pointed the mirror down,"

Those branches would cast big shadows.”\n“Okay…” Ferkudi said.\n“The mirrors on the wall are mounted precisely so they can reflect the\nGreat Mirror’s light into those places that would otherwise be in shadow.\nGuys, every ancient city that could afford one built a Great Mirror. The\nscholars have always thought it was pure cultural dick-waving, you know,\nlook how rich and important we are. Now we know they enabled\ncommunication—eventually—but not everyone would’ve had chi drafters.\nThey’ve always been rare, and short-lived, and the ancient cities were\nhostile to drafters not of their kingdom’s color. Yet they insisted on building\nthe Greater and the Lesser Mirrors. Here, with the filters I found, you can\npoint a beam of any color light you wish, anywhere, even right at the base\nof your own wall. Why?”\n“To power your drafters in a battle?” Kip asked.\n“Definitely… but for both religious and cultural reasons, the ancients in\nthis city would have only had green drafters. They were at war with\neveryone else. So why have other color filters?”\nNo one answered.\nCruxer rubbed the bridge of his nose. “This is the short version, right?”\n“Yes,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Then, what’s the answer?”\n“I don’t know,” Ben said.\nThey groaned.\n“You’re killin’ us here, Ben,” Big Leo said.\n“No, no, no,” Ben said. “Wait. I don’t know… but I have some guesses. I\nknow how engineers think and how they build—even over the centuries, we\nall have the same kind of minds. This Great Mirror can be moved quickly.\nYou don’t need to do that for messages—but you do in a battle. I’m certain\nthat the Great Mirrors are defensive. They’re artillery. I think the filters are\nfor fighting wights. I don’t know, but maybe if you shoot a huge beam of a\ncomplementary color at wights, it messes with their drafting or their minds?\nWhat does Orholam’s Glare do? It overwhelms and then destroys a drafter\nor wight by giving them too much light. Now, if you had enough mirrors,\nall working together, say, under the direction of a full-spectrum\npolychrome, I bet you could negate the effect of even a bane.”\n“What are you…” Kip started.\n“The ancients weren’t stupid,” Ben-hadad said. “But the Chromeria has\nbeen, in wiping out as much of the knowledge about the old gods as they\ncould. The ancients would have known all about the bane. They would’ve\nknown they were vulnerable to them—and they would’ve guarded against\nit. The Thousand Stars all over Big and Little Jasper? The Great Mirrors in\nthe Chromeria’s towers? They weren’t meant just to give drafters a few\nextra minutes of light every day.

He felt his face flushing.\n“Breaker,” Ben-hadad said, “Kip. They need the Lightbringer.”\n“I’ve never—I’ve never said I’m that,” Kip said. It was like they were\ntrying to foist an enormous burden onto his shoulders.\n“It would explain the biggest conundrum of all,” Cruxer said.\n“What’s that?” Ben asked.\n“It’d explain why the White King has done so much to keep Breaker\nhere.”\n“No,” Kip said. He wasn’t sure which part he was denying. “Anyway,\nthe other reasons for him tying me up here are plenty.”\n“No, it makes sense,” Big Leo said. “He’s afraid of you.”\n“No, this is ridiculous. You guys, we’ve talked about this!” Kip said.\n“I’m not…” He lowered his voice, though they appeared to be completely\nalone up here.\n“Wait, wait. What if—what if—forget all the extra stuff,” Ben-hadad\nsaid. “All the religious garbage. All the myths and prophecies. Let ’em go.\nThe core of what made Lucidonius Lucidonius was that he gave people\nlight. He was the light-giver. Yeah, there was all the religious stuff he did\nand how he became a conqueror, but how did he give people light? He was\na lens crafter. He discovered how to make colored lenses, and that\ntechnological leap changed drafters’ lives forever. What if the Lightbringer\nis just as simple: you bring light. You physically bring light at the moment\nthe Seven Satrapies need it most. What if that’s it?”\n“The Lightbringer’s a lot more than that,” Cruxer said.\n“Shut up with that right now,” Ben-hadad said. “Uh, with all due\nrespect, commander.” He turned. “Breaker, let other people call you\nwhatever they want. You can figure out how to counteract the bane. You can\nsend colored light to every corner of the Jaspers as quickly and precisely as\na battle demands.”\n“What if it doesn’t work that way? What if counteracting the bane isn’t\njust a matter of directing the mirrors?”\n“You’d figure it out,” Ferkudi said, as if it were that simple.\nThey all nodded.\n“And that’s a monumental amount of drafting, even if I could figure it\nout.”\n“So we make you Prism first,” Winsen said.\nKip threw his hands up. Oh, like that’s no big deal. But a phrase rattled\naround inside of his head: ‘You won’t be the next Prism,’ Janus Borig had\nsaid.\n“Breaker, focus on the problem, not the title,” Ben-hadad said. “It’s our\nbest chance—not just to save the Chromeria but to stop the White King\nonce and for all, to save the empire, and Blood Forest, and hundreds of"

Here’s where it ends.\nShe couldn’t see anything. She’d thought that might make it easier—if\nshe didn’t see his eyes go paryl-black to tell her that her death was coming.\nIt didn’t.\n“Ben-Kaleb,” he said. “Ben-Zoheth! Dammit! Is that what she meant?\nGoddam soothsayers. The hell can’t they talk straight? I should’a made it\nhurt.”\nWhat?\nHe cursed some more, and she could hear his footfalls as he paced.\n“I want you to know this,” he said, getting right in her face. “You ain’t\ngood, and us bad. Your Chromeria’s as bad as we are. Near enough\nanyway.”\n“So I don’t get to choose between good and bad?”\n“Choose, yeah. I didn’t get to choose, anyway.” He started mumbling.\n“Separation, that’s it. That’s what separates me.” He cursed the Chromeria\nthen.\nBut Teia had a sudden revelation. She was an idiot. How had she not\nthought of this before?\nWell, I’ve never been blindfolded since becoming proficient with paryl.\nParyl could be cast through clothes. It could be sent out through flesh. If\nit could go out, surely it come in.\nThere was no reason she couldn’t gather paryl through a blindfold and\nher closed eyelids.\nHalf to keep him talking, she said deadpan, “I’m stunned. All this time\nI’ve been so sure of our righteousness as I was murdering innocents. But…\nbut maybe there’s some subtlety to this that, uh, you could explain?”\n“Maybe so,” he growled. He was puzzled. He wasn’t good at detecting\nsarcasm.\nWhich was probably much better for her continued health. But she\ncouldn’t stop herself.\nDammit, T! Are you trying to get yourself killed?\nHer eyes relaxed to sub-red, and then those odd drafter’s muscles pried\nthem wider, wider. And there it was, sweet tenebrous paryl. A bare hint of it,\nthough, between being indoors and the fact that whatever bounced around\nhere wasn’t focused.\nThe first wash of it slid into her, down her gullet like brandy going down\nhot.\nShe tilted her head, blackly amused, a hint of condescending amusement"

He’d\nsnatched something up from the table, and—skritch—something smashed\ninto her face.\nHer head felt like her skull had become a gambler’s dice cup with a\nfurious loser rattling her brain around, hoping by rage alone he might shake\ngood luck out from bad.\nShe couldn’t move, couldn’t think. There was a thought, a plan that was\ntrying to form. Blood filled her mouth. Her left dogtooth had smashed\nthrough her lip, and she felt a surge of terror.

He pushed back,\nbanging her head against the wall, tearing hair from her scalp.\nHe shoved whatever he’d hit her with between her bloody teeth. It was\nleather and parchment? Oh, the pages he’d stolen from Marissia, bound in a\nfolio.\n“You take this,” he said. “You take it and read it, and you decide if what\nthey’ve done counts as ‘not great.’ You decide if all the blood on their hands\ndemands vengeance.”\nBound, helpless, bleeding, and having trouble focusing, with a butcher\nholding a fistful of her hair, Teia suddenly felt what she least expected:\nHope, is that you? Hey! Been a while! Don’t make yourself such a\nstranger.\nShe made to speak, letting out a small grunt, but there was still the folio\nwedged between her teeth.

Lost, like a ratweed addict suffering withdrawals who\ncatches a whiff of that poison he calls his love and salvation.\nMurder Sharp never so much as glanced at her eyes.

I’m\nreckless as all hell—knowing this might mean my death if I fail, and I\nfigure out she’d gone to the harbor. I got that feeling in my gut the whole\ntime I’m running there—and I get there in time to see her ship disappear on\nthe horizon. I ask where the boat’s going. I ask for other boats going the\nsame way, though I have no way to pay for passage. It turns out her rich\ndaddy’s boat is one of the fastest around, and no one knows where it’s\nheaded anyway. I ask if there’s a boat heading for her home port, because I\nknow I’m in it deep. I’m willing to gamble going to the wrong port on the\nbare chance I can fix it. But there isn’t. Not for a week. And I know the Old\nMan won’t let me live that long if I don’t meet him when I’d said.”\nHoly hells, Teia thought.\n“No matter how I practiced it in my head, it all sounded like a lame\nexcuse, an unforgivable failure. The Old Man’s not a fool. He doesn’t\nexpect perfection. He tolerates failure from those valuable to him. But this?\nA rich woman allowed to escape, when the Old Man was already\nsuspicious? I’d look untrustworthy. And that he doesn’t tolerate. So it was\nlife-or-death. Do you know I didn’t really have good teeth beforehand?\nDidn’t even think about my smile. Didn’t take care of myself. I’d probably\nnot choose to keep a single one of those teeth now. Not like you. Very\nfortunate, you are.”\nShe did not want to hear him rhapsodize about her teeth, not right now.\nNot ever. “That’s… that’s not the story you told in the Mirror Room,” Teia\nsaid.\n“Well, all that was a lie. I was trying to scare you into not getting\ndistracted or greedy when you’re on a job. The real problem with taking a\nbribe is that every delay gives your target more chances to get away or be\nsaved. Don’t do that.”\nPlease stay utterly un-self-aware, Teia thought. “So, how am I supposed\nto know that this story is true this time?” she asked, trying to change the\nsubject.\n“Does it look like I’m trying to amuse anyone?”\n“So that’s why you broke all your own teeth? Because you were afraid\nthe Old Man would think you’d taken a payoff to let that girl go?”\nToo late, as he sucked air through his perfect dentures, she realized she\nshouldn’t have said he was afraid. How could you call a man a coward who\nhad shattered all his own teeth in order to live?\n“I’m sorry—”\n“Point is,” Murder Sharp cut her off angrily, “I never had a choice. Not\nfrom the moment I was born with a paryl talent I didn’t ask for. Elijah ben-\nKaleb didn’t have a choice who I would kill for the Chromeria, and Murder\nSharp didn’t have a choice who to kill for the Order. They’re just the\nfuckin’ same."

Couldn’t figure that out. ‘Son of\nSeparation.’ Maybe this is how I separate myself from them.”\nHe looked up at Teia with sudden resolve. “That’s why I ain’t killed you\nyet. Not fondness. Not weakness, for sure. You’re gonna be my proof. I’m\nbetter than them. Better than your master, better than mine. Better than\nOrholam Himself, if He’s up there, who didn’t give me one choice since He\ncursed me with a talent for paryl. I, Elijah ben-Zoheth, am the god who\nholds you in his hand. I will give you the choice no one ever gave me. You\nread this folio, and you make your choice. Join us for real, or fight me, or\nrun.\n“You join the Order for real, and I’ll never let ’em know you were a spy\nfrom the get-go. Or you can run. As long as you leave a trail so it’s clear\nthat you’re running far away, the Order doesn’t have anyone to spare right\nnow to send after you. Or if they send me, now or later, I won’t find you, on\nmy honor. Or, if you’re just that damned stubborn and stupid, and you want\nto fight…” He paused.\nHe sucked spit through his teeth a few times.\n“Tell you what, I’ll be as, uh, what-you-call-it? fair? sporting? generous?\nas I wish they would’ve been to me. You choose to fight, I won’t tell them\neven then, unless you blow your own cover. You aren’t supposed to be on\nthe Jaspers at all. I haven’t reported you—and I won’t. But if you side with\nthe Chromeria, I’ll hunt you down myself, and I’ll kill you. No mercy, no\nsecond chances. So I guess you’ll have to try to kill me first. It can be a\nlittle hunt. That could be fun. We’ll getta see who’s best. Maybe I’ll have a\nreal challenge for once.\n“So you choose. You want to join the Order for real, you show up at the\nGreat Fountain tomorrow at noon. If you want to run, you best be on a boat\noff the Jaspers by then. If you want to fight me, uh… hmm… don’t do\neither of those, I guess? Because if you’re not at the Great Fountain at noon,\nthe next time I see you, you die.”\n“I understand,” Teia said.\nHe loosed her bonds, and she rubbed feeling back into her limbs.\n“Eyes,” he said.\nShe made sure he could see her eyes weren’t flared to paryl.\n“Now, go,” he said, handing her the folio. “You have some reading to\ndo.”\nTeia took it carefully.\n“No, wait,” Sharp said suddenly. “Uh, if you run, I can’t risk you using\none of your old codes in the note, so just address it to your handler and, you"

Nothing else. No secret ink or codes or any\nof that. I’m ready to give you your life, but I don’t need you endangering\nmine. So just leave that in your old bunk, under the pillow.”\nWhere Sharp would look at it, of course.\n“That would give you their name. I’d be betraying my handler.” Unless I\nput someone else’s name on it?\nDammit, I could have put that asshole Grinwoody’s name on the note,\nand the Order would have killed him. Granted, shoving an innocent into the\npath of an arrow in flight like that wasn’t exactly how a Blackguard was\nsupposed to protect her ward, but between Karris and Grinwoody?\nGrinwoody could burn.\nShit. Teia’d thought too slow.\n“Besides,” Teia said. “If I leave anything without the right codes, my\nhandler will know the Order got to me. Or some random innocent might\ntake it.”\nActually, that last wouldn’t be a problem for Sharp. He didn’t care that\nthe message got through; he only cared to see the name on it.\nAgain, she wasn’t thinking fast enough.\nBut he did look confused.\nSharp cursed. “True, true. Uh…”\nTeia realized then that he really was at a loss. It wasn’t a trap, or a\ndevious plot by the Old Man to confirm her handler was Karris—whom he\nwould surely have suspected.\n“Just the words ‘I’m sorry’?” Teia asked. “Then if someone does pass it\non to my handler, they might be expected to recognize my handwriting, but\nno one’s going to learn anything else from it, and if you see it, you’ll know\nthat I’m really—”\n“No,” he said. “You’d leave that note to try to trick me, even if you\nplanned to fight me. Sorry, nope. That’s the price. Do it my way if you want\nto run. Name probably won’t be a surprise to the Old Man anyway.\nProbably will know who you’re working for immediately as soon as that\nwhite boat gets back and you’re not on it.”\nShit! Sharp had gotten to the right solution through animal cunning\ninstead of intelligence.\nOr at least the wrong solution for Teia. If she put a name on that letter,\nshe had to be willing for that person or anyone else who mistakenly touched\nthe letter to die. If one of her Blackguard friends—Gill Greyling maybe?\nEssel?—tidied her bunk, they might find the note. Surely the Order would\nkill them, just in case they were a contact. Or it could be one of the slaves\nwho tidied the floor. Even if she put that snake Andross’s name on it,\nmurdering him might be exactly the wrong thing for the Chromeria and the\nwar.\nAnd she sure as hell wasn’t going to betray Karris.

He was a stupid\nman, but Teia wasn’t much smarter, was she? She hadn’t even thought fast\nenough to outsmart a moron.\nKip would’ve.\n“Oh,” Sharp said, like it was an afterthought, but there was a cruel edge\nto it, and Teia realized that what was coming was a trap. Sharp’s cunning\nwasn’t the kind that thought of every avenue for every plan; it was the kind\nthat sought out chinks in the armor, like paryl slipping through the skin to\nyour heart. “You’ve deceived us before. So if you choose to join the Order,\nyou’ll need to do something this time to convince me that you’re serious.\nBecause that’s the first thing a spy would lie about, right? You already lied\nto join us, so you’d just do it again, right? So I’ll need some proof. By your\nactions.”\nOh God.\nSharp said, “You’re my shitty tin mirror, so let’s give you a test, don’t\nyou think? Just like I had.”\nShe could tell he loved the dread he’d put on her face.\n“It’d have to be something a spy would have a problem with doing,\nwouldn’t it? Killin’ some slave would be nothing to a tough, hardened little\nbitch like you, right?” he asked. “Nah, you’re way past that. And we’ll have\nto have a time pressure, so you don’t get all sneaky smart or something and\ntry to fool me. By tomorrow, then. By noon.

You have to give me more time than—”\n“You’re right,” he said, cutting her off. She shut up instantly. She wasn’t\nout of this place yet; she couldn’t afford to disrespect him.

You piece of shit.\nA glowing crescent of his white teeth seemed to illuminate the shack\nwith Sharp’s cruel glee. He said, “If you want to join the Order for real,\nprove it by bringing me a sack. Waterproof. With a head in it.”\n“What?!”\n“I don’t trust you not to just go find some corpse, so I want to see a paryl\nblood clot in the brain, and dual hemorrhages so the eyes go all blackballed.\nIt’s a bad way to go. But on the other hand, it doesn’t matter who you\nchoose. Choose whoever you like. That makes it easy.”\n“I…” Always before, Teia had been assigned whom to murder. Someone\nelse had chosen.

This would mean choosing some innocent herself.\nChoosing some stranger and killing them in a horrific way.\nHow do you choose which innocent dies?\n“Wait, wait. With your skills now, that’s not difficult or hard, is it? You’d\njust kill another slave. You’ve already shown you’re perfectly willing to do\nthat.”\n“I don’t—”\n“No, no, I’ve got an idea,” Sharp said. He nodded to himself. “Yeah,\nyeah, that’ll do it, I think. A kid. Bring me a kid’s head. You know, a little\nsquirt. Say, eight to ten years old.”\n“A—a child?” Teia asked. One summer when she was growing up,\nthere’d been someone in the city who snatched kids around her little sister’s\nage. A few of the girls were found mutilated. More simply disappeared. The\nsnatchings stopped after that horrible summer, but no one who lived\nthrough that time could ever hear about a missing child without\nremembering the horror and fear.\nNow Teia was going to be the person who snatched and mutilated a\nchild, like a bloodthirsty ghost in the night.\n“Eight to ten years old,” Sharp said. He pushed her out the door. “After\nyou read the folio, you’ll know why.”\nChapter 36\n“I suppose it should sound ungrateful to say that I was rather looking\nforward to being dead,” Orholam said.\n“You didn’t look like you were looking forward to it out there,” Gavin\nsaid, cracking one eye open. His shade had moved away from him, and it\nwas miserably hot on the beach. He could only imagine he was already on\nhis way to a fierce sunburn. And the damned sand fleas…\n“Oh, I’m terrified of dying. Being dead, though? That’s the thing.”\nOrholam was sitting cross-legged on the sand, heedless of the bugs, dirt,\nand his own nudity.\nGavin stood up slowly, his body afire with aches. He still had the\ndamned gun-sword strapped to him. Neither blade nor straps had made for\neasy rest. He began brushing off the worst of the dirt and bugs. “You’re\nright,” he said.\n“I am?” Orholam asked.\n“You do sound ungrateful.”\n“I meant to be the opposite,” Orholam said. “Thank you. I was wrong\nabout you.”\n“Well, I only did it for one reason,” Gavin said. He gestured for them to\nmove off the beach.\nOrholam stood and then started walking. “And what’s that?”\n“Lots of men claim Orholam saved them from drowning,” Gavin said.\n“But what man can say he saved Orholam from drowning?” Orholam\nsaid. He chuckled.\nGavin grunted, irritated the man had taken his punchline.\n“Guess we should both be grateful there’s an island here at all, huh? If\nthe story had been true about the isle sinking when the reef rose, we’d be\nshark supper.”\n“There’s looking on the bright side!” the old man said.\nGavin grunted again. “How bad’s my back? It cut me.”"

Need to wash it, though, if you want to live.”\nGavin examined the rest of himself for injuries. Arm had rope burn, but\nnot bad. His head ached, tongue was dry, left leg hurt, but that was just a\nlightly pulled muscle. A few calluses torn off his hands. They’d gotten soft\nin his prison.\nHis left eye pit hurt like hell. The patch had stayed on, but saltwater had\ngotten into the hole, and sand was all around it. If he got sand into the\nempty orb of his eyeball, he’d be in such agony he wouldn’t be able to\naccomplish anything.\nFantastic. Washing that was going to be just great.\nAssuming, of course, they could find clean water at all.\n“I already searched everything that washed up,” Orholam said. “Only a\nlittle luck.” He rapped on a little barrel small enough to fit under his arm.\n“Black powder? That’s enormous luck! With this musket, we can hunt!”\n“Not powder. Salt fish,” Orholam said apologetically. “Keep us for a few\ndays if we can find some water. But nothing else. Maybe more’ll wash in\nlater, but I’d say we head inland and see if we can find the pilgrims’\nwaystations. Whether they’ll hold anything useful after a few centuries is\nanother question, though.”\n“You couldn’t find anything good?” Gavin asked, looking out to the\nlagoon. Fish was great, but water was more important, and tools to hunt\nwith would’ve been the best.\nHe’d been so concerned about the beach and his own injuries that this\nwas the first time he’d looked around. They were inside the great circular\nwall of mist that made the White Mist Tower; it was utterly clear here, with\nblue sky high above. The island was large enough that it would have\nstreams if not a river, but that wall, maybe five hundred paces high, made\nGavin claustrophobic. The outside world didn’t exist here.\nHalfway through alien cloud, part of their ship was visible perched on\nthe reef crest. The stern, waist, and sails were completely gone, battered\ninto flotsam, spread throughout the lagoon with the floating dead. Only the\nforecastle survived, with The Compelling Argument pointed at a jaunty\nangle into the sky. There appeared to be a figure moving there, but it might\nhave been Gavin’s imagination.\n“Is that…?” he asked.\n“Uluch Assan. Yes,” Orholam said.\nGunner. “Hard man to kill,” Gavin said.\n“Not the only one,” Orholam said.\n“Don’t suppose there’s much we can do to help him,” Gavin said.\nThough, come to think of it, he wasn’t sure that he really wanted to help the\ncrazy pirate.\n“He’s fishing,” Orholam said, shielding his eyes against the sun.\nGavin couldn’t see that well. But he chuckled. If only he could be like\nthat madman, taking the day with equanimity, unperturbed by sea demons\nand reefs and shipwrecks and brushes with death."

What was?”\n“I told him if he didn’t want that cannon to fall into the sea, he’d have to\nkeep his feet close. I thought I meant just nearby.”\nGavin squinted and shaded his eyes. Gunner was moving, testing the\ndeck, trying to step off it for some insane reason, perhaps thinking he could\nwalk around the reef to some easier point to swim? But as soon as he lifted\nhis foot, the entire deck began to shift, the end lifting, as the weight of The\nCompelling Argument threatened to tip it into the gap in the reef. The\ncaptain had to stay on the deck counterbalancing the big gun or it would tip\ninto the sea.\nGunner sat back down on the deck railing and picked up his fishing pole\nagain.\n“Man doesn’t know it’s already lost,” Gavin said.\n“What you love isn’t lost while you still have a mind to save it,”\nOrholam said. “Sometimes.”\nHe saw them looking at him, waved, and saluted with the skin of brandy.\nHe seemed entirely unworried.\nGavin spread his arms helplessly like, ‘We can’t come save you.’\nGunner waved them off, happily. He stood on his right leg and pointed\nto his left foot, as if to show that the sharks hadn’t gotten it. As if he didn’t\nhave a care in the world.\n“Poor bastard,” Gavin said. “Why do I have the feeling he’ll outlive us\nall?”\n“Not a risky bet if we don’t find some water,” Orholam said.\nThey moved inland. It was hard to tell how large the island was from the\nbeach, with thick jungle obscuring their view. Judging from the gentle\ncurve, maybe a couple leagues across? From the size of the outside of the\nreef as they’d sailed around it, though, it could have been ten leagues\nacross.\nThey followed game trails until they came to a wide area where no trees\nwere growing, though the ground was covered with low vegetation. The\nwide area continued in a broken line inland, uphill. It didn’t look natural.\nGavin grabbed a shrub and pulled it up. The roots were only a hand’s\nbreadth deep, and below that were flat stones, interlocking.\nAn ancient road, not yet fully claimed by the jungle.\nGavin’s heart leapt in his breast. Streets meant cities. Cities meant the\npossibility of shelter and access to clean water, which his thick tongue\nwanted more than anything.\nThey walked, slowly.\nIn less than an hour, they passed the first ruins. Nothing spectacular, just\na few stone walls with no roof, all of it covered by moss and vines. But\nnearby, there was running water.\n“Orholam!” Gavin said. “Can you go ahead and prophesy whether I’m\ngoing to get sick from this?”\n“I have no idea. But I’m gonna drink.”\nAnd so they both did. They had nothing to use as a skin, so they drank\nuntil they nearly burst.

For one clumsy\nmoment, he bobbled his grip, but luckily the eye patch held in place in his\neye socket.\nThey headed on.\nWithin two hours of heading uphill, they rounded a turn and found more\nruins. Lots more.\nAmid the palm trees was an ancient, abandoned temple compound, all\nancient stone arches and broad avenues with flagstones and great mosaics\nrent asunder with scrub grasses, and towering atasifusta trees, now extinct\neverywhere else in the Seven Satrapies. This was an entire ancient city,\nempty, if not old Tyrean itself then built in the style of the old Tyrean\nEmpire, with horseshoe arches and stone carved like delicate lattices, once\npainted to look like climbing roses and ivy but now faded and chipped. The\nentire city was built around one central avenue, two blocks away from\nGavin. He made his way to that street.\nStepping into the broad, open area—an ancient market?—Gavin had an\nunobstructed view toward the center of the island for the first time.\nHis heart stopped. All day, Gavin had expected to see the famed Tower\nof Heaven at any moment, but the jungle’s canopy and the body of the\nrising mountain they’d been climbing had hidden it. Until now.\n“This… this is not what I saw,” Orholam said.\nOverwhelming all the terrestrial wonders of this lost city was a great\ntower, surely as wide as all seven towers of the Chromeria put together,\nincluding all the grounds, and much, much taller.\nPerfectly symmetrical, and bafflingly, blindingly black, the untapering\ncylinder was stabbed in the heart of the island. A crater ridge rose around it,\nas if some angry god had impaled the world here and only the black haft of\nhis spear jutted from the wound.\nNothing relieved the unearthly emptiness of that black except a thin,\npearlescent ribbon, a trail, spiraling around the outside of the great\nmegalith.\nAnd if its base would have covered half of the entire island of Little\nJasper, its height was something else entirely. It had to be taller than Ruic\nHead or any of the Red Cliffs.\nGavin said, “Orholam’s beard, pilgrims climbed that?”\nOrholam had already recovered, and he just smiled at him like a fool.\n“I have to climb that, don’t I?” Gavin asked.\n“We,” Orholam said cheerily. “We get to climb that.”\nChapter 37\nKarris twitched in her sleep. She couldn’t breathe.\nShe tried to snort. Nothing happened. No air entered her lungs.\nHer eyes flew open. The room was pitch-black. There was nothing over\nher face, but as her tongue convulsed, no air flowed in.\nShe couldn’t swallow.\nHer body was paralyzed from the neck down.\n“Shhh,” a woman said. Soothing. “Shhh.”\nThe woman stepped closer. Teia. Karris jerked at the recognition."

And rapidly, feeling returned to\nher body.\nShe gasped, then sat upright, her chest heaving.\n“I brought you something,” Teia said.\nKarris’s hair fell over her eyes, and she considered punching Teia in the\nthroat. The goddam child, strangling her?! Who did she think she was? Was\nthat paryl?\nTeia pulled out a red leather-bound folio. She flipped the leather back for\nKarris to read the title page: ‘Being the Secret History of the Chromeria:\nWritten for and by the Whites.’\nBy the Whites?\nAnd then Karris saw that there were dozens of signatures below the title.\nThe last one was Orea Pullawr’s, albeit a more florid hand than she’d had\nwhen she was young. The folio had been penned by Karris’s predecessors in\noffice. All of them.\nA note on the next page said, “Entrusted to your care on the\nunderstanding that you will add no untrue or deceptive word, nor bring the\nblack to excise any words written herein. We trust you here with the\nunvarnished history of our empire. For Orholam loves the truth, and will\nbring all things to light in time, but not all things should be known by all\npeople.”\nA sheaf of loose papers was tucked in the back. Karris flipped to them.\nThey weren’t histories, but instead names, contacts, accounts with\nbankers: all the things Orea Pullawr had wanted Karris to have, and to\nknow.\n“Where did you get this?” Karris asked. Her heart was pounding, and\nshe wasn’t sure now whether it was still from her fright or from excitement.\n“From my master, who killed its previous owner and stole it.” This was\none of the ways Teia tried to minimize the dangers of eavesdroppers: no\nnames to prick ears.\n“How did you get this away from him? Did you kill him?”\n“He gave it to me.”\n“Orholam Himself must have blinded him to its value.”\nTeia snorted and shook her head as if Karris were a hopelessly clueless\nmom and she her teenage daughter.\n“What is your problem?” Karris asked. Even her excitement about the\nfolio couldn’t erase all her pique at the girl paralyzing her.\n“Quiet!” Teia hissed. “My problem? First is that you’re gonna get me\nkilled if you can’t even remember to whisper for five fucking minutes.”\nKarris gritted her teeth. She hadn’t been that loud. Whispering now, she\nsaid, “You come and give me a gift like this, and then act like a spoiled\nchild while you do it?”\nTeia scoffed. “A child?

She wasn’t being fair.\n“Please.” She offered this last genuinely apologetically.\nTeia calmed, but still said, “I don’t have time for questions.”\nFirmly but with all the restraint she could muster, quashing the red rising\nin her at the fact the girl had used paryl on her spine—on her spine!—\nKarris said, “You have time.”\n“I am literally being hunted by their best assassin. He saw through me.\nHe said he had a previous Prism pull the same trick with him as you did\nwith me. Same big talk. Same assignment. But then he died, leaving him\ntwisting in the breeze. No one knew who he was. What he’d done for him.\nHe ended up joining them in truth. He captured me. And just let me go so he\ncould have a little hunt. A contest. See who’s really the best between us—as\nif I’ve got a chance.”\n“Orholam have mercy. How can I help?”\nTeia shook her head like Karris was being a fool. “Help? You can’t. You\ncan only make things worse.”\n“Surely I can—”\n“I need to go. You want to know everything I have on Gavin or not?”\nTeia said.\n“Of course.”\nAnd then Teia reported about the ship and their conversation and the\nimpossibility of reporting it all immediately.\nKarris could tell Teia wanted to leave more with every passing minute,\nbut she quizzed her on the Old Man of the Desert, whom she’d seen\ndisguised. “Could it be Andross Guile?” she asked finally.\nTeia shook her head. Andross had hired the Order before, and perhaps he\nwas cunning enough to pretend to be someone else while hiring his own\npeople, but no. “It was a good disguise, but there are things that are really,\nreally hard to fake. This man or woman isn’t as broad as Andross Guile is.\nYou can add padding to affect a silhouette, but moving in the same way a\nlarger person does, that’s hard. So I think this person is probably thin,\ndisguised with some padding, or maybe average with layers of jackets and\nthe fine mail that breaks up paryl, but he or she isn’t broad-chested and\nwearing all those layers, too. And the man had a presence about him, so I\ndon’t think it was a lieutenant standing in for the real Old Man. I think some\nsecrets are so big, the Old Man attends to them himself. Or herself.”\n“And they threatened me?”\n“To get… your husband to go along with them. A threat that I believe is\ncredible. They do have people here, in the ’guard, I’m sure of it.”\nKarris breathed a heavy sigh. “I didn’t think that… your masters were\ngoing to be a bigger threat than the White King.”\n“Not my masters.

I realized we were so rushed\nbefore that I didn’t tell you.” She lowered her voice. “Ironfist. He was in the\nOrder.”\n“What?!” Karris said.\n“I don’t know if he is anymore. Apparently, he joined them when he was\na kid so they’d protect his sister from their family’s enemies. And I guess\nthey did. Then with me killing her, he thinks they betrayed him. Even\nthough she was trying to murder him when I did kill her, he was… He was\nscary as hell. You ever see a man lose everything he’s given his life for, all\nat once? I hadn’t. And I’ve never known a man like him.”\nMe neither.\n“It took me a while to put it all together, but… you know, he betrayed us\nin order to save his sister. Then his sister failed and betrayed him, and his\nbrother died for us, and the people he betrayed us to then betrayed him.”\nShe got pensive, seemed to forget her urge to leave so quickly for a\nmoment. “You know, not to do your job, but if he finds out you knew I was\ngoing to assassinate his sister, and you let me…? He won’t be too happy.”\nKarris was reeling, but her first thought was horror. Oh, Ironfist, what\nhave we done to you? In every part of your life, we’ve destroyed you.\nWhat have you done to yourself? Joining the Order?\nIn ordering Teia to assassinate his sister, the Nuqaba, the Chromeria had\nbetrayed him, but he’d betrayed them first.\nWell, sort of. He hadn’t known Karris or Gavin or any of the\nBlackguards when he’d taken his vow to the Order, had he? No wonder\nhe’d held himself aloof, not just from Karris but from any woman. He’d\nknown he was a hypocrite of the greatest degree, that he might be called on\nto do reprehensible things. He’d lived with that terrible, terrible secret and\nshame.\nThen her gut sank as she realized what a new and horrible twist this put\non them potentially marrying.\nO God, protect us.\n“Yeah,” Teia said. “Sorry I didn’t get you the news earlier.”\n“No, it wouldn’t have changed anything.” Except I would have felt rage\nfirst, rather than compassion. So maybe it was for the best.\n“It’s like your best friend dying, isn’t it?” Teia said, her voice softer.\n“I’m sorry for all this, Teia. But…”\n“They’re a blight. I know. It’s gotta be done. And I’m the only one who\ncan do this. Doesn’t seem fair, but there it is. Now, sorry, but I really do\nhave to go. Can you distract your door guards?”\n“Hmm?”\n“Invisible, not incorporeal,” Teia said. “Can’t float through things, and\npeople tend to notice a door opening and closing by itself.”\n“Oh, right, right.” Karris got up and threw on a robe. “You, uh, you\nhaven’t asked for your orders.”"

The girl rubbed her cheek over her dogtooth as if it\npained her. “Orders? An arrow in flight doesn’t need orders. I’ll return to\nyou bloody or not at all.”\nShe threw her hood over her head.\nShe was going to leave without another word. Karris grabbed her by the\nwrist, wishing she could shake some sense into the girl, wishing everything\nbetween them had been different.\n“Nonetheless,” she said gently. She rummaged through her desk and\ngrabbed a paper. “Same code as usual.”\nTeia snagged it and tucked it away. Her cloak shimmered—and she was\ngone.\nKarris went and opened her door to give Teia room to get out past the\nBlackguards. “Pardon me, Essel, could you check and see if any of my\nchamber servants are awake and would bring me some kopi? I hate to wake\nthem at such an hour, so if none of them are up, it’s not really necessary…”\nEssel smiled. It had taken her a worryingly long time to recover from\nbeing knocked out the day Gavin had been kidnapped, but she was finally\nher old self again. “They are your chamber servants. That’s what they do,\nHigh Lady.”\n“High Lady?” Karris said. “Essel, don’t talk to me like we haven’t\ndanced the gciorcal on tables till past dawn together. One of us without a\nshift under her skirts.”\n“Yes, High Lady,” Essel said. “I’ll go check. You think you can keep it\nprofessional around here for one minute, Amzîn?”\n“Yes, Watch Captain!” the young man said. “I will not stand here and\nwonder which of you was dancing without her shift, sir.”\nEssel stifled a laugh.\nKarris raised her eyebrows, and young Amzîn blanched.\n“I changed my mind,” Karris said. “Amzîn, there’s a kopi seller named\nJalal on the back side of Ebon’s Hill where the two main lightwell streets\nintersect. Opens early. Go find a Blackguard in the barracks to cover the rest\nof your shift. Then I want you to run to the kopi seller and bring back as\nmuch hot kopi as you can carry. As quick as you can. I hate it lukewarm.\nUntil your brain is faster than your tongue, your feet are going to have to be\nfaster yet.”\nHis mouth worked once or twice, but then he was off like a shot.\nRunning so far was easy. Running so far carrying a hot drink? And being\nexpected to bring it back before it cooled?\nEssel came back to her post, “That… might have been my fault. I’ve\nbeen telling the boy stories of the old days of all the trouble we got into.”\n“Any of them true?”\n“One or two,” Essel said. “He’s been terrified of you since his last gaffe.\nAnd the others have been none too gentle on him.

I’ll ease\nup.”\n“Just a little.”\n“Just a little,” Karris said. “So, uh, which version of that story did you\ntell him?”\n“The true one,” Essel said, “where you were the one half-naked, and I\nwas trying to convince you to go home.”\n“You wicked little liar!”\nEssel just laughed.\nThen she said, “Actually, after all this time, I can’t remember which way\nis true. Or did it happen more than once?”\n“More than once. For you,” Karris said.\n“Doing some work tonight?” Essel asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Want me stationed inside instead?”\nKarris wanted the company, but said, “No. It’s, um, no… not tonight,\nfriend.” She didn’t know what was in the folio. No one should know it even\nexisted.\nEssel nodded, and Karris could tell her feelings were bruised. But Essel\nwas a professional. She asked immediately, “Want me to send to the\nkitchens for some kopi? It’ll be at least an hour before the kid gets back.\nWith lukewarm kopi, I’d guess, too.”\n“Sure,” Karris said. “But don’t let Amzîn know, would ya? Just in case.\nThat old man’s kopi really is the best.”\nEssel reached to close the door, then hesitated. “Gav was a great kid. I\nmiss him, too.”\nKarris took a deep breath, letting the sorrow flow through her. “I miss a\nlot of us,” she said.\nEssel nodded, though there was a flash of sorrow there.

And a new dedication, a new direction, and a new mission was born\nas the night yielded to the dawn in a single-breath prayer that broke from a\nchrysalis of horror and blasphemy at Karris’s lips. “Oh my God,” she\nrepeated, as she flipped the pages one by one.\n“Oh my God.”\nIt wasn’t a reverent salutation beginning some sacerdotal benediction; it\nwas the curse of a warrior who’d just taken a mortal wound.\n“Oh my God.”\nIt wasn’t the hushed intonation of a supplicant seeking divine favor; it\nwas the shock of an officer coming upon the scene of a massacre, with his\nmen standing, bloody, near the innocent slain.\nBut given time, horror fades, and repetition makes what was unthinkable\nnow normal; the monstrous is made manageable. For mankind adapts to\nevery horror.\nThis can’t have happened.\nThis happened but not often.\nThis happened often, but this happens no longer.\nThis happens still but not often.\nThis happens often, but this is what must happen. This is what someone\nmust do.\nThis is what I must do.\nThis is what I will do.\nI am doing this.\nI have done that, and it is what you must do in your turn.\n“O my God,” Karris said, “please, please, save us.”\nAnd the words were that commander’s grief, as he held a dead child in\nhis arms, at finding out the massacre hadn’t been committed by some mortal\nfoe but by his own men.\n“O my God, save us from what we’ve done.” Save us, Orholam, from\nYou.\nChapter 38\n~The Guile~\n38 years ago. (Age 28.)\n“This is like no prophecy I’ve ever seen, Andross,” Felia says. She is\nnineteen years old and heavily pregnant with our first child. A son, she\nthinks. I’ve always wanted a girl first, to take care of me in my old age. It’s\na disappointment I can’t hide from her, but she forgives me this, as she\nforgives so much else.\n“I should hope not. This one might cost me drafting for thirty-eight\nyears.”\nShe ignores that. Through another scroll we discovered when it’s likely\nthe seal on the Everdark Gates will fail. That, plus this scroll, gives us either\nthat the Lightbringer already came, years ago, and no one noticed; or that he\nis still to come thirty-eight years from now. So in order to see the prophecy\nfulfilled—if this prophecy is true—we’ll have to live another thirty-eight\nyears. That means giving up drafting. Not exactly how either of us wants to\nlive.\nShe sighs. “For a prophecy, that which hasn’t been redacted is so clear.\nWhich makes me wonder if it’s somehow deceptive. You understand.\nYou’ve seen the others: even the ones we know are from true prophets brim\nwith phrases like ‘when brother turns against brother, and men put power\nover religion’ that obviously apply to every era.

This…\nthis is so different, it doesn’t surprise me that other scholars have\nquestioned its veracity, its provenance, even the prophet’s sanity.”\nShe’s translated the scrolls for us. Felia has a knack for all learning, and\nwith her charm and familial connections, she’s had the opportunity to study\nevery discipline that has captured her interest with its foremost scholars.\nShe is like unto a desert, leaving men once fat with knowledge desiccated.\nShe is a hooded lamp, never bragging of her brightness, but taking for fuel\neverything that comes to the hungry wick of her intellect. She is now\ndoubtless one of the great linguists of our age, and few of the others even\nsuspect it.\nHolding the ancient scroll in my hand, I ask, “Is any other translation\npossible?”\nShe chews on a finger. We both wonder if she’s missed something, so\nshe goes through it phrase by phrase to see if I have any questions that\nmight shine light on something she missed.\nShe says, “‘If upon that day,’ or ‘at the time,’ a constrained time, but\nusually it means ‘on the same day’ ‘when the Everdark Gates open full.’\nThat’s pretty clear: the Gates will have been open to some degree before\nthen—and I do know that the translation of ‘Everdark Gates’ is certain; I’ve\nseen it elsewhere in even older scrolls. Unless you want to go really\nrecursive, and say that ‘the Everdark Gates’ means ‘the gates of hell,’ since\nwe know that’s how they got their name in the first place.”\n“Let’s not get too deep here,” I say. “The whole premise was that this\nprophecy is remarkably unambiguous.”\n“For a prophecy, yes,” she said. “But you’re right. Here we go: ‘and the\nbane touch the Jaspers’ is when the bane—plural, no note of how many—\nliterally touch the Jaspers. If on that day, ‘there stands no Lightbringer’—\nagain, ‘Lightbringer’ is used elsewhere, no ambiguity—‘on the Jaspers’\nshore’—not necessarily literally standing, it’s often used colloquially the\nway we do: the Lightbringer is there, on the Jaspers, possibly literally on\nthe shore of one island or the other. They didn’t call them the Jaspers then,\nbut they referred to the islands in a manner that was consistent. They\nthought of them as four islands, including Cannon Island and another low\nisland that is believed to have been sunk when the Everdark Gates closed\nand the sea rose. I have translated that bit as ‘the Jaspers’ for simplicity.\n‘Then shall the Chromeria fall.’ In this context, ‘fall’ seems to mean both\nfiguratively and literally. ‘As a river of blood pours from the Prism’s Tower’\nis simply, ‘As a river of blood pours from or around a tower the Prism in\nsome special sense climbs’—thus, ownership: ‘His or her tower.’ The same\nword for tower is used again in the next sentence.”\n“Is ‘a river of blood’ sacrifices, or a massacre?” I ask.\n“The Freeings have been going on a long time without causing a fall of"

Maybe the Angari who come in\nthrough the Everdark Gates? But I’m getting ahead of myself. ‘Then will\nseven towers collapse, and with them, seven satrapies.’ Obviously the falls\nof the seven towers and satrapies are figurative—collapse, political\ndissolution. Sorry, I’m overexplaining, of course you know that.”\n“We’re grasping at straws. Too much explanation might actually be the\nperfect amount to trigger some new understanding. Please go on.”\nShe does: “‘Ye shall know the time is short when bane rise from the\nseas.’ I preserved the ‘ye’ instead of ‘you’ because he adopts a high tone\nhere, an almost heraldic alarum. And apparently, this prophet believes the\nbane to be literal, physical things. He believes the loci damnata are real\nplaces, real temples of the false gods, the damned. ‘Atirat will rise off Ruic\nHead.’ ‘Off Ruic Head’ is a little tricky. Ruic Head wasn’t called Ruic Head\nat the time. It was the ‘fist sinister of the Iron Mountains.’ So the left hand\nof the Red Cliffs. Most agree that means Ruic Head, but it is a bit of an\nextrapolation. Further, ‘off’ could mean near or even on Ruic Head. It’s\nmore often ‘inside Ruic Head,’ so it might mean ‘on Ruic Bay’? Or maybe\n‘buried in the ground beneath Ruic Head itself’? Alternately, if we wanted\nto take it a metaphorical direction, ‘inside the left fist’ could merely mean\n‘in the power of’ a political entity near Ruic Head, the city of Ru itself. But\nI don’t think so.”\n“If a bane appears near Ruic Head, I imagine we’ll notice,” I say drily.\n“So it doesn’t matter. The ambiguity will likely clear itself up in time.”\nShe continues, “‘and she who births him will become Ferrilux.’ This\ncould be an actual birth, but I’ve never heard of the gods literally giving\nbirth to other gods, especially of such disparate colors as superviolet and\ngreen. And that Atirat rises from nearby doesn’t suggest growing up from\ninfancy; rather it suggests a god in full.”\n“So this woman will help Atirat… become Atirat?” I ask. We have so\nlittle idea how godhood is conferred or perhaps recognized. It is not\nsomething lost to the black, I don’t think, though; I think it has always been\nsecret.\nFelia says, “And then this woman, this goddess, will at some\nindeterminate point later become Ferrilux, which is intriguing as Ferrilux is\ntraditionally male. I’ve considered that this may be symbolic if the ‘she’ is a\nnation or a satrapy, but that would be a strange construction.”\n“Not that prophecies are noted for their plain language.”"

I’ve considered that this may be symbolic if the ‘she’ is a\nnation or a satrapy, but that would be a strange construction.”\n“Not that prophecies are noted for their plain language.”\n“Which makes this one all the more striking,” Felia says. “It could be a\npoetic phrasing, because that seemed appropriate to the subject matter of\ngoddesses?” She spreads her hands, as puzzled as I am.\n“As you were,” I say.\n“Then ‘She will open the Gates fully, which have been cracked.’ The\n‘have been cracked’ isn’t the same as our idiom ‘opened a crack.’ It means\n‘leaking’ as in ‘slightly broken,’ like a cracked egg. Some believe—and I\nconcur—that at some point during Lucidonius’s or Vician’s time, the Gates\nwere fully closed and let no water at all through, which hasn’t of course\nbeen the case for centuries. But this woman will open the gates all the way.”\n“Which would make us entirely vulnerable to the Angari.”\n“Maybe they aren’t warlike anymore. It’s been centuries,” Felia says.\n“But then, this prophecy doesn’t exactly strike such a hopeful note.”\n“On the other hand,” I say, “if ‘the Everdark Gates’ actually does mean\nthe gates of hell… there might be something worse than the Angari waiting\nto come through.”\nFelia purses her lips. “Not a hopeful note at all, huh? ‘From Tyrea’ is the\nlast fragment, and then the rest is redacted. She, the new Ferrilux, will come\nfrom Tyrea, or something or someone else? There’s not enough context to\nguess.”\nI look at the words again:\nIf upon the day when the Everdark Gates open full and the bane\ntouch the Jaspers, there stands no Lightbringer on the Jaspers’ shore,\nthen shall the Chromeria fall. As a river of blood pours from the\nPrism’s Tower, then will seven towers collapse, and with them, seven\nsatrapies. Ye shall know the time is short when bane rise from the\nseas. Atirat will rise off Ruic Head, and she who births him will\nbecome Ferrilux. She will open the Gates fully, which have been\ncracked. From Tyrea—\nThe words seem writ in fire to me. I have no doubt they are true. This\nprophecy alone doesn’t give us the evidence we’d hoped for, but it gives us\nwhat’s at stake, and the time frame.\n“What do we do?” I ask.\nFelia is the only one in the world of whom I would ask such a question.\nShe studies me with eyes aglow with orange luxin, with love, with\nintelligence, and with pride. A man cannot long endure a look of total love\nand acceptance without turning aside or being changed forever.\nI hold her gaze.\nShe puts her hands on my forearms, looking up at me, and when she\nspeaks, her voice is soft but unyielding. “How we direct all the resources of\nour wealth and our connections and our intelligences and our considerable\npowers hinges on your answer to one question.

There were preparations to make, regardless of what he decided\nhere tonight.

He\nwasn’t really joking. She was far more comfortable with governance than\nhe was.\n“Only half?” she asked.\nThey shared a smile.\nThen she said, “Today I was placing and recruiting sources and\nacquiring a number of diaries from our new recruits’ camp, including\nDaragh’s, and securing the cooperation of several minstrels who were\npreviously tasked with writing songs about the bandits’ exploits.

No. I tried not to think, because I was sure I’d become like my\nmother, that I’d go from stuffing my face with food today to stuffing my\nnostrils with gutwrack tomorrow.” Or haze, or ratweed, or anything to\nobliterate a day.\n“Really?” she asked.\nHer eyes filled with such empathy that he couldn’t bear it.\n“Sorry,” he said, with a quick fake grin.\n“But…” she said. “Why’d you ask?”\n“Oh, a man asked me that question once. Green wight I ran into outside\nmy hometown, just before… you know, the king’s army came.” It felt like a\nlifetime ago.\n“Gaspar Elos?” she asked. Oh, right, he’d told her the story. He was\nprobably boring her.\nHe nodded. “Funny,” Kip said. “Back then, Koios’s side imprisoned this\nwight and I freed him. How’d we switch sides?”\n“You didn’t. They’re deceptive, Kip. Corrupted.”\n“Orholam’s gift shouldn’t be corruptible, should it? Shouldn’t lead\ninevitably to death.”\n“Standing daily in the sun is a blessing; standing in the sun from dawn\nto dusk every day will burn even the darkest skin. Every gift must be\nreceived and released with the appropriate measure. Even the gift of life\nleads to death, Kip.”\n“It just feels wrong. Madness at the end of every road for us.”\n“What did he say?” Tisis asked.\nKip knew she meant Gaspar. How long had the wight’s words festered\nunder his skin like a jagged splinter? From the beginning, he supposed.\nBury and ignore them as he would. Tell himself he couldn’t be bothered by\nthe words of a wight, a liar, an enemy, or simply a man who’d ruined\nhimself and wanted to make sport of a vulnerable boy.\nYet still the splinter lay embedded in his psyche, inflamed.\n“‘You ever wondered why you’re stuck in such a small life?’ he asked\nme. Of course I had! What young man doesn’t? ‘Do you know why you feel\ndestined for something greater?’ and for a moment I think I really believed\nhe might be a messenger from Orholam Himself, come to give me meaning"

Why had I found him? So randomly, out there alone, at\nthat very hour? It was like it was appointed. Like maybe this was my great\npurpose calling.” Kip trailed off. “What a child I was. So desperate and\nweak and full of hope that something great would simply happen to me.”\n“What did he say, Kip?”\n“I don’t know why I even care. I certainly shouldn’t be deciding the fate\nof an empire on some throwaway insult. It doesn’t matter.”\n“Kip.”\nKip licked his lips. “He said the reason I felt destined for something\ngreat was because I was an arrogant little shit.” He shook his head and half\nchuckled. “Actually kind of funny.”\n“No. Cruel,” Tisis said. “A sharp wit can puncture a wineskin overfull of\nego. But any bully with a club-wit can shatter an empty crystal glass.”\nKip shrugged. The man had said, ‘There’s a prophecy about you. Not\nRekton you. You you.’ But it had all been a setup for the taunt, hadn’t it? He\nsaid, “Just a stranger. Dead one now.”\nShe looked skeptical.\nHe shook it off. “I should get—”\nShe put a hand on his arm, stopping him. She was biting her bottom lip,\nintense. Then she took a deep breath. “I believe in you, but that’s not\nenough, is it? You need to know. For you.”\nShe didn’t have to say about what.\n“Don’t you?” she asked.\n“Know?” Kip asked.\n“You’re gonna play dumb? You? With me?”\nThey’d never talked about it directly, even as the Mighty assumed it. It\nwas too precious, too big, too ridiculous for fat little Kip of Rekton to even\ndream.\nHe knew Tisis wouldn’t ridicule him. Knew it absolutely. It wasn’t in\nher.\nBut what if she did?\nHe cleared his throat. “I’m not that fat kid from Rekton anymore,” Kip\nsaid. He shrugged. He braced himself on the ramparts, the masses of busy\npeople below blending into one unvariegated carpet.\nShe stepped up beside him and put one hand atop his.\nShe looked out, and her face filled with pleasure at the people united,\npurposeful, hopeful—and it made him ache. Her satisfaction brought vigor\nto her beauty, a feminine strength, not fragile like a bloom that might be\ncrushed underfoot, but adaptive, stubbornly growing toward the sun. Like a\nsapling in good soil, rushing into her strength, that she might bend before a\nstorm, but grow; or be pressed down today and spring back up tomorrow,\nhaving grown taller yet overnight.\nTisis was transforming before his eyes, and he knew he’d played a role\nin that beautiful mystery, that growing into what she was meant to be. It\nfilled him with humility to be allowed to partake in something so sacred.\nAnd it filled him with impossible longing.\nKip looked out on all those thousands of people taking his direction, and\nthough he knew it was there, he didn’t see the glory of a community united,"

He saw thousands of people he\ncould fail. Ten thousand ways he could fall short. And yet, how could he\nsolve the paradoxical audacity in his breast?\nHe wanted to be even more.\nHow dare he?\n“Kip, do you know what we do when we look at ourselves in a mirror?”\nSee ourselves? “Why do I have a feeling that whatever I say next is\ngoing to get me in trouble?”\n“Shut up, Kip.”\n“See?!”\n“Kip.” Level, stern, no-nonsense. If they lived so long, she had definite\nmother material in her.\nWell, he’d certainly put enough father material in her for that to actually\nhappen.\nWhich was kind of terrifying: Kip. A father.\nNo, he did not want to think about that right now.\n“Sorry,” he said. “Go ahead. You were saying?” He folded his hands and\ncomposed himself like an attentive student.\nShe studied him for a moment until she was certain he wasn’t making\nlight of things.\nShe spun the mounted mirror over and directed Kip’s image at himself,\nwhich he didn’t really appreciate. She said, “A mirror turns quiet voices\nblaring, and can blind you to the whole you by distracting you with details.\nIt breaks you into imperfect pieces of a body rather than integrate you into a\nwhole person. A mirror pushes its will into you, Kip. So if you think a\nmirror only reflects, if you think a mirror shows you the way you really are,\nyou won’t realize what it’s doing, and you won’t push back. You are that\nkid from Rekton, Kip.”\n“‘Aren’t,’ you mean,” he said. “Sorry, not important. You just misspoke.\nGo on.”\nShe shook her head. “I didn’t misspeak.”\nYes, you did. He flashed a quick smile. It really didn’t matter.\nShe rolled her eyes skyward. “Did you really have to give him a loud\nsilent yes, too?!”\n“You know,” Kip said, “I usually feel smarter than this. And I don’t\nusually feel all that smart.”\nShe took his hands, and she was the comfort of a lantern in darkness.\n“You are that wounded, fearful child stuck in the closet with the rats.” Her\nvoice cracked momentarily, and lightning of her righteous wrath at what\nhad been done to him flashed in the distance, but she went on. “And you are\nthis man. And I have seen you…” Her eyes filled with tears, but she ignored\nthem. “Kip, when you bring that little boy’s heart and his compassion for\nbrokenness into your rule, I have never seen anyone so powerful.” She wet\ndry lips, mastering herself. “I think you owe that child abandoned in a\nlocked closet with rats something, Kip. That boy? That boy you’ve poured\nscorn on, who you called a fat fuck? He survived because he fought.

That memory was so clear when he\nthought about it that he tried to never think of it at all. Huddled in a ball on\nthe floor, back slick with blood, exhausted, starving—Orholam, he hadn’t\neven been fat yet then, had he?—the bodies of rats he’d smashed as he’d\nthrown his body this way and that, crushing some few of them. Those he’d\ncrushed writhed while dying and were devoured first, as easier food. The\npure disgust—rats!—had come first, and long since been scoured away. All\nthat mattered in the end was that they not get his fingers, his toes, his groin,\nhis face. All else he lacked the strength to protect.\nHe’d despised himself for his weakness. For flailing like a madman and\nhaving nothing left. For not being able to fight. For not having the courage\nto tear open one of the rats he’d killed to drink its blood to wet his parched\nlips.\nAt least not until it was too late, and the dead ones had already been\ndevoured.\nHe was powerless, and it was his own fault. He’d known what he needed\nto do, and he hadn’t done it.\nAnd the rats would be back.\nTisis said, “Every slave stops fighting the chain. But some run every\ntime the chains do come off. And you’re here, Kip. And you have friends.\nAnd you trust people. And you love. Are those the hallmarks of the weak\nand contemptible?”\n“Not… so much,” he admitted.\n“So what I’m looking forward to seeing is you pushing back at that old\ndistorted mirror. I can’t wait to see you repay that hurting boy for his gifts\nto you by finally bringing your piercing wisdom back to that child. Mirrors\nbreak us into pieces because that’s how the eye focuses: one detail at a time,\na prism splitting our whole experience, but the heart can be a second prism\nbrought to the first, bringing that which is split back into a whole. So maybe\nit’s no coincidence that the Seven Satrapies need healing and reintegration\nas much as you do. Maybe it’s a sign that you’re exactly the one to do it.”\nKip swallowed. “Ah… so that’s what you meant when you said you\nbelieved in me? Got it. That is a little different.”\n“Kip, I believe you’re him.”\nShe’d never said it aloud, and he’d never dared to ask.\nHe looked into her hopeful eyes, and now he saw reflected there a man\nmade whole. He breathed her in, and she filled his lungs with confidence.\nShe was countering lies, defying contempt—I’m the boy who felt destined\nfor something greater, because I was. She wanted to know if all her efforts\nwere actually making a difference: healing fissures, helping him accept boy\nand man both.\n“I believe it with all my heart,” she said. “And that’s why I want you to\nstay.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“The satrapies are finished.

We have to figure out how to counter that,\nor the only way to fight would be to send wave after wave of fighters into\nhis wights like grist into a mill until they’re exhausted. It’d take a hundred\nthousand men to have a chance. Maybe twice that. Most would die, even in\nvictory. I’d rather lose.”\n“You’ll lose anyway,” she said.\nIt felt like a stab in the back. “I thought you believed in me,” he said.\n“I don’t mean to the White King. They’ll kill you, Kip.

It’s not about you.”\nBut her face contorted in grief, and she sank to her knees. “Kip. Kip.\nThis will be the death of you.”\n“O my love,” Kip said gently. He pulled her to her feet and embraced\nher, just breathing in the scent of her, cherishing the comfort of her weight\nagainst him.\nThe next words had to be pushed up a hill before they could roll down\nthe other side, unstoppable, but they had to be said. In the years to come,\nshe would need to know that he had chosen this, clear-eyed, if not unafraid.\nHe said, “My love. Haven’t we always known? This was never going to end\nwith me alive.

After all, I am the Lightbringer.”\nChapter 40\nThe door to Karris’s rooms opened, and Samite strode in. “Hey, we missed\nyou at training this morn…” She trailed off as she saw Karris’s haggard\nface and puffy eyes, and then she swore. “Is there some new emergency the\nboys at the door don’t know about? Because I swear to Orholam, if you’re\nslipping back into some weak-ass limp-wristed bureaucrat’s skin, I am\ngoing to kick your ass so far you need a long-lens to find it.”\nSamite was the trainer now, Karris thought, the ghost of a smile\ntouching her lips. “Not a new emergency, no. An old one.”\nLate in the bundle of papers, where Karris had breezed past it at first,\nwas a bit from Orea Pullawr. It had been a brief conversation Orea and\nKarris had had years ago with each other, but here anonymized and left for\nthe benefit of all the future Whites:\n‘I’ve left you a mess.’\n‘You are the White. It’s your prerogative,’ her strong right hand said.\n‘A prerogative I’ve invoked far too often. I hope your strong hands will\nsucceed where mine have failed.’\nAnd that was it. That was the entirety of her note. The occasion for those\nwords originally had been when Orea’s health had been failing and she’d\nhad to take sometimes to her wheeled chair. It had been an actual mess, too\ntrivial to summon the room slaves for, when Karris was simply standing\nthere. She’d always liked making herself useful, so she’d cleaned it up.\nThat Orea had left that conversation in this missive without even noting\nher own name—Karris recognized it by the hand alone, but future Whites\n(if there were any) would have to guess who’d left this, so the exchange\nwas generalized from one White to her successors: ‘Clean up my messes.\nMay you do better than I did. I’m sorry.’\nShe’d tried to say it to Karris before, saying something like, ‘I hope you\ncan find it in your heart to forgive me,’ when Karris had no idea what\nforgiveness Orea could possibly want from her, or for what offense.\nBut now she knew, and it upended all her feelings for the old woman\nand spilled them on the floor in a tangle.\n“Hey! Hey! Where’d you go?” Samite demanded. She snapped her\nfingers in front of Karris. “Uh-uh,” she said. “You don’t get to retreat. You\ndon’t pull back. Remember who you are, woman!”\nKarris’s eyes refocused, but she shook her head and scoffed. “Put your\nthumb right on it, didn’t you?”\n“No, no, no,” Samite said. “You’re not doing this.”\n“You don’t know what I’ve just learned.”\n“I don’t give two shits what you’ve learned,” Samite said. “I’m worried\nabout what you’ve forgotten.”\n“Sami, it’s all worse than we thought.

I thought it was bad when I killed\nGav…” Karris started to open the letters to show her old friend, then\nstopped. “No, I can’t,” she said aloud, surprised that their rules still bound\nher inside, though she should respect them as little as Gavin did.\nBut no. She couldn’t tell Samite. She couldn’t tell anyone. This was her\nburden to carry. Her stomach twisted. She was alone, as she’d been alone\nsince Gavin had been taken.\n“Karris,” Samite said softly, and in that word, not her title, not her full\nname, Karris saw the broad warrior lift off the mantle of Trainer Samite and\nbecome again her dear friend Sami.\n“Thank you for standing for me the other night,” Karris said. “I never\nsaid thank you for that, for standing watch. It was most ungracious of me.”\nHer friend waved it away with her one good hand. “Karris, do you\nremember Aghilas?”\nKarris did. He’d been the fastest scrub in their cohort, and one of the\nstrongest, too, but he hadn’t made it into the Blackguard.\n“Let me tell you a story.”\n“I don’t have time for—come on, Sami.”\n“Before you and I met, I’d trained for years. Years to ready myself to\nattempt the Blackguard training. I’d spent hours every day making my body\nmy slave. I still wasn’t nearly the best, short reach, not naturally gifted, not\nfast, merely strong—and not even that strong, compared with most of the\nboys. I already felt resentful of the others, to tell you the truth.\n“And then you showed up: this slip of a girl. Light-skinned, soft, pretty\nin all the wrong ways, good drafter with two colors but didn’t have a clue\nhow to use them in fighting yet. You were weak, slow, had no endurance.\nYou had no business trying to be a Blackguard. We all knew you’d only\nbeen given the chance because you were noble-born.\n“Truth is, Karris, I hated you. I was afraid they were gonna bend the\nrules to let you in.”\n“Well, you didn’t need to worry about that. They kicked my ass—”\n“And they did.”\n“What?” Karris asked, eyes tightening.\n“They bent the rules. Maybe broke them, depending on whether you go\nby the rules as written, or as observed.”\n“They what?!” Karris asked. “They did not. I earned my—”\n“You shocked the hell out of us, all of us,” Samite went on, and Karris\nshut up, if only to hear the rest of this slander. “I remember the trainers\nlooking at each other, while me and the other scrubs were waiting for you to\nfinish one of our runs. You were a lap behind us all, and you puked—while\nrunning—and you broke stride as your stomach heaved, but you never\nstopped.”\n“I puked every day for a while there,” Karris said, her mind casting back\nto what she’d always thought of as the best worst days of her life.\n“You remember that day when the physickers came and yanked you out\nof training?”"

Quietly, she said, “I thought I was done.”\n“You should’ve been,” Samite said. “I know that now. Trainers tell each\nother things, not just the rules as written and what to let slide, but also how\nto keep kids from getting dead. You’re lucky you didn’t die. It’s because of\nkids like you that they checked our piss every day. You remember that? We\nsubmitted to it thinking it was a test of whether we could stand\nawkwardness and humiliation, but it wasn’t. A kid stops pissing regular, and\nthen it comes out bloody—that kid’s gonna kill himself from exertion.”\n“The physickers told me it was pretty bad,” Karris admitted.\n“When you were gone, Trainer Tzeddig stopped us and asked two\nquestions.”\n“Oh? I never heard about that.” The trainer had asked enough trick\nquestions to make every scrub paranoid.\n“She asked us, if we had to pair up that day and fight in teams, fighting\nto the death against the others, who we would like to have on our side: you\nor Aghilas. We all said Aghilas, of course—except Aghilas, who tried to be\nsmart.”\nAghilas had never been as funny as he thought. “She whack him upside\nthe head?” Karris asked.\n“She whacked him upside the head,” Samite said with a smile. “Then\nshe said we’d have to be fools not to choose Aghilas, that he was one of the\nmost naturally gifted athletes she’d ever seen. He was fast, strong, and\nquick with a dozen weapons, or without any at all. Then she asked us if, in a\nfew years, we had to go to war, who we’d want to have fight beside us: you\nor Aghilas.”\nKarris realized momentarily that she hadn’t thought about her damned\npapers in several minutes, but she was enrapt.\n“Some of us figured this had to be the trick part, so we said you instead\nof the obvious answer, but when she demanded why, none of us could say.\nYou could see the traps opening up in front of your feet with that woman\nand still never avoid them. I hope I can be half the trainer she was.”\n“Well, what’d she say?” Karris demanded.\n“Do you know why you piss blood when you’re killing yourself from\noverexertion?”\n“What?” she asked, not following.\n“Your body panics. It starts devouring its own muscles.”\n“That sounds… unhelpful, when one’s already overexerted.”\n“Trainer Tzeddig pointed after you, where the physickers were carrying\nyou, and—” Samite’s voice cracked with sudden emotion. She cleared her\nthroat, but her eyes brimmed. “And she said, ‘That girl Karris has all of two\nmuscles to rub together, and she wants to be here with you so bad she’s\nliterally pissing them down her leg.

Last week we rigged the race so you\ncouldn’t do better than second—and you gave up and didn’t finish in the top\nten. You haven’t stopped complaining since. You know who’s never\ncomplained?’” Samite shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks.\n“Orholam’s stones, I remember it like it was yesterday. That woman was\nmagnificent when she was chewing our asses.”\nKarris was barely holding back tears herself.\n“Tzeddig said, ‘That little girl will run through a brick wall for you. You\ngive her a goal and death itself won’t keep it from her. For years now I’ve\ntrained the best fighters in the world, and I tell you that you haven’t seen a\nperson until you’ve seen how hard they’ll push themselves and what they\ndo after they reach their end and fail. So you tell me, when you go to war—\nand you will, may Orholam grant that it’s merely a metaphorical one—but\nwhen you go to war, who do you want beside you?’ And I tell you what,\nKarris, you weren’t there, and Aghilas was. And a lot of us were afraid of\nhim, and we knew we’d have to spar him that afternoon, and the next day,\nand the next, but almost everyone in the cohort chose you anyway.”\nThey did? And now Karris couldn’t stop the tears from spilling hot down\nher face.\n“And then Trainer Tzeddig said, ‘So now you’ve voted with your words.\nLet me tell you what you all already know: Karris isn’t good enough to\nmake it. Not yet. She’ll get there: she’s not just relentless, she’s quick and\nshe’s a damn fast drafter too. But she’s not good enough to get into the\nBlackguard. What you may not know is that she’s got nothing else. The\nFalse Prism’s War took it all from her: family, lands, wealth, and she’s got\nenemies, too, who blame her for things, who see her vulnerability and are\ndrooling to devour her. So I don’t know where she’ll be in a year, but it\nwon’t be here. She won’t be able to try again. This is her only chance.’ We\nall looked around at each other like we’d been punched in the gut. Then\nfinally someone, maybe it was Fisk, asked, ‘What do you mean we’ve voted\nwith our words?’ But Tzeddig didn’t answer. Some of the older Blackguards\nwere there, enjoying watching us get reamed, and Holdfast—remember\nhim? Cruxer’s father? Married Inana eventually?—he said, ‘You know what\nBlackguards do? We stand for each other. When one of us can’t make it, we\ncarry him. You’ve all said you want to fight with Karris by your side, but\nthe fact is, if she gets in, one of you standing here doesn’t. So each of you\nmake your choice. Vote with your cunning and your fists. You want Karris\nin? Make it happen.’”"

And some of the kids who were on the edge really did\nfight you. But those at the top eased your way a bit. It wasn’t for you,\nKarris, you understand? It was for us.

And that’s what you’re\ndoing now, saving all of us, no matter what.” Sami shrugged. “Anyway, that\nday changed my life. That was the day I stopped hating you. I realized that\nif you could get in on sheer grit, I could, too. So that day you kind of\nbecame my role model, and uh, you’ve never stopped. So when I lost my\nhand, I had this little moment where I thought my life was over and I’d\nhave to retire. It’d kill me, you know? This work is everything for me.

That turned me around. Sure, I was\nstill afraid. This isn’t what I expected from my life. Death? Death I\nexpected, someday. But living as a cripple? Seeing pity and fear in my\nbrothers’ and sisters’ faces? This isn’t what I expected from life, but this is\nwhat life expects from me. And you know what? I don’t see myself as a\ncripple now. I just got a bad left hand to compensate for. And I don’t see\nmuch pity anymore, and the nunks’ fear of being me has become their fear\nof me. But the fact remains: I’m not what I was. A bit of my burden has to\nfall on someone else, but I’ve made my peace with that. Blackguards stand\nfor each other. I can be humble enough to let ’em, even as I work to make\nmyself useful—if not today, tomorrow. So if you need us to carry you for a\nday or two, we’re here. We’re here, Karris. But don’t you dare give up,\nbecause that isn’t who you are.”\nSamite studied her, then flashed a sudden smile. “You got that look on\nyour face like my nunks get, you know? Like you’re about to ask a stupid\nquestion. So let me answer it for you before you embarrass us both.”\n“What, I was—”\n“‘Who am I, then?’” Samite mocked. “That’s what you were gonna say,\nwasn’t it?”\n“No,” Karris lied, sounding way too much like a nunk who’d been\ncaught out.\nBut Samite laughed. She’d known Karris too long.\n“Karris, your answer for that’s never been found in words. At least not\nany this simple Blackguard can put together. You’ve always made yourself"

You’ve always made yourself\nknown by your actions. Known and loved, too. So just keep doing what you\ndo.” Samite rolled her shoulders, as if trying to find some way to extricate\nherself from the messy emotions and pick up her gruff-trainer persona once\nmore. “Now, uh, there’s a stack of messengers and a line of papers outside\nyour door—or maybe I got that backward. Regardless, uh, given the\ncircumstances, I’ll give you the rest of the morning off. See you at the\ntraining yards tomorrow?”\nSlowly, despite the still-churning mess of thoughts and emotions roiling\nhead and heart and stomach, and despite the headache she had—she always\ngot headaches when she cried—slowly, Karris nodded, and she felt a little\nbit of herself coming back. “Bright and early,” she promised.\nChapter 41\n“I wanted to ask you something,” Kip said, coming into the little room that\nCruxer had made his office and bedroom. It was nauseatingly tidy. Even the\nstacks of schedules on the desk looked just so.\n“Anything,” Cruxer said. He’d just dribbled oil onto his blade, and now\nhe picked up his whetstone, spinning a spear point into position.\n“It’s a sore spot.”\nCruxer didn’t waver. He began the soothing wush-wush of the\nwhetstone.\nKip went on. “Big Leo said something I didn’t understand. He said you\nwere still grieving Lucia—”\n“It hasn’t been that long,” Cruxer interrupted. It was uncharacteristic of\nhim. He’d been in love with the young Blackguard scrub, and when she’d\nstepped into the line of fire, taking a bullet that had been meant for Kip,\nCruxer’s world had ended.\n“No. It hasn’t. And that wasn’t at all what tripped me up. It was that he\nthought the reason you were angry about me giving Ruadhán another\nchance had something to do with her. He wouldn’t say anything else when I\nasked him. So what’s that about?”\n“I’m fine with you giving Ruadhán another chance,” Cruxer said.\n“Now.”\n“That actually confuses me more,” Kip said.\nCruxer paused in his sharpening, then said, “You’re the… you’re the\nBreaker, not me. Different rules apply to you. I’m not a man who does new\nthings. I’m a man who does the old things as well as they can be done. But\nhere? I’m doing new things all the time. I’m making decisions over other\npeople’s lives, like I’ve got any right to do that. I’m worried all the time,\nBreaker. I keep looking around waiting to be punished,” Cruxer said.\n“Punished? For what?”\n“Breaker, I’m eighteen years old. I’m styling myself a commander? I’m\nnot even eligible to be a watch captain. I keep thinking Orholam’s gonna\ngive me what I deserve any moment.”\n“Is that who Orholam is to you?” Kip asked. “An Andross Guile waiting"

Isn’t He instead like Ironfist, who will correct your form, not\nbecause He enjoys showing you how you’re messing up but because doing\nit wrong might get you hurt or killed someday?”\nBut Cruxer wasn’t even hearing him. “I’m not the man anyone thinks I\nam. I’m a fraud. I had a hundred chances to come clean, and I never did.\nAnd do you know what punishment I got for that?”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“None. She paid for it.”\n“Lucia?” Kip said. “Her dying wasn’t your fault!”\n“She wasn’t good enough to make it into the Blackguard—”\nKip accepted that. They’d all known it was true. “She absolutely had the\nspirit of the best of us, Crux. She saved my life. If this is on anyone, it’s on\n—”\n“She had the spirit, yes, but not the skills. She shouldn’t have been there.\nWouldn’t have…” His face contorted.\n“Wouldn’t have?”\n“I fell for her. Hard. Like, before we even talked. There was…” Cruxer’s\nface brightened at the memory. “There was something radiant about her.\nLike you just want to watch her across the room and watch how spirits\nlighten as people talk to her. I started training her extra right away, not just\nto be near her, either. I knew, brother, I knew so early that she’d never make\nit in. I don’t think she did. And I couldn’t bear to be away from her.”\nHe took a breath, steadying himself against his grief.\n“She came from one of the slave-training houses, you know? If she\nfailed out of Blackguard training, we both knew her owners would look for\nsome other way to recoup their investment. Decent men who just want a\ndomestic don’t bid as much at the auction as men who want a domestic for\nwhom they have… other uses as well. Good women who just want a\ndomestic don’t often bring a pretty one into their homes.” He shook his\nhead. “Have you ever seen the light in a girl’s eyes die?” Cruxer met Kip’s\ngaze for the first time in a while. “No, they didn’t have slaves where you\ngrew up, did they? That disgusting brutality isn’t considered normal in oh-\nso-backward Tyrea, is it?” he said bitterly. “Well, I couldn’t let it happen.\nNot to her.”\n“Oh, Cruxer.” Kip covered his face.\n“I thought, if I could just keep her in until the final testing, I could take\nmy Blackguard price the next day and buy out her contract before her\nowners sold her. To free her, of course. I mean, I was nervous that maybe…\neven though she’d never acted like it, that maybe she’d attached herself to\nme hoping that would happen.

I mean, I was thinking marriage, but I wasn’t going to put that\non her. I wanted her to be free to go, if she wanted. But maybe someday…”\nHe swallowed.\n“So I cheated to keep her in. Our cohort was solid at the top places, but\nnot at the bottom. A couple deep muscle bruises delivered during training\nthe week before testing—hard kicks to a thigh or calf, not anything that\nwould disable anyone, you know? Those kids were going to wash out\nanyway. What’s the harm? I thought.”\n“Cruxer, everyone does that kind of thing, trying to keep their friends\nwith them, and everyone knows it. It’s part of—”\n“It’s cheating. It’s wrong.”\nExcept it wasn’t. Not exactly.\nThe trainers and the watch captains and the Blackguards’ commander all\nknew such scheming happened, and they didn’t stop it. In fact, they didn’t\neven mind, because allowing it rewarded cunning and alliance-making over\npure technical fighting skill. Only fighters as incredibly skilled as Cruxer\ncould be unaware of how the others schemed together; fighters as good as\nCruxer always made it in regardless.\nThe rest of the scrubs stayed awake at night, wondering what they could\npossibly do to make it in. The commander and trainers accepted all the\nschemes and backstabbing because full Blackguards needed to know how\ncunning minds worked if they were to guard against such minds, addressing\nnot only external threats but also internal political machinations.\nBut Kip wasn’t going to convince Cruxer out of his guilt with\njustifications that others were cheating, too.\nCruxer said, “But of course, like every fraud, I got greedy. Keeping her\nin the Blackguard until the final testing wasn’t good enough. I wanted to be\naround her all the time. There was no way she belonged in Aleph squad. I\ndemanded it. Commander Ironfist took one look at me, and he knew. I never\nfelt so naked and foolish in my life. He told me it was gonna lead to grief.\nHe told me! He even offered to buy her contract himself if she failed out\nearly—and I angrily denied everything. Breaker, he gave me a chance to\nhave everything I wanted except that I wouldn’t be the big hero in her eyes,\nand I lied to his face. I broke faith. I was a man under authority, and in my\ncowardice and weakness, I ripped myself out of my place in the Great\nChain of Being. I stepped outside of Orholam’s protection, and leader that I\nam, I brought Lucia with me. And she got killed for my sins. Orholam is\ngood and merciful, so I’ve had many blessings since then. But the lesson\nremains. Those who break faith bring grief to those who love them most.\nAnd the sooner they’re stopped, the better.”\n“So you didn’t want mercy for Ruadhán, because you’re afraid he’ll hurt\nus.”"

I would’ve said one, and\nthat then he deserves everything he gets and worse. But you give Conn\nArthur a third chance—and it feels right. You confuse me, and I can’t tell if\nthings work out for you because different rules apply to you, or if you’re\njust the only person I know brave enough to try them.”\nSo that was why Cruxer had almost stopped Kip from stepping in front\nof the window that day: anyone else, he would have stopped, but Kip?\nThe young commander scrubbed his fingers through his short curly hair.\n“It’s different, right? Up near the top of the Great Chain, the lines get fuzzy.\nI know the Lightbringer is going to upend everything. You have to obey\nOrholam, and you have to figure out if following the Chromeria’s will fits\nwith that. Me? I hate that kind of thing. I’m not equipped for that stuff. Not\nmade for it. You decide where Orholam calls us to go. Me? I follow you,\nunless you do something that outrages the light of conscience Orholam gave\nme.”\n“Or if I put myself in danger,” Kip said.\n“Well, I do get to save your dumb ass from yourself, yes,” he said with a\nshort-lived smile. “But that’s not quite the same thing.”\nKip nodded agreement, but his heart ached. How do you save a friend\nwho’s had a trauma burn the wrong lesson onto their heart in words of fire?\n“Cruxer… This rigidity in you, this fear? That’s still the wound. Not the\nhealing. You know that, right?”\n“No. It’s not. This is righteousness, and a man must fear he’ll lose his\nintegrity in a world like this or he’ll never keep it.”\n“True… true,” Kip said. And entirely beside the point. He tried another\ntack. “There were two brothers. During a siege of an enemy city, they\nheroically broke through a burning sally port door. The city was taken, but\nthey fell wounded and later shared a room as they convalesced from their\nburns,” Kip said. “Day after day, they spoke as they were able.\n“‘Fire’s hot,’ the first observed.\n“‘Still hot, weeks later,’ the second agreed.\n“‘Burns are the worst,’ the first said.\n“‘The absolute worst,’ the second agreed.\n“‘Bravest thing I ever did,’ the first said.\n“‘Dumbest thing I ever did,’ the second said.\n“The first said, ‘If we’d waited, a defender might’ve extinguished that\nfire, and many more of our friends would have gotten killed trying to take\nthe city.’\n“The second replied, ‘If we’d waited, that burning door might’ve fallen\ndown by itself, and we wouldn’t be here, and no one would have gotten hurt\nsaving us when we fell wounded.’\n“‘There’ll be another battle next month or next year, but we did what we\nhad to, and we did it as well as we could,’ the first said."

But despite the darkness,\nthe armor-bearers and bakers and coal-carriers and dungboys and the\negglers and the fletchers were already up, their diurnal labors slowly\ndisplacing the stubborn nocturnal revelry of those soon leaving to greet\ndeath. The garrulous and the hateful and the inquisitive and the jocular\nwould come later to see them off. Kin and lovers would trail behind, some\nmothers following for a league or more, unwilling to turn their faces from\nsons and daughters they might never see again.\nKip had come down from the wall and the mirror and his angry wife to\nwalk from campfire to campfire, clapping shoulders and admiring weapons\nand offering a ready ear. Being seen, mostly, though it meant even more to\nthose he touched and nodded to and questioned. A hundred times, he’d\nraised some offered skin, but had let neither beer nor brandy nor more\nexotic brews beyond his lips.\nA hundred times, he saw a man he barely recognized in his people’s\neyes, and he didn’t know if he could maintain the image of that hero and yet\nremain himself.\n“There’s a sadness about you,” a logistics officer in her forties said.\n“You got respect, wealth, position, beautiful wife, friends—whole world in\nyour purse. What’s that about?”\nShe was one to know sorrow. When she’d refused to hand over the\nlocation of her daughter and several of her grandchildren, the Blood Robes\nhad burned her brewery down—after locking two of her other\ngrandchildren inside. The daughter who’d been saved couldn’t forgive her\nfor it, so she’d left it all and joined up.\nKip met her gaze. “I want to lead as well as you all deserve, and I’m\nafraid I won’t.”\nHer eyes widened briefly at his honesty, and he could see her tuck that\naway to share it with others later.\nThey would love him more for it, he knew, but that hadn’t been why he\nsaid it. Somewhere, oddly, he’d displaced some essential part of his fear. He\nwasn’t, perhaps, fully the man they thought he was, but neither was he a\nfraud.\nIt also wasn’t quite the whole truth. Tonight felt like a little death;\ntonight was goodbye—though he couldn’t tell them that. Every hour of\nsurprise that he gained on the White King and separately on his generals at\nGreen Haven was an hour that might mean the difference between victory\nand defeat. So Kip had to endure this goodbye alone, even while in the\ncompany of those he’d come to love.\nHe joined the fire of some river sailors and longshoremen and asked a\nquestion about some intricate knot a man was using.

When he didn’t\nunderstand the answer about why a particular fiber was good for a task, he\nasked again, and then a follow-up; he dared to do so now because he wasn’t\nafraid of looking stupid. Even if he would never understand the things these\nmen understood easily, it was no essential threat to him. He did other things\nwell. He didn’t have to be good at everything.\nStrangely, that lack of fear of failure made failures infrequent.\nWhen he understood and asked if that meant you would use that\nparticular knot with these cotton ropes in this kind of application, but only\nuse it with a hemp rope in these other ones, they seemed to think he was a\ngenius.\nFor a noble anyway, one offered, testing to see how prickly he was.\nHe laughed, though. “I see I’m not the only bastard here!”\nThey lit up. It was almost too easy, with men who wanted to like you.\nThen he indulged his curiosity and threw a problem at them. “So let’s\nsay I’ve got a stallion. Fully barded. Sixteen hands. Weighs, what, probably\nnineteen and a half or twenty sevens? Got a wall fifteen paces high, but\nstraight up, sheer. We can get right to the base. What ropes and knots do I\nuse to lift him as quickly as possible to the top of the wall? And how long\ndoes it take? Let’s say I’ve got access to hemp ropes and cotton, much as I\nneed. Manpower’s no problem, but time is.”\nThey peppered him with a few other questions about what other supplies\nthey had available. Pulleys? Nets? In a minute, they’d devised and refined a\nplan. Their pleasure in demonstrating their mastery told Kip he was on to\nsomething he should repeat at the other fires.\n“No, no, no,” a young sailor piped up suddenly after they’d all agreed on\ntheir answer. “You’re doing it all wrong. I can get that horse to the top of\nthe wall in half that time. We gotta think about this like our brothers the\nlongshoremen here. We got these standard-size boxes, right?” He held his\nhands out to show how big they were.\n“We already talked about that,” one of the longshoreman interjected.\n“No matter how you lash ’em together, you can’t make a platform or a sling\nwith ’em. Ain’t gonna be strong enough for—”\n“So first thing you do is,” the young man continued, his hands still held\nout to box size, “you cut the horse into pieces this big—”\nBoth the sailors and the longshoremen busted up laughing, though the\nlongshoremen followed it with cursing at him for his cheek.\n“Watch out, boys,” Kip said, standing to go. “With that kind of approach\nto problem solving, you might have yourselves a future officer there.”\nThey laughed again, and he moved on, but not before he took the boy’s\nname. A quick wit’s the flower of a keen mind. The boy might be an officer\nyet.\nAfter some hours, he gave in to exhaustion.

She’d told the magisters she wanted to offer\nthem encouragement in a difficult time.\nInstead, what she was telling them might get them all killed, and her\nwith them.\n‘I’ve left you a mess. I hope your strong hands will succeed where mine\nhave failed,’ Orea had told her.\nWell. This was where the rot began, so this is where Karris would begin,\ntoo. At some point, the shining, idealistic faces of the young luxiats before\nher would become old and powerful… and compromised, and even corrupt.\nShe didn’t have a master plan yet, but she knew that what Orholam had\nfor her to do began here.\n“It’s a puzzle, isn’t it?” she said. “It’s as if they almost think that the life-\ngiving Lord in whom we believe is not, perhaps, so superior to the pagans’\nancestor worship and ritual orgies, and their elevation of drafters as innately\nmore valuable than other men and women. Why are our leaders so\ntentative? Is it merely because they are old? What is so wrong with us? Has\none day passed since High Luxiat Tawleb’s execution on Orholam’s Glare\nthat you haven’t asked yourself, ‘How could the High Magisterium itself\nshelter such a person?’ A murderer in league with Nabiros himself? And\nthen we saw Pheronike—not simply serving the immortal but somehow\nhosting him. How can such things be? Why is our faith spineless? Have we\nnothing to offer a dark world desperate for light?”\nThere was still time to bail out, to offer some anodyne exhortation to be\nfaithful and do good.\nKarris hadn’t brought the red folio, but everything she did now was\ninformed by it, and by the fact that Orholam had armed her with it. Why\nwould Orea choose Karris to succeed her? Why, out of all those smarter,\nholier, and more impressive in a hundred ways, would Orholam choose her\nto be His White now?\nIt could only be because Karris was a warrior. So she sometimes needed\ndirection? Orea’s letter was that much: clean up the mess, whatever the\ncost. Fight. Die if necessary. Inspire others to join you in that, through your\nexample. Karris could do that.\nThe red volume was, damnably, missing large chunks of its text.\nApparently at least one of the later recipients of the work had ignored their\npledge, or considered themselves not bound by an oath they hadn’t\nconsented to.\nA later pen claimed that at one point, the folio had been sealed with\nsome sort of a will-crafting magic so that it wouldn’t even open until a new"

Now\noath-binding was another magic forbidden, and mercifully lost.\nBut despite what had been erased, what remained was enough. Karris\nwasn’t the first of the Whites after the folio had been altered, and her\npredecessors had been brilliant and curious and indefatigable in restoring\nwhat they could. While some had written circumspectly, others were\nbruisingly blunt.\nCareful to use the past tense, Karris said, “My own husband, the Lord\nPrism, the Highest Luxiat, himself did not believe in Orholam.”\nGasps went up. They looked at her as if she were sullying the dead, and\nher own husband, no less. These young luxiats liked her a lot, she could tell,\nso they were doubly aghast.\n“You’re shocked,” she said. “So it will grieve you to learn that none of\nthe High Magisters were shocked at all by his disbelief. In fact, I’d be\nsurprised if his atheism wasn’t shared by some of them. They cared little. So\nlong as Gavin kept up the pretense of faith, they were content. He did his\nduty faithfully, except that he had not the faith that undergirds those duties.”\nIf they had dared to shout her down, they would have then. It was why\nshe had excluded the High Luxiats and their staff, not by barring them from\nthe meeting but by pretending it was yet another informal exhortation of the\nkind she’d done many times before.\nIndeed, she’d met with three other classes recently and given them each\nan uninspiring lecture. Giving the same stultifying lecture, three times, had\nbeen enough to bore the important luxiats and magisters away.\nAll that in order to set this up.\nThe sole person of any standing in the room, a Magister Jens Galden,\nlooked ill to the point of fainting. He stood at the back, and suddenly looked\nas if he were uncertain if he should bolt and go summon his superiors, or if\nhe had better stay so he could keep a record of what outrage she spoke next.\nShe and Quentin had not chosen these young luxiats at random. Among\ntheir number was the order of the auditarae—a group dedicated to the\npreservation of contemporary and ancient history. The auditarae’s discipline\ninvolved training their memories with various tricks and a great deal of\npractice to a point where they could listen to a speech of half an hour and\nreplicate it point for point, if not word for word. Others of their order were\ntrained in a traditional shorthand, and partnered with an auditarae, so that\ntogether they could compare their recollections and notes to form an\naccurate representation of the speech. This was not primarily for an accurate\ntext of the speech—skilled shorthand was more than adequate for that—\ninstead, the auditarae wrote annotated copy akin to a musical text, noting\naccents, rising or falling volume, pitch, speed, obvious sarcasm, physical\nmovements, and other verbal flourishes or delivery idiosyncrasies.

These,\nrequiring judgment calls, were more art than science, and the auditarae\nworked first in isolation with their partner and then often compared their\nresults with other auditarae.\nSometimes, the close examination revealed much more than the speaker\nhad actually intended. Some auditarae became famous for their insight, and\nsome of these (Karris had learned from Orea Pullawr) were recruited as\nspies.\n“There are magics deeper than chromaturgy, and truths dangerous to tell.\nThere are truths about the Chromeria and about the world that we have held\nfrom you. But hard truths buried in the soil of a lust for power become\npoisonous secrets. We’ve enforced ignorance, and allowed conjecture. We\n—your leaders, the Spectrum, and the High Magisterium—have nodded\nalong, as incorrect suppositions hardened into tradition and tradition aged\ninto doctrine. We told ourselves that the risk was too great. We asked: what\nwas worse, a small body of lies, or letting dangerous powers free into the\nhands of any madman who might use them to harm the most vulnerable, or\nto harm us? If people learned the truth and rejected what we had done, we\nwould surely lose power—and we thought that none could use power so\nwell as we could. We told ourselves the lie that we were indispensable, that\nOrholam couldn’t work without us, and thus we couldn’t possibly let\nourselves look bad.\n“So we lied. Tell me, when has Orholam been a liar? Then how dare we\nlie for Him? How dare we say we do His work when we deceive our\nfriends, and disciples, and flocks?” She laid a folio open flat on the podium.\n“This comes from the pen of the White Justinia Brook, two hundred and\ntwelve years ago, in an address solely to the Whites who would follow her,\nlike me: ‘We have successfully, it seems, destroyed all knowledge of how to\ncraft black luxin. This is a victory so profound that it cannot be overstated,\nnor likely ever understood, simply because of the nature of the victory. In\nthe coming years it will be your duty, my fellow Whites, to relegate black\nluxin to myth. Of course, we’ve not stamped out the knowledge from the\noral storytelling cultures, but even those sources may be attacked and\nmarginalized, even carefully corrupted. Let no books be written anew from\ntheir memories, and knowledge of the black may die out entirely. This,\nperforce, also means knowledge of white luxin will shrink. We have crafted\nas many of the Knives of Surrender as has been practical. I need not tell you\nhow you must value each of these! If we lose them all, we will no longer be\nable to make Prisms, nor indeed, fight the elohim when they return.’”\nThe lecture hall had gone dead quiet. Everyone knew what they were\nhearing was dangerous. Everyone expected some adult to come along and\nstop it. But not a one of these young scholars wanted to leave. Prayerfully\nhandpicked by Quentin, these were the intellectual cream of the luxiats.\nThey lived to learn, and longed to teach.\nShe went on. “Then this comes from the White Orea Pullawr, my dear"

Black luxin\nhas been rediscovered. Dazen Guile has drafted so much of it he nearly split\nthe world at the Tyrean battlefield called Sundered Rock. I’d known black\nluxin could have some effect on memory. This drafting obliterated\neverything that happened in the entire battle from the memories of men\nwithin many leagues. All of them are, even now, reconstructing their own\nversions of the battle to explain the gaps in their memory, believing they’ve\nlost nothing. I’ve spread official accounts already, but with the loss of the\nBlinding Knife—the last of the old Knives of Surrender—I fear an\napocalypse is upon us. I fear that the old gods are loosed upon us in\njudgment of our many sins. We know black luxin once more. We cannot\nsurvive unless we also rediscover white.’”\nThe hall was deathly silent. Some even of the young auditarae had\nforgotten to write down her words, mouths hanging open. Jens Galden was\nrooted to place. Even from this distance, the whites of his eyes showed\nround against his deep-olive skin.\n“I am your White,” Karris said. “And though you are not entitled to\nevery truth from me, I will not lie to you. In white there is no room for\ndarkness. White may become tainted—I shall fail—but when I do, I shall\nnot hide the stain. I shall expose the truth, no matter how painful, and pay\nthe penalty. This is what I pledge to do, because this is what the Chromeria\nshould do. We are not called to perfection; we are called to correction.\nWhen we slip from the path, we will return to it. When we offend, we beg\npardon and pay restitution. We do not call the crooked straight. Our courage\nis the courage to stand in the light, and to learn to love it.\n“In this room, with this company, you may ask me any question you\nwish without fear of reprisal—and, auditarae, without attribution of the\nname of the questioner, thank you?”\nThe auditarae shared looks, and nodded, some vigorously, immediately,\nwhile others seemed more torn, but finally assented. She waited until they\nall agreed.\nShe said, “Now ask, and I will answer you.”\nNo one spoke for a few moments. She saw some of them glancing at the\nolder luxiat, who looked like he was halfway to wanting to know all the\nanswers himself, but was more scandalized by Karris’s betrayal of tradition.\n“The gods!” someone yelled, not standing up, not asking to be\nrecognized by her first, and not wanting to be recognized by Jens Galden.\n“Tell us about the elohim!”\nAmong the luxiats, there was a lot of debate about the gods. If they were\npurely fictitious or real; and if real, what was their nature, their connection\nto luxins, and to the old worship. Despite the pagans’ rebellion, it was still a\ntaboo subject, for the Magisterium feared even speaking of the gods might"

Despite the pagans’ rebellion, it was still a\ntaboo subject, for the Magisterium feared even speaking of the gods might\nseduce the simpleminded to worship them once more.\nFertility cults? Orgies? Surely the simple would rush to their damnation\nat the mere rumor.\nOf course, the appearance of Nabiros during Pheronike’s execution on\nOrholam’s Glare had made many luxiats ignore the old taboo. What were\nthey to make of that? Had it been mass hysteria? An orange hex delusion?\nCould it have been real?\n“The old gods are real,” Karris said bluntly. “At least two hundred\nimmortal powers are spread out amid the Thousand Worlds, though maybe\nthat number refers only to the greatly powerful among them. Whatever their\nnumber, they are united in wishing nothing more than to kill and destroy\nand corrupt what Orholam has made, for He was their king, and they hate\nHim. In these last years of peace, our world has been either temporarily\noverlooked or barred from their direct influence. As we’ve seen, that peace\nhas come to an end. I believe we may see more of these elohim, ere the end\nof this war.”\n“Stop!” Jens Galden shouted. “What are you doing? Why! You’ll ruin\nus!”\nAnd there you’ve done it, she thought. You probably didn’t even know\nhalf of this yourself, and yet in the minds of these young luxiats, you’ve just\nconfirmed it all.\nKarris didn’t raise her voice. She spoke as she would have spoken to the\nBlackguards at a mission briefing. “We are at war. We need unity if we’re to\nfight. If the Magisterium cannot be united in light and in truth, how can the\nSeven Satrapies have any hope? The light of Orholam’s Glare revealed the\ntruth to us. Go now, and quickly,” she told him. “I’m sure you have reports\nto make.”\nAnd so he rushed from the hall, nearly weeping.\nBut the door had barely clanged shut when a young woman asked, “Is\nthere no hope, then? We stand against gods.”\n“Hope? Of course there is hope!” Karris said, “For know this—these\ngods can be banished from our world. The Whites of old believe that the\nnature of the old ‘gods’—Anat, Dagnu, Molokh, Belphegor, Atirat, Mot,\nand Ferrilux—has confused us because it’s always meant two different\nthings. The ancients would have easily picked up what was meant by\ncontext. As powers of the air and sky, the elohim can make themselves\nphysical only for short times. Perhaps only minutes or hours, but certainly\nnot months or years. So when they hunger for the pleasures of the flesh—as\nwe sons and daughters of the earth hunger to fly—they must partner with\nmortals to do it: usually a drafter of great ability, often a high priest or\npriestess of their religion. Thus, both the mortal and immortal would get the\npower and adoration they crave, and the limitations of embodiment\nwouldn’t be so irksome for the immortal.\n“Together, mortal and immortal could live for ages, though it was"

But in this union, they are made vulnerable\n—as Nabiros was. These fell immortals enter the body through the eyes,\nand so do they leave through them, if they may, as their host dies or is\nkilled. This is why our ancestors blinded enemy priests and drafters, not\nthrough cruelty—or not through cruelty alone—but to trap the immortals in\na form where they could then be banished from our world forever. We can\neven, the Whites of old believed, banish an immortal from all the Thousand\nWorlds, if we kill one with a Blinding Knife. This, I believe, is why we’ve\nhad our long peace. Lucidonius gave us a gift of drafting colors more freely\nthan ever, but he or his circle also gave us the ability to threaten the very\nelohim. The foul elohim who’d so long ruled here as gods decided to hunt\nless dangerous quarry on other worlds—until the time was ripe, until the\nKnives and the knowledge of their making could be lost. No doubt they had\na hand in such losses, coming here and briefly risking embodiment in order\nto someday win their long war. But regardless of what they orchestrated\nbeyond our knowing, we can know this: they believe that the time for their\nvengeance is now.”\nThis was greeted with stunned quiet. It had taken her time and many\nreadings to comprehend it all herself, and longer to distill it so, knowing her\nwords would be written down and must convey all she’d learned concisely\nand clearly.\nThese luxiats were not, she knew, ones whom anyone else would have\nchosen to use to pass on such earth-shattering news. But that they were\nyoung and idealistic and of humble estate, and holding forbidden and vital\nknowledge, was exactly what would make them unstoppable.\nAt least if they hurried and got out of here before the High Magisters\narrived to stop them.\n“What are we supposed to do?” they asked. “We’re nobodies.”\n“That is a damned lie!” she shouted instantly, and the whole room\nflinched at the suddenness of her hard, hot anger. “You are Orholam’s\nThousand Stars. Stretch your hands high, reaching into the last light of the\nwaning sun. Bring light where there is darkness. Those who love the light\nwill flock to it, and those who hate the light will reveal themselves by their\nfear and hatred of you. Bring unity to these realms.

You scholars, search your books\nfearlessly and find if what I’ve said here is true. Or disprove it if you can, I\npray you. Learn what I haven’t learned. Find any lost knowledge that may\nhelp us. You auditarae, spread word of all this. If you believe what I’ve told\nyou, then join me in the fight. If any can be found who will join this war,\nwho will aid us, bring them here.

So far.\nShe was being honest now and blameless, but earlier today each of the\nHigh Magisters had found themselves called upon to answer honest needs\nin far parts of Big Jasper. Being honest and blameless didn’t mean she had\nto be without cunning.\nAfter all, she was still Karris Guile.\nChapter 44\nIt’s amazing, the things your mind will do when you have to stay awake for\nmany hours with a slim but distinct possibility of suddenly needing to kill\nsomeone.\nCertain boredom, with a chance of murder.\nBlinking, crouching in this dark corner, shaking her limbs periodically to\nkeep them from cramping, Teia was not, she finally had to admit, a ghost.\nShe could not pass through walls. For one thing, she had muscles that\nwanted to cramp—oh, and she had a bladder, albeit a tiny one (thanks for\nnothing, Orholam). She also wasn’t dead. Yet. (Though it seemed she was\ntrying to change that with alarming frequency.) Really, the only way she\nwas like a ghost was that she was not something any rational adult would\nfear.\nThat’s a great pep talk there, T. Your army of one has a shitty\ncommander.\nOh yeah? Well, that’s a much better pep talk.\nBollocks. Good point. Snottily made, but correct.\nGood to see I can at least win an argument with myself.\nDoesn’t that also mean you just lost an argument with yourself?\nGlass half-full. And shut up.\nShe stared at the slum building’s door impatiently. Orholam’s balls,\nwould you finish up in there already?\nTeia had never gotten close enough to identify the Blackguards at the\nback dock who’d attended the Old Man of the Desert, but she’d thought one\nof them had a hitch to his step, a slight limp on the left side. He’d also been\ntall, and most likely (having been brought to the back dock to make sure\nthat Teia didn’t simply head back inside) a sub-red drafter.\nHow many tall sub-reds had a bit of a limp in the Blackguard?\nUnfortunately, the answer was not ‘only one.’ The constantly training\nwarrior-drafters of the Blackguard accumulated injuries like misers hoard\ngold, and a slight limp didn’t necessarily denote a permanent injury."

Old guy, nearly forty, had a hitch in his step that showed up only\nwhen he was tired. Sub-red/red bichrome named Halfcock. Teia didn’t\nknow how he’d gotten the name—an Archer had told her once not to ask,\nand Teia hadn’t been curious enough to follow the obvious lead. He was\ninfamous for being an asshole, though, especially to Archers.\nIt would all be so perfect if he were her traitor that Teia was pretty damn\ncertain he wasn’t. Still. She had to start somewhere, and his little trip\ntonight to see his… lover? handler? had seemed not only the most obvious\nplace to start but also the only place to start.\nTomorrow, after this didn’t pan out, she’d have to head to the Chromeria\nand sneak down to the training yard and start looking for anyone else with a\nlimp.\nShe hadn’t read the folio Murder Sharp gave her. He wanted her to read\nit, and that was reason enough not to. He thought it was going to change her\nmind? What, because it would tell her the Chromeria was terrible? She\nknew those people. She knew how good and how bad they were.\nShe was up to her neck in the tar pit of evil herself, but she hadn’t sunk\nso far as to think everyone was just as bad as everyone else. The Chromeria\ntried to save lives—and sure, they failed a lot. Their leadership was often\nvenal and weak and self-indulgent, so what? They weren’t malevolent.\nThey didn’t take bright young girls and turn them into remorseless\nassassins.\nUm… in your case they kind of did, T.\nTo infiltrate the Order! Not for fun.\nRight, and I’m sure the Order has some really good reasons, too, about\nwhy they simply have to—\nNo. Uh-uh. I’m not the smartest girl in the world, but I’m smart enough\nto figure this out. The bad guys? They’re the ones who smile as they send\nyou to behead a kid.\nTeia was a terrible human being, but she wasn’t gonna behead a kid.\nMaybe it was an odd place to plant her flag of moral compunctions:\nshe’d killed innocents already. Did the age really matter? She could choose\na slave kid who’d been pressed into service at one of the technically illegal\nbrothels that catered to such things, and free him or her from an unbearably\nshitty life with the point of her blade. No one would raise a complaint. Such\nkids were disposable.\nJust like me.\nMaybe that was it. Once you stop telling yourself how much you’re not\nlike your neighbor, suddenly someone murdering your neighbor takes on a\ndifferent hue.\nTeia’d advanced in perfect time on the path to perfect\nconsciencelessness, hitting every beat, every step required, a compliant\npartner taking the devil’s hand and following the devil’s lead, and dancing\nto his tune, whirling round and round, skirts and morals flying as she spun,\nthe dance floor itself a vortex to oblivion."

The house he’d\ndisappeared into was small and dingy. It had been created by slapping up\ntwo walls to connect the stronger walls of two large estates where they\npinched together. The rich had long ago left this section of Overhill, and the\nestates on both sides had been diced up into dozens of homes, but they’d\nincorporated those walls, making this first a blind alley and then a section of\nstreet unclaimed by anyone.\nIt was illegal to block the rays of the Thousand Stars.

Halfcock had a mistress.\nIf so, it had to be someone forbidden. Blackguards were allowed\nfornication, but could be stripped of their rank for adultery, because that\nwas a breach of faith. If a person couldn’t keep their wedding vows, how\ncould you trust them to keep the more difficult vows of Blackguard duty?\nAlso, it opened them to blackmail.

Punchline!\nProstitution was a business generally more concerned with pumping out\na large volume of satisfied customers rather than pumping a large volume\nout of one satisfied customer.\nShe filed that one away too, for no one.

Prohibitions on having sex with each other mostly\nheld in the Blackguard, but no one could stop young athletic warriors in\nconstant close proximity from admiring one another.\nWhat Halfcock did was different. He looked for any excuse to pull it\nout, either to intimidate or to impress.\nOnce, Samite had shared a night guard posting with him alone. She said\nhe’d done it again, and that when she made her total lack of admiration\nclear, he’d prodded her with it.\nSo Samite broke his jaw.\nUnfortunately, then he’d thrashed her, despite the jaw.\nHe’d always been a hell of a fighter, and still was, despite his age.\nNo one else had witnessed the fight, and their stories of what had\nhappened seemed to bear no relation to each other’s, so he hadn’t been\ndrummed out of the Blackguard. Instead they’d both been punished for\nfighting each other while on duty.\nThat had been before Commander Ironfist’s time, and since then,\nHalfcock hadn’t given him enough reason to kick him out.\nBut everyone had believed Samite. Quietly, both the men and the\nwomen of the Blackguard made sure Halfcock never shared duty alone with\nan Archer ever again. The men took turns as his partner, like it was a burden\nno one should have to bear for too long. He was never promoted from the\nlowest ranks, and the watch captains gave him all the worst postings.\nAfter Ironfist became the commander, he’d told Halfcock he would be\nallowed to retire early but with full benefits.\nHe refused to quit. Early retirement, normal retirement, late retirement\n—he refused each in turn. He was just a tough, stubborn son of a bitch all\nthe way through.\nThere was nothing wrong with his skills, though. Sometimes at training,\nTeia would think he was mentally undressing her, so unrelenting and\nawkward was his gaze. Then he’d correct the position of her heel and tell\nher to turn her hips a fraction this way for a kick, and she’d feel the\ndifference in the power instantly.\nIt had almost made her reappraise her own inherited hatred of him. But\nthen, when she did it right the next time, he’d say, ‘Better. But you’re small\nand weak. You’ll always be one of the worst Blackguards.’\nWith shooting muskets and drafting he was similarly skilled. He almost\nmade a great trainer even as his own physical skills declined with age.\nIf he could have been trusted, he’d be exactly the type of person the\nBlackguard needed more of. Older warriors gave them continuity, which\nthey desperately lacked. They’d seen it all, and done half of it, and knew\nhow to fix what was wrong. People like that kept young Blackguards alive;\nthey sharpened them and instilled tradition and pride in the whole corps.\nTeia had fully absorbed the Archers’ institutional disgust for Halfcock,\nbut she wasn’t certain that he deserved to die."

It had to be very difficult for the Order to get a man inside the\nBlackguard. Once they did, they wouldn’t want him to retire. No, they\nwould demand he draft as little as possible so that he could live and be in\nplace as long as possible.\nIt made sense. It all pointed to Halfcock being in the Order. But a death\nsentence required a little more than suspicion.\nIt doesn’t have to, T. You can kill anyone you want. You can kill anyone\nyou want and get away with it. That’s what makes you scary. Call yourself a\nghost or a fox or whatever you want. Your powers are the wet dream of\nanyone who hates.\nOrholam’s fear-shrunken stonesack, that—now, that was a pep talk.\nThe door opened. It was him.\nChapter 45\n“We’ve new reasons to fear our enemies,” Kip announced to his assembled\nthousands. His voice was carried with magic, but he still had to shout, and\nthus, keep it short. “But we’ve also new reasons to hope. I want you to\nknow why we’re doing what we’re doing this morning.”\nThe units had been arrayed so that they could be disentangled as quickly\nas possible without tipping Kip’s hand that he was splitting his army. Word\nof any vast change would inevitably get out, and Kip wanted his men to\nhave a chance to outrun the rumors of their coming.\nKip’s goal this morning was simple: he had to tell his people that he was\nunexpectedly abandoning them, without them feeling like he was\nabandoning them. This army had come together largely because of him, and\nnow he was leaving them, and he needed to do so without destroying their\nmorale.\n“We’ve had good news and bad,” Kip said. “The bad news? The Wight\nWho Calls Himself King has collected bane from all over the world. Maybe\nall of them. The bane immobilize drafters. Whoever faces him will do so\nwithout their drafters. The good news? Neither the Wight King nor his best\nsoldiers will be at Green Haven. You won’t be facing them.”\nHe could see relief wash over some faces. None of the drafters wanted\nto face a bane—something that could turn their own magic against them—\nthat made their bowels turn to water. By the same token, none of the\nsoldiers wanted to face wights and Blood Robe drafters without their own\ndrafters.\n“So you might ask, ‘If they aren’t going to be at Green Haven, where\nwill they be?’” Kip said. “What could be more important to them?” Kip let\nthat sink in. He glanced at Ambassador Red Leaf, who shared the stage with\nhim, and was maintaining a pleasantly interested expression, betrayed only\nby a worried tightness around his eyes: why was Kip going on about this?\nKip continued, “They’re taking their best troops and all the bane to the\nChromeria.

And they don’t know what’s coming. You have fought\nagainst some of the Wight King’s best. Now imagine barely trained tower\nguards fighting wights and drafters, without any drafters of their own.\nImagine what happens on the Jaspers when Koios wins over those he hates\nmost.”\nMany of the men and women here had seen slaughters, had heard of\nneighboring villages completely wiped out. There were those here who\ncared little for the empire. It hadn’t done much to defend them, after all.\nOthers felt they’d been let down, but still had great affection for Gavin\nGuile, who’d ended the Blood Wars and brought two decades of peace. But\nno one in this passionate people could think of another Blood Robe\nmassacre of innocents as some abstraction.\nCries went up, angry denials that they couldn’t let this happen. Curses.\nFew had gotten as far as thinking of what it might mean for them.\n“There is hope,” Kip said. “A slender one. I’ve learned that the\nChromeria has a weapon that can defeat the bane. But the Chromeria\ndoesn’t know it. It doesn’t know how to use it. And only one man can.”\nThere were cries of ‘Luíseach!’ and ‘Lightbringer!’\nKip bowed his head. They’d hadn’t been slow on that one at all.\nThen he lifted his head. “I don’t know if I’m the Lightbringer, but I\nknow this: if I’m not, many thousands of innocents will die on the Jaspers,\nand the empire will fall, and the Wight King will come here next. We have\none best chance to stop him—and that’s this chance, now. I don’t know if\nI’m the Lightbringer, but I know Orholam won’t abandon us now. I don’t\nknow that I’m the Lightbringer—but I believe!”\nAs they roared, and as the cries went up again, Kip’s entire form was\nbathed in light. It pulsed, and their awe was redoubled.\nKip hadn’t done that.\nDammit, wife, he thought. That was what that lotion she’d insisted on\nhim using this morning was. A Prism-on-Sun-Day trick, Kip knew. He’d\nheard of it, though he’d never seen it himself. Still, old tricks endure\nbecause they work.\nHe wondered idly how much that balm had cost, and how many soldiers\nhe could’ve fed or given better armor for that doubtless-princely sum.\nKip let them roar for a moment, then lowered his hands. He glanced\nback at her; she was smiling innocently, but she gave a small signal to a\nsuperviolet drafter and his shine went down to a low burn.\n“That leaves us with two problems,” Kip said. It still took them a\nmoment to quiet, so he repeated. “Two problems: First, we have little time.\nToo little. Most of you know how slowly a full army moves versus an elite\ncorps.

And the weapon will be destroyed. If we all go, we might as well not\ngo at all. Second, if we all go, we abandon Green Haven. Even without the\nWight King’s best men, the city will fall before we could possibly return.\nThat is, if we all go.”\nKip let it sink in. These were a people of loud emotions. It made them\neasy to give a speech to.\n“I’m not willing,” Kip said, “to abandon anyone to the Blood Robes’\nmercy. But to save Green Haven and Big Jasper—to finally, once and for all\nstop the Blood Robes—we have to do something we don’t want to do. We\nhave to split our forces. Only I can wield the weapon at the Chromeria. To\nmove fast enough to get there in time, I can only take a small force with me.\nYou say you believe in me”—“We do!” a man shouted; Kip flashed a smile\n—“and the first thing I’m going to do is test your belief by leaving. You\ncould think I’m abandoning you. I wouldn’t blame you. But we each have a\npath laid out for us, and we have to serve as best we know. I’m charging\nyou—most of you—with saving your brothers and sisters at Green Haven.\nIt won’t be easy, but I wouldn’t leave you without giving you the best\nchance I know to be victorious.\n“May I reintroduce you to your old general and your new satrap—Satrap\nRuadhán Arthur!”\nAmbassador Bram Red Leaf squeaked.\nKip hadn’t exactly cleared that with him first.\nThe moment stretched, and Kip gestured broadly, almost bowing,\ndirecting their attention to the carpet in front of the platform as if they could\nexpect their new leader to walk out onto it at any moment.\nHe heard a voice from below—Sibéal Siofra—saying, “You will wear it,\ndamn you!”\nKip muttered, “Any time now, Arthur. Timing is kind of import—”\nThe carpet exploded upward in a mass of muscle and fur and sharp teeth\nas Conn Arthur’s giant grizzly Tallach leapt out of the hole the carpet had\nbeen concealing. Thank Orholam that Tallach didn’t also snarl. Kip had\nspecifically instructed that none of the muskets be charged this morning and\nthat none of the archers have their quivers or any arrows at hand. Some\nmagically appeared anyway—but no one loosed an arrow in their shock.\nTallach stood on his hind legs, and from this special harness that allowed\nhim to stand upright with the great bear, Conn Arthur suddenly appeared,\nstanding at the bear’s head. He was dressed as they were accustomed to\nseeing him—as a warrior, the chief of the will-casters, first of the Night\nMares—with only a crown of laurels to denote his new position as Satrap of\nBlood Forest.\nThe acclaim was thunderous. Conn Arthur’s—and Tallach’s—absence\nhad been felt keenly. This people loved him. If Kip was the Lightbringer, he\nbelonged to all the satrapies—but Conn Arthur was theirs alone. He was"

He was\nBlood Forest, magnified, larger than life, from his red-hair-carpeted skin to\nhis massively chiseled muscles to his giant grizzly to his huge emotions,\nboth joy and grief and rage.\nBut Ambassador Red Leaf had almost recovered. Kip walked over to\nstand next to him, yielding the stage.\n“This is not at all what we agreed,” the ambassador began. Kip could tell\nhe was working himself up to real rage. “You were to—”\n“I know who you serve,” Kip said.\n“What are you—”\n“My only question is why,” Kip said quietly so they might not be\noverheard, “why did you turn traitor?”\n“This is outrageous!” Bram hissed. He didn’t shout it.\n“Your lands are where Koios has been keeping his army, aren’t they?”\nKip said. “But it’s not just land to you. It’s people, isn’t it? Your sister\nhasn’t appeared in the capital in months. Nor your parents. Your son. All of\nthem were last seen in lands that have gone dark. Hostages?”\n“Nonsense. They fled long before there was any threat. They’re in Varris\nHollow and Glen Everry.”\n“So you admit there is a threat,” Kip said. “Those lands are reputed to be\nempty.”\nBram gawped.\nTallach had dropped to all fours and walked to the side of the stage,\nwhere Conn Arthur swung down easily. Still the applause continued.\n“I think,” Kip said, “that you aren’t a traitor. Not exactly. I think you had\nto decide between loyalties, and you decided your loyalty to those you love\ncame before your loyalty to a satrap you don’t even respect and a cause you\nbelieved was doomed.”\nBram looked at Kip, and something in him collapsed.\nHe nodded.\n“I’m going to tell you what’s going to happen,” Kip said. “You’re going\nto sign this paper. You’re going to tell my wife everything you know”—Kip\nforestalled the man’s stuttering objection—“which may be more than you\nthink. You’ll stay with Conn Arthur’s—pardon me—Satrap Arthur’s forces\nfor the next month. Enough time to prove it’s your signature, and to make\nthe terms binding. Then you’ll be allowed to escape if you wish. In the\nmeantime, I will send two elite units of Night Mares at speed to your\nfamily’s holdings. They’ll attempt to save everyone they can. I do that not\nbecause you’re innocent but because they are. Your family will keep their\nholdings, but you will withdraw from public life and sign a full confession,\nwhich we will keep secret. If you cause more trouble, you’ll be executed as\nthe traitor you are. Deal?”\nConn Arthur came up front and center, as the ambassador’s throat\nbobbed and his eyes blinked furiously.\n“Deal,” Bram said.\nBefore the word had faded from the air, Tisis had pushed an ink-wet\nquill in his hand and a parchment before him.\n“What does it say?” he asked, his eyes imploring Kip.\n“Does it matter?” Kip asked."

He hated speeches, and hadn’t known that Kip\nwas about to make him a satrap, either, until the moment Sibéal had forced\nhim to wear the laurel crown, so maybe it was no wonder he’d let the\napplause go on longer than he would have otherwise.\n“Ten years ago,” Satrap Arthur said, “there was a bump in the silver\nmines at Laurion—you know the term? It’s a major collapse underground—\nand whenever it happens, everyone comes running to try to dig out those\npoor bastards who are trapped inside.”\nKip’s brow furrowed. He’d just used this little story this morning on\nConn Arthur himself as he was convincing him to lead most of the army to\nGreen Haven.\n“To rescue their friends, the miners had to squeeze into areas that were\nso tight you couldn’t swing a pick. So they cut half the handles off. You\never work with a tool with half the handle? Makes it exhausting, right? But\nit was all they could do. No choice. They had to take turns of just a few\nminutes. But each did what he or she could. They pulled together, and they\ndid the job. They saved whoever could be saved. Now, on an ordinary day,\nyou’d call a pickax with half a handle broken. You’d either throw it out or\nwait until it was repaired before you’d use it for work. But on that day, that\nbroken tool was the only thing that could save lives.\n“This job ain’t what I want. But we got no time. So we don’t get the\nchoice of having the fight on the terms we’d like. We only get to choose if\nwe’re going to go help and save those who can be saved, or if we’re going\nto give up. There’s some days I feel broken, like I should be thrown out.\nMaybe you do, too. Guess what? I don’t need you to be whole. I need you\nto be here. I need you to be willing to do what you can. Because in this\nfight, in this satrapy, you’re exactly, exactly what I need. So will you\nserve?”\nThey shouted.\n“Will you join me?”\nNow they shouted again, louder. For a guy who said he didn’t know how\nto give a speech, Satrap Arthur wasn’t mucking it up too badly. He drew his\nsword.\n“Will you fight?!” Arthur demanded, and he thrust the sword at the sky.\nWeapons raised, they roared together, and Tallach roared with them, and\nit was a sound that shook the heavens.\nA minute later, General Antonius took the platform, and began splitting\nthe joyful army, the men bragging to one another about how they were\ngoing to plant their regimental flags in various unlikely or even\nanatomically impossible places of the Blood Robes’ anatomy.

The Great River was utterly blocked, so Kip would be\nheading overland with less than two thousand of his most elite Nightbringer\nraiders, with two horses for everyone, the fastest of the wagons, and the\nbest gear possible. But they wouldn’t be taking any Night Mares, except for\nwhatever of the Cwn y Wawr they could reach with messages to ask to join\nthem.\nArthur made his way over to Kip. “So,” he said, “how’d it go on your\nend with the ambassador?”\n“You did exactly what we needed,” Kip said.\n“That mean I’m…”\n“Legitimate?” Kip asked. The word had always been bladed for him, the\nbastard, but now it rolled out easily. “Yes, you are. They’ll need to see the\ntreaty, of course, and there is the matter of making sure there’s a satrapy to\nbe satrap of… but, yeah.”\n“This is, um”—Arthur adjusted the laurel crown on his head—“really\nweird. With where I was just a couple days ago.”\n“Uh-huh,” Kip said.\n“Say, you had me and Tallach jump up out of a pit on purpose, didn’t\nyou? Wait. You made me climb out of a pit—literally! You bastard.”\n“Maybe it was just good staging for the speech,” Kip said. But he\nsmiled.\n“Maybe.”\n“Also, I don’t know how you’re calling me a bastard. You used my\nstory.”\nArthur grinned back. “Hell, like I know how to write a speech! Anyway,\nsomething something, imitation, flattery, something?”\n“I should’ve been way harder on you,” Kip said. “But there’s no worse\npunishment I could think of than making you a satrap. Every boring\nmeeting you have to sit through in the future, I want you to think if maybe\nyou should’ve been nicer to me.”\n“Yeah, thanks!” Arthur said with a rueful grin.\nOrholam but it was good to have him back, and have him back with\nsome of his old spirit animating him.\nThe big man said, “You know, I just thought of something. The thing\nabout using a pickax with half a handle: it’s exhausting.”\n“Yeah?”\n“So was that your subtle way of telling me it’s exhausting to work with\nme?” Arthur asked.\n“Dammit,” Kip said, “I was planning to hit you with that some other day\nwhen you were being a pain in the ass.”\nConn Arthur laughed.\nKip thought it was the first time he’d heard the man laugh, ever. It was a\nmagical sound.\nAnd for the first time in a long time, Kip thought that maybe, just\nmaybe, they were gonna be all right.\nChapter 46\nBefore Teia could move, Halfcock doubled back suddenly at some sound\nshe hadn’t heard.

She didn’t want to see anything approaching\ntenderness. She reminded herself that it was in this woman’s economic\ninterests to feign feelings for Halfcock. A mistress is more a mummer than a\nlover. This woman was interested in Halfcock’s coin stick, not his meat\nstick.\nBetter?\nBetter, that derisive part of her that reminded her too much of Murder\nSharp admitted.\nTeia didn’t know what she’d expected, but the woman was neither very\npretty nor very young, both of which were things Teia associated with kept\nwomen. But then again, maybe if this woman were very pretty or very\nyoung, she wouldn’t live in this neighborhood, nor be a mistress to a man\nlike Halfcock, who had a terrible personality and—despite his skills—\nwasn’t wealthy. The lowest level of Blackguards were expected to be\nyoung, and their elders didn’t want them to have too much money on their\nhands lest they be corrupted by all those vices that the poor avoided.\nOr so the old ones said, as they kept the money and the vices both for\nthemselves.\nAfter some words about how she’d hoped he would stay all night this\ntime, and whispered promises Teia couldn’t overhear, Halfcock pulled\naway.\nTeia had made the right choice. This wasn’t—thank Orholam—a\nmeeting of Halfcock’s cell of the Order, with this dingy house a front for a\nsecret temple.\nWell, unless that woman was in on it.\nNo, as far as Teia had been able to learn, members of the Order were not\nsupposed to know one another’s identities or fraternize in any special way.\nFar simpler that she was his mistress, and he was supporting her himself,\nand she was innocent of his Order ties. Or she might be cheating on a\nhusband, if this was just somewhere they met to make love, but she was still\ninnocent of Halfcock’s Order ties.\nEither way, not someone Teia could kill.\nThe conversation dragged on, and Teia sidled closer to eavesdrop.\n“… understand… retire,” she said. She was turned more away, so Teia\ncouldn’t hear her as well.\n“We’re not doing this again,” Halfcock said.\nDammit. That would have been handy.\n“Come inside,” the woman said. “It’s practically morning anyway, and\nI’m freezing. I’ll make you breakfast.”\n“Does this place even have a stove?” he asked.\n“Yeah, but I, uh, couldn’t get the flue open.”\n“Oh, using me for my muscles, I see,” he said.\nPlease don’t go back inside.\n“I thought we agreed you were going to leave right after I did,”\nHalfcock continued.\n“Eliazar is gonna be out all night with his friends regardless, and\nprobably not come home until I can’t smell the liquor on him.”\n“But you need to be home before he is,” Halfcock insisted. “Just in\ncase.”"

I asked you twenty minutes ago if you wanted to go another—\nand you said no!”\n“You were supposed to ask again.”\n“You do this to me every—” He trailed off, sighing at the sky again, but\nthis time his gaze was like one gauging the time. “I am gonna bang you like\nan open storm door in a tempest, woman.”\nShe wet her lower lip, a look of erotic triumph in her sudden smirk.\n“Oops, look at that. I left the storm door unlatched,” she said, hiking her\nshift up.\nHe rushed up the steps, and she jumped up on his hips, embracing him,\nkissing him. He swept her inside, neither of them shutting the door in their\nhaste.\nOh, for fuck’s sake!\nYes, I think it’s exactly for that, T.\nShe sat down, sighing. Everyone’s got a love life but me. Is everyone\ngetting that much action, or am I just unlucky enough to go out exactly\nwhen everyone else is getting lucky?\nShe stood. Not even a pity party was going to keep her awake if she kept\nresting.\nInstead, she went to the door. Glanced inside.\nHalfcock had his lover standing pinned against a wall, her legs around\nhis waist, bouncing her against him as if she weren’t nearly as big as he\nwas. Impressive.\nThe look of rapture and the delighted gasps from the woman took Teia\naback. For some reason she couldn’t have articulated, she’d imagined that\nreally amazing sex was reserved for the young and good-looking. Neither\npartner here was either.\nHuh. Well, go to it, you two. Good for you.\nI guess.\nShe looked beyond them. There wasn’t much to the space. There was\nonly a single room. A feather bed made neatly after the night’s diversions\n(admirable Blackguard discipline there), towels, chamber pot, a stove with a\nbit of kindling and firewood stacked beside it.

What was he, made of solid rock?\nShe kept her feet, though, which kept her clear of him. That and\ndisarming him made it a victory, despite the fact that the collision had\nstunned her, too.\nHalfcock’s reflexes were better than she’d hoped, though. A lesser man\nwould have been immobilized. Instead, he tried to launch himself up to his\nfeet a moment before Teia could get a paryl grip on his spine.\nHis legs below the knee didn’t obey him, and he fell again, farther into\nhis house.\nShe flicked a kick at his neck.\nIt caught him mostly across his jaw instead. He rolled with the blow, his\nlegs jamming against the doorframe, and the motion broke the paryl crystals\nparalyzing his knees.\nTeia hesitated. On the long list of things she didn’t want right now,\ngetting stuck in an enclosed space with a bigger and stronger fighter was\npretty high up. But she couldn’t get the angle to get at his spine from here.\nThe advantages of being inside the little house—where they wouldn’t be\nheard or interrupted—were only advantages if he was paralyzed. Her\ninvisibility was far less helpful in a tight space, where she could be trapped.\nBut she had to attack or he’d escape and regroup.\nShe dodged in, kicking, just as he rolled head over heels farther into the\nhouse. She was aiming to stab the point of her boot into his kidney, but only\nhalf caught him.\nHe rolled, and rolled again—holy hells, he was fast!\nIn an instant, he was up on his feet, guarding his pained kidney, gasping,\ngrunting."

Maybe he didn’t realize she was\ninvisible yet. He circled quickly, hands up in a guard, trying to get a view\nout the door, where he assumed his attacker was.\nThe unexpected motions of his guard broke the reaching tendrils of\nTeia’s solidifying paryl once again.\nChills shot down her back. She was good at fighting now. She was good\nat using paryl. She was getting good at using invisibility with the master\ncloak and even maintaining the fragile paryl cloud around it. But doing\nthem all at the same time?\nShe was like a marksman also skilled at fencing and grappling, to whom\nsomeone had just handed two swords, a musket, and a brace of pistols and\nplopped her ten paces from a charging spearman. She had so many options\nto take down the threat, she was going to stand there with her hands full,\nchoosing, until she got skewered.\nHalfcock leapt, diving, rolling for the door.\nShe slashed with the knife she didn’t even realize she’d drawn. It caught\nsomething as he went past, but he popped to his feet. He swept the door\nclosed with a bang, flipped the bar down across it with one hand, and\ngrabbed a blade mounted above it in quick succession.\nWith the closing of the door, it was suddenly pitch-black inside the\nsingle-room house.\nIt wasn’t the boon it usually would be. Halfcock was a sub-red. Which\nmeant—\nTeia checked her paryl cloud, throwing back up the edges that had\ndissipated in the violence. She didn’t make a shell anymore. She’d gotten\nbetter than that. A shell was easier, but fragile; anything could break it, and\nwhen it went, she lost all the paryl inside it too.\nWith one eye dilated to paryl and one merely to sub-red, she could see\nHalfcock’s puzzlement. His eyes were dilated to sub-red, but he couldn’t\nsee her.\nBut Halfcock wasn’t a thinker. He was already moving, circling, back\nagainst the wall, only out far enough to give his blade space. He spun his\nblade in an ascending flower.\nFlowers looked impressive, but were terrible moves if you were actually\nfighting. Terrible, that is, unless you were fighting against someone you\ncouldn’t see and you hoped to hit their body by simply covering as much\nspace as possible with your blade in the least time possible.\nIntentional or not, that blurring steel, white in her paryl vision, was also\na perfect shield against her paryl attacks.\nShe circled opposite him, keeping low and quiet. He was bleeding from\nher earlier slash, warmth throbbing bright in the sub-red spectrum down his\nback. It didn’t look like enough to make him faint soon, though.\nHis jaw was tight. He was pretty sure that she was still in the room with\nhim, but who could hide from sub-red?\nFrustrated, he brought down a descending flower. Spinning a blade in a\nflower put his hands momentarily in predictable places, and Teia was ready.\nShe grabbed hard for the nerves in his wrists."

Spinning a blade in a\nflower put his hands momentarily in predictable places, and Teia was ready.\nShe grabbed hard for the nerves in his wrists.\nThe blade escaped from his enervated grip, but by terrible luck it flew\nright at Teia. It was twisting, sideways, impossible to judge exactly—she\nblocked with her own short blade, intercepting the blade, but the twisting\nhilt slapped around into her shoulder.\nHarmless. Not even a cut. Flat of the blade.\nIt didn’t hurt her at all—but it destroyed the paryl cloud, and cost her a\nfull precious second—and her paryl grip on his wrists.\nHalfcock lost the blade and as his eyes naturally followed it, he saw heat\nbloom, the whisper of a figure.\nHe charged, instantly.\nOne moment Teia was disengaging from a flying blade, stepping aside,\nup onto the stuffed feather mattress she’d been avoiding, trying to recover\nher stance, and the next her entire view was blotted out by a charging\nwarrior three times her size.\nHer foot slipped, but she didn’t fall.\nLuckier if she had.\nShe was crushed against the wall.\nIt drove the wind from her and smacked her neck against a wooden\nbeam in the wall.\nThey dropped to the bed together. She had only mind to grope for her\ndagger. But it was gone.\nHalfcock had driven his shoulder into her guts, but his face had met the\nwall with almost as much force.\nShe looked, hoping to see her dagger sticking out of him somewhere,\nbut it was nowhere to be seen. She tried to roll free, but his hip was on top\nof her shin, trapping her.\nLevering her other foot against him, and arching her back to press\nagainst the wall, she tried to push his weight off her leg.\nHe rolled with it suddenly, surprising her and snatching her leg with a\nhand. It sent her flipping over him. She was obviously lighter than he’d\nexpected.\nHe threw a punch at her leg, but missed. Catching a glimpse of his face,\nshe saw the collision with the wall had made him tighten his eyes from sub-\nred back to the visible spectra. In the dark, he was momentarily blind.\nBut vision wasn’t nearly as important when grappling.\nShe threw a knee into his face, and teeth and blood exploded\neverywhere.\nHe roared, falling back on the bed, but the motherfucker did not let go of\nher leg.\nUsing her trapped foot to brace herself as if she were doing a great sit-\nup, Teia levered herself upright. She kicked at his kidney, once, twice. He\nblocked, blocked, trapped her right foot hard against his side, under his arm\nagainst his ribs again, and rolled to fling her over him.\nBut she’d been expecting it.\nAs he rolled, it freed her foot from the ground, allowing her to spin. She\npulled herself down toward him with her trapped left leg, and jump-\nstomped on his head with her right.\nHe lost his grip, and she tumbled across the room away from him.\nThis time she rolled to her feet first.\nHe shook his head like an enraged bull, snot and sweat and blood and\nbits of broken teeth streaming from him.

He reached one hand out toward\nthe wall, perhaps to steady himself, even as his eyes flared back to sub-red.\nWhere was all the paryl she’d packed? Had she lost it all?\nThen Halfcock plucked Teia’s dagger from where it had been buried in\nthe wall, unseen by her, and his face filled with grim triumph as he saw the\nwarm glow of her small figure against the dark cold.\nHe crouched to pounce—and dropped like a sack of slops before the\npigs as Teia’s last paryl pinched his spine.\nShe sealed the crystal—important to hold the paryl open while the target\ndropped, so they don’t break the crystal with their fall. Then she turned her\nback and limped to the door. She opened it, trying to appear careless, but\nattuned to any sound in case she’d screwed up anything else.\nFresh, cold, alien paryl filled her lungs. It was power. It was life.\nLife was good. Better than the alternative, today. She filled herself full\nof her monochrome power, then closed the door again. Barred it.\n“So, Halfcock,” she said, “let’s talk about the Order.”\nChapter 47\n“We’re missing something,” Karris said as Andross approached her at her\nmorning forms, and the sweat dripped from her trembling shoulders. But\nshe kept her voice level. The exercise was making her mind sharp once\nmore. “Something that may cost us the war.”\n“It’s so nice to see you taking a break from our labors, daughter,”\nAndross said, as if the Blackguard training yard were his home, not hers.\n“Grinwoody was just worrying for your health, wondering if you were\npregnant. The weight gain, you understand.”\nThat shot a bolt of fury through her. She almost lost her balance.\nShe could hear the smile in his voice. “Naturally, I punished him for\nsuch impudence. But I’m so glad to see you returning to the sweat and\ngrime you rose from, like a flame eagle rising from the ashes of its old\nhome—oh dear, pardon, that came out all muddled. I didn’t mean to\nmention ashes to a White Oak.”\nShe continued the form. Breath in, foot held above waist height, imagine\na smug face for the next strike. She snapped it out, then held the position\nperfectly.\n“I’m beginning to worry about your health, father,” Karris said. Don’t\nsay it, Karris. “I know it’s not age. You’re very sharp for your advanced\nyears. But you seem irritable, pissy… are you premenstrual perhaps? I\nknow a good masseuse.”\nDon’t let Andross get under my skin.\n“Oh, I know you do,” Andross said. His voice was ice. “Rhoda works\nfor me, you know. Has a lovely way of turning your neck just so, doesn’t\nshe? Just shy of where you worry it’ll break. Hmm.”\nAnd now her fury stilled.

But as she thought about it, she had a hard\ntime believing Andross would tolerate Rhoda’s insouciant flamboyance, or\nRhoda Andross’s icy disapproval. No, Andross was simply aware that the\nwoman worked for Karris, and was trying to make her paranoid.\nKarris stopped the form and walked to a hook where her public-\nappropriate clothes hung, and patted herself with a towel. There were no\nservants here to fetch her things. Even Andross had come without a slave,\nleaving Grinwoody behind in an unusual display of respect: the promachos\nknew how the man’s presence infuriated the Blackguards.\nKarris pulled the loose tunic over her head, then called over to Samite,\nwho was leading the exercise, “I’ll make it up tonight. Twice as hard.”\nSamite nodded sharply amid her own forms. Her own face was beaded\nwith sweat, not from the exertion but from the concentration. Oddly, the\nloss of most of her hand sometimes threw off her balance, and she wouldn’t\nlet herself falter.\nKarris loved these people. They’d risked so much for her, in the past and\nnow, too. They were helping her reconnect with herself, find her purpose.\nAnd still Andross didn’t ask about what she thought they were missing\nthat would cost them the war. Didn’t seem to care. Perhaps didn’t respect\nher enough to even remember, much less to ask.\nFine. Be that as it may, regardless of who he is, I am called to be who I\nam.\nNo games. No fucking games.\n“I’m sorry, Promachos,” Karris said. “I was out of line. What may I do\nto make it up to you?”\nHis eyebrows twitched up. He took off his lightly tinted spectacles that\nhe wore in the darker hours, and squinted at her, pulling a darker pair from\nhis pocket as the sunlight dawned over the wall and onto the topside yard—\nthe lower areas having been yielded to the many hundreds of less\nexperienced drafters needing training in the martial arts. But as Andross\nsquinted at her, the light struck his face full, and Karris thought she\nglimpsed a cornucopia of colors in them. Red and the sparking of sub-red,\nof course, but also orange, and yellow, a hint of green? But Karris was\ncertain that Andross’s arc of colors only went from sub-red to yellow.\nOdd, but maybe it was a reflection or natural coloration she’d never\nnoticed. “It’s your son,” he said, putting on his dark spectacles. “You’re\nignoring him. He’s come to me to complain about it.”\n“I’m too busy,” Karris said. Zymun. Ugh.\n“Yes, I see that.” He said it as if her work here was worthless play.\n“I’ve invited him to join me here. And at other occasions. Events.\nDuties.”\n“But never at dinners anymore,” Andross said. “Or to your solar. Or\nyour study. Or anywhere alone. So he says.”\nNo games, Karris."

Kisses my lips, as a son might, maybe, but for too long, too softly.\nWants to nuzzle my neck. Grazes my breasts. Wants to put his head in my\nlap. Trails his hands up and down my thigh, though I ask him to stop. Sniffs\nwhile he’s there, as if he expects me to be aroused by it.”\n“That’s enough.” The disgust on Andross’s face was stark. Apparently\nsome things were out of bounds even for him. Marvel of marvels.\n“Then he begs me not to reject him. Tells me how much it hurts that his\nown mother would push him away. This, as he strokes the small of my\nback.”\n“Enough. Enough!” He rubbed the bridge of his nose, then said quietly,\n“Shit.”\n“You knew he was like this,” Karris said, heat rising in her.\n“Lots of men bother the slave girls and pressure the servants. I’d hoped\nthe endless stream of women happy to climb into his bed would sate his\nappetites.”\n“His is not an appetite for sex.”\n“Yes, thank you. I see that now.”\n“I won’t allow him to be alone with me again,” Karris said.\n“You’ll do what you damn well need to!” Andross said.\n“I won’t let him be alone with me again,” Karris repeated calmly. “Nor\nany of my people. And if anyone is found willing to testify against him, he\nwill be brought up on charges.”\n“This is why you put out that missive to the servants?”\n“You know about that?” Karris asked.\n“I thought you were trying to find the rumors so that you could silence\nthem before they cause us embarrassment.”\n“Then you thought exactly the opposite of the truth,” Karris said.\n“No one’s going to come forward,” Andross said. “They never do.\nYou’re his mother. I’m his grandfather.”\n“Don’t underestimate a thirst for justice. Or the fear of the Guiles. It\nmay lead someone to strike first. And even an allegation from a sufficient\nsource would be enough to stop our Prism-elect from becoming Prism in\ntruth.”\n“No,” Andross said.\n“I’m just telling you, it’s a card you ought to consider in your little\ngames. There are other, better people who would make fine Prisms.”\n“I have plans for him, and you will not—you will not!—destroy him. I’ll\nfind out about anyone who comes to you.”\n“You won’t harm them.” She said it with a whipcrack in her voice, and\nhe looked at her, surprised.\n“No,” he said. “I’ll pay them off. But carefully, in such a way that it\ndoesn’t encourage more accusations.”\n“Father,” Karris said, and there was no mockery in her voice at using the\nterm, which made his brow knit. “Zymun cannot become Prism.

I hope you know what you’re doing better than\nmy brothers did, or it’ll all be ashes again. This time for House Guile.”\nAndross pursed his lips. “You don’t have to meet with him. Ever. I’ll\ntake care of it.”\nSurprised, she said, “Thank you.” And she meant it.\nIt was an odd thing, to know what she knew now, from the folio.\nAndross surely knew all the worst parts of what she’d read. He’d surely\nparticipated in some of them, and then had hidden that knowledge from\neven most (or all?) of the Colors now serving. He had participated in and\nordered and committed murders.\nBut so had Orea Pullawr.\nKarris found herself unwilling to forgive her old mentor, but also\nunwilling to condemn her. Why was it so different with Andross? Only\nbecause he seemed to truly enjoy being hated?\nThen why did it trouble her so when he partially did the right thing?\nReluctantly, Andross said, “Now, what’s this about something we’re\nmissing that’s going to lose us the war? Zymun? You think he’s going to\nwreck the effort?”\n“No. I mean, I’m sure he’d tear apart the Seven Satrapies eventually—\nbut no.”\n“What, then?” he asked irritably. He glanced to the edge of the yard,\nwhere Grinwoody had appeared, but waited respectfully. Andross had other\nbusiness to attend to.\n“It’s my brother.”\nAnd then something fell into place, and her skin turned to gooseflesh\nthat had little to do with the morning’s cool air. She’d thought it a hundred\ntimes: Why me, Orholam? Why would You want me as Your White? And\nthis was the answer: he was her brother, and she was a warrior. She was the\nonly one who could stop him.\n“Your brother the Wight King, I presume, not one of the ones who are\nash?”\nShe took a breath and closed her eyes. Just when she wanted to see him\nas human. “Yes, the living brother.”\n“I’m waiting on tenterhooks,” Andross said.\n“He’s going to attack us,” Karris said. “Here. Soon.”\n“I looked into those rumors. Nothing to them.”\n“This is not from any rumor.”\n“You’ve had words from spies? Which ones? Where?”\nKarris chewed on her lip.\n“What is this…?” Andross asked.\n“He’s my brother. I know him. I can just… feel it.”\nAndross’s face lit with incredulity. “No, dear. You knew him. You’ve\nseen him one time in almost twenty years.

And he’s going to strike first, just as he tried to strike\nfirst against Dazen.”\n“You think he hasn’t learned his lesson from how that turned out for\nhim?” Andross asked. “He was a child then. A boy amid the temperamental\ngang of his brothers, who thought their sister was being taken in by Guile\ndeceit. He’s had a lot of years since then, and everything he’s done has been\nsmart and forward thinking. He’s got supplies pouring into his forces\nbecause he didn’t let his men burn the fields as they marched through; they\ndidn’t destroy the mills and the orchards. They left lambs and calves\nbehind. He means to rule, not just conquer.” Andross lowered his voice.\n“He can win through sheer patience, Karris. If he attacks us now? He could\nlose everything.”\n“But you’re counting on him waiting. Waiting gives you time to make\nsomething else happen that he can’t foresee.”\n“Time is on his side.”\n“Only if he wants to rule,” Karris said. And she thought of the look in\nhis eyes when she’d met with him, a look of hatred implacable.\nAndross tilted his head. “Of course he wants to rule. I just told you what\nhe’s done to prepare—”\n“To prepare for an assault on us. Koios doesn’t care how many of his\nown people die. What if he doesn’t want to rule? What if he just wants\nvengeance on all of us for what we’ve done? Regardless, it’s easier for him\nto build his new paradise on our graves.”\nAndross scowled, thinking it over, but then his scowl softened, and she\nalready knew what he was going to say. “We’ve no reason to believe what\nyou’re saying.”\n“I just gave you a reason,” Karris said.\n“Your intuition? That’s not reason. That’s exactly the opposite of reason;\nthat’s a feeling. A worry. You want to base our war plan on your intuition\nnow? Well! Let’s recall our spies. What a waste of time, trying to actually\nfind things out! We can just feel what our enemies are going to do from now\non! It’ll be so much more efficient!”\n“Has anyone told you recently how much of an asshole you are?”\n“No. But only because they’re afraid of me.”\n“Well, I’m not.” It was actually true at the moment she said it. And this,\ntoo, felt right. Her purpose was unfolding before her with every action that\nwas in line with the Blackguard she was and every word she spoke that was\ntrue.\n“Good for you. Are you going to say it now? Will it make you feel\nbetter?”\nKarris didn’t take the bait, didn’t call him an asshole or any of the other\nwords that so aptly applied.

Not now, but—”\n“I’m fighting alongside you, father. You ask yourself, Is your time so\nworthless that you can throw it away in fighting against me instead? I\nrequire less money than you might lose if a single galley with supplies were\nplundered on its way here from Ruthgar.”\nHe hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Very well, but if I let you do\nthis, then—”\n“No! This is not a trade. It’s not a game. You do what you must to save\nthe satrapies. That’s exactly what I’m doing, too.”\n“And when Ironfist arrives? You’ll do what you have to then, too?” he\nasked.\n“Yes,” she said, and she felt it to the core of her being: this, too, was\ntrue.\nAndross turned to go, but then stopped. “I’ve been intending to give you\na gift, but I’m afraid it’s fallen through.”\n“A gift?”\n“Yes. Gavin’s old room slave, Marissia. I know you have… missed\nhaving her help. It turns out she didn’t run away after all. She was\nkidnapped. I traced her to an island off the Ruthgari coast where she was\nimprisoned. But it turns out she escaped with the help of mercenaries or\npirates. One assumes she must have been desperate indeed to throw herself\non the mercies of such people, but at least they didn’t murder or enslave the\nservants on the island, so there is some reason to hope. Unfortunately, the\nlord those servants believed they were serving doesn’t actually exist, so I’ve\nno more leads on who took her in the first place. Anyway, I thought you’d\nlike to know you were right about her innocence, and that she is likely still\nalive. Who knows, maybe she’ll come back to take up her chains once\nmore.” He smiled thinly.\nNo, Marissia would fear she was labeled a runaway. She’d surely\nbelieve that if she returned they would sell her to some lesser house—if not\nto a brothel or the mines. It was unlikely she’d heard Gavin had manumitted\nher in his will. Even if she had, she’d still have good reasons to fear coming\nback.\nBut all this was a smokescreen, Karris knew. Andross had been the one\nwho’d ordered Marissia’s kidnapping. Not that she could tell him she knew\nthat.\nSo what did this mean? It was probably half true. He’d taken Marissia\noff the table himself, but had meant to keep her in reserve—thus, not\nmurder but kidnapping and imprisonment, likely on one of his own islands.\nBut then she’d escaped.\nGood for her.\nOh, Marissia, how do I let you know that I mean you no ill? I would\ngive you back your old position as spymaster in a second! But I couldn’t\nkeep you safe.\nGo, Marissia, go and find yourself a good life."

Just another innocent killed in this war. But one\nhas to be certain.” Teia shrugged.\nOrholam have mercy, is this who I’ve become? Casually threatening the\nmurder of innocents?\n“You’re not with them,” Halfcock said, stunned. “You’re hunting them!”\nObviously, the only Shadows he knew of were the Order’s assassins.\n“That’s—that’s—that’s wonderful! They were threatening me!”\n“Uh-huh.”\n“You have to believe me,” Halfcock said. “You have to believe me! I am\nnot in the Order. I swear by Orholam! I swear to God!”\nNow we’re getting somewhere. “Who’s Eliazar? Husband?” Teia asked.\n“Son,” Halfcock said, defeated. “From her first marriage.”\n“First marriage?”\n“Shit,” Halfcock said. “Look, can you let me—”\n“Do I look like a fool to you?”"

It’s so hard to tell what a traitor means when he uses that\nword. Which ‘us’?”\n“Us, us! I’m not a traitor! I mean the Blackguard. Come on! I had to\nkeep it secret from the Order.”\n“Now, why would you have to keep secrets from the Order?” Teia asked.\n“I never really followed them. I was waiting for the perfect moment to\nbetray them. I could run away if it were just me. I don’t have family, but\nAliyah does, and I knew the Order’s vengeance would be terrible. You have\nto believe me. I was going to redeem myself.”\n“Redeem yourself, huh? Now, what’d you do that requires redemption?”\n“Nothing. Nothing, I swear!”\n“Uh-huh.”\n“Please. I know you all hate me. I know I did stupid shit when I was a\nkid. Yeah, I was an asshole. But I was a kid. I’ve been paying for that for\nlonger than you’ve been alive. You’re gonna kill me for that? You want to\nknow why they gave me the name Halfcock?”\n“Not really,” Teia said.\n“Our trainer said I was so fast that if I were anyone else, he’d be\nwarning them about going off half-cocked. It was a compliment. But they\nhated me. So they called me Halfcocked around the trainers and Halfcock\neverywhere else. They told every new season of recruits I had the smallest\ncock in the Blackguard. They shit on everything good in my life. Samite\nwas the worst of ’em, fucking man-hating tribadist. You tell me, you think\nshe’s fast enough to hit me in the jaw if she didn’t throw that punch out of\nthe blue?”\n“I don’t care about any of this,” Teia said. “Are you stalling?” She\ndouble-checked her crystals.\n“Don’t kill me over an old lie,” Halfcock said.\n“I won’t kill you over anyone’s lies but yours,” Teia said. “You say you\nwere just infiltrating the Order? Fine. Give me the names you’ve learned.”\nHe blanched. “You know it’s not like that—”\n“I know it’s not supposed to be like that. Everyone’s supposed to keep\nthings carefully separate. But it just doesn’t work, does it? Is Aliyah in the\nOrder too? You’re not supposed to be dipping your quill in the Order’s ink.\nThat’d be enough to get you both killed. Good reason to keep things secret.\nHmm?”\n“No, no, no. She’s got nothing to do with them!”\nTeia believed him. She’d overheard the woman pressuring Halfcock to\nmake their relationship public.

Because I’m a\nBlackguard my handler made me skip all but the high holy days, so I didn’t\nhave many chances. And then… Most people are so careful, even with me.”\n“Even with you?” Teia echoed.\n“You ever been on a high holy day? The parties afterward tend to get\nsexual before dawn. We’re supposed to keep our faces and any identifying\ncharacteristics covered—but, well, I got popular among a certain set of the\nwomen, on account of, you know, my endowments.”\n“I bet you stayed late for the orgy just on the hopes of being a better spy,\nright?”\n“That’s right!” he said.\nNot keen on picking up sarcasm, old Halfcock.\n“So you found someone,” Teia said.\n“Not a name, an address. A little love nest she keeps for her affairs.\nShe’s newer, and careless, but I’m certain she’s from the nobility, and\nnobles tend to climb the Order’s ranks quickly. She wanted me to come\nmeet her—”\nAnd here’s where you lay your trap for me, Teia thought.\n“—but I never dared,” Halfcock finished.\n“What?” Teia asked.\n“I went by the place once. That’s how I know it’s a safe house. No one\nlives there, but it’s well maintained. But there was no way I was going to go\ninside and openly disobey the Order. I wouldn’t cheat on Aliyah that way,\neither.”\nBut an orgy is fair game?\nThe hypocrisy of the statement actually made Teia believe him a little\nmore, though.\n“You have nothing else?” Teia asked.\n“Nothing,” he said.\nShe wasn’t a skilled interrogator, but by the end of her talk with\nHalfcock, she learned one more thing: The Order had ‘something big’\nplanned for Sun Day. That was all he knew. Or maybe not on Sun Day.\nMaybe before. They would find out the specifics, he guessed, at their own\nritual on Sun Day Eve, which the Braxians called the Feast of the Dying\nLight.\nShe probed for more a dozen times, a dozen ways, trying to see if he\nknew something else, maybe without realizing it. She asked about how his\nhandler contacted him, how he knew where the meetings were on the high\nholy days, and a dozen other things—but he gave her nothing that helped.\nThe Order had morons in its ranks, but only at the bottom. Whoever was\ndirecting Halfcock had been very careful and very skillful, and Halfcock\nhad been too stupid or afraid to notice any patterns or slipups.\nBut still, he’d given Teia the next step up the Order’s ladder. It was just\nwhat she needed: a noblewoman who didn’t like to follow the rules that had\nkept the Order safe. Perfect.\n“If you were really going to spy on them, you’d have waited outside that\nsafe house,” Teia said. “You’d have watched and seen who walked in.”\n“No, no, please. I thought of that, but only after I’d hurried away. I was\nafraid of them. Please!”"

That’s why you have to die, because every\ntime it’s come down to it, you’ve done what they wanted. And that’s what\nyou’d do again.”\n“Please, I’m a loyal Blackguard.”\n“You’re not even loyal to your wife—if you’re not lying about that, too.\nBut just so you know, I’ll let her live.”\n“I was gonna change! Everything was gonna be different!”\n“I think you might even believe that,” Teia said. “But I don’t.”\nAnd then she killed him.\nBut something went wrong. Either there was some idiosyncrasy of his\nspine or Teia’s control wasn’t as fine as she thought. Instead of paralysis,\nshe hit some bundle of nerves that sent his entire body into racking\nconvulsions, bucking and flailing and screaming at a pitch and intensity\nshe’d never have guessed he would reach, or even that he could. His\nscreams shrieked like claws jagged across the slate of your mind and lodged\nin some animal part that begged you to run away or huddle in a corner,\nrocking back and forth, face to knees, ears plugged, whimpering.\nIt shook Teia’s cold calm a bit, to be honest.\nBut there was worse to come. That old cliché she’d heard? The one\nshe’d always figured men added to their war stories to make themselves\nsound tough, like they were better than weaker men or that the situation\nthey’d been through was so, so hard? That thing about grown men crying\nfor their mothers as they die? She’d always thought, Whatever, maybe that\nhappens once in a while, maybe. Maybe with child soldiers or boys who can\nbarely shave, but not with a grown man. Not with a warrior. Certainly, she\nthought, a man tougher than old saddle leather and more bitter than\nvinegared wine would never stop fighting. A hardened veteran weeping,\ntears and snot streaming unheeded down his face, gasping, “Mama help,\nmama help, mama, mama, mama…”?\nShe’d been so sure that never happened.\nHuh.\nChapter 49\nThe dead savaged in the lagoon behind him didn’t matter. The prophet and\nhis logorrhea had no meaning. The world beyond the mist curtain had\nceased to exist. Even the city, this nameless city below the black tower, held\nnothing to pique his curiosity.\nThis had been a waystation for pilgrims, once. The whole city had been\norganized around the physical and spiritual preparation of those who\nplanned to attempt the climb. At its heyday, it must have hosted thousands\nevery day.\nBut Gavin paid none of it any mind.\nOn the central boulevard, he found great mosaics of legends and saints\nancient even to the ancient peoples who had made them.

By the remains of their painted pictographic\nsigns, there had been cobblers and tailors and makers of packs and torches\nand walking sticks and bandages and dried meats and fruits. Doubtless a\nstreet or two back had housed the whorehouses and taverns, for all those\npilgrims who wished, one last time, to sample the favorite sins they’d come\nto leave behind. Now empty buildings stared out at him like skulls stripped\nof flesh and eyes.\nBut as every secondary tone had darkened to the chromatic blindness in\nGavin’s sole remaining eye, so every secondary voice in curiosity’s chorus\nhad fallen quiet in his ears. The soloist rose before him. The answer to all\nthings lay up there. And Karris’s salvation, too—if Gavin were strong\nenough.\nHe came out from the shade of two mighty overarching atasifusta trees\nand saw a great gate, open, flanked by two large statues. All the work of\nhuman hands stopped at the gate. Not an outbuilding lay beyond, only the\ntrail and jungle. The statues were warriors in identical scale armor and the\nspears common to the Tyrean era. But their faces were curious to Gavin:\none a typical Tyrean with a prominent nose and brow, perhaps woolier hair\nthan was common in Tyrea now, but the other one had flatter features, dark\nhair straight as wheat, and small eyes with a monolid like no one Gavin had\never seen.\n“Is this some race of the immortals? A people from beyond even the\nAngari?” Gavin asked. “Or is it some quirk of Tyrean art?”\nOrholam shrugged. “Look over here.”\nThere were ceremonial baths by the road, fed by a lively stream.\nThey drank and washed and thought of little else for a time. A mosaic\nwall behind the stone baths depicted men and women feasting and then\nwashing in its waters. There were among them men with such eyes as the\nstatue had, and other races and peoples Gavin had never seen in the Seven\nSatrapies. Men covered with tattoos and tall women and men half-sized,\nlike Blood Forest’s pygmies, though perhaps that was simply the ancient\nTyrean art’s way of depicting children.\nAll the figures were dressed in simple robes, and looked somber as they\nwashed.\nApparently the old Tyrean Empire had been more cosmopolitan than the\nSeven Satrapies, or some races of men had simply passed from the earth.\nGavin washed his body. Nothing like having salt water and sand\nbetween your butt cheeks as you started a hike that might take weeks.\nNo, not weeks. They didn’t have that long. Karris needed him to make it\nbefore Sun Day.\nBy the time Gavin was finished bathing, Orholam had washed himself,\nand had found water skins and clothing covered with odd pockets in airtight\nchests sealed with luxin. By their first good luck they’d had in a long time,\nthe skins and clothing were actually functional. Four hundred years old and\nyet functional?\nThen again, it was hardly the most astonishing magic here, so Gavin put\nit out of his mind.\nThat magic and their luck didn’t extend to finding any edible food,\nthough. Even the food they found likewise sealed away from the damp was,\nafter all this time, little more than dust."

Even the food they found likewise sealed away from the damp was,\nafter all this time, little more than dust.\nThe water and the salt fish would be enough for a week, though. Gavin\nhoped it would be enough.\nIt would have to be. He wasn’t going to take the time to fashion\nweapons, hunt animals, butcher and cure meat. He didn’t know if Karris\nhad that much time. Sun Day was coming.\nThey ate the fish, drank, filled the water skins, and then started. Old\nParian text adorned the ground just under the gate, a line reference of some\nsort?\nAh, a prayer. For the pilgrimage.\nOrholam spoke under his breath—saying the prayer, Gavin guessed, but\nhe wasn’t curious enough to find out if the old man recognized it, or knew\nOld Parian at all, for that matter. This whole trip had to be like a holy wet\ndream for the old kook.\nThe path was straight as an arrow’s flight through the jungle. Some\nsections had been displaced by roots and new growth, others washed out by\nmudslides. Elsewhere, entire trees had fallen over the path and melted into\nsoil, from which had bloomed flowers. But the path was impossible to lose.\nGavin kept an eye out for animals, but saw nothing larger than mice.\nThey climbed the crater’s rim. The ridge here descended to a circular\nswamp before the queer black stone itself began. The straightness of the\nroad had only aided its own erosion. Water from any rain cascaded fast\ndown what had once been the road and had washed away all its stone.\nThere was nothing for it but to try to cross the swamp while the sun was\nstill high.\nIt was muddy, mucky, brutal work, first sliding down the hill trying not\nto turn an ankle and then crossing the ooze, hoping not to plunge into some\nsinkhole or quicksand.\nOrholam insisted on going first, in thanks for Gavin saving his life.\nGavin followed in his footsteps. They didn’t speak.\nNor did they make it across the swamp before evening fell.\nGavin said, “Mosquitoes are proof that God hates us and wants us to be\nmiserable.”\n“I always thought of them as a strong hint to go inside and be with\nfriends beside the fire, and be done with the day’s labors.”\n“You’re kind of a look-on-the-bright-side guy, aren’t you?” Gavin asked.\n“I don’t really remember that about you, back on the oar.” He’d always\nbeen set apart, but then he’d been quietly pious, and though kind, he’d been\nmorose.\n“Life on the oar was its own life. Everything looks bright after that\ndarkness.”\nThe road was ruined on the other side by erosion, and the climb was\nmisery. It was almost dark when they reached the first white gate, beyond\nwhich began the tower path itself.\nThis was the first of eight such gates, Gavin thought, if there weren’t\nothers on the other side of the tower. He’d been studying the black\nmonstrosity all day. The tower was indeed a cylinder of equal thickness\nfrom foot to head, so the long path didn’t curl around the outside of the"

The tower was indeed a cylinder of equal thickness\nfrom foot to head, so the long path didn’t curl around the outside of the\ntower but rather was cut into the tower so pilgrims would have the black\nstone not only below them and to one side but also overhanging above them\nas well.\nAnd what black stone it was.\nWith only one good eye, and the other only good for monochrome,\nGavin had held on to a great deal of skepticism about what his initial\nimpression of the black stone was. Surely it couldn’t be obsidian. Not an\nentire tower of it, glittering dangerously.\nObsidian was precious beyond words. If the whole tower was actually\nmade of it, the pilgrims of old would have made off with all of it, and\nobsidian would no longer be as precious as it was.\nBut as they stood mere paces away from it now, it could be nothing else\n—unless there was some kind of hex here, fooling his eye.\nOrholam appeared unfazed and was washing himself at a great stone\nbasin off to one side before the gate, again fed with fresh running water off\nthe tower side. Either the ancients had been quite a thirsty lot or they’d been\nobsessed with ritual cleanliness.\nThere was nothing ritual, though, about Gavin cleaning the muck from\nhis legs and clothes. Again.\nAs the sun set, they finally confronted the gate itself, with its own statue\nof an immortal beyond it. The gate was fully as wide as the trail (though he\nthought he might be able to climb around the outside of it). The drop here\nwas only thirty feet. The gate was starkly white against all the light-sucking\nblack of the tower, its pearlescence shining in the sunset (probably pink,\nGavin guessed). There were three mighty locks on it, side by side. Each\nlabeled.\n“My Old Parian vocabulary is limited,” Gavin said. “Any idea?”\nOrholam said, “The locks are Confession, Contrition, and Satisfaction.”\n“Not much good as locks, are they? The keys are still in them.”\n“Perhaps you should be grateful that the guardians who had to abandon\nthis place decided that their own desire to save a relic of the place holiest to\nthem should be suborned to the possible needs of strangers living long after\nthem to make this climb.”\n“Fine,” Gavin said, “I’m the asshole.” He turned Confession, and the\nlock turned as smoothly as Andross Guile pivoting to stab you in the back.\n“I’m sorry,” Gavin said.\nHe turned Contrition.\n“I won’t do it again. Happy?”\nHe turned Satisfaction, and gave his best old Gavin Guile grin—marred\nsomewhat, no doubt, by his missing dogtooth.\nOrholam said, “There’s a difference between charming and winsome.\nYou’re more the latter when you’re less the former, Man of Guile. Shoes.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Leave your shoes. We walk now on holy ground.”\n“Are you serious? I haven’t got time for this.”\n“You’ve got all the time you need as long as your feet are touching the\nholy mountain.”\nGavin sighed. The obsidian of the path was polished, so it wasn’t like he\nhad that as an excuse, and the old man was going to keep harping on this."

The obsidian of the path was polished, so it wasn’t like he\nhad that as an excuse, and the old man was going to keep harping on this.\nHe took off his shoes and moved forward onto the path. It was wide\nenough here for ten abreast, and the overhanging ceiling high enough not to\ninvoke his claustrophobia.\nThe open gate revealed to the left an array of stones of varying sizes,\nand to the right, another statue, her paint worn thin by the elements. Her\nhead was bowed, and at her bare feet, dropped from open hands, lay a\nscepter.\n“Behold the spirit of Humility,” Orholam said. “Here, you may expiate\nyour Pride, the foundation of all sins. Here pilgrims select a stone to carry,\nsymbolic of their own pride.”\n“Well, one would hate to offend local customs,” Gavin said. He started\nto reach for the smallest of the stones.\n“Hold,” Orholam said. “A word about the pilgrimage, before you make a\nmistake you’ll regret.”\n“There are booby traps?” Gavin asked.\n“No!” Orholam said as if it were the stupidest thing he’d ever heard.\n“Why would luxiats try to kill people who are seeking Orholam? You want\nto know what your whole problem is, Guile?”\n“Not really—”\n“You’ve always feared men where you should have feared God.”\n“That… is at least half true.”\n“Shut up!” Orholam said. “Before you begin, do consider if you really\nwish to undertake this pilgrimage flippantly. Here’s how it works. At each\nlevel, you’ll pick a burden to carry representing your sin. At the next gate,\nyou’ll trade in your burden for a small stone, commonly called a boon\nstone, a mark of how far you made it.”\n“Ah, thus the pockets!” Gavin said, pulling at one of the seven funny-\nshaped pockets on his ancient tunic.\n“When you arrive at the top—if you do—you may present them to\nOrholam, as a tribute that He makes holy. Some say that for each stone you\npresent, Orholam grants a boon. Me, I don’t think Orholam’s favor can be\nbought.”\nThose are two different kinds of favors, Gavin thought. But he said\naloud, “So everyone gets seven favors?”\n“Few, I think, got the chance to test it.”\nThis was starting to feel like an old magisters’ examination. But fine,\nhe’d passed plenty of those, often in ways that infuriated the magisters. He\ncould do so again.\n“If I pick the wrong rock, do I not get the boon stone?” Gavin asked.\n“No, but it’s written,” Orholam said, “that you will find the correct stone\nto be the lightest burden.”\n“So the stones know somehow?” Gavin asked. “Clever, for stones.”\n“You’ve seen greater magic. Done greater yourself.”\n“No, I believe it. But, well, if you have stones here that weigh a man’s\nsins, I should like to take some home. Come in right handy when\nadjudicating disputes.”\n“You could ask Orholam for that favor, if you wish.”"

Come in right handy when\nadjudicating disputes.”\n“You could ask Orholam for that favor, if you wish.”\nGavin moved toward one of the smaller stones. “So can I try a few…”\n“The first stone you touch is the stone you take, for good or ill.” He put\nhis hands on his hips. “Are you really going to try to cheat a pilgrimage?”\n“No!” Gavin said. He didn’t sound convincing even to his own ears.\n“Consider carefully, please.”\n“Consider what? The stones?” Gavin asked.\n“Yes, those, in a moment, but no. Consider how you wish to start on this\npath. Start as you intend to go. You’ll reap what you’re planting.”\n“What’s this thing?” Gavin asked, spotting an odd depression carved in\nthe inner wall. He poked his head in. It looked like a chute, such as certain\nwaterfalls carve. But—unfortunately—it was far too steep, slippery, and\nwide for him to climb directly. If he were hoping for a shortcut, he might as\nwell simply scale the sheer walls of the tower instead.\n“Lest you fear that hiking so burdened will slow you too much, know\nthat this is where the celestial realms overlap the mundane. Time works\ndifferently here. Your first attempt will take less than two weeks, though\nhere it will feel like only days have passed, so you’ll finish by Sun Day, if\nyou aren’t too much of a sluggard. That’s considered the most blessed day\npossible, naturally. You’re highly favored to even have the chance.”\n“I feel real lucky,” Gavin said.\n“Your second attempt will feel like it takes the same amount of time, but\nduring the attempt a year will pass. During the third, a decade.”\n“You get multiple chances?”\n“Some people refuse to learn easy lessons, even repeated ones, yet still\ndon’t give up.”\n“Fools, you mean,” Gavin said.\nOrholam raised his eyebrows as if Gavin saying this was a bit rich. But\ninstead of the stern rebuke Gavin had expected, Orholam said, “Gentleness\nsuits you better. I know you’re not without it.”\nFor some reason, it quieted Gavin. He wanted to mock all this, all this\nholiness that had spilled rivers of blood. He wanted to punish Orholam for\nall the bitterness in his own heart. But Gavin had to climb regardless.\nWhat if he climbed and failed, then had to worry that it had been his\nfailure, not anyone else’s? Taking it seriously wouldn’t cost him much of\nanything except his own sanctimonious attitude—and it might gain Karris\nher life.\nWhether Orholam Himself or a nexus of magic awaited Gavin at the top\nof this climb, he had to get there in order to find out. Everything might\ndepend on him taking this seriously.\nGrinwoody had said Gavin had to kill the magical nexus called Orholam\nby Sun Day or Karris would die. How would the Old Man of the Desert\neven know?\nBut actually, if Gavin killed all magic in the world, then everyone\neverywhere would know it right away.\n“Woo!” he said. “Let’s expiate us some sins!” But though his tone was\nlight, his heart was not.\nOrholam didn’t reprimand him."

He nudged the biggest stone to test its\nweight.\nIt rolled easily under his foot.\nShit.\nChapter 50\n“Lord Luíseach,” one of the new Mighty, Einin, said with a heavy accent as\nshe entered Kip’s dusty command tent. “The Cwn y Wawr captured a man\non the road. Claims to be a messenger.” Every one of the Mighty was\nextraordinary, but Einin stood out.\nA huntress married to a farmer from some close-knit community far in\nthe highlands, she was thirty years old (ancient compared to the rest of the\nMighty), had borne ten children in her fourteen years of marriage, and had\nleft her eight surviving children in her husband’s care to come fight as soon\nas she heard about the White King’s invasion. She’d found that her natural\naffinity for animals stemmed from a previously unknown ability to draft\norange, red, and sub-red. Though she’d failed the requisite tests of strength\nfour times, her speed, marksmanship, astonishingly keen intuition, and\nintellect had won her a place with the Mighty. Cruxer said the woman also\nhad the pain tolerance of… well, a woman who’d borne ten children and\nclaimed to enjoy the experience.\nKip had once idly asked her how she managed to go hunting when she’d\nhad young children and her husband himself was out in the fields, before\nrealizing that was how a close-knit community works. But she’d said\ninstead, ‘Some women thrive when they can be with their brats all day. Me?\nI’m a better mom when I can get out regularly and kill something.’\nThen she’d laughed.\n“High Lady Tisis Guile requests the honor of your presence for the\ninterrogation,” Einin said. Her mouth twisted. “Eh… milord.”\n“Yes?” Kip asked, thinking she had something else to say. And what was\nit with the formality?\n“Nothing?” she said. “Oh, shi—sorry. Ahem. I’m still sortin’ when I’m\ns’posed to add the ‘milord’s and all. Apologies. Er, my lord.”\nStanding beside Kip, Cruxer was rubbing his temples. “Smart woman, I\nswear she is,” he mumbled.\n“It’s simple enough,” Kip told Einin. He spoke quickly. “Every time you\nthink you’re supposed to add a ‘milord,’ don’t. And every time you think"

        "text": "swear she is,” he mumbled.\n“It’s simple enough,” Kip told Einin. He spoke quickly. “Every time you\nthink you’re supposed to add a ‘milord,’ don’t. And every time you think\nyou probably don’t need to, do. And enunciate it fully ‘my lord’ every third\ntime. Any more than that and people will think you’re being sarcastic; any\nless and they’ll think you’re showing disrespect. Also make sure you pay\nattention to how often other people use name, surname, and full title—\nthere’s some nuances to it that are hard to explain, but really important, and\nmost lords interpret mistakes as insults. Got it? Then, lead on!”\nCruxer could barely contain his laughter as Einin preceded them out of\nthe tent, looking bewildered. He said, “You know she scares the hell out of\nthe rest of the Mighty, right?”\n“She kind of scares the hell out of me,” Kip said.\n“What do you think of Milard?” Cruxer said, pronouncing it just a bit off\nfrom how Einin’s accent rendered ‘milord.’\n“As a Mighty name for her? Pretty much perfect. She’s gonna hate it!”\nhe said happily.\n“It’s a good kind of hate,” Cruxer said with a smile.\nKip thought maybe he’d already gone crazy. He’d checked Cruxer’s\nhalos, but he couldn’t blame it on luxin.\nAll he knew was that the weeks of torturous riding through hard country\nwas the most joyful time of his life. He was riding toward his death; he’d\nnever felt more alive: Connected with his bride, even when she wept on his\nchest in the cool privacy of their tent as he stroked her hair. Unified with the\nMighty, granted the respect of men he respected profoundly. Filled with a\nsense of purpose that the course that lay before them was true and right and\nworthy, and all of them working at the very limit of their abilities.\nKip felt that all the disparate strands of his life were coming together.\nThis was to be the final test. He was at the peak of his skills and strength\nand power, and either it would prove to be enough or he would fail utterly.\nThere was something to be said for moments of crisis that announce\ntheir coming beforehand, rather than leap at you from the shadows.\nHis use of the Great Mirror for signal-casting would help the army he\nwas leaving behind enormously. Few of the old minor mirrors were still\nfunctional, and fewer still had acknowledged messages (meaning the locals\nwere afraid to answer, had fled, or were ignorant of the mirrors’ use), but\ntwo mirrors in the south and southeast parts of the Forest had answered, and\nwere passing messages to the Night Mares in their areas. Those were the\nfastest of Kip’s forces, and they’d be able to reach many other will-casters\nand rush to join the siege at Green Haven.\nThey would be no help to his own forces. No matter how he’d love to\nhave them in any battle, he couldn’t exactly bring will-cast bears and\njaguars and tygre wolves and giant elk into a city. The Jaspers had cats but\nfew dogs, and those required an exorbitant license fee. Kip had only\nrecently realized that what he’d thought was a weird cultural idiosyncrasy"

There were few domestic animals on the Jaspers by\ndesign: the ancient Chromeria had feared being infiltrated and attacked by\nwill-casters.\nStill, two hundred of the Cwn y Wawr war dogs and their handlers had\njoined his sprint for the coast, and where the Chromeria would have barred\nwild animals from landing on their islands (or been forced to accept\nheretical will-casting), everyone on both sides could pretend the war dogs\nwere simply highly trained dogs.\nThey found the grubby man bound and guarded. An equally grubby\nmessenger bag lay before him, open and empty.\nThe rest of the Mighty—the old original crew—was already gathered.\n“Where is it?” Kip asked.\n“There isn’t any scroll,” Tisis said. “He claims he memorized it, and\nwhen he started, I stopped him so you could hear it first.”\n“Who’s it from?” Kip asked.\nThe messenger spoke up. “My mistress says the name you would\nrecognize as being hers is Aliviana Danavis, though it referred to one so\nutterly changed as to be unrecognizable.”\nLiv?!\n“Where is she?” Kip asked.\n“When I left her, she was in Azuria Bay. She directed me to give my\nmessage before answering any other questions, though, your pardon. With\nyour permission, my lord?”\nKip waved the room clear of everyone but the Mighty, then nodded.\nThe messenger took a deep breath, then spoke, obviously recalling\nwords verbatim: “‘Kip, Lord Guile. Who I used to be felt something for\nyou. I am not she anymore. I’m not secretly on your side. I’m not going to\nsave the day for you and stab Koios in the back. You’re my hedged bet.\nShould you fight us where I think you will, I ask you fight me last. Should\nyou win, I ask exile rather than death. Should we win, though, I’ll be unable\nto give you the same.\n“‘It’s no fair trade. Therefore, without obligation that you give me\nanything back, I tender to you something first: The White King plans to\nattack the Jaspers directly. He’s already constructed barges to carry all his\nmen, and will float all the bane with them, paralyzing the Chromeria’s\ndrafters. You’ll need to attack before he leaves Ruthgar to have a chance\nagainst him.’”\nBig Leo bellowed a curse, picking up the man and shaking him. “That\nmessage would have been really fucking helpful three weeks ago!”\nTisis put a hand on Big Leo’s arm, and he put the man down, but he\ncontinued to breathe heavily, as if on the very point of murderous rage.\nIt was an act—the warm, kindly Tisis and the murderous brute—but it\nwas surprisingly effective.\n“When were you sent?” Tisis asked gently.\n“My lady sent me more than a month ago. I, uh, got caught behind\nenemy lines.”\n“Which enemy? Us?” Cruxer demanded.\n“Yes?” the man said, pained. But then his eyes became haunted. “There\nwere these huge dogs, but not dogs.

They\ngave signals to each other like men, searched in grids like disciplined\nsoldiers, and then—I saw them run a man down with speed and tear him\napart with a fury and savagery that no snarling dog has ever matched. I saw\nit from afar, and I ran, and I couldn’t—I couldn’t…”\nHe could say no more.\nHe didn’t have to.\nIt was sometimes easy to lose perspective on what Kip’s army had\nbecome. His will-casters called themselves Night Mares. A joke, if a grim\none.\nBut it was no joke to the men and women who fought an armored war\ndog the size of a horse.\n“She messed up,” Tisis said. “She tells us exactly what she means to do?\nBut also without worrying we might take offense at it. Who does that? She\ndoesn’t try to mislead us into hoping she’s still your friend, Kip? Why?\nBecause she thinks the deal itself is clearly good enough. This is the\nhyperrationality of a superviolet wight lost deep in her color. She’s still\nthere, but she’s not in control anymore. Because if you weighed them on a\nscale, the power of a dog is nothing compared to the power of a god; she\nsends a man without considering that phobias are irrational.”\n“I dunno that I’d call war-dog-o-phobia irrational,” Ferkudi said. “I’ve\nseen what those dogs can do.”\n“I’d side with Ferk on this—pray to Orholam that never happens again,”\nBen-hadad said. “The dog was here, she’s not. A man afraid of both is going\nto react to his fear of the one that’s closest.”\n“Is a goddess ever really absent?” Tisis asked. “You remember that\nsuperviolet lux storm last year that was, like, looking for you? She sent that\nfrom Orholam alone knows how far away. What might she do now when\nshe’s so much closer?”\n“Well,” Ferk said, “so much for that.”\n“So much for what?” Kip asked. You never knew what brilliant insight\nFerkudi might offer.\n“Looks like I’m going to have to change underwear. Again. Third time\ntoday.”\nOr not offer.\n“Third time?” Winsen asked.\n“Eh, I’ve been timing exactly how fast I can empty my bladder when it’s\ntotally full. You know, to make marching more efficient—”\n“Forget I asked,” Winsen said.\nBut Ferkudi went on. “See, you scratch a trench parallel to the line of\nmarch and have the men relieve themselves in ranks as they reached it.\nEliminate bathroom breaks or soiled clothing altogether. I had it down to a\ncount of twelve this morning… I thought.”\nTisis was rubbing her face.\n“Yeah,” he said to her, “more like a fourteen count.”\n“What do we do with this one?” Big Leo asked, rattling his thick\nfighting chain that was looped around the messenger’s thin neck."

He\ndidn’t come under a flag of truce, nor openly, nor unarmed. Why should he\nget covered by those rules? I think he’s more like a spy.”\n“I suppose it all depends on how we frame the problem, huh?” Cruxer\nasked, pensive.\n“Liv is gone,” Kip said, mostly to himself.\n“In more than one way,” Ben-hadad muttered.\n“She’s sailed,” Kip said to the messenger, but mostly thinking aloud.\n“So we have no mistress to send you back to. And I can’t let you go without\nrisking it costing me lives. You’re a Blood Robe, albeit one the White King\nwould hang as a traitor with that message you’ve told us. Maybe you’d try\nto bring him back some intelligence valuable enough that you’d hope would\nmake him spare you.”\nThe man said, “No, I wouldn’t. I swear—”\nHe stopped as soon as Kip started talking, though. Power means never\nhaving to shout to be heard. Kip said, “You’re a man alone with no friends\nand many enemies, a soldier of a pagan rebel you betrayed, the servant of\nan absent goddess you failed. And now you’re a problem for me.”\n“I’ll take care of it,” Winsen said emotionlessly.\nKip took a deep breath, thinking.\n“Wait, wait, wait—” the man said, sinking to his knees, staring at\nWinsen with horror.\n“You don’t get a voice in this,” Big Leo said, his voice a low rumble.\n“One last part of the message!” the man said. “Look! This is valuable!”\n“Get on with it,” Big Leo said.\nDesperate, the messenger talked, tripping over himself. “She said—she\nsaid if you could draw them into a fight at, at, at Paedrig’s Field near Apple\nGrove that you could win. Demolish them. She said she’d activated the\nGreat Mirror there for you. And she said if you made it by… hold on, I can\nremember this. She said you needed to provoke the battle by um, two\nhundred twelve days after the Festival of Ambrose Ultano.”\nKip squinted. “What the hell, Liv?” It was a minor local festival in\nRekton celebrated by little more than the cooking of fruit pies. Obviously,\nshe’d picked the date in order to obscure it from anyone who might get the\nmessenger to talk. Worse, it was a floating date based on the lunar calendar.\n“Well, that doesn’t sound like a trap at all,” Winsen said.\n“Shut up, Win,” Cruxer said.\n“Is that an order, sir?”\n“Just shut up.”\nAfter doing the arithmetic in his head, twice, Kip called Ferkudi over\nand whispered to him for a bit.\n“Yep, yep,” Ferkudi said too loudly—the man was utterly guileless.\n“That’s either tomorrow, or more likely yesterday, depending on how you"

And if we push, and the river is passable all the way—unlikely,\nright?—but we could get to Apple Grove in… two days. More likely three\nor four.”\n“So there’s no way we can get there by tomorrow?” Kip asked.\nFerkudi laughed. “No. Unless you can steal Orholam’s own chariot like\nPhaethon or make a machina like a skimmer for the skies.”\nHe’d meant them both as similar impossibilities, but it made Kip think\nof his father and the condor he’d made. Too bad he’d never told Kip how to\nconstruct one. Nor did Kip have his father’s mind of how to invent things.\nBesides, the condor had needed a vast body of water to build up the\nrequisite speed to glide. Kip didn’t have that, either.\nLow curses were muttered all around. No one trusted Aliviana Danavis,\nbut if she was on their side, she’d just told them it was too late for them to\nwin.\nThe messenger saw the black looks directed toward him. If the man had\ndelivered his message when he was supposed to, they would have had a\nchance.\n“You may have killed us all by dodging your duty,” Cruxer snarled at\nthe man. “Your cowardice. You knew what you had to do, and you couldn’t\nsimply do it, could you? Could you!” There was a depth of rage there that\nput the Mighty to glancing at each other.\n“W-w-wait! She said, she said, she said for when you were done\nlistening to her offer and were dismissing me, she said to tell you, ‘This\nman is as much a treasure to me as Ramir’s esteem was, back in Rekton.\nPlease lavish commensurate honors upon him.’”\nThe man breathed again. He wet dry lips with his tongue. His eyes lit\nwith hope as everyone turned to Kip.\n“Oh, you have got to be joking,” Big Leo said. “We have to let him go?\nGive him stuff? He’s a spy!”\n“That isn’t what she said,” Ben-hadad said, adjusting his spectacles.\n“Not necessarily. Breaker?”\nIt was an odd dislocation into memory. All his best friends were here,\nbut they hadn’t known the old Kip, when he’d lived in Rekton. They didn’t\nshare that life, those friends, those allegiances, fears, hatreds, and loathing.\nThe momentary reverie had apparently stretched beyond momentary,\nbecause Cruxer cleared his throat. “Since no one else is, I’ll go ahead and\nask the obvious: Lord Guile? How much did Aliviana Danavis value this\nRamir’s esteem?”\nBut Kip didn’t answer. He had a vivid memory of being wildly\ninfatuated with Liv and talking with her when she’d been back from the\nChromeria once. As he was nervously trying to make conversation with the\nolder, pretty girl, Kip had said Ram thinks this, Ram thinks that, maybe\nthree or four times. Ramir had opinions about everything.

Grow up!’\nIt had been highly confusing to him, being called a bootlicker and a\nbaby but being praised at the same time.\nOrholam’s stones, it was embarrassing even to recall it.\nShe’d been right, too. Not that it mattered to the present situation, except\nthat it verified the message was from her, and that it was going to be a bad\nday for her messenger.\n“He’s not having one of his trances again, is he?” Ferkudi asked.\n“No,” Tisis answered quietly. But she didn’t prod him for an answer.\nResigned that they were going to have to give Kip some time to think it\nover, Ben-hadad looked over at Ferkudi. “What if a guy gets a shy\nbladder?”\n“Huh? What’s that?” Ferkudi asked.\nBen said, “You know, needs to pee, gets up to the trench, feels like\npeople are watching, can’t pee. Too much pressure.”\n“That’s a thing?” Ferkudi asked, thunderstruck.\n“It’s a thing,” Winsen said.\n“That is not a thing,” Ferkudi protested. “You gotta pee, you gotta pee.”\n“It’s a thing,” Big Leo rumbled. “I’m kind of a shy-bladder gentleman\nmyself.”\n“Really?” Ben-hadad asked him. “Never noticed that about you.”\n“Huh,” Ferkudi said. “I did not know that’s a thing. That would explain\nsome things that happened at the latrines when I was gathering data.”\n“And what were the women supposed to do, pee in the same trench? At\nthe same speed?” Ben-hadad asked with a grin. “Were you going to run\ndrills until they got up to snuff?”\n“Of course. All those problems were next,” Ferk said soberly. “But…\nwell, I hung out by the privies and approached a lot of women to help me\nwith my experiments, but I had real trouble finding volunteers. Not a single\nwoman would help.”\n“You’ll find those women in a different part of the camp,” Winsen said\ndryly. “And they’ll expect to be paid.”\nThe rest of them laughed. Even Cruxer cracked a grin.\nOrholam help him, even the poor messenger smiled.\n“I don’t get it,” Ferkudi said. “You mean the tanners?”\nBut Kip turned toward the messenger. “Liv hated Ramir with a passion.\nShe said his opinion was dung I should throw in a fire.”\nEveryone fell silent. The man froze, wide-eyed. Throw in a fire?\nKip continued, “So your goddess is letting me know I can kill you\nwithout offending her. She framed the words to deceive you, thinking your\ngreed would drive you here.”\n“What a bitch,” Tisis whispered.\n“Not even loyal to her own,” Winsen said.\n“She didn’t understand loyalty even before she went wight,” Kip said."

A year\nand a couple weeks of servitude, and your oath not to return to the fight.”\n“Only a year?” the man asked, suddenly hopeful again. Funny how fast\nour hopes can shrink.\n“Anyone holding you past that date will face death.” If our laws matter\nat all a year from now.\nKip pursed his lips as the man walked willingly to the blacksmith to be\nbranded.\nAnd that is how I justify becoming a slaver.\nTisis came to his side. “So we’re headed to Apple Grove now? Even\nthough it’s either too late or a trap?”\nKip looked at her, pained.\nChapter 51\nThe door swung open silently, revealing the profile of a scrawny young\nscholar scratching a parchment with sure, fluid strokes while he studied a\nparchment whose fat, twin rolls dominated his desk.\n“Are you here to kill me?” Quentin asked, not looking up to see who’d\ncome into his recently locked room.\n“No,” Teia grunted, tucking away her picks.\n“Then, one moment, please.” He finished the long sentence he’d been\nwriting. Then he used a boar’s-hair brush and soapy water to clean the gold\nnib of his quill, shook a bit of fine sand on the damp ink, opened a case, and\nput away all his accoutrements. He grabbed a folded parchment from the\nbox before closing it away.\nThere was some essential rightness to seeing Quentin with his scrolls\nand quills. His was a quieter excellence than Kip’s drafting or Cruxer’s\nflowing through the fighting forms, or Tlatig with her bow, but Teia knew\nthat his mind was doing things that hers could never grasp.\nWhen he looked up and saw Teia, his face showed no surprise.\n“Of course it’s you,” he said. “Orholam wants us to be whole, does He\nnot?”\nTeia didn’t really want a sermon from a traitor. She tossed her orders on\nthe table. In Karris’s hand they read, ‘Quentin will be your handler, and will\nserve you in all ways. Trust him absolutely. Don’t get him killed. I have\nplans for him.’\n“What were your orders?” she asked.\n“Karris told me the one who came would be my master and maybe even\nmy friend. She said I needed to learn how to have both.”\nTeia was suddenly embarrassed for him. “I’m sorry,” she said suddenly.\n“Maybe… maybe for a lot of things.”\n“I’m not,” he said. “Just for the one thing. Nothing else.”\n“‘The one thing’? What do you mean?” she asked.\nHe looked at her, clear-eyed and steady. “Murdering Lucia, of course."

She sat, and her blood\nwent cold at the heading of his notes: ‘Mist Walking: Myths/Speculation,\nAncient/Modern, & Educated Guesses.’\nHer heart stopped. “Did she tell you I…?”\nHe shook his head. “Paryl. I think early on you must’ve believed it was\nuseless, didn’t you? Otherwise, you’d never have told anyone that you\ncould use it. Hard to explain why you would qualify for Blackguard training\nif you were a mund, though, one supposes. Anyway, I found that a number\nof the books with the best information about Mist Walkers weren’t even in\nthe restricted libraries. You have to know which authors to trust, of course,\nbut this hasn’t been the hardest research I’ve done, by any means. Now,\nwith you to tell me which information is true and which is exaggerated, I\ncan winnow out which authors were fabulists or given to exaggeration\namong those I don’t already know.”\nOnly then did he seem to notice the stricken look on her face.\n“Teia, what’s wrong? I thought you would be excited.”\n“Quentin, do you have any idea what I’m involved in?”\n“I thought that would be obvious,” he said.\nShe gestured: ‘Go on.’\n“You’re trying to discover how the most-likely-mythical Order of the\nBroken Eye was able to achieve whatever small measure of light diffraction\nthey were, to the extent that latter storytellers would so grandiosely call it\n‘invisibility,’ but which, according to the eminent leader of the Eighth Stoa,\nUlgwar Pen, was more akin to good camoufla… What are you doing with\nthat hood?”\nTeia went invisible. Karris had said to trust him absolutely, right?\nShe held Quentin’s gaze for a moment, knowing that her eyes would be\nvisible while receiving light. Then she dipped her head to disappear\ncompletely.\nHis mouth dropped open, and Teia couldn’t suppress a giggle.\nThat seemed to completely flip his apple cart.\nTeia dropped the invisibility just as Quentin went wild-eyed.\n“That—that… Ulgwar Pen had no idea what he was talking about!”\nQuentin said. “That liar! Everyone trusted—he made his reputation on that\npaper! There goes half my report!” He rubbed his temples. “That prompts\nthe question: Was he deceived, or just wrong?

I’m on all the wrong questions,\naren’t I? Tell me.”\nTeia removed her hood. “The Order is real. They’re assassinating people\nto this day. Not far away, either. They’ve been at work in the Chromeria\nitself. Karris assigned me to infiltrate their ranks and destroy them utterly, at\nany cost. You understand? I’m to do anything at all. Everything,” Teia said.\n“I’ve had to kill innocents to prove myself, and even that hasn’t been\nenough. Some of them trust me, but… one of their best assassins is hunting\nme. If I’m lucky, he alone suspects me. I can’t run away, because I still have\na chance to stop them—and if I run, they’ll kill my father.”\nIt was hilarious to see Quentin’s brain explode twelve ways with\nbafflement. Under the strain of all she’d been through in the past year,\nTeia’s sense of humor had gone so dark she couldn’t see a dead-baby joke\nin front of her face. But the surprising part was how much of a relief it was\nsimply to share—with Quentin! The last person in the world she would\nhave thought would understand her new terrible life.\nBut the awful weight of her secret was halved instantly.\nThey talked, they planned, they shared what had happened in their lives\n—each holding back at least some parts, Teia could tell. She couldn’t bring\nherself to tell Quentin about all the awful shit she’d done. But strangely,\nwith how he reacted to the merely bad shit she did share, and the elliptical\nreferences to worse, she could imagine eventually telling him more. Maybe\neverything.\nShe’d expected him to radiate condemnation, but without pretending he\nknew exactly what she’d experienced, instead he radiated sorrow at what\nshe’d been through, and acceptance of her, without accepting all she’d\ndone.\nShe didn’t know how he did that, but the tight knot in Teia’s chest eased\na little. She still felt like she was growing old too fast, like her youth was\ndraining away like water through sand. But for an afternoon, she didn’t feel\nlike she was dying.\n“I made up a joke,” Teia said suddenly, as their time was winding down.\n“Oh yeah? How’s it go?” Quentin asked.\nShe suddenly realized her joke was not one to share with a holy man.\nTrue, some of the Blood Forest luxiats were known to be a bit earthy\nfrom time to time, but on the whole, luxiats were not known for their ribald\nsenses of humor. And Quentin, who didn’t even like to hug, wasn’t\nsomeone Teia could imagine ever being called ‘earthy.’\nShe grimaced. “Nah, sorry. Forget I said anything. It’s crude.”\n“I’ve never heard a crude joke before,” Quentin said.\n“You haven’t?” she asked. She didn’t think the luxiats were quite so far\nremoved from—“Oh. You’re kidding.”\n“Try me,” he said.\n“It’s not… it’s not even very funny.” She sank into herself."

Is that\nactually the proper name for—”\n“It was actually a joke,” he said.\nShe stopped. “Oh.”\n“Pretty bad, huh? Now you owe me a bad joke. C’mon, I even made it\nbe a fart joke,” he said. “Meet me halfway here.”\n“Okay. Fine.” She tried to think of a different joke quickly. Something\nless gross. Some actual fart joke she’d heard. There had been off-color\njokes in the barracks every day. But of course now she couldn’t think of a\nsingle one.\nShe covered her face with her hands. I can’t believe I’m doing this. “So I\nwas out following a bad guy, and he’d gone inside this hovel with what I\nthought was his mistress and I had to wait for them to finish fu… meeting.”\nShe grimaced. “Anyway, when I first started doing this, I thought I was\ngoing to be like an avenging ghost, and all of a sudden I thought I was more\nlike a fox, like my old shimmercloak—it had a fox on it?” This is awful.\n“Like I’m this fierce, keen, silent hunter who stalks unseen at night to kill,\nyou know?”\n“Uh-huh?” Quentin said.\n“But then I thought, well, I don’t only work at night, so I’m not entirely\nnocturnal. More like nocturnal-y.” The worst joke ever. “But I am really\nfocused on my missions. So, you know, I’m really worried about my\nnocturnal-y missions. So I thought, I’m not a fox. I’m a teenage boy!”\nQuentin stared at her blankly.\n“You know, a, a…”\nNothing. Total blank.\n“What’s a nocturnal emission?” Quentin asked.\nThe blood drained out of her face. No, no. Hell, no. She was not going\nto explain that!\n“I think I’ve heard the term before,” Quentin said, “but when I looked it\nup, it wasn’t in any of the luxiats’ dictionaries. Is it a specialized term?\nFrom what field? I’m so sorry, the whole joke hinges on that, and I’ve failed\nyou. Maybe you could define it for me and then tell me the whole joke\nagain?”\nBut then she noticed a tiny twitch of his lips.\n“You asshole!” she said.\nHe burst out laughing. “Ah! the look on your face!”\n“Goddammit, Quentin!”\n“Easy, easy with the blasphemy!” he said, still laughing.\nOh, that was right. “Sorry, sorry,” she said.

Swearing and jokes about\nwet dreams were fair game, but saying ‘God’ was out of bounds. Or was it\nthe ‘damn’ part? Her mouth twisted. “We are really different from each\nother, aren’t we?”\n“Oh, absolutely,” he said. “But… also very much alike. I mean, you\ncould say I’m like a fox and you’re like a teenage—”\n“Quentin!”\nThey both laughed, and Teia realized that for a precious hour, she hadn’t\nfelt alone.\nAnd when she left to go do more terrible, necessary things, she banked\nthat memory like a little glowing ember in her heart. She would take it out\nlater, and breathe on it, and bask in that little warm glow.\nThat, that right there, is what it feels like to be human. That’s what it\nfeels like to have a friend.\nShe didn’t know what her future held, but she knew she would need it.\nChapter 52\n“Satrap Corvan Danavis is bringing his fleet here. To celebrate Sun Day\nwith the Chromeria, he says,” the diplomat Anjali Gates said.\nKarris’s breath caught. “‘Fleet’? So our spies were right? But how’d he\nget a fleet? How could he afford that? The new Tyreans have nothing. Do\nyou have any guesses on the number of drafters? Soldiers?”\nThe older woman fanned herself, though the morning was cool in\nKarris’s rooms high in the Chromeria. The head of the diplomatic corps had\ncome out of retirement to serve in the satrapies’ time of need, and had\nproven herself a dozen times over.\n“Not guesses. He told me the numbers himself, and from my experience,\nwhat he said seemed right. Four hundred drafters, four thousand fighters.\nHe said he’d like to recruit among the pilgrims and drafters visiting the\nChromeria while he’s here, to pull together an expeditionary force against\nthe White King. He would need to be in direct control, with a very specific\nwrit of authority, and he gave details on exactly what funding, logistical\nsupport, and intelligence he’d need. It is quite impressive in both scope and\ncompleteness.”\nTaking up the pages and pages of requests, Karris was struck for a\nmoment by the fact that she now knew exactly what all these numbers were.\nThey all seemed in line, nothing excessive for the admittedly ambitious\nrecruiting goals he had in mind. For whatever it was worth, her time\ntraining the drafters of the Chromeria was paying dividends.\n“You look at these?” Karris asked.\n“No indeed, High Lady,” Anjali Gates said. There was a whiff of\nindignation around her, but she was sweating.\n“They aren’t sealed. I’d not be offended,” Karris said.\n“They were from his hand to yours. That’s my trust, High Lady, and\nwith it all my honor,” Anjali said.\nKarris flashed her eyebrows. Prickly sort. “Very well. You seemed, uh,\ndiscomfited. I’d supposed it was by what you’d read. Is it not?”"

My apologies, High Lady. Hot flash.\nDamned things. Never at a convenient hour.”\n“Ah,” Karris said awkwardly. Then she pretended not to feel awkward,\nwhich was also awkward, but hopefully only internally. Especially after the\nprecedent Orea Pullawr had set, the White was often expected to be a\nmother figure. How can you be a mother figure to a woman old enough to\nbe your own mother, especially when you miss such obvious signs?\nKarris took a breath, while Anjali Gates pretended (more artfully) not to\nfeel awkward at all. Diplomats got good at that sort of thing, Karris\nsupposed. “I’m sorry. I didn’t intend to embarrass you,” Karris said. “I’m\nstill learning.”\n“And if I may be so bold, learning very well, too, High Lady. You’ve\nengendered an enormous amount of trust in a difficult time. Most\nimpressive.”\nKarris accepted the compliment with a nod of her head that didn’t break\neye contact. The White—as any diplomat would tell her—should not bow\nto anyone.\n“Impressions of Danavis?” Karris asked.\nGates was ready for this sort of thing. “A man utterly in command of\nhimself and his people, and deeply, deeply admired by them and promptly\nobeyed. As reported previously, he was recently widowered. There is a real\nair of grief about him, but not brokenness. He looked several times to a\nportrait he keeps of her. No signs of drunkenness or dissipation. It should\nnot surprise me if he harbors great stores of rage; however, it seems he\nkeeps them under lock and key. No truth whatever, I’d hazard, to the rumors\nof her killing herself. Now, there were some other numbers he\nmentioned…” Anjali Gates then lowered her voice so that no one might\noverhear, despite that they were in Karris’s very rooms and no one other\nthan Blackguards were in attendance. “He caught me when I caught him\nlooking at her portrait, and he told me quite frankly that the Order of the\nBroken Eye had her assassinated so she might not help you with her\nvisions. I asked if this suggested an alliance between the Order and the\nWhite King. He thought it likely, but said he had no proof.”\nKarris took a deep breath. The Order again. Aligned with the White\nKing? Curse them to the deepest hell.\n“Are those numbers also in these papers?” Karris asked for any\neavesdropping ears. “Oh, of course, that’s right, you didn’t look. I may have\nto have you write them down for me, though, if they’re not. I shan’t\nremember all of that with everything else I have on my mind.”\nKarris thumbed through the pages. It looked like Satrap Corvan Danavis\nexpected to recruit a lot of her drafters for the fight. It wasn’t implausible\nfrom a practical standpoint: hot from the holy fervor of Sun Day, women\nand men might sign on for well nigh anything.\nBut putting her drafters under Corvan’s command?

Karris clucked her\ntongue. It certainly showed audacity—which was exactly what leading the\nfight against the White King would need.\nBut where would he attack? Had his Seer of a wife told him things that\nhe didn’t dare entrust to a diplomat messenger? Karris still believed her\nbrother wanted to attack the Chromeria directly—but with what ships?\nFrom what port? When?\nIf she could attack him instead, either at sea or, even better, with his\nships still in port, the Seven Satrapies might end this war without even more\ndevastation.\nCorvan might be the key to everything.\n“He says these requests aren’t meant as an opening to begin\nnegotiations,” Anjali Gates said. “If you give him less than what he asks,\nhe’ll be able to tell you what successes you can hope for from his campaign,\nbut he believes that striking hard and as quickly as possible will be the only\nhope for the Seven Satrapies to avoid collapse next spring. He plans to sail\naway from here to begin his attack only a day or two after Sun Day, and\nasks that as soon as his ships are seen on the horizon arriving, we allow no\nmore ships to exit our ports.”\n“He still hopes to surprise the White King,” Karris said. “It’s worth a\ntry.” She knew her brother surely had many spies on both Big and Little\nJasper, and one of them at least would try to sail to tell him about the arrival\nof unexpected forces.\nBut with her small fleet of skimmers, her people could overtake and stop\nany ship of spies. Surprising the White King was actually quite possible.\nApologizing again for her earlier gaffe, Karris dismissed the woman,\nand ushered in the next senior diplomat. This one to report the Ruthgari\nsituation: Eirene Malargos was playing her cards close, stalling real action,\nbut Karris’s spies had learned that her allies—and allies they seemed, still—\nhad discovered the secret of how to make their own skimmers, albeit of a\nseemingly more rudimentary design than the Chromeria’s own.\nOf course they had. It was easier for friends to spy on you than enemies,\nshe supposed. Eirene had ships staffed and provisioned, ready to sail, but\nwas still summoning troops. She could delay Karris’s call to serve for as\nlong as she wanted with that excuse. You can always wait for more troops,\nif you’re as rich as a Malargos.\nIf Eirene were being honest with Karris, then she’d had no word from\nKip’s forces up the river since about the last time Karris herself had heard\nfrom them. Eirene suspected bandits were seizing supplies going up the\nriver and had intercepted messengers, so she had long since dispatched\nmessengers overland to Kip. But she’d had no word back yet. Dammit.\nThe scouts searching the seas for King Ironfist had found nothing.\nDammit again.\nOn Karris’s hunch, the Chromeria’s small fleet was patrolling between\nthe Jaspers and the Ruthgari coast, but the next messenger reported nothing\nnew from their scouts—which could actually be good news."

Usually they\nstarted their piracy at the farther ports as pilgrims embarked. The\nBlackguards had gone to those coastal cities, sending their own personnel to\nhunt pirates as well as they were able to, because they didn’t trust anyone\nelse with the skimmers except Karris’s and Andross’s messengers.\nMaybe Karris could send the Blackguards out en masse when the pirates\ncame closer, and deal them a blow they’d never forget.\nMaybe the pirate kings’ and queen’s fleets had tangled with Ironfist’s,\nand they’d done one another such damage that none of them would come\nthis year!\nRight, Karris, and maybe the heavens will open up and shower down\nwarriors to save the day! And chocolate. That’d be nice. Maybe a hot cup of\nkopi?\nWhat Karris really needed was someone to serve her as she and Marissia\nhad served the old White. She needed someone to recruit and manage her\nspies. She should choose Anjali Gates for the job: the woman was\neminently capable, sharp, diligent, and exact, and willing to do excellent\nwork without getting public recognition.\nThe last was a rarity on the Jaspers.\nBut Karris had delegated off so many duties already, only to add dozens\nmore in taking over the drafters’ war training and in quietly bolstering the\nislands’ defenses, from refortifying walls that had had stones stolen from\nthem for other construction over the years, to drilling the cannon crews of\nall the towers on overlapping fire and their supply chains for shot and\npowder if they ran out, to hiring the smiths to cast weapons and armor, to\ndrilling free militias, even spurring on their training by offering prizes in\narchery competitions and melees.\nNone of it had been as cheap as she’d promised Andross, but he hadn’t\nstopped her. Without ever saying a word of why, he acquiesced often now. It\nwas almost as if he respected her a little, now. Almost.\nHe hadn’t even demanded she stop meeting with her pet luxiats (as he\ncalled them). He seemed more amused that it had so infuriated some of the\nHigh Luxiats—and, she guessed, kept them busy being angry at her rather\nthan at him.\nShe should summon Ambassador Gates and give her the job now. She\nknew she should.\nBut with all she’d passed off to other hands, the control of information\nwas one thing she couldn’t bear to give to anyone. Not now, not when the\nOrder had people everywhere.\nIn peacetime, you might worry about a spy enriching a family unjustly\nor using their illicit knowledge to claim estates or negotiate or end trade\nagreements or even marriages. In wartime, though, a well-placed spy meant\ndeath for thousands. It could mean the death of the Seven Satrapies."

After my long tutelage everywhere else,\nyou taught me to handle secrets and those who keep them. You taught me to\njudge whom to trust and how to trust someone halfway or three-quarters,\nrather than trusting fully or not at all, like I used to.\nThank you, Orea. Thank you.\nAnother knock.\n“Send them in,” Karris told her Blackguards.\nOne more meeting, she promised herself, then I’m getting the hell out of\nhere to go to that little kopi shop myself.\nChapter 53\n“YOU…”\nThe sound rose from a pitch so low Teia felt it first in her chest, but\nmaybe that was only her anxious dreams. She rolled over. The closet was so\nsmall, no one could open it without the door pushing into her hip. This was\nas safe a place to sleep as anything got for her.\n“HAVE.” The voice had risen now, like a sea demon emerging from\nthalassic depths. Monstrous and raw, it was basso profundo deep, as if it\nhad taken until now to find a cadence intelligible to her.\n“MY CLOAK!”\nThe voice was a volcano rending the earth beneath her and vomiting fire\npast her face, the heat alone pummeling her into mute submission, agog,\nfalling backward to tremble on uncertain ground.\n“You cannot hide for long, thief. I will find you and take what is mine,\nand I will teach you what eternity means. I will snatch you from this time to\na place where we can be uninterrupted for decades of torture, and then I’ll\nbring you back, to your own family, your own home. You will betray your\nown father for one hour’s cessation of pain, and then I will take you again,\nuntil you have broken yourself, and you beg to torture by your own hand\nthem whom once you loved. I will flay you, I will tear off your fingernails, I\nwill grind your bones to spike shards and make you dance as they pierce\nyour skin. I will impale you from anus to broken teeth on the axle of my\nwar chariot before I ride into battle. But no matter what pain you come to\nknow, you will heal every time I allow you nightmarish sleep. You will not\ndie. I, who am the Lord of Flies, will never let you more than glimpse that\nbourne.”\nThis was not a nightmare. From any nightmare Teia had ever known\nwhen asleep, she would have woken by now, sheets drenched, cheeks wet\nwith tears. But she could not wake.\nThis was not her psyche pawing through the jagged detritus of what had\nunsettled her in the day and sorting her fears. This wasn’t a twisted\nconfusion of things she knew.

For one\nheartbeat, Breaker broke her free of quicksand fear with memories of his\nquicksilver humor at all the wrong times. Though not in so many words,\nKip the Lip had taught her this:\nIf you think you’re helpless, if you think you’re powerless; as long as\nyou can speak, you’re not helpless, and you’re not powerless until you’re\ntoo afraid to. If you’re trapped in the darkness all alone, how do you know\nyou’re alone and not actually surrounded by an army of friends, also silent,\nalso afraid in the dark, merely waiting for the sound of one voice to rouse\nthem from fear, to fight for freedom?\nSilence is isolation chosen.

So, young—well, I won’t\nsay ‘lady’—is there anything else you wish to say?”\nOh, shit.\n“Yeah, one last thing,” Teia said. “Thanks for the cloak, you little bitch.”\nIf Teia had thought that Abaddon had been shouting at her in a\nfortissimo, the sudden draconic roar of a hatred that stretched to the very\nbounds of infinity quibbled that perhaps the immortal’s former threats had\nbeen spoken sotto voce: her mortal ears simply weren’t capable of hearing\nmore than the minutest modulations in the volume of his mammoth voice.\nThe pressure of his scream clapped cupped hands on the ears of her\nmind, blowing blood from her every orifice at a pressure her psyche\ncouldn’t contain.\nAfter she wandered a trackless season of dizzied pain, his voice\ndescended to words that she could slowly begin to understand, now bated\nwith acid malice. “You are an ant on the finger of a curious giant, daring to\nbite him.

You spoke with Janus Borig a dozen times. There was no\nmistake.”\nHer hands lay in her lap like dead birds. “My love,” she says. “I was\nyoung and so, so full of myself. So proud. What if we’re wrong?”\n“If we’re wrong, it will be terrible. Pointless sacrifices, meaningless\ndeaths, talent wasted, and fortunes burned for nothing, as happens every\nday in these satrapies. But if we’re right… If we’re right but we blink—if\nwe’re right but we’re not strong enough to do what must be done—all the\nworld will pay. You will see all your sons die. You will bury me. You will\nsee the Chromeria burn and the Jaspers awash in blood. You will live to see\nthe beginning of the Blinder’s thousand-year reign. Felia, it is because you\nare a great heart coupled with a great mind that Orholam has trusted you\nwith this yoke beside me. A lesser soul would break.”\n“I am breaking!” she says. And tears explode.\nA slave peeks in at the door, but I wave her away.\nI can’t go to Felia. I barely can stand myself. This was to be the burden\nwe would carry together, but if she is fallen, I can’t let her drag me down.\n“For Orholam’s sake, stand,” I say. “My love, please.”"

She tries to weep quietly,\nbut can’t. “But… our sons!” she chokes out.\nThe words are barely discernible through her weeping, and part of me\ndespises her for being weak. I need her now, and she thinks of the\nimpossible.\nI know better than to say, ‘We can have more sons.’ She will never share\nmy bed again if I appear so callous. Nay, she will never so much as look at\nme again.\n‘Of red cunning, the youngest son cleaves father and father and father\nand son.’\nHow I loathe prophecy. It could mean anything or nothing. Which\nfathers, which son or sons? Which generation? It’s worthless, meaningless.\nSo why does it occur to me now?\nI know why.\nSevastian. Curse you, Ulbear, curse you, Orea—and curse You, too,\nOrholam. How can I give You my son?\nChapter 55\nKip didn’t know why it was that when you think someone is trying to kill\nyou, it should be mildly disappointing to find out that they aren’t.\nThey’d prepared for an enemy trap as they approached this little town.\nThey’d arranged signals, scouted twice, set backup plans and rally points.\nMostly they’d just thought they knew what was going to happen. And\nthey’d been wrong. Which made Kip worry they’d fallen into another trap.\nThey’d wasted time, and they’d arrived at Apple Grove too late.\n“Breaker, you need to come see this,” Winsen said. His blue-and-yellow-\nstained eyes looked uneasy. Kip had never seen Winsen look uneasy.\n“Just tell me it’s not more of the dead,” Kip said. He was in a black\nmood.\nThey’d arrived too late to stop the White King’s armada before it\nlaunched from the next town over, and too late to stop a massacre here.\nThey’d expected to be too late for the armada, but the massacre didn’t make\nany sense.\n“Not dead,” Winsen said, “though I thought he was at first.”\nKip mounted up and followed him, swinging Tisis into the saddle behind\nhim. Cruxer, Ben-hadad, and Ferkudi fell in immediately.\nThe town hadn’t been burned. It hadn’t been disturbed in any way,\nmerely left neglected, as if everyone had decided to leave while\nunaccountably abandoning their every worldly possession. The town was\nempty except for children between the ages of maybe one and three years\nold.\nEveryone old enough to speak had been killed.\nNo massacre felt right, but this one felt very wrong. Strange wrong. Men\ninflamed with Atirat’s lust for destruction don’t leave buildings standing\nthat they could burn. Those who massacre entire villages don’t usually\nspare the young. Nor, afterward, do they pile up the bodies and burn them\nin an orderly manner until the ashes obscure what had happened, obviously\nstaying to feed the bodies back into the hottest flames until every part is\nconsumed.\nIt was careful, and massacres aren’t careful work."

But the hounds smelled no departing tracks for those adults and older\nchildren. The people of Apple Grove had been rounded up, forced to give\nup valuables and jewelry, moved into a field, and slaughtered there. Maybe\nthree hundred of them.\nOne of Kip’s men found the stolen jewelry, all of it arrayed neatly on a\ntable in one of the houses, as if asking to be taken by whoever came along.\nThe young children who had been allowed to live had been left with\nplenty of water and food.\nBut still. From everything they could tell—the war hounds had trouble\nwith abstracts like units of time, but their handlers could make certain\nestimates that were confirmed by other trackers and evidence—the\nmassacre had happened three or four weeks ago. These remaining children\nshouldn’t have still been alive.\nNot that all of them were. The war hounds led them to fresh graves.\nSmall ones.\n“Someone’s been taking care of them,” Tisis said. “They’re too young to\nhave survived this long by themselves.”\nMen and women from Kip’s retinue were trying to comfort the children\nnow, trying to engage them in play. It worked with a few. Others were still\ntoo traumatized to do anything more than mechanically chew the food\noffered them.\n“What I’m taking you to see may be the answer to who’s been taking\ncare of the kids,” Winsen said. “Or maybe he was part of the murdering.\nHell, maybe both.”\nThey rode up the main track away from the empty village for a few\nminutes, and then cut over into farmland, passing through apple orchards\nthat had been tended until recently.\nThey rode up a hillside orchard to where the top flattened out.\nWho massacres a village, doesn’t take any loot, doesn’t burn anything,\nand kills everyone except the kids too young to speak? Why would the\nWhite King hide what he’d done here? He’d massacred other cities and\ndeliberately left people alive to spread the tale.\nAnd why did the name of the town seem familiar? Kip was certain he’d\nheard it before, but he must not have thought it was important at the time,\nbecause he hadn’t locked it in his memory.\n“How’d you even think to come way out here?” Kip asked Winsen.\n“Big Leo said something about this place from his parents’ traveling\ndays with their troupe. I wanted to get away from the brats’ crying and\nthought I’d find some quiet out at these ruins. Didn’t expect this.”\nThey emerged from the orderly rows of trees into a wide clearing. It was\nalmost a perfect circle. Even the great limbs of the old apple trees had been\ntrimmed long, long ago to not intrude into the circle. Younger limbs did\nintrude, though, telling a tale of uneven husbandry or failing respect for old\ntradition."

Younger limbs did\nintrude, though, telling a tale of uneven husbandry or failing respect for old\ntradition.\nIn the center of the grassy circle stood a stone plinth, a few feet across\nand only as tall as a man. It was no great monument. Oddly, the earth\naround the base of the plinth was freshly cracked, as if something restless\nlay beneath it.\nOn top of the small plinth an adolescent sat cross-legged, hands draped\nover his knees. He was olive-skinned, with his raven hair in a short\nponytail, naked to the waist, stringy rather than merely skinny, a leather\nband tied around one bicep, and wearing the deerskin trousers of a Blood\nForest hunter. But in one relaxed hand he held a hellstone dagger that was\nsurely worth more than two fistfuls of rubies.\nIt appeared he’d been using the dagger on himself, for his body was\nencrusted with blood old and new in shades of scarlet and crimson and\nbrown. He’d striped himself, perhaps in ritual mourning, lines down his\nforearms, lines on his face. Cuts deep enough to scar but not to maim, with\nolder wounds poulticed but the blood not washed from his skin nor from his\ncruor-encrusted trousers.\nFresh blood coursed down his forehead into his left eye. The boy didn’t\nlook up as Kip dismounted and came forward. Kip gestured for the others to\nstay back.\nThey ignored him; everything about this young hunter spoke death.\nSome intuition held Kip back from speaking. He came before the young\nman and sat on the ground, legs akimbo in deliberate imitation, as if he\nwere a disciple at the foot of his master.\nI thought he was young. I was wrong.\nThe boy had eyes as old as a great oak that has seen the leaves brown\nand fall a thousand times, blossoming from green to grave, from bower to\nbier, leafy souls soaking the soil and feeding the tree again, like a cannibal\nhungry for the fruit of his own body.\nKip sat still, staring up at him. The old young man looked at him with\nthe patience of the zephyrs chewing a mountain down, a quick form with a\nslow intent. The blood obscuring his left eye reminded Kip of the Parian\ntradition of the eye of mercy and the eye of justice, the good eye and the\nevil.\nWith the shedding of blood comes blindness.\nAnd slowly, Kip’s mimicry became imitation, and imitation became\ncommunion. Communion not with each other, but each settling into the cold\nembrace of time and their mortality, separate souls in the night, but the\nsame night, different journeys to the same end.\nAnd then, as the blood dried on the young man’s obsidian blade and on\nhis face, he became slowly familiar.\nA swirl of the wind brought the young ancient’s wild scent to Kip’s\nnose, and suddenly Kip was gripped by blank, black fear. He was sitting\nbefore one of the most dangerous men in history.\nVoice raw, Kip said, “Greetings, Sealgaire na Scian, Daimhin Web.”\nDaimhin’s chest stopped in midbreath.

Then, in a rocky voice like a man\nwaking from a too-long slumber, “She said you would know me, Guile.”\nLike a rusty lock cracking open at the key that was Daimhin’s name\nspoken aloud, Kip remembered the man’s card, all of it: touching the white\nstag with his very hand, the village braggart who disbelieved him, the\nunrequited love, the hunt, then coming home to the village burned to the\nground by the White King’s outriders.\nAfter that came the memories in blood: the hunting of men, dressing\nthem like wild game, hung upside down, skinned and drained of blood to be\nfound by their comrades outside their very tents. He remembered a dozen\ncruel games invented to terrorize the invading Blood Robes.\nWho was the woman who’d told him of Kip coming?\n“The Third Eye,” Kip said.\n“She sent her message with this. It’s some leather I’ve never\nencountered.” Daimhin gestured to the armband he wore above his bicep.\n“It intrigued me more than her words. Arrogant, I thought her. She claimed\nto see the future. But how dare she tell me what to do? I have become a god\nof vengeance, a spirit of the forest. She bade me come here. To stop this.\nThen she begged. Words as wind to twist my will.”\n“What is it?” Kip asked.\n“Not snakeskin, nor any reptile known in these lands. I came here not to\nobey her but hoping she might tell me more. Perhaps this was some new\nanimal to hunt, to test myself against. Perhaps I might lose my taste for\nhunting men. But it’s not done that. I’m like a wolf that takes one lamb and\nthen cannot help but raid for sheep, no matter the dangers.” He fingered that\nleather band around his bicep, but Kip was too far away to see anything\nstrange about it. “By the time I came, I was too late. Another village\nmassacred while I was gone hunting.”\n“Like your home village was. But Apple Grove this time,” Kip guessed.\nDaimhin nodded bloody guilt.\n“Why’d he do this?” Kip asked. Taking a village’s livestock, burning a\nfew huts to halt resistance, taking a few men or women, Kip could\nunderstand why an invader would do those… but this? Both recklessly\ninsane and secretive.\nAn invader doesn’t want its massacres to be secret. No one’s intimidated\nby a massacre they never learn about.\n“He didn’t,” Daimhin said. “If by him you mean the White King. I\ntracked those who did this. They didn’t come from the White King’s camp,\nand these men hid from the White King’s patrols both coming and going. It\nwas only twenty men, but some of them were drafters, and all were armed\nwith good muskets. The villagers scattered at first, but then they recognized\nthe leader.

Started killing people until they did. Made\npromises of safe passage. Lies, naturally.”\n“You didn’t learn all that from their tracks,” Kip said.\n“On their way back to their boats on the coast, these arrachtaigh, these\nmonsters, came across a Blood Robe patrol and had to hide. One of them\ngot separated from the others. Got lost. I found him. We talked.”\nKip didn’t bother to ask if that man was still alive.\n“Can you tell me anything else about them?” Kip asked.\n“Height and weight for most of them, a few would just be guesses. They\ncall themselves Lightguards, came on some type of boat they called a sea\nchariot. Second-in-command walks with a crutch.”\n“Aram,” Ben-hadad said from behind Kip. “That sonuvabitch.”\n“Commander was a young man named Guile,” Daimhin said. “I didn’t\nask many more questions. There were kids dying.”\nKip’s stomach sank. “Zymun.”\nNo one protested that surely he wouldn’t do such a thing.\n“Why?” Cruxer asked.\n“Zymun was raised here, right? Maybe it was a childhood grudge?”\nTisis asked. “But why kill everyone else? He can’t have hated everyone.”\n“I think once people saw him for what he was, they may well have all\nhated him,” Cruxer said. “He’s certainly capable of hating all of them.”\n“The massacre was to cover up whatever he came here to accomplish,”\nKip said.\n“You think he met with the White King?” Tisis asked.\n“Definitely possible. Maybe he was seen, and decided—” Kip started.\n“No tracks that way,” Daimhin said. “They might have taken their boats,\nI suppose, but there’s a good road straight to the old city. He would have\nknown about it if he grew up here. I don’t think he came to meet with the\nwights.”\n“And they hid from the Blood Robe patrol,” Ben-hadad said. “I don’t\nthink he was making an alliance with the White King, as convenient as that\nwould be for us to expose.”\nKip said, “Whatever he did here, he killed everyone in this village in\nsuch a way that we would think the White King ordered it, if we found out\nabout it at all. By leaving the houses standing, refugees from elsewhere can\nmove right in, and squatters don’t often dig too deeply into why the houses\nthey’ve moved into are empty.”\n“Nor do they appreciate when others ask where the original owners are,”\nBig Leo said. “So they do the covering up for you.”\n“That’s why he didn’t let his men steal any jewelry,” Kip said. “He\ndidn’t want them to keep any evidence of their crimes.”\nIt was all… pretty clever, actually. Zymun was stupidly impulsive at\ntimes, but he was smart enough to realize he could disappear for three or\nfour days and turn up saying he’d been in brothels, and everyone would\nbelieve it.

A year or two ago, it would have been impossible. It still would\nbe, except that he had access to skimmers.\n“But why not kill the children?” Winsen asked. “Why add the risk of\nletting them live?”\n“Some of the men must’ve balked at it,” Tisis said. “Many men will\nbarter with evil, when they must. ‘We’ll kill the men, sure, but not the\nwomen. Fine, the women too, but not the kids. They can’t even speak.\nThey’re no danger to us.’ The Lightguard’s rife with thugs and criminals,\nbut they’re not all… Zymun.”\n“That’s the Lightguard for ya,” Ben-hadad said, “willing to butcher\nhelpless men, women, and children, but they draw the line at toddlers.\nMoral fucking paragons.”\n“We should kill all of them,” Cruxer said. Fair as Cruxer was, there was\nnothing soft in him toward evil.\nKip had known Zymun was a snake, but his wanting to kill Kip so he\ncould be assured of his own position had at least seemed understandable, if\ncruelly calculating and cold. Their grandfather was cruelly calculating and\ncold, too.\nMurdering several hundred people… for what?… was a different thing\nentirely.\nKip couldn’t imagine Andross Guile doing that.\n“The babies died,” Daimhin said with a voice like a swimmer in the\ngreat ocean seeing no land in sight, no ships, breath short, one last\nconfession on his lips.\nIt brought Kip back to the present.\n“Fourteen babies they didn’t kill, but I couldn’t save them. Not one. I\ncouldn’t find milk. No cow nor horse nor pig nor goat in the time I dared to\nbe away. I went in to the camp followers who haven’t yet left Azuria, tried\nto hire a wet nurse. They’d heard of me, though, from the Blood Robes.\nThey feared me. They raised the hue and cry, said I was there to steal their\nwomen, tried to kill me.\n“I came back. I could never go far again. I cut up food. The babies\ncouldn’t take it. I chewed up food, gave them little bits. They spat it up.\nThey didn’t even all die in my arms. There were too many dying for me to\neven give them that. I thought of giving them the black mercy, but I held\nout hope that someone would come at the last minute. The Third Eye had\nsent me to stop the massacre, but I’d failed. I hoped maybe she’d sent\nsomeone else to save the children.” He took a deep breath. “But maybe I\nwas the last hope. Or maybe the others failed, too.”\nHis voice rolled across a vast distance, a messenger telling the facts, but\ntears rolled, blood and water mixing on his cheek.\n“I was so happy when the crying stopped. Not relieved, mind you.\nHappy. I wept with joy. What kind of a horror could be ‘happy’—”\n“That’s not joy,” Kip interrupted. “That’s a breakdown.” The words kind"

You don’t know me,” Daimhin said, eyes coming to hard\nfocus.\n“Yes I do,” Kip said. “The day you took your first stag, your hands were\nshaking so hard that when you cleaned it, your knife punctured its\nintestines. Your father never told anyone. He didn’t want to shame you in\nfront of the village. But you were ashamed, and your secret shame spurred\nyou to become a better hunter. You expect perfection of yourself, and it’s\nalways been your shame that makes you redouble your efforts. It’s brought\nyou to heights unimaginable to other men… but it broke you here.”\nKip could feel his Mighty getting tense even before he saw the white-\nknuckled grip Daimhin had on his obsidian knife.\nShame is a gorgon. Before you grab her serpentine hair to drag her into\nthe light, remember what her hair is.\n“Forgive me,” Kip said. “I know you, but you don’t know me. I\nshouldn’t have spoken so.” Except it had been on purpose, and the truth lay\nwriggling in the light like a rainbow trout thumping about the bottom of the\nboat, gasping in the air when it so wanted to breathe safe water. “The\ncutting. Tell me about it.”\nHe knew it was an old pagan ritual way of mourning the dead, but\nDaragh the Coward had cut himself as bravado and as a mask. The same\naction might mean something very different in Daimhin Web.\nThe young man was on a jagged edge, looking as if he wasn’t sure if he\nshould attack Kip or throw himself at his feet or bolt into the forest. Instead,\ndefeated, he sulked. “One for each one dead.”\n“But not too deep,” Kip said. The hunter knew exactly how deeply to cut\nto cause a scar without impeding function.\n“I have promises to keep,” Daimhin said, as if it were simple.\n“To the other children,” Kip said, understanding him. “You’ve been\ntaking care of them.”\n“Not well,” Daimhin spat.\n“You’ve made a vow that you’ll take care of them forever.” Kip had\nthought that the murderers had left the food. It had been Daimhin. “A\npenance?”\n“I made them orphans,” Daimhin said.\nCame too late to stop them being made orphans by others. It was very\ndifferent.\nThere had to be thirty children here. And this boy—maybe twenty years\nold? maybe years short of that—hunter and legend though he was, this boy\nwas going to be their mother and father? It was insane.\nAnd yet, war makes insanity a necessity.\n“One might suggest…” Kip said. Then he wasn’t sure if he should go\non. But he bulled ahead. Drag it all into the light.

As if it were simple.\n“If she asked knowing you’d say no, is it really your fault?”\n“She did ask,” Daimhin said.\n“Why would she ask if she knew he wouldn’t get here in time?” Cruxer\nasked quietly, aggrieved. As if the Third Eye had piled guilt atop a boy too\nsensitive to hold its weight. Hard as he was, and as starkly as he liked to see\nthe world separated into sheep and goats, at times Cruxer could show deep\ncompassion. He could see that Daimhin the Hunter would never be only a\nhunter any longer. Cruxer, who’d been catapulted from an old life by his\nguilt over a death he couldn’t stop, Cruxer understood.\nIf they made it through this damned war, Kip hoped to see that\nunderstanding, compassionate side of his dear friend flourish.\nTisis said quietly, “I think sometimes we can all see the future coming,\nand we can’t help but act, even when we know it’s too little or too late, too\nfeeble. Sometimes we act even though we know it will mean our death,”\nshe said, locking her jade-green eyes with Kip’s. “I don’t think that makes\nus fools. I think it makes us great.”\nAnd you’re staying with me, Kip thought. Does that make you a fool, or\ngreat, or both?\nBut Kip tore his eyes away from his remarkable bride, who was as\nundeserved as sunshine on a winter morning.\nHe saw perhaps the real reason for the Third Eye to send Daimhin: if\nshe’d told him there were orphans for him to care for, he wouldn’t have\ncome. What were orphans to a hunter? But by lying, by telling him there\nwas a massacre he could stop, she could save these orphans as Daimhin\nrevealed a mettle he himself hadn’t known he possessed.\nAfter all, like everyone else, prophets can lie.\n“Tell me about this, this clearing, that plinth,” Kip said instead. “You\ncame here for a reason. Or was it merely for the quiet?”\n“Ha!” Daimhin said. But he breathed and looked at the sun for a time,\nand spun his hellstone knife and sheathed it, and jumped off the plinth with\nthe grace of an artist whose body is his brush.\nHe turned and bowed to the plinth with a gravity that might have been\nmockery. He was a broken man indeed, teetering at the edge of madness.\n“Seven groves, in seven lands,” he said. “Apple, pear, fig, pomegranate,\nolive, orange, and atasifusta. Blood Forest, Ruthgar, Paria, Abornea, Ilyta,\nTyrea, and Atash. Seven cities, seven mirrors, seven colored lenses.

Not that that was the point\nright now.\nDaimhin said, “My forefathers were the keepers of this sacred grove,\nonce upon a time. My father brought me here to visit once. Kind of a\npilgrimage in our family, though we haven’t lived here for generations. I\ncame here hoping… for their understanding? Their forgiveness? Their\nwisdom? Ha. They failed, too, after all, and let us all be scattered into the\ndeep forest. I hoped…” He snorted. “Maybe it was just for the quiet, after\nall.”\n“There was a city here, then?” Kip asked.\n“Apple Grove was always small. I think most of the grove cities were.\nAll were close or within a direct line of sight to great cities—Azuria, here,\nfor one. They were intended to be isolated from the city’s politics. As if\nsuch a thing is possible. But at least it is harder to capture two fortified\npositions than just one. It didn’t work as intended, of course. The fort on\nRuic Head was constructed solely to house Ru’s Great Mirror, but Satrapah\nNaveen later moved the Great Mirror into Ru itself to show her power.”\nKip hadn’t been thinking in terms of the ancients when he’d been there,\nbut it was true, the fort of Ruic Head was far too large for what the\nChromeria thought it had been. The fort had thick timber walls, but it had\nbeen built on stone foundations. Before the relatively recent advent of\ncannons that could shoot great distances into the bay, there was no function\nfor a fort there. A simple lookout tower would have sufficed. Maybe a\nlighthouse. There hadn’t been need for an entire fort.\nWhich was interesting history and all, but if there were big mirrors in all\nthese groves, where was the mirror that had been here?\nBut Tisis was already going in another direction. “Azuria?” she asked.\n“I’ve never even heard of a city called that.”\n“The pygmies didn’t lose all their wars to the Tyrean Empire,” Daimhin\nsaid. “They wiped out the city while it was still being built. Razed it.\nCrucified everyone in it or fed them to their tygre wolves. My people fled\nwithout a fight after that. The ruins of Azuria are over beyond the new wall\nnow, where the White King was. There’s little there now except access to a\ngood harbor.”\n“How do you know all this?” Kip asked.\n“We deep Foresters keep our traditions alive in our songs, not on\ncorruptible parchments or skins that can be changed.” Daimhin’s face\nclouded. “Or we did. I wasn’t a singer of the songs and I don’t know all the\nstories. They’ll die now, I suppose.

Nor the point.\nDaimhin said, “I thought it was a coincidence that this Seer should\ncontact me and want me to come here. It’s been centuries since my people\nwere here. I feel no connection to this land. I love my forests wild. I am no\ntender of domesticated trees.”\n“Arborist,” Kip supplied. Also not helpful, but his mind was far away.\n“Did you say something about an orange grove? In Tyrea?”\n“Yes.”\n“I don’t suppose you know where that was?” Kip asked.\n“I can’t recall the name. Near the Great Dome.”\n“‘Great Dome’?” Tisis asked.\nKip felt like he’d plucked an invisible spiderweb, or perhaps a tripwire.\nHe remembered the old ruin in the orange grove where he’d gone so often.\nHe said, “There were stories that Sundered Rock was once a great stone\ndome. Maybe it was, back when these groves were established.” He turned\nback to Daimhin. “What happened here? What cracked the ground?”\n“I assume something happened to make the Great Mirror move recently.\nBut you’re the drafter. You tell me,” Daimhin said.\nWhat mirror? Liv Danavis had directed them here saying she’d activated\na mirror… but there was no mirror here, just a big empty field in the middle\nof an apple orchard.\nBut Daimhin was close enough now that the light caught on his leather\narmband. It shimmered a bit, like it was made of many tiny scales.\nAnd that lute string of memory thrummed once more.\nThis moment was the kind of thing a Seer might see: Daimhin standing\nwith his armband in the sun, talking to Kip, who was suddenly intensely\ninterested in it, rather than the blood all over the young hunter or the blade\nin his hand or the cracked earth at his feet.\n“Daimhin, do me a favor,” Kip said. “Close your eyes, and think that\nyou’re in the blackest night, and that you want desperately to hide. Will\nyourself to disappear into the blackness.”\nAfter a moment of staring at him inscrutably, Daimhin closed his eyes.\nThe armband shimmered and went a smoky, mottled black.\nThe others muttered imprecations, and when Daimhin opened his eyes\nand saw it, he seemed stunned.\n“What does that mean?” Tisis asked.\n“How did you know to do that?” Ben-hadad asked Kip.\n“Because I’ve seen that kind of skin before,” Kip said.\nIt was the same skin as what made the master cloak he’d given Teia. Kip\nhad thought that cloak had been made of human skin—a light skin and a\ndark one stitched together—but he’d been wrong.\nThat shimmer reminded him of a being who changed his appearance at\nwill, in far more complex ways than simple camouflage, who appeared\nbeautiful when in reality he was ugly and burnt: Abaddon.\nAnd then it reminded Kip of another immortal, whose glory had\nshimmered like the sun, but who had shifted herself effortlessly to walk\namong mortals: Rea Siluz."

Not men dressed in luxin and power to fool the gullible,\nthe real gods. The Two Hundred. The Fallen. The djinn.”\n“I don’t suppose they shed their skin?” Cruxer asked.\n“I, I don’t think so.”\n“So someone skinned one?” Cruxer asked.\n“Who could do that?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“Maybe we can,” Winsen said flatly.\n“Shut up, Win. Not funny,” Cruxer said.\n“No,” Kip said. “I think Winsen’s kind of right. We’re fighting the gods.\nThe Third Eye wants us to know… we can do it. They can be killed.”\nChapter 56\nTeia was running out of time. She leaned against the wall of a cooper’s stall,\nhalf-shaded in the afternoon sun, nearly invisible not because of paryl\nmagic but because she wore the hooded cloak low over her face and its\nstripes matched the tones of the wall and the shadows perfectly. She\ncouldn’t maintain her paryl cloud for hours, and hours it had been.\nSun Day was only ten days away. Whatever the Order was planning, it\nwould spring then. Tens of thousands of pilgrims had swollen Big Jasper’s\nstreets. It seemed that for every person who sensibly kept away from\nmaking a pilgrimage because of the war, someone else came in their place,\ndesperate because of the war.\nShe couldn’t have let Halfcock live with what he knew of her, but by\nkilling him, she’d given up her one certain lead to where the Braxians\nwould meet the night before Sun Day. Halfcock hadn’t known where their\nrituals would be held beforehand, and claimed he always would find a note\nin his pocket with directions when the time was close. So he couldn’t tell\nher where it would be, but she could’ve followed him.\nNow this safe house was her only lead.\nA safe house no one had visited in three days.\nIt could be a trap, of course.\nWorse, the longer she waited, the more likely it was that Murder Sharp\nwould get wind of Halfcock’s disappearance. Would that lead him here?\nShe gathered her paryl around her, going invisible, and moved through\nthe street. She’d mastered it now, moving with her head down, shooting the\nquickest glances this way and that to see what she must, moving with the\nunderstanding that others didn’t see her at all. It was a busy street, but the\nlittle house had a recessed doorway.\nTeia slipped into it and started to work with the picks and anchors.\nThrough Quentin, Karris had made sure she had the best gear, but truth\nbe told, Teia still wasn’t much good with lockpicks.\nThe mechanism was neither new nor tight nor complicated, and it still\ntook her almost ten sweating minutes and one ruined anchor to open the\nlock.\nOpening the door a crack, Teia streamed a cloud of paryl vapor through\nthe gap and into the room beyond.

She felt nothing moving.\nShe looked back to the street and the bustle of carts, then opened the\ndoor—neither fast, which would draw the eye, nor too slow, which would\nmake any who saw wonder why a door was swinging open by itself. Nope,\nthis was just as if someone in the house had opened the door, changed their\nmind, and closed it again.\nHer heart was in her throat as she stepped inside, hands baring daggers\nfrom sheaths, paryl readied for the attack. She pushed the door shut with\none foot.\nThe trap would spring shut now, if there was one.\nOne breath passed with no attack.\nTwo.\nShe streamed out clouds of paryl again, moving from room to room\nquickly, not really noticing anything, merely feeling for life or empty\nplaces, trapdoors, hidden alcoves.\nIt was clear.\nShe breathed easy for the first time in half an hour.\nEmpty. Like she’d supposed it would be, after all her time watching the\nplace.\nNow to work.\nThere was a bed that was too rich for this neighborhood by half, a closet\nwith various clothes rich and poor, and a woman’s white Braxian robes.\nThat was good. At least it told Teia Halfcock had been honest with her\nabout that much. This was someone in the Order’s safe house.\nTeia examined everything for some hint of who the woman was. The\nsheets were Ilytian cotton, but had no tailor’s mark on them. The nicer\nclothing came from a variety of tailors around Big Jasper, but not a piece\nwas monogrammed.\nSo whoever owned this place wasn’t stupid, then.\nTeia searched for two hours and found nothing.\nShe sat on the bed and sighed. What was she going to do? She could set\nKarris’s people on it—the White did have many other eyes and ears—but\nKarris had asked that Teia reserve that for an emergency. Anything to do\nwith the Order should be held closer than close, lest they all get killed.\nWhat were her other options? If she set Karris’s people on this, she\ncould get back to hunting for her father, which almost certainly would be\nwhere Murder Sharp would have his best traps set. But some traps you have\nto risk.\nIt was hopeless. For months and months she’d been hunting the Order,\nand she had nothing. She was a total failure.\nIf she could just think. There had to be some way forward.\nShe closed her eyes.\nWhen she opened them, she couldn’t tell how long they’d been closed.\nHad she fallen asleep? No, surely not.\nThe rattle of a key in the lock sent a jolt through her. Shit! She hadn’t\neven locked the door behind her.\nBut it bought her an extra couple of moments now, as whoever was on\nthe other side had first locked the door, tried it, and now unlocked it.\nShe jumped to her feet, pulled the cloak shut, went invisible, and\nroughly smoothed the blankets from the depression her sitting on them had\nmade.\nThe door cracked open, and a man poked his head in, a puzzled look on\nhis face.

He was fair-\nskinned, dressed in slaves’ garb, dark hair oiled back, clean shaven.\nHe checked the rooms, and straightened out the wrinkles in the\nbedspread with a disapproving look. Just a slave checking the house for his\nmistress—of course she wouldn’t clean a safe house herself.\nRich people. So helpless.\nThe slave busied himself, dusting the already clean surfaces, and Teia\nhad to dodge him a few times, as silently as possible, regulating even her\nbreath, and looking only at his feet. He was soon finished, but when he got\nto the door, he paused. “It’s madness, Micael. Don’t do it. It’s the whipping\npost and salt packed in the wounds unto death if she catches you.”\nHe reached his hand to the door, but instead of opening it, locked it.\nHe went to the sideboard, opened a drawer, and took out the silver. He\nlaid the silver-polishing kit next to it, but he didn’t polish the utensils, as if\nstill momentarily at war with himself.\nThen he held the front of his trousers away from his waist and scratched\nhis pubic area with a fork.\nHe examined the tines carefully and then put it back away, glancing\naround guiltily.\nTeia’s mouth dropped open. She almost lost hold on her invisibility. But\nhe worked systematically through the silver, until every piece had been\ndown his pants.\n“‘Thank you, Mistress.’ ‘Your crop, Mistress?’ ‘With pleasure,\nMistress.’” He repeated the phrases like they were a meditation prayer: he\nmust have had to say them hundreds of times, but now he was reclaiming\nthem. In the future, whenever he said those, he would think of this.\nHe was grinning like a maniac.\nHe moved to the bedroom, and he wiped his ass across every single one\nof the pillows, both sides. “‘How did you sleep, Mistress? Oh, a scent?\nOdd. I’ll have a stern word with the laundress. This old house is a little\nfusty, despite my best efforts. But I’ll try harder, Mistress.’”\nTeia had heard rumors of others doing this kind of thing when she’d\nbeen a slave, of course. She’d fantasized about it herself when her owner,\nthat cunt Aglaia Crassos, had dreamed up some new humiliation for her or\nher friends. Watching someone deathly ill be forced to lick up their own\nvomit, or seeing a boy ten years old beaten to death because he’d peeked in\non the mistress noisily having sex with someone.\nLater she’d heard the same kinds of stories among slave owners, albeit\nrepeated with more horror than glee: stories of slaves drying the dishes with\ntheir poxy undergarments, of men putting their cocks in the cups, or\nurinating and worse in the soup. They were the kinds of stories that played\non the fears of those served and the fantasies of those enslaved, so of course\nthey were popular.\nBut she hadn’t thought anyone actually did it.\nIt was hatred to the point of suicide."

But here,\nseeing this man do it, it was desperately unfunny. This Micael was risking\ntorture and death merely to secretly dishonor a woman. He likely wouldn’t\neven be here to see her use the forks or pillows. He was right: it was\nmadness.\nEnough, Micael. Just say her name. I don’t need to see all this.\nHe finished doing everything he could think of, and went again to the\ndoor. “I should clean it all,” he said. “Vengeance defiles the hand that enacts\nit. Orholam will bring justice in its appointed hour.” He leaned his head on\nthe doorframe, leaving a gap behind him.\nHe still blocked half the doorway, but Teia realized it was her best\nchance. She could easily leave after he left—but she had no way to relock\nthe door, at least not in time to follow. Now or never!\nShe slipped out behind him, not even brushing his tunic.\nShe’d never been so happy to be petite in her life.\n“No,” Micael said. “Fuck her. Fuck her.”\nSay her name!\nHe left, and Teia followed him.\nIn several blocks he arrived at a small hovel, opened the door. It was\napparently his own house. But there he stopped. Looking suddenly\nskyward, he said, “Orholam, You know she deserves it. If I stay my hand\nfrom vengeance, Orholam, You have to promise me…”\nHe stood there for a moment, then shook his head and sighed. Teia could\ntell he was walking back to his mistress’s safe house to clean it up.\nShe didn’t follow. She’d hoped that he would take her directly back to\nhis mistress’s estate, but it looked like she wasn’t that lucky. Whoever the\nnoblewoman was, she was too lazy to clean her own safe house, but she\nwasn’t completely stupid. Her slave had his own hovel.\nThe Order really did do a good job enforcing all the disciplines of\nsecrecy.\nQuickly, Teia ransacked the slave’s belongings. There were several\ntunics, with old bloodstains on the backs from whippings. Last, there was\nan overjacket with a family insignia on it.\nTeia had been unlucky that it had taken her so long to find a time when\nshe could get Halfcock alone and isolated. She’d been unlucky that the\nnoblewoman hadn’t been at her safe house, and that the slave had never said\nher name. She’d been unlucky that this slave was new and so Teia didn’t\nrecognize him and therefore his owner right away.\nBut finally. Finally luck turned its golden face full upon her.\nFor the first time in weeks, Teia smiled. Wonder of wonders, miracle of\nmiracles, it seemed Orholam had as black a sense of humor as any soldier:\naccording to this livery, the slave Micael belonged to Aglaia Crassos. Teia’s\nvery own former owner, that utter abomination, had joined the Order."

Teia was going to\nbe an answer to prayer!\nAglaia was in the Order. Sooner or later, Teia was going to get to kill\nher.\nSooner, Teia thought. Definitely sooner. Just in case.\nChapter 57\nWorried they were stepping into a trap—still—the Mighty didn’t let Kip\nclimb the luxin ladder until second to last, but at that point it didn’t matter.\nHe joined them atop the new wall.\nThe White King was no Gavin Guile. This wall was no Brightwater\nWall; it wasn’t luxin but simple wood, more a frontier fortification than a\nwork of art. It wasn’t high, either, less than three paces in most places. But\nit was vast, encompassing a half circle nearly a league across.\nA nearly empty league, now.\n“Huh! There’s no one here,” Ferkudi said.\nThe others looked at him. Big Leo cursed under his breath.\n“Can I push him off the wall?” Winsen asked. “Please?”\n“He’d probably survive,” Ben-hadad said.\n“You’re right, that is a problem,” Winsen said.\n“Not the first time he’s been dropped on his head, I’d wager,” Big Leo\nsaid.\n“Question is,” Tisis said, “if he landed on his head, would that set him\nright, or make him more Ferkudi?”\nSome scowled. Some shuddered.\n“Yeah,” Winsen said, “best not to risk it.”\n“Ah, come on, Ferk,” Cruxer said, hugging the hurt dope around one\nboulder-sized shoulder. “You know we love ya.”\nIt was a beautiful morning, sunny and clear. The forests were a green to\nmake your eyes ache, rolling to the Cerulean Sea which was still and dark\nas wine from last night’s glass at this early hour.\n“But they’re gone,” Ferkudi said, re-restating the obvious. “There’s no\nboats. Am I the only one surprised by this? Are you telling me we hurried\nfor no reason?”\nBen-hadad was staring through a far-glass. “There are some people still\nhere. Looks like they left most of the camp followers behind. At least, I\nhope that’s most of them. If Daimhin Web’s telling us the truth, though,\nthat’s only those who haven’t already left.”\n“But no army,” Winsen said.\n“They’re already gone,” Kip said.\n“What’s that mean?” Ferkudi asked.\n“It means we have to race them,” Tisis said. “We didn’t make it in time\nto stop them. We—or our messengers—have to warn the Chromeria.” She\nglanced at Kip like, ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’\n“All of us,” Kip said. “We’ll join the fight.”\nTisis sighed. “I know.

He looked at the grim\nfaces around him, then bobbed his big round head. “All right.”\n“Something occurred to me,” Cruxer said. “Your half brother.”\n“Yeah?” Kip asked. He suspected where this was going.\n“He’s a straight-up murderer. No boundaries at all. And he’s the Prism-\nelect. Prism fully in less than a week.”\n“On Sun Day, yep,” Kip said.\n“And he’s got the Lightguard, which have already committed atrocities\nfor him.”\nKip nodded, as everyone looked harder at them both. He knew where\nthis was going.\n“We’ve got no evidence for what he did here,” Cruxer said. “But he’ll\nworry we do.”\n“Uh-huh,” Kip said.\nTisis took his hand and squeezed. “I didn’t say anything, I swear.”\n“I know,” Kip said. “This was going to come up sooner or later.”\n“We’re heading back to the Chromeria with purely good intentions,”\nCruxer said. “But men with impure eyes see dirt everywhere they look.\nWe’re headed for two kinds of fights, aren’t we? And one of ’em isn’t the\nkind where we can save you.”\nKip looked from face to face: these boys he’d watched become men. He\nsaid, “I didn’t know who he was then, but High General Corvan Danavis\nhalf raised me, and he used to say politics are more dangerous than sharks\nor sea demons. We have to be ready to make sacrifices,” Kip said. “That\ndoesn’t just mean you. It means me, too.”\n“If we go back, Zymun will kill you,” Cruxer said.\n“Nah,” Kip said with a wink. “My grandfather will kill me first.”\nChapter 58\n“I will have my vengeance, Ravi.”\n“Shh, no names, no names!” the man whispered.\nThough she was nearly dozing behind a curtain, Teia’s ears pricked up\nimmediately.\n“In my own home?” Lady Aglaia Crassos scoffed.\nTeia had been following Lady Crassos for days now. She’d learned all\nsorts of things about her, from her numerous lovers to her far more\nnumerous business associates. The last few years had been disastrous for\nthe Crassos family, starting with the death of Aglaia’s brother at Gavin\nGuile’s hands, so Aglaia had been cobbling together allies and coin in ways\nshe’d never paid attention to earlier in her life. Teia couldn’t even tell where\nthe lines between lovers, business associates, and political allies might be\ndrawn, either.\nShe’d made no secret of her hatred for the Guiles, though.\nWhich might have been why some of the men who met with Aglaia\nwanted to do so privately.\nTeia had endangered herself unnecessarily at first, when she’d presumed\na furtive little banker who was meeting with Aglaia must be in the Order.\nThat had been merely an assignation: the man was married, and the only\nconspiracy he seemed to be part of was disguising the true extent of his fees\nfrom his clients."

This was her lead!\nRavi was a little beaver-faced man who fretted with his hat. “It doesn’t\nwork like that, and don’t let them see you with that attitude. I’ll… I’ll speak\nwith the priest on your behalf.”\n“The high priest, and I’ll speak to him myself.”\n“I have no idea who that is!” Ravi said.\n“Fine, then, the priest. Which one is he?” Horse-faced though she was,\nwith her perfect braided blond hair and her tiny vest worked with coins,\nAglaia could be attractive, Teia had to admit, and Ravi had certainly noticed\nher cleavage and the familiarity of her wearing house clothes in front of\nhim.\nHe made a pained noise. “It doesn’t work that way, really. Even I’m not\nsupposed to know who he is, and I’ve been in the Order for three years.\nEach priest has several congregations and they’re always very, very\ncareful.”\n“If you figured it out, then I would have, too, within a few more weeks. I\nwon’t tattle on you, Ravi… sweetest.”\n“A little fear is appropriate. These people aren’t safe.”\nShe leaned forward, clasping her hands and making the most of her\ncleavage, and did she pout her lips just a little? Regardless, she waited until\nRavi’s eyes flicked down to her breasts, which only made it more withering\nwhen she said, “Get some stones, dear man. We are these people now.”\nHis jaw twitched with momentary indignation, but then Teia saw that he\nwas the small kind of man who, when insulted, tried to prove he didn’t\ndeserve the insult. “I suppose… maybe they’ll forget that I was the one who\nbrought you in. He’s of medium height, thin…” He seemed to lose his nerve\nand stopped.\n“We’re masked and robed, Ravi. You’ve described half of them.”\nHe gulped. “I just—I just have to think! The disguises rotate with where\nwe meet. I can’t remember!”\n“Ravi,” she said soothingly. “Haven’t things gone well for you as long\nas you’ve been with me? Trust me, and things can go better yet.”\nHe sighed, defeated. “It’s Atevia Zelorn.”\n“Zelorn? The wine merchant?!”"

It was painfully obvious that Aglaia despised him, wasn’t it?\nIf Teia hadn’t already reasons beyond counting to hate Aglaia, she would\nhave added this easy manipulation to the list. Although it had been rather\nsmoothly done, hadn’t it? The woman wielded what she had like a chain\nwhip.\nAdd another reason to the list of reasons to hate her: making Teia admire\nsomething about her. Sweet Orholam’s garlicky breath, Teia was going to\nenjoy killing her.\nShe didn’t think that the Order was going to kill any of the remaining\nGuiles just because Aglaia Crassos wished it, but she didn’t know how\nmuch she should bet on that.\nShe couldn’t let Aglaia get in touch with Murder Sharp. Right now, as\nfar as Sharp was concerned, Aglaia was just one barely initiated member of\nthe Order among many. But the woman’s whole purpose in joining was\nvengeance on the Guiles, which Teia wasn’t going to allow. But wouldn’t\nthe Order find it suspicious if Aglaia disappeared right after she insisted on\nkilling a Guile?\nOr would it be more suspicious if Ravi told the leadership how she’d\ndisappeared before she even got to ask?\nWell, there’d be no suspicion at all if Teia killed both of them now. After\nall, she had all she needed from them.\nThis is how life gets cheap. Someone teaches you how easy it is to kill.\nSomeone gives you permission. The next moment it simply seems like the\nthing to do. You’re stopping an unwanted flow of information, not sending\nimmortal souls to their maker for judgment.\nIt was a hell of a thing, war. And yet part of her loved it.\nRegardless of how she felt, though, this was still the thing to do. They\nhad chosen treason. Teia was simply the satrapies’ shield coming down on\ntheir necks.\nThere was nothing more to think about it.\nThe meeting ended soon after, and Teia followed Ravi Satish. Finding\nAglaia again would be easy. Ravi was the more pressing.\nLord Ravi had come from one of the families dispossessed and\nbankrupted during the False Prism’s War. He had little more than the\nclothes on his back, and no morals whatsoever. He supported his delusions\nabout a return to power on illegal slave trading—mostly from drugging and\nenslaving sailors with the help of unscrupulous tavern owners.\nHe was the kind of man who would have lots of enemies—but not subtle\nones.\nBlunt force, Teia thought, as she followed him through the streets.

If she wanted a stabbing to look like\nthe result of a drunken brawl or a sudden passion, she’d have to be willing\nto dice him up.\nShe’d done enough grappling recently, thanks.

Teia had a sap, a leather\ncasing covering a pouch of lead balls.\nHit him, grab his purse, and roll his body into the water! Quick!\nBut she hesitated, looking around to see if anyone might witness it, and\nwhen she was sure that there was no one looking, Lord Satish was already\npast the place where it would have been a good option.\nShe should’ve been more aware. She should always be thinking about\nwhat to do if an option presented itself. Dammit!\nHe led her to a boardinghouse. It didn’t exactly have an inn on the first\nfloor, more just a single hogshead barrel of wine, an old door propped on\nsawhorses to make a counter, and one currently occupied stool. Lord Ravi\npaid the wine pourer, was given a full tankard of wine, and told which room\nhe could sleep in. Then the barman went back to chatting with the two\nwomen who were sharing the lone stool.\nTeia noted which stairs creaked, then followed Ravi up, her lesser\nweight silent. She hadn’t been close enough to hear which room he was in.\nShe could only hope that the slaving business had been going well enough\nfor him that he could afford to have the room to himself.\nWhich was kind of twisted, if she thought about it.\nHe opened the door, and Teia peeked over his shoulder. Empty. Perfect.\nShe didn’t follow him in. Instead, she went downstairs and found the\nboardinghouse’s utility closet. Boardinghouses always had things to fix,\neven if, like here, they didn’t actually fix them all that often.\nNonetheless, she was able to find a hammer with an iron head. Good\nenough.\nShe ghosted back up the stairs. No sense in delaying things.\nBut she paused at the door.\nOne breath, T. You get one deep breath to panic. Then you move.\nShe took her long deep breath, and savored her paralysis like a warm\nbed on a cold morning. Then she exhaled slowly, shimmering into visibility\nand removing her hood."

Then she exhaled slowly, shimmering into visibility\nand removing her hood.\nShe opened the door and stepped into the room like she owned the place.\nIt was small, nondescript, not very clean, with fresh rushes thrown down on\nthe bed on top of months of dirty ones. Ravi Satish was halfway into pulling\nhis tunic over his head.\nAt the sound of the door opening and closing, he said, “What the hell?\nArun told me I’d have this room to myself to—oh.”\nHe finished shucking his tunic off and stopped speaking as he saw her.\n“Dammit, that’s what he told me,” Teia said. “Did one of us get the\nwrong room?”\n“Uh, second room on the right?” Ravi said.\n“That’s what he told me,” Teia said, giving him a bold look.\n“Arun’s always been a joker. I’m going to have to thank him for this\none, though.”\n“No,” Teia said quietly. “No you’re not.” She took off the master cloak\nand hung it on a hook by the door.\nRavi picked up his tankard, still standing bare-chested. “I’m, uh, not\nsure I take your meaning.”\n“Would you be willing to share?”\n“Share? The bed?” he asked.\n“The wine. I’m parched.” But she smirked as if the bed might be a\npossibility, later.\n“Oh, the wine. Of course. Of course.”\n“Thank you,” she said. She took the tankard and pretended to drink. She\ncoughed. “Oooh,” she said, “that is really bad.”\n“Does the trick, though,” he said with a chuckle. He looked her up and\ndown.\nShe set down the tankard on the lone table. Out of the way.\nThen she turned back to him.\nHis eyes went round as he saw her hellstone stare. She pinched the\nnerves in his spine hard, and caught him as he fell.\nShe guided him to his knees, then released the nerves. “I know you’re in\nthe Order. If you believe in repentance,” she whispered in his ear, “now’s\nthe time.”\nShe would have a few seconds until he regained feeling. Should,\nanyway. She grabbed the hammer from the master cloak’s pocket, stepped\nup to him, and swung with all her might.\nTeia had never killed a man this way. She wasn’t sure what she’d\nexpected, but hadn’t expected the hammer to stick. It crushed through his\ntemple in a splatter of blood and bone and brain, and stopped.\nRavi crumpled to the ground, his skull clinging to the hammer harder\nthan her fingers did.\nHe tumbled to the floor, but somehow, he wasn’t dead.\n“My teeth. You broke my teeth!” he moaned into the ground.\nTeeth? What the hell?! But Teia was already moving, reaching out with\nparyl to squeeze his spine and grab his heart.\nMake it stop. Dear Orholam, would you please just die?\nHe went limp as she found the right grip, but his heart kept stubbornly\npumping on.\nThen she saw them, glistening pearly beside his head. He’d broken his"

He’d broken his\nteeth against the floor as he fell.\nBut whinging about his teeth? When there was a hammer in his head?\nGradually, Teia found the nerves she needed, and Lord Ravi Satish died\nat her feet, sphincters relaxing, burbling, befouling his clothes and the air.\nShe rifled through his pockets to find his coin sticks and a knife, then\nstepped back quickly before the blood pool spreading from his head could\nreach her feet. The last thing she wanted to leave here was her small\nfootprints.\nShe tore off his sleeve and looked at herself in the room’s small polished\nbronze mirror. She blotted off the blood spatter on her face and neck and\nhand—there wasn’t much, thank Orholam, and none at all she could see\nagainst her blacks.\nShe dipped his blade into the pool of blood, then flicked her wrist to\ndistribute blood drops on the linens. Ravi’s body had no cuts on it, so they’d\nguess that he’d cut his attacker before he himself was killed.\nThen she tossed the knife across the room.\nIt clanged loudly, but no one was going to look into such a small sound\nin a place like this.\nShe left, invisible. Several blocks later, she stopped at the dock where\nshe’d almost simply pushed him into the water, where she’d missed her\nchance at murder without drama, or blood, or pain. Without broken teeth\nand blood spatter.\nShe’d told herself this wasn’t murder. It was sanctioned killing.\nGranted: sanctioned without trial, commissioned in secret, committed in\nsecret, and she would be prosecuted by the very state she served if she were\ncaught, lest the Order find out how close the Chromeria had gotten to them.\nIt had been murder in every sense except for a few words of permission\nspoken to the ephemeral air.\nTeia hadn’t done anything but work in months. She’d never gambled or\ndrank or listened to the minstrels or watched the puppets or the light shows.\nShe’d needed to train. She’d needed to hunt. She’d needed to train some\nmore. There was always more to do that might later mean the difference\nbetween life and death.\nShe’d passed her name day, and even she hadn’t noticed. She was\nbecoming all warrior, all the bits of little girl and woman scraped away to\nleave only muscles and magic and blades.\nIf she were tough enough, and cold enough, and strong enough, she\nwould go back to Aglaia Crassos’s estate right now. Murder the woman, or\nkill her, if there was any difference anymore, and be done with this before\nanything else could go wrong.\nYou keep moving before your enemy can recover and counter. You don’t\nstop until they can’t recover, until they can never counter again.\nBut she wasn’t tough, or strong, or cold in any way except physically\nright now.\nIt was time to find Quentin, and report, and then though she knew he\ndidn’t really like to be touched, he was going to hug her while she cried for\nfive minutes, then she would go out again.

None of that!\nA woman makes do.\nTen minutes, scrawny Quentin, and I don’t start crying until I’m where\nno one can see me.\nHead high, she dropped her bloody cloth into the water, and the sea\nswallowed her sins, as it had swallowed so many before.\nChapter 59\n“You want to know what’s the worst?” Kip asked, staring at the plinth.\n“Rhetorical questions?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“Swamp ass,” Big Leo said.\n“A booger you can’t reach,” Ferkudi said. “Or mosquitoes. If you were\ntrapped with mosquitoes and had a booger you couldn’t reach, that’d be\nreally bad.”\n“When you’re two pumps shy of drawing the happy water up from your\nwell and the woman’s husband walks in?” Winsen asked.\n“Insubordination?” Cruxer suggested. “Cluelessness? Obscenity?”\n“No. Wiseasses,” Kip said. “But after that? When someone tells you the\nsolution to a problem is obvious, and then you can’t figure it out.”\n“Huh,” Ben-hadad said. “Never had that happen to me.”\n“I hate you guys,” Kip said. “I know we’ve all got things to do, but what\nam I missing here?”\n“The answer,” Winsen said.\n“Win, shut it,” they all said.\nBig Leo said, “Commander, were you lumping me with Ben’s\ninsubordination or Ferkudi’s cluelessness?”\nCruxer ignored him, though, saying, “Liv Danavis—or whatever she is\nnow—said she’d activated the Great Mirror here. But… there’s no Great\nMirror here. Right? I mean, is it hidden somewhere else in Apple Grove?”\nThey shook their heads. It was a small town, and their people had\nsearched all of it. Even if the Mirror were half the size of the one housed in\nRu or Dúnbheo, it would still be impossible to hide.\n“And saying it’s been ‘activated’ makes it sound like it’s functional, so\nit’s not lying in some barn or something; there has to be the whole frame\nsystem, right?” Kip asked. He looked at the plinth. Was it supposed to be\nthe base of the frame, or where you’d set the frame?\n“Well, then, it’s obvious, especially given that,” Ben-hadad said,\npointing to the plinth. “The mirror’s buried right under us.”\n“Well, yeah, obviously,” Kip said. He looked over at the cracked earth at\nthe base of the plinth. “The crack made that impossible to miss, right?”\nHe’d missed it. Apparently so had some of the others. They were\nlooking down uneasily."

We hate you for all sorts of reasons,” Winsen said easily.\nKip walked over to the plinth. There were no superviolet panels on it. It\nfelt like it was just a marker. And maybe it had been, the ancient equivalent\nof ‘Dig here.’\nFerkudi said, “Please don’t tell me we have to dig it up.”\n“We?” Ben-hadad said. “I’m gonna be overseeing the drafters building\nour skimmers down at the coast. Actually, I should really be on my way.”\nBut he didn’t leave. Ben couldn’t leave an unsolved puzzle.\nKip shielded his eyes against most of the light and looked into the chi,\nthough it pained his eyes to compress them so far. He’d gone blind for three\ndays the last time he’d used a lot of chi, and he couldn’t afford that now.\nHe shot a pulse down into the earth, and it seemed to burn his skin in a\nline from his eyes, down his shoulders, along his entire arm. He tensed, but\nno one seemed to notice.\nWith its tremendous energy, the chi penetrated the earth easily, and he\nsaw that Ben-hadad was right. Under a thin layer of grasses, the soil yielded\nfrom the native loam to a vast bowl of sand, and within that sand was a\nframe system, and lower still was a vast quantity of luxin. Green probably,\nconsidering the history of this satrapy. A temple? A shrine of some sort? It\nfelt strange, though, as if being underground so long had changed it from\nsolid luxin to a liquid. Or maybe it was just that he’d reached the limits of\nhis tiny chi burst.\nBut that was all he could see in the tiny burst he’d shot out.\n“It’s a moot point,” Cruxer said. “The Blood Robe army’s gone. It’d be\nlike building a siege engine when there’s no siege… Unless…” Cruxer\ncleared his throat. “Our Lightbringer needs to tinker?”\nThey all looked at him.\n“I’ve been thinking about it,” Ben-hadad said, “and I keep coming up\nshort. I mean, I get why the mirror towers would have been tremendously\nuseful to the ancients. The kingdoms were broken into single colors, right?\nAll the red drafters would go to Atash, greens here, and so on. They didn’t\nhave colored lenses, so simply fighting in bad light or at the wrong time of\nday or without decent sources would have been the death of many of them.\nSo before lenses were developed, a king could gather thousands of precious\nor semiprecious stones—anything in their color—and use the Great Mirrors\nto beam their color out to their drafters.

But, Breaker, I don’t understand how the\nMirrors are going to help us now: every drafter at the Chromeria has\nspectacles in their own color, and all the buildings are white by design.\nSourcing isn’t a problem for us. The real problem is how the bane paralyze\nus. Are you certain that the Great Mirrors even do anything about that?\nLike, you bombard a drafter—or even the bane—with a complementary\ncolor, or what?”\nThey all looked at Kip. It wasn’t exactly a problem he hadn’t thought\nabout in the long days on the trail.\n“Hand me your water skin, would you?” Kip asked Cruxer, who gave it\nto him immediately.\nHe shot a quick flash again, this time down the plinth.\nIt showed a dark panel on the structure, two paces below.\n“Aha!” he said, gladly dropping the chi. He poured water over the\nblisters rising on his burning hand, handing the skin back absentmindedly.\n“I wonder.”\nHe wasn’t going to be able to worm superviolet all the way down into\nthe soil by itself, but what if…\nConnecting superviolet to chi, like foot soldiers following charging\ncavalry, Kip shot chi into the soil, clearing the way for the superviolet to\nreach the panel. It’d be way faster than digging.\nHe’d only have an instant. Unless he wanted to hold on to this hot coal\nthat was chi for longer.\n“Kip, do you think maybe it would be a good idea to take it slow with\n—” Tisis said.\nAnd there, in the panel, he felt an obvious trigger, as if recently repaired,\njust waiting for his touch.\nThanks, Liv. It was only as the trigger clicked that he thought, What if\nthis is a trap?\n“Oops,” he said.\nWith a muffled grinding of massive gears, the earth suddenly shifted\nunder their feet.\n“Run!” Kip shouted.\nOnly Tisis froze. She had no idea what was happening.\nA two-paces-wide section of earth simply dropped into the ground\nbeside them, tearing the grass free, exposing a chasm below and a glimpse\nof stone workings.\nKip stopped, grabbed Tisis, and threw her over his shoulder, sprinting\nfor the trees. More ground gave way to the other side, the sand undergirding\nthe grass sliding into oblivion, the sound of pouring sand and rumbling\nmachinery filling his ears.\nAs always, he went to green first. The morning was bright, and the grass\nwas emerald, the trees vibrant with dark-green leaves. The green rushed to\nhim like a long-absent friend to an embrace.\nBut he wasn’t going to make it to the safety of the trees. The Mighty had\nall seen that he was sprinting, and had bolted themselves. Only Cruxer\nlooked back now, horror and guilt etching his features: he’d run away\nwithout his wards.\nThe ground heaved upward for one moment and staggered him.

He felt the ground\ngo soft under his left foot and saw it disappear from where he was going to\nplant his right.\nHe blasted green luxin down as hard as he could, but carrying Tisis, it\nwas too little to compensate; they were too heavy together.\nLeft hand under her ribs, he heaved her to safety, and plunged toward\nthe depths.\nHe hit the wall of the abyss gracelessly and caught the edge, lost it, and\ngrabbed some roots overhanging the blank wall. He slipped, slid down, and\nthen caught a double handful.\nHe didn’t even think to draft. The wind had been knocked from him\nwhen he hit the wall, and all he could do was clamp his eyes shut and hold\non as tight as a kid fighting his big brother for a sweet.\nThe roots were tearing up his hands.\n“Kip, let go!” Tisis shouted from above. She sounded in pain.\nShe must have said, ‘Don’t let go,’ and he’d missed it. “I won’t!” he\nshouted.\n“No, Breaker. Let go,” Cruxer said, suddenly there with her, looking\nover the edge of the abyss at him.\nKip looked down. His feet were almost touching the sunken ground.\nOh.\nHe dropped onto the churned grass and sand.\nKip turned. The first thing he noticed was that there was a platform right\nwhere they’d all been standing moments before. It was untouched by the\nseismic chaos, its grass still undisturbed. Ah, because whoever had hidden\nthe mirror hadn’t meant it to be a death trap for whoever triggered it.\nIf he’d listened to his wife and looked a bit longer before messing with\nthe control panel to a massive subterranean structure, he would have\ncertainly seen it.\nHe glanced over at her. She was rubbing her ribs as if he’d bruised her\nwhen he’d thrown her to safety. Safety. What a hero.\nBut finally, his eye was drawn to the most obvious part of the gigantic\nmachinery that had emerged from the soil. Perhaps working on the same\nprinciples as the mighty escape lines running from the Prism’s Tower down\ninto the city, massive counterweights must have dropped into hidden\ncaverns in the earth in order to lever a great disk and a frame into the air,\nthirty paces high, with a huge pitted silver disk barely smaller than that held\nvertically in the frame.\nBut even as he watched, that silver casing cracked open, and a sheet of it\nslid off, first one side and then the other, revealing a giant lens and a giant\nmirror. Each cover spun out slowly, balancing on opposite arms.\nThere was no sign of the green temple below them, though. When this\nhad all been buried, only the frame and mirror had been rigged to rise.\n“Well, that was invigorating,” Cruxer said, dusting himself off.\n“Been too long since I nearly died,” Big Leo said.\n“Most bracing,” Ben-hadad said, through obvious pain. “Speaking of\nbraces…” He looked down at his leg, where his knee brace had snapped.\n“Looks like I have some repairs to do.”\n“I said ‘Oops,’” Kip said, his heart still racing."

A gigantic weapon,\nhidden by the ancients. And we found it! It’s actually here!”\n“We don’t know how to use it, so it’s not really a weapon yet,” Ben-\nhadad said. “Except maybe against impulsive Tyreans who can be hurt by\nvery minor falls.”\n“But he could’ve figured it out,” Tisis said. “Liv thought he could’ve,\nand so do I.

The trouble was that\nthere was no telling which was hiding key information in plain sight: This\nrumor of sea monsters? This one of new lux storms in the Cracked Lands?\nThis sighting of Gavin Guile smashing the Everdark Gates? This rumor\nabout the pirate queen launching a laughably massive fleet to prey on Sun\nDay pilgrims? No, it was Pash Vecchio’s fleet! And he was coming to\ninvade Big Jasper!\nKarris sighed, taking another spoonful of a delicious soup that she really\nwasn’t appreciating as she should. There were fleets coming here—two of\nthem at least, and decked out for war: one under Corvan Danavis and one\nunder King Ironfist. And there were certainly thousands of pilgrims banded\ntogether, and there were certainly many pirates, too. But her spies\nthemselves should winnow out the most ridiculous of the rumors—except\nshe’d told them not to, fearing she’d miss something important.\nPash Vecchio had (possibly? likely?) worked with the White King\nbefore, and Gavin had sunk the pirate king’s flagship, but such a blow was\nmore likely to send the cur scurrying back to his islands than to try to take\nvengeance on a man he and everyone else believed to be dead.\nMeanwhile, here, the Chromeria’s fleet, gathered to conduct its own\nexercises in preparation for Corvan Danavis’s arrival (and Karris’s hoped-\nfor invasion of Blood Forest—which she still needed to figure out how to\npitch to Andross), had heard a rumor of some other pirate fleet and had\nsailed out immediately, without even telling Karris which direction they\nwere headed.\nIt would be a good exercise for them, as long as they didn’t sink any\npilgrim vessels on their way.

The nobleman had been the general who’d\ngotten tens of thousands of soldiers slaughtered at the Battle of Ox Ford.\nThose losses had nearly driven the Ruthgaris and the Parians to surrender\nand ally with the Blood Robes. Caul had resigned in disgrace before he\ncould be fired. But the money to support the new fleet had to come from\nsomewhere, and she’d known that the Azmiths were desperate for Caul to\nbe given a chance to redeem himself. She’d allowed that he could serve\nwith the fleet but had barred him from command.\nShe’d meant all command. The Azmiths had agreed. Now it seemed\nthey’d gone around her. They’d apparently put him in a subcommand in\ncontrol of a quarter of the fleet, under an admiral whom Azmith’s familial\nconnections allowed him to bully.\nShe had about a week to decide how to chasten them without losing their\nmonetary support.

And it feels like an inconvenience! I\nreally am getting soft.\nKarris stood and stretched. Her soreness reminded her of the morning’s\ntraining as much as of the day’s sitting. She wasn’t getting literally soft, at\nleast. Not anymore.\nShe wasn’t quite back to the body she’d had at twenty—but maybe that\nship had sailed, too.

May I come in?”\n“I’m afraid I’m terribly busy—”\n“Won’t take but a moment.” He glanced down the hall, where a\nBlackguard was striding back toward her post. Just someone taking an\nunscheduled break. Overstretched forces.\nWas Karris going to throw him out? Make a scene?

Forbade me even to\napologize for anything I might have done… I’m so ashamed of myself. Can\nyou just tell me what I did?”\n“Your grandfather said what?!” Karris asked.\n“Mother, I hurt you somehow, and now you’re joining my enemies.

He said he didn’t know why\nyou hated me, but that once you hated, you never turned away from your\nwrath, that you never forgave anyone. Not ever in all your life. He forbade\nme to come speak to you of it. Told me I’d only arouse you further. But he\ndoesn’t know you like I do. You’re not like that… are you?”\nShe stepped forward, aghast. Furious. What the hell was Andross\nplaying at?!\nHer only warning was that Zymun didn’t look up as he said the last\nwords—‘are you?’\nHe didn’t search her face for any sign of forgiveness.\nHer old Blackguard senses shrieked at her, but too late.\nZymun pounced, tackling her, and crushing her under his larger body.\nHis eyes were full of color, but as devoid of feeling as a snake’s. He’d\nhidden them with his hands to hide that he was drafting.\nNow luxin snared her hands, her throat.\nHe punched her hard in the stomach, but she took the blow with\npracticed ease. She immediately began wending a foot up for a wrestling\nhold—\n—and stopped as he pricked a dagger point under her eyelid.\nThe flat, dead look in his eyes gave her no read.\nIf he killed her, they’d put him on Orholam’s Glare for sure. But he\ndidn’t even seem to be aware of that. Had no concern for consequences in\nthe least. Not in this. Not in anything.\nShe stopped fighting.\nIn moments, he’d immobilized her with luxin bonds."

No place in the councils of war? No honors that are due me?\nYou treat me like a child! And it ends now.”\nQuietly, calmly, despite the hand tight around her throat, Karris said,\n“May I speak, Zymun?”\n“Son!” he said. “You call me son.”\n“They warned me,” she said, her voice distant. “But I didn’t see you.\nNot as you are. I let my guilt blind me. For a time, but no more.”\n“You’ll give me what I want,” Zymun said.\n“Astonishing,” she said as if amused, though her guts squirmed. “So\nclose to being given all you want and you can’t help but show your true\ncolors. No. You’re no son of mine, Zymun. I disown you. Disavow you. I\nadmit, you certainly do bear a resemblance to the worst parts of me, and\nperhaps you have my own father’s weak chin and venial disposition and\nshallow intellect, but you’re not the small, lame, petty shadow of Gavin\nGuile that I thought you were; you bear no likeness to him at all. I shall\nhave to ponder that harried month when I conceived you. It seems more and\nmore undeniable that I must have gotten very drunk and fucked a village\nidiot.”\n“You… you cunt!”\n“Get out,” she said, ignoring her bonds, ignoring that he was on top of\nher and she was helpless. “And never speak to me again.”\n“I know how to break a woman,” he hissed, spit flying in her face. “I’ve\ndone it before. It’s not so hard.”\n“You’ll break nothing here,” Karris said. “You’ll walk out that door with\nyour tail between your legs like the cur you are.”\n“Oh yeah?” he said. He lifted the hand with the dagger. “You stupid\nbitch, I’ll—”\nHe cut off as two spear blades slid into view. One sharp blade slipped\nbeneath his wrist, so the dagger couldn’t descend without him slicing off his\nown hand. The other blade pressed along the side of Zymun’s neck.\nGill Greyling stood behind Zymun, spears trembling in his grip, not with\nfear but with rage.\nKarris had never been happier to see anyone in her life.\n“Give me the excuse,” Gill said. His voice was raspy. The man had been\non edge perpetually since his brother died.\nZymun eased up, carefully dropping the dagger on the carpet, far out,\nraising his hands slowly and releasing the luxin to dust. “Could have sworn\nI barred that door,” he said, good-naturedly, as if it had all been a joke. He\nrocked back on his heels and stood slowly.\nDerisively, Karris laughed at him as if he were the stupidest man she’d\never met. “As if the Blackguard doesn’t have ways to open the doors here?”\nHis face dropped, and the mask slipped to show the depth of the ugliness"

He couldn’t stand disrespect.\nShe only hoped he’d attack.\nGill would kill him—he wouldn’t try to wound or incapacitate him, she\nknew. She knew her Blackguards.\nShe stood up and brushed the luxin dust off.\nNow she was free, though, and this was all out in the open. She was\nhonestly relieved. No more pretenses.\n“Zymun,” she said. “Until tonight, I didn’t scheme against you. Not\never. But now I will. Thank you for bringing your true nature to light.\nHistory will judge me for giving birth to a monster. But at least I have the\ndecency to hate him.”\nBut his dead eyes betrayed nothing even of rage now. He walked out the\ndoor, then stopped and turned. “Oh, may I have my dagger, please? It was a\ngift from my grandfather.”\n“Try to take it,” Gill said dangerously. “See what happens.”\nZymun didn’t move.\n“What’s your name again, Blackguard?” Zymun demanded.\n“You don’t remember?” Gill asked, looking at him contemptuously. “A\ntrue Guile would.”\nChapter 61\n“I have news about our hunt,” Quentin said. He furrowed his thick brows.\n“Good news, barely good news, and definitely not good news.”\nTeia had managed to pull her shit together, somewhat, and hadn’t asked\nQuentin for a hug the other day, despite having told him the outlines of how\nshe’d killed Ravi and what she’d learned. She’d fled then to her solitude,\nonly giving him the name ‘Atevia Zelorn.’\nShe still wanted that hug, actually, but… Quentin was so damned\nawkward, and he didn’t like to be touched. It would be selfish. And\nprobably not satisfying. Right? “Go ahead,” she said.\nShe’d asked to hear about his project first; it gave her time to gather her\nwits.\n“Easy one first,” he said. “Zelorn is indeed a wine merchant. Very\nsuccessful one, too. Well-known among the nobility. Karris didn’t have her\npeople dig too deeply, though, lest it alarm anyone.” He described where to\nfind Zelorn’s house, and his profile: physical description, style of clothing,\nthree kids, six slaves, various servants between home and business, two\nlong-term mistresses, and a pretty young wife who spent a lot of time\ncrying about his many affairs, the pursuit of which seemed to be his main\npastime.\nOther than being a pagan priest, Teia thought.\n“That was the shallow digging?” Teia asked.\n“That’s exactly how I reacted,” Quentin said. “High Lady Guile said,\n‘Of course. Anyone in the upper nobility would dig that much into anyone\nthey were considering doing even casual business with.’”\n“Sometimes I think the nobles are just like the rest of us, and then other\ntimes…” Teia said.\n“Also exactly my reaction,” Quentin said.\n“But that was the good news, though, wasn’t it?” Teia asked.

Though\nthat was all helpful, she could’ve learned it herself—though any time she\nwent out in public was a time she was risking Sharp finding her.\n“Afraid so. Now, about the other project,” he said. He opened a folio on\nhis desk. “These are copies of all the final plans for each of the Chromeria’s\nseven towers. Builders’ notes, allotments of slaves, materials requests,\nstockpiles, and overages. Everything I could find. No budgets, irritatingly,\nwhich is what keyed me in—but I’m getting ahead of myself. If there’s a\nhidden room in the Chromeria anywhere, it should show up here.”\nOne of the jobs Teia had given Quentin was to search the Chromeria for\nthe Old Man of the Desert’s secret room. She knew he had one, if not more.\nShe herself had lost caches of clothing and money and weapons simply to\nservants or strangers stumbling across them; there was no way the Old Man\nwas going to risk the same happening to his code books; there was no way\nhe’d risk someone interrupting him as he penned or decoded his secret\nmessages. Secrecy required privacy, and the bigger the secret the more\nprivacy required.\n“That sounds pretty good… can you not read them? Are they in code or\nsomething?” Teia asked.\n“No, I can read them. Now. I had to study up on construction techniques\nand terminology. Took me a while,” the slender young man said.\n“So… the bad news is…?”\n“The plans show no space for any hidden rooms at all,” Quentin said.\n“Everything is clear and public.”\n“Okay…”\n“But I found an exterminator’s report of a rat’s nest… right here under\nthe young discipuli’s barracks.”\nTeia looked at the plans, but for her they might as well have been written\nin Old Tyrean. “Explain?”\n“See, in the diagram here, there’s no space at all. This is supposed to be\nhardwood planking directly over stone. But the rat catcher’s report\nmentions finding a rat king… Do you know what that is?” He looked ill just\nspeaking about it.\n“No.”\n“You don’t want to. Regardless, he said the rat king was two paces high.\nAccording to the plans, that’s impossible. There’s no space for it. So the\nplans are wrong. So I went outside, and using some trigonometry and an\nastrolabe, I was able to calculate the heights of the towers.”\n“And the Prism’s Tower was taller than these plans say,” Teia guessed.\n“No. All of the towers are taller than these plans say. Four paces taller!\nAnd these are the most recent plans. So that means there isn’t just one\nsecret room, there’s the equivalent of one secret floor. In every tower.”\n“How do you hide an entire secret floor?”\n“Cleverly, I guess. Maybe not all in one place? People look at the towers\nfrom the outside all the time, and point out their rooms and the rooms of\ntheir friends. I don’t even know how you do it, honestly. I’m no master\nbuilder, but whoever did this certainly was. Of course, I am pretty sure that"

So I’d\nguess the Black would have those, or the promachos.”\n“My money’s on Andross Guile. The man’s a maelstrom of secrets.”\n“I concur,” Quentin said.\n“Quen,” Teia said. “No one says, ‘I concur.’”\n“I know, but it bothers you,” he said with a quick grin.\nShe forced a smile, but then returned to the task. “It’s not like we can\nask Carver Black,” she said. She sighed. Should she break into his rooms?\nHis office? How long would it take her to find a book he’d hidden? Could\nshe spare the time from hunting the Order itself to surveil him? What reason\nwould Carver Black have to check the old tower plans? He might have\nthose documents, not ever check them.\nAnd who was to say Carver Black even knew? Would the Old Man of\nthe Desert hide in a place Carver Black knew? Was Carver Black himself in\nthe Order?\nShe sighed. It all made her head hurt. She would need years to untangle\nall this fully. And it wasn’t like she could kill Carver Black without anyone\nnoticing. No, her best bet wasn’t to go after individuals to find if they were\nin the Order; it was to let the Order come to her. She rubbed her jaw\ngingerly.\nShe had to figure out some way to mark every person who attended their\nFeast of the Dying Light, the night before Sun Day. Maybe in the changing\nroom? Could she mark their clothing?\nThen Karris’s soldiers could sweep down on the traitors on Sun Day\nmorning and wipe them out in one fell swoop.\nThey could celebrate Sun Day by putting the Old Man of the Desert up\non Orholam’s Glare.\nThere was one man Teia would happily watch cook, screaming in agony\nas he died.\nIf she could survive so long. She rubbed her jaw again.\n“Tooth still hurting?” Quentin asked. “I thought you were going to go\nsee the White’s barber about that before all this even started.”\n“I did. Not that I can tell, but he said it’s better now than it would have\nbeen if I hadn’t come to see him.”\n“A nonfalsifiable statement. Clever.”\n“I’m supposed to chew some herbs to help, but I always forget,” she\nsaid. “I don’t know what irritates me more: that he may be a charlatan or\nthat this may be my fault because I don’t follow instructions.” She heard the\nwhinging in her voice, and shut up.\nQuentin looked at her, and didn’t fill the sudden silence.\n“It’s killing me,” she said.\n“Your tooth? Not your tooth.”\nShe sat on Quentin’s bed. “Quentin, you’re on a first-name basis with\nthe guy: how can Orholam allow this?”\n“This?” Quentin asked uncertainly.\n“I’m a butcher, Quen. I’ve taken to scoring a notch on my knife for each\nkill.”"

I’ve taken to scoring a notch on my knife for each\nkill.”\nHe said nothing, but he wasn’t fast enough to hide the brief flash of\ndistaste on his lips.\n“Not to brag about the number. To remind myself. Because I was\nforgetting. They all run together until I dream: Oh, the way that one slave\ngurgled on his blood because he bit his tongue so hard in his fear of me\nbefore I even touched him. How that other girl wept from the moment the\ndoor opened and never even got a word out because she was crying so hard.\nI remember how I despised her, how I wished she would die as bravely as\nsome of the others had. Do you know, they gave me a break? The Order.\nSaid that too many slaves had disappeared, and they needed to hold off until\nsome more refugees came to the island so no one would get suspicious—\nand I felt disappointed because it would interrupt my studies. Disappointed.\nFor only a moment, yes. But what the hell is that? I don’t want to be this\nperson I’m becoming, Quentin. Why would Orholam allow this?”\n“‘If Orholam can do something, and if He cares about us, why doesn’t\nHe?’”\nShe nodded. “So what’s the answer?”\n“The answer’s simple for the mind, but impossible for the heart. And the\nquestion, honestly asked, always comes from a wound.” He said no more.\nShe waited, then understood. “So you’re not going to tell me.”\n“Not when you’re hurting and angry. You’ll reject the answer, and then\nlater you’ll think of it as an answer you already found lacking and perhaps\nyou’ll neglect to consider it again. Having found a door’s handle bristling\nwith needles, you’ll tell yourself it’s probably locked anyway. When you\ncome to the big questions, before you can get a true answer, you need to\nknow whether you’re approaching them rationally or emotionally.”\nA Blackguard guards his emotions, Teia thought. “So you’re not going\nto tell me the rational answer until I can approach the question rationally,”\nshe said.\n“It’s not that it’s a big Magisterium secret. You could go ask any luxiat\nand get the same answer today that I’ll give you when you’re ready—\nthough some will phrase it more or less eloquently. But in my estimation,\nyou’ll profit more from it later. If you disagree, you’re free to ask them.”\n“You’re asking me to trust you when I don’t understand something hard\nfor me,” she said. “That’s supposed to parallel something, isn’t it?”\n“I didn’t mean it to, but perhaps it does. Thanks for thinking I’m smarter\nthan I am.”\nShe pursed her lips to keep from smiling, though the hollow in her chest\nstill ached.\n“Now,” he said, “you were abrupt last time. Seemed on edge. You killed\nthis slaver, Ravi Satish. Easy kill?”\nSticking a hammer in his head? Easier than I thought. Fooling him?\nPathetically easy.

You’re going\nto kill her?”\nShe nodded once, sharp as a falling guillotine.\n“This is your first job that isn’t purely professional.”\n“It’s necessary,” she said, quick and defensive. “If she contacts Murder\nSharp, it brings him to her, and that puts him way too close to me. Plus she\nintends to contract a hit on a Guile. Not Andross, I’m sure. Sharp probably\nwouldn’t take the job, but how could I explain that to Karris?”\n“Those are all good reasons. Sufficient reasons,” Quentin said. He let it\nhang there.\n“Yeah,” she said, trying to cover it over.\n“Yeah?”\nTeia felt stricken. He knew she wasn’t being honest, and yet his eyes\nwere filled with compassion. “She’s low-level, Quen. I mean, she’s a noble,\nso she’d rise quickly in their ranks… but she told Ravi she only joined them\nto try to get revenge on the Guiles for… something. Which, come to think\nof it, she ranted to me about a long time ago. Her brother was the governor\nof Garriston, and Gavin Guile killed him as a traitor or something? I don’t\nknow exactly. But it means she’s not a true believer. And I know where the\nOrder’s meeting now. She doesn’t need to die, not exactly. I mean, she’s\ncommitted capital offenses, and she’s covered under my writ, but if she\nwere anyone else, and she got away? It wouldn’t trouble me. She wouldn’t\nbe forming a new Order ten years from now. But I want to kill her almost as\nmuch as I want the Old Man.”\n“Then you know.”\n“I know what?”\nQuentin looked at her, and his eyes were old and gentle. “Teia, this is the\nmost dangerous job you’ve ever done. Not physically. This is where you\ncan come to love what you do. The power of it. The righteous vengeance.\nThis work wounds you, but this job is where you can get dirt in the wound.”\n“Like I haven’t already?” she scoffed.\n“To this point, you’ve been a shield, doing what you have to do, getting\nbattered and torn protecting those you love. Now you decide what else you\nare. You can torture her, if you want. You can try to make her pay for all she\ndid to your friends and to you. You can look into her eyes and wring\nwhatever suffering from her you desire. No one can stop you.”\n“And no one should,” Teia said coldly.\n“Some luxiats say even the Two Hundred may yet repent, but from what\nyou’ve told me of her, I daresay Aglaia’s damnation is assured. What’s in\nquestion is yours.”\nChapter 62\nWith a grunt, Gavin set down the great, cumbersome Lust stone he’d borne\nfor the entire circuit around the black tower on a pedestal.

The weight of the stone released a boon stone wider than his\nhand from the statue’s grip.\n“Chastity, I suppose?” Gavin asked, picking up the boon stone.\nThe prophet didn’t have to answer.\n“I’ll be happy to give this one up to Orholam!” Gavin said.\nThe old man was as stone-faced as the statues, and a good deal less\njoyful.\n“You know,” Gavin said, “to hand over Chastity, because I don’t want\nit?”\nOrholam pursed his lips.\n“Not like, give up my chastity to Orholam, like a sexual… You know\nwhat? Never mind. Just looking for a little levity, after the bludgeoning I\njust took with that round. You know what I mean?”\n“No.”\n“So tell me, O, why aren’t you pilgriming with me? Pilgriming.\nPilgrimaging? Huh. I’m the head of the faith and I don’t know how people\nusually say it. I think I like pilgriming. Feels grim, and it’s a bitter pill,\nright? No? Not working with me at all here, are you? Fine. Why aren’t you\npilgriming? No sins to purge? Too holy already?”\nAs Orholam sighed, Gavin took the Chastity boon stone and tucked it\ninto a pocket in the pilgrim’s tunic. It was heavy, but it fit perfectly.\nWhen Grinwoody had commissioned Gavin for this task, he’d\nmentioned magical locks at every level that the fleeing guardians had left to\nkeep out drafters of each associated color. That was why Gavin, unable now\nto draft, was supposedly the perfect candidate to assassinate Orholam—or\nthe magical nexus called Orholam. So far, though, Gavin had only felt a\nwhisper of resistance as he walked through each gate, and that may have\nbeen his imagination or his dread at what the next circle would hold.\nThey moved farther into the landing. There was one between each circle.\nHere, silently, they ate salt fish and drank water while Gavin recovered. The\nsteep chute that Gavin had seen below had an opening here, and Gavin\nwondered how many pilgrims failed not on each level but on the spaces\nbetween them like this, where they pondered how terrible the next one\nwould be.\nHow easy was it to give up and simply escape, too afraid to confront\nwhat lay next?\n“I’m journeying for you,” Orholam said finally, when Gavin had nearly\nforgotten his question. “If I did my own pilgrimage, I would take much less\ntime on certain circles than you, leaving you alone. It’s even possible I\nmight take more time on certain circles. Dimly. Wrath, for one, would not\nbe easy on me. But I’m here to walk with you, step for step, no matter how\nlong you take. We’re not meant to take the pilgrimage alone.”\n“So no pilgrimage for you at all?” Gavin asked.\n“When my business with you is finished, I’ll go back down and start my\nown climb.”\n“I’m really delighted that you are here for me, but I, uh, won’t be joining\nyou for yours.

Then he frowned.\n“There’s my old Wrath again, rearing up inside,” Orholam said as if\ndisappointed in himself.\n“I piss you off that much, huh?” Gavin asked. And here he’d been being\nas respectful as he could manage. Wrath was going to be a tough circle for\nhim, too.\n“This is your chance to decide whether you want to be that old deceiver\nGavin Guile or if you want to be a Dazen Guile made new. I know you want\nthat. You’ve made attempts before. This is an opportunity to change, Guile.\nAnd you’ve been offered more of those than most get. Take it.”\nThe old prophet hunkered down with his own salt fish, turning his back\non Gavin. The conversation, clearly, was finished.\nGavin sighed. Some company for his pilgrimage.\nHe’d mostly given up trying to understand the magic of whoever had\ncreated this tower. It had to be a highly advanced will-casting-focused\nmagic, from the way it triggered Gavin’s memories. He’d had multiple\nflashbacks during every circle: the makers of this thing had weaponized his\nown mind against him.\nThis wasn’t a hike up a tower; it was a trek through everything he’d ever\ndone wrong, everything he’d never done right. This was his every failure\nheld up to the light and splintered into its component deadly sins through a\nblack prism.\nIt was not a magic to be understood, merely one to be endured. He was\ngaining no new knowledge of magic, but only of himself.\nHow the tower’s Tyrean makers (if this wasn’t older than even their\nempire) had understood vice and virtue was different than what the\nChromeria taught. He’d learned, and as the Highest Luxiat, even taught the\nseven virtues as being the four worldly virtues (prudence, courage, justice,\ntemperance) and the three heavenly ones (charity, hope, and faith).\nBelievers were to meditate on these virtues, and how they might embody\nthem better, as they made the sign of the four and the three touching hand,\nheart, and lips. If you counted hands as a collective singular, you would\ncount them as number three, whereas if you counted each hand in turn\nseparately, they would count as three and four—thus symbolizing a\nparadox, and the connection of all the virtues (or all the vices) to one\nanother.\nHere, though ultimately the lists basically covered the same territory as\nthe Chromeria’s, the tower’s builders had divided up the pilgrimage into\nSeven Contrary Virtues: Patience against Wrath, Abstinence against\nGluttony, Liberality against Greed, Diligence against Sloth, Chastity against\nLust, Kindness against Envy, and Humility against Pride.\nGavin hadn’t thought that Lust was going to be a difficult circle for him.\nAfter all, he’d been (unwillingly) chaste for quite a while now. Sure, he was\nas virile as the next two guys, but he hadn’t been promiscuous—especially\nfor a Prism with all the opportunities he’d had! But the memories he’d"

But the memories he’d\ntriggered at every step had focused not on numbers of women he’d taken to\nhis bed but mostly on how he’d treated Marissia, not only in bed but out of\nit.\nHe’d prided himself on treating Marissia very, very well for a room\nslave. That she hadn’t been a slave at all but was only masquerading as one\nwas, if anything, a reason for him to be angry with her.\nThe tower hadn’t let him off so easily. It hadn’t cared whether she was\nslave or free. It triggered his own memories of how he’d treated her. They\nweren’t flattering.\nMarissia had been, in Gavin’s careless estimation, supposed to feel only\ngratitude or desire toward him. That was pretty much the entire range of\nemotions he’d expected from her, and it was all he’d allowed her to express.\nHe’d seen undeniably over the years that the true range was far, far\ngreater. He’d seen her despair, he’d seen her love for him, and her self-\nloathing at times, seemingly because she did love him—but he’d written\nthem all off, as if they, and she, weren’t worthy of his attention.\nIt must have been torture for her. Gavin would treat her well, showering\nher with compliments, thanking her for how well she was running his\nhousehold and managing the servants and slaves. Some days he would ask\nher opinion on matters of all kinds, confide in her, give her gifts, and take\nher to his bed and make sure she reached her pleasure rather than merely\ntake his own. Other days he would demand she serve him sexually at a\nmoment’s notice, pretending instant arousal and total desire—though her\ndryness betrayed the pretense, he’d ignored it or blamed her for it—then\nhe’d banished her from the room as if she were no more than a rag to mop\nup his semen.\nThat’s what room slaves are for, he’d told his protesting conscience.

Or she’d loved him so much that she stayed,\ndespite it all.\nOr, his conscience asked, had the abuse so worn her down that she\ncontented herself with taking the emotional scraps that fell from his table,\nand slowly come to believe it was all she deserved?\nHow long can everyone around you tell you that you’re a slave, how\nlong can every mirror show you to be a slave, and you not believe you\nreally are one?\nHe had destroyed a great woman.

But if\nthis journey was supposed to be purgative, Gavin didn’t see how. Purgatives\nare supposed to make you puke but then feel better.\nGavin didn’t feel better, nor any more humble, kind, or chaste, only\nmore aware of how much he wasn’t those things.\nRubbing the eye patch deeper into his eye, oily pain canceling out sharp\npain for a brief moment, he stood up and walked to the edge overlooking\nthe sea.\n“What the—? Gunner’s gone!” Gavin said.\nSlowly, troubled, Orholam said, “Yeah.”\nGunner had been drinking out there.\nHe must have gotten drunk and fallen off. There was no way he would\nhave abandoned his big gun to the waters, no way he would have tried to\nswim when there were still so, so many sharks gathered from leagues\naround to feed on all the bodies floating in the lagoon.\nWhen sober, Gunner was a master of timing. If he’d decided he was\ngoing to have to abandon the gun and swim, he would have waited until\neverything calmed in the lagoon. A few days, at the least, while the sharks\nsated their hunger devouring all the bloating dead.\n“You told him he was going to live,” Gavin said, snarling.\n“I know,” Orholam said apologetically.\nGod damn. And Gavin had been starting to believe that Orholam wasn’t\na holy-talking charlatan, that—wherever it came from—he really did see\nthe future sometimes, and the past.\nBrushing past the old man, Gavin snarled, “What circle’s next?”\n“Wrath.”\n“Perfect.”\nChapter 63\n“How many fights do we have left in us?” Kip asked Cruxer. It seemed like\na good time to ask; Tisis was on the other side of their little fleet, checking\non her reserve scouts, and she didn’t like him dwelling on the death\nawaiting them.\nThe early-morning embarkation had been somber. Now they were\ncrossing the Cerulean Sea at the maximally efficient skimmer speed: slow\ncompared to what the craft were capable of, but preserving the lives of their\ndrafters while still getting them to the Chromeria in two days.\nEvery one of the thousand drafters, two hundred Cwn y Wawr will-\ncasters and war dogs, and one thousand elite soldiers knew they were\nheading for a fight for their own lives, for the future of the empire, and even\nfor the future worship of Orholam Himself. Would the Seven Satrapies even\nexist, or would there be instead nine kingdoms with a high king? Would\nthere be ten gods in this world, or One?\n“Mentally we’re tough,” Cruxer said under the sound of the rushing\nwind. The sea was placid, the sun orange on the horizon, and the sky\ncrystalline blue. It was one of those pristine summer mornings that made\nyou feel that Orholam was full of joy when He created the world.\n“Emotionally, we all feel like we can fight forever.”\nThat wasn’t what Kip had meant, and they both knew it.

He glanced\nback at the phalanxes of skimmers and sea chariots behind them. With\ndrafters of various colors of luxin paired at the reeds of the different ships,\ntheir colors mixing as they jetted it into the water, the thousands of the\nForest’s best were painting Ceres’s skin like artists each wielding a different\ntone, human colors rising in answer to the divine in the skies.\n“Two or three hard skirmishes, maybe. One protracted battle. After that,\nwe’ll start losing significant numbers to luxin burnout. Too many of them\nhave been making up for their lack of skill by drafting ever greater\nquantities. We might even lose a few on the passage.”\n“And the Mighty?” Kip asked, throat tightening. He already had his own\nguesses, of course. But he was trying to be dispassionate. A full year of\nraiding and the Battle at Dúnbheo had meant many fights to the death—and\nwhen your life is in peril today, why be careful with how much you draft so\nyou can live another year fifteen years from now?\n“The nunks are fine, of course,” Cruxer said. “Ferkudi isn’t too bad with\nblue, but his green is to the halos. Winsen will live forever. His yellow is\nbarely halfway through his irises. Tisis is fine with her green. I’ve got four\nor five battles left in me. Ben-hadad is fine with yellow, but whenever he’s\nnear a fight, he tries too hard to compensate for his bad leg. His green and\nblue both are full. It’s Big Leo who’ll probably go first. He’s straining his\nhalos in both red and sub-red.”\n“We’re insane for letting Ben-hadad even get close to a battle,” Kip said.\n“He’s great in a fight, but ultimately, he’s just another drafter. But outside a\nfight, doing what he does? The man’s a marvel. A once-in-a-generation\ngenius. He’s the one of us who could change the world the most.”\nCruxer looked at him, shadows of Ironfist in his gaze. “You’ve pretty\nmuch summed up my thoughts exactly—”\n“Glad we’re agreed—”\n“About you.”\n“Oh.”\nCruxer shrugged. “Granted, you’re a bit better in a fight. Maybe. Having\ntwo good legs and all.” But the hint of a smile crept onto his face. He\ncouldn’t deadpan quite like Ironfist, not yet.\n“Trouble is,” Kip said, eyes staring at the morning’s beauty but no\nlonger seeing it, “a man isn’t just the one thing he does best. Even if he’s\nthe best at that one thing that the world has ever seen.”\nCruxer turned his palms up. “I haven’t tried to keep you from fights,\nhave I?”\n“No,” Kip admitted, coming back to focus.\n“But lay off green. You go golem one more time, and you may break the\nhalo yourself.”\n“Yeah. I’ve got other options.”\n“I know you do. Use them. It’s always green with you.”"

It’s always green with you.”\n“Yes, mother,” Kip said. But they both knew Cruxer was right.\nThe Mighty didn’t want to fight on the seas, but Ben had refused to let\nthem go unarmed, in case a fight was necessary—maybe the White King\nhad discovered how to make skimmers by now. Also, they’d heard wild\nrumors about will-cast sharks and other beasts. (Kip’s Night Mares didn’t\nthink it could be done, though. Or not for long. Or not without them also\nattacking one’s own people. Or… )\nSo the Nightbringers had muskets, a few swivel guns, and a pile of the\nsticky bombs they called hullwreckers now. The skimmers wouldn’t be\ndefenseless, but they wouldn’t go looking for a slugfest with a galleon,\neither—a single cannonball strike anywhere would cause a catastrophic\nfailure of the luxin. Ben-hadad said he already had plans to address that in\nthe next generation of skimmers—if he lived so long.\nHe said it as if he’d started saying the sentence aloud intending to wink\nor grin, but changed his mind halfway through, like there was so much he\nwould never discover in this life if he died, and that death felt more real\nnow than it had in more than a year filled with fighting.\nCruxer had one of General Derwyn’s drafters taking point a hundred\npaces out in front of them. A nautical equivalent of outriders protected him\non either flank, but the main body traveled in cohorts of twenty craft each,\nwith everything from two- to six-person craft.\nKip was trying to be patient, though he wanted to get to the Chromeria\ntoday—and could have, moving with only the Mighty. Moving even a small\narmy at speed was an impressive feat of logistical acumen and leadership.\nMoving that army over water made it a feat wherein if you loused up,\npeople drowned.\nKip supposed that he should be trying to enjoy the little remaining life\nhe had. It was pretty much impossible to get any work done. Despite the\nwind blocker, he had to lean close to Cruxer to have a conversation, and it\nwas just Cruxer, Kip, and two young drafters with fresh halos on reeds. Kip\nhad tried talking to them, but that had put a panicked expression in their\neyes. They couldn’t concentrate on two things at once.\nFunny he thought of them as kids. One of them had to be nearly his own\nage.\n“Lord Commander!” one of them said, laboring to speak and still keep\nin time with her partner. “Scout returning!”\nNo sooner had she said the words than Kip saw the scout streaking\ntoward them on a type of craft they’d come to call a flying pulpit. The\nscouts’ special skimmers were made to be as light and fast as possible, so\nthey’d dispensed with nearly everything: it consisted of a single chair\nmounted between two propulsion reeds with wings extending from the sides\nbeneath the water.

Each scout-drafter (all were small men with excellent\nupper-body strength) was strapped to his chair and carried a long-lens to see\neven farther. The craft were ludicrously fast, but they had to be launched at\nspeed and couldn’t stop moving or they’d sink.\nThe tenth scout was Izemrasen, who was approaching now. Forty years\nold, he was a ghotra-wearing Parian who’d been training to be a Blackguard\nwhen he fell during a wall climb and broke his back. His legs had turned\nuseless and numb. A couple of unnoticed sores on them had gotten infected,\nand they’d had to be amputated. He’d lived through the operation, but his\nChromeria sponsor had abandoned him (illegally), despite his strength as a\ngreen drafter.\nIzemrasen hadn’t had the coin or connections to bring the matter before\na magistrate, and he ended up performing on the streets for food, doing\nacrobatics for coins. How he’d even made the trek through Blood Forest in\nthe hopes that Kip’s army would have some place for him, Kip didn’t know,\nbut the man was bursting with life and purpose now. Kip had never seen\nanyone more proud to don the uniform.\nThe scout turned in behind Kip’s skimmer and docked in a slot made\nespecially for it. Kip and Cruxer attached the hooks that bound the small\nskimmer to their larger one while he took a few deep breaths. Izemrasen’s\nmassive shoulders shone with sweat—he’d come back at the greatest\npossible speed.\n“Two fleets, my lord,” Izemrasen said. “Closing for battle, as far as I can\ntell. Definitely the Blood Robes on one side and the Chromeria on the other.\nMaybe a hundred fifty galleons on the Blood Robe side, but a lot of those\nseem to be trade ships with only a few cannons each. Chromeria’s only got\nfifty-three galleons, but they’re well-armed. They’re flying banners of all\nseven satrapies.”\n“How far from here?” Cruxer asked.\n“Three leagues? Four? I could be off.”\nKip couldn’t blame him. Distances were tricky at sea at the best of\ntimes, even with special tools. The scouts had trained to measure distances\nby their own speed over time, which they were supposed to keep constant—\nbut Izemrasen had come back as quickly as possible.\n“And how far from each other?”\n“A bit more than a league? I’d guess the fight will start within half an\nhour, an hour? I don’t really—I don’t know anything about naval battles,\nmy lords. My apologies. I’m still learning my work.”\n“As are we all,” Kip said.\n“There was something strange, though,” Izemrasen said. “I mean, I don’t\nknow anything about naval warfare firsthand, but I have seen tapestries and\npaintings and such, and…” He tugged his ghotra forward from where the\nwind had pushed it back despite the hairpins. “The Chromeria’s ships were\nout in big wings left and right, with multiple ranks and such—like the\npaintings. But the left wing was leading, a lot. Too much, it seemed to me."

Too much, it seemed to me.\nUnless there’s some strategy…?”\n“That’s…” Kip said. “Who’s on the left wing?”\nIzemrasen said, “Uh… they were too far away for me to pick out their\nbanners for sure, but given the style of ships and the colors, Ruthgar—\nand…” He scrunched his eyes closed, trying to remember. “A snake below\nit?”\n“Coiled or striking?”\n“Striking.”\nKip turned. “Commander, please tell me that moron Caul Azmith isn’t in\ncharge of Ruthgar’s fleet.”\nCruxer shrugged. “Last we heard he’d been demoted because of his\ndisastrous leadership at Ox Ford.” Azmith had been commander of the\narmies—but his family was rich and powerful. Kip knew how those\nfamilies worked now: he bet they’d bought his way onto a small command\nwith the fleet, where they thought he couldn’t do any harm.\n“Orholam’s balls. He broke ranks,” Kip said. “He’s charging, hoping to\nreclaim his lost glory.”\n“May Orholam save those men from their leader,” Cruxer said, brow\ndarkening, making the sign of the three and the four.\n“But that wasn’t all,” Izemrasen said. “The White King’s ships were all\nhuddled together, real tight, almost in a ball. Not at all like any tapestry I’ve\nseen. I mean, I know artists exaggerate and try to make things look pretty,\nbut isn’t being encircled as bad in naval battles as it is in land ones?”\nMessengers on small skimmers had pulled in beside Kip’s craft, waiting\nfor orders to relay.\n“No bane visible?” Kip asked.\n“No, sir. Didn’t even feel anything, and I was paying attention like you\nsaid to.”\n“Ah, shit,” Kip said. “They’re doing the same damned thing they did at\nRu!” Sinking a bane so the drafters don’t feel it, raising it at the last\nmoment—except this time it wasn’t one color; it was all of them. “What\nkind of idiot falls into the same trap they’ve used on us before?!”\n“Caul Azmith,” Cruxer said with quiet fury.\n“We have to warn them,” Kip said.\n“We’re all drafters,” Cruxer said.\n“But we’re the only ones who can get to them in time.”\n“We can’t go.”\nKip looked at him. “They’ll all die if we don’t.”\n“Breaker, when a man who can’t swim jumps into the sea to save a\ndrowning friend, you end up with two dead men, not zero.”\nKip turned to the messengers. “I’ve new orders. Redistribute the supply\nships. Take the empties to circle behind the White King’s fleet after the\nbattle and pick up survivors from the waves. Don’t come in too fast or too\nclose or they’ll be sunk, too, but save as many as they can. I don’t think the\nWhite King will double back. Izemrasen, you go get rest. You’re gonna be"

You two on the reeds, go with the messengers. Commander\nCruxer and I have it from here.”\nThe young drafters stepped off the still-moving skimmer onto\nmessengers’ vessels. To another messenger, Kip said, “Tell our fleet to\ncontinue on. We’ll catch up by nightfall.”\nCruxer snorted.\n“Or, you know, not at all,” Kip said.\n“Tisis is going to be pissed,” Cruxer said. She was off checking on\nsomething on the other side of the fleet.\n“Yep.”\n“Because this is a bad idea,” Cruxer said.\n“I know,” Kip said.\nCruxer made the sign of the seven again and then took a reed. “You\nknow, Blackguard training has very specific rules about keeping one’s ward\nfrom putting himself in mortal peril unnecessarily.” He looked at Kip’s\nopen, expectant face, and sighed. “So I guess it’s a good thing we quit\nbefore we got to that part.”\nChapter 64\nTurning people into meat sacks was the easy part. The problem was\ndisposing of the bodies. For all that Teia now knew dozens of ways to kill,\nshe wasn’t superhuman. Even in her blacks, holding a spear, and soaking\nwet, she weighed less than two sevs. She’d done tens of thousands of push-\nups and curl ups. She’d run thousands of leagues. She’d swum until her\nshoulders were small blocks of granite. She’d lifted salt bags until veins\nbulged from her forearms even at rest, and she’d run relays with the\nBlackguard trainees until she could run down a gazelle on the open plains.\nShe could climb and jump and balance and fight and shoot a bow and\nfire a musket and draft—dear Orholam, at the insistence of her Archer\nsisters, she could even dance tolerably well now—but when it came to\nlifting a corpse that was more than double her weight, she was hopeless.\nThe good news was that she wouldn’t need to drag Aglaia’s body far.\nIn quick glances, Teia watched the noblewoman have her cosmetics\napplied by a severe old slave woman who was, despite her age and her own\nplain features, obviously an artist. It was evening, but Aglaia had come\nfresh-faced from a steam bath at an unmarked private club in the Embassies\nDistrict. The old slave applied delicate layers of powders and creams with a\nsure and speedy hand. Teia used the time to scout the estate again.\nIt was a meeting night for the Order of the Broken Eye. That meant\nAglaia had taken dinner in her room, as she apparently always did on the\nnights when she attended the Order’s meetings, and she’d ‘dismissed’ the\nslaves except for this handmaid.\nOf course, what a woman like Aglaia thought dismissing the slaves\nmeant and what it really meant were very different. She would be angry if\nshe came home and her dishes and food weren’t cleared from her room and\nher bed wasn’t turned down, a warming plate put between the sheets to\nprepare them for her."

As if she were giving her slaves a\nbreak rather than complicating their lives. For them, the dismissal meant,\n‘Get all the usual work done without me seeing you, and pretend not to see\nme leave, and never ask about where I’m going or where I’ve been, and\nthere will be extra laundry in the morning.’\nAt long last, the slave finished her duties. As far as Teia could tell, the\nslave woman had done magic of a sort Gavin Guile himself would envy.\nOld Horse Face actually looked attractive, though Teia had no idea why\nAglaia was putting on cosmetics. The woman would be donning a cloak and\nmask, which were required to stay on for the rest of the night.\nWell, she thought so, anyway.\nAglaia looked at herself in her mirrors. She seemed dissatisfied with\nwhat she saw—for all the wrong reasons, Teia thought. But after a few\nexasperated sighs, Aglaia dismissed the slave woman.\nTeia waited with the patience of a coiled serpent.\nThe door closed and Aglaia moved to a closet. She pulled a hat box off\nthe highest shelf she could reach. She carried the box to a bed but didn’t\nopen it.\nTeia crept forward invisibly on her rubber-sap-soled shoes, moving\nbehind her prey.\nAglaia turned so abruptly, she almost collided with Teia.\nTeia shrank bank, eyes downcast.\nAglaia moved forward quickly, but then stopped just as Teia was\npreparing to lash out with paryl.\nAglaia sat, grabbed a hair tie, and scowling at her reflection, rapidly\nbound up her long blonde hair into a sensible bun.\nThis was the moment Teia had been waiting for. She touched her chest\nwhere the vial of olive oil had once rested: it had been Aglaia’s threat of\nsending her to be a brothel slave at the mines.\nThe blade came free of its leather sheath noiselessly.\n“You are not afraid, Aglaia Indomita Crassos!” Aglaia told her\nreflection. “You think of Marcus. You think of what the Guiles did to him,\nand you make them pay.”\nIt should have stirred something in Teia. Some human emotion. If not an\nemotion, a question at least. Paryl was supposed to make you more\nsusceptible to feeling, but even handling paryl didn’t do more than make\nTeia aware of the spot that was numb, like tapping frostbitten fingers\nagainst a stranger’s flesh. There was pressure registering farther up your\nfingers, and you could see the touch. You remembered what feeling was\nlike, but that spot had been pushed so far past pain it wasn’t capable of\nanything at all.\nBut this was no time for thoughts or second thoughts.\nThis isn’t payback. I am merely predator, you are merely prey. No\ntorture. No final words.\nTeia squeezed the nerves in each of Aglaia’s shoulders and watched her\narms fall unfeeling to her sides.

As the woman looked down, wondering\nwhy her arms had dropped, Teia grabbed that sensible bun with one hand\nand rammed the dagger into the back of Aglaia’s neck. With paryl\nilluminating the gap between skull and spine, Teia’s blade slid in as easily\nas if Aglaia had lubed herself up for the unwanted penetration with olive\noil, and penetrated to the hilt.\nAglaia’s body went limp instantly, but Teia held her in place by her hair,\nthat beautiful blonde hair that provided such a nice grip, and guided her\nback into her seat.\nTeia wrenched the blade back and forth to ensure she’d fully severed the\nspine, then left it in Aglaia’s neck as she grabbed a rag from a pocket.\nShe barely got the rag in place around the blade to blot up the blood\nbefore it leaked onto the fine chair’s back.\nTeia rolled Aglaia out of the chair and onto the bare floor, facedown,\ndagger up.\nThen Teia left her prey and locked the door.\nWhen she came back, she waited a few more heartbeats, and then used\nparyl to feel for life. You could punch a hole in a man’s heart and he might\nyet move as you made a full count to ten. The body could be stubborn. It\nwas faster with the spine, but it never hurt to be sure.\nAglaia Crassos was dead. Easy.\nA bit of blood and spinal fluid seeped out around the dagger’s blade and\ninto the rag, but with the wound elevated and the heart stopped, there was\nno more bleeding than that. Teia had picked a short dagger deliberately so it\nwouldn’t pierce all the way through the woman’s neck. By design, but also\nby luck, she’d severed the spine without also slicing the big arteries in the\nneck.\nThe dead woman had pissed herself, but only a little, and her petticoats\nhad held most of it. A few dribbles had escaped onto the wood floor and\nnone onto the upholstered seat of the chair. Excellent.\nLest it get stained, Teia removed the master cloak and got to work. She\nuntied the two bags she’d tied tight around her waist. The first held half a\nsev of rocks. The second was larger and made of waxed canvas.\nUnhurried, Teia laid out that bag next to Aglaia’s body and opened it.\nThen, carefully, she put the body onto the bag: lifting and moving feet, then\nknees, then hips, shoulders, and arms, keeping the dead woman’s face down\nand wound up always. She slowly stuffed the body inside the bag, buttoning\nthe buttons as she was able.\nThen she left off buttoning the bag and cleaned the floor fastidiously.\nLast, she slid the dagger out of Aglaia’s spine and cleaned the blade, and\ntucked the rag into the bag as well.\nFrom here it got dicey.\nShe tested dragging the body, being carefully to keep the wound\nelevated.\nEasy… on stone.

Teia’s disposal site was a latrine at the end of a long\nhallway—a long hallway with one of those runner carpets that’s easier to\nkick out of the way than to keep in place. And Teia was going to be\ndragging a body down that. Dammit.\nThere was no way she could add the weight of all those rocks and do\nthat.\nThat meant she was going to have to drag the body down the hall, then\ncome back, get the rocks, take them down the hall, open the bag, put the\nrocks in, then lever the body somehow into the latrine.\nIf she were caught, would she kill the servant who saw her? How about\na slave?\nYes, she thought. She’d already decided that. Why did she keep\nrevisiting the choice? In this war, if innocents had to die, innocents had to\ndie.\nMore innocents, she thought, seeing the faces again.\nShe pulled Aglaia’s body out into the hall, rolling it until she got to the\nedge of the damned carpet runner. No blood seeped out, though on this\npatterned red carpet it wouldn’t have been disastrous.\nHugging the corpse against herself to be able to pull it down the hall\nwithout leaking blood was somehow less repulsive to Teia than it would\nhave been to hug Aglaia in life. This was simply meat. The vile part of it\nhad departed, her spirit had been a putrescence worse than the merely\nphysical odors of urine and decay.\nTeia made it to the latrines. No problems. There was no blood. It was all\nclean. Professional.\nTeia jogged back and grabbed her rocks. Made it back, put the rocks into\nthe waxed bag with the body, and closed it again. The latrine opening\nwasn’t overly wide, but mercifully Lady Crassos had been a big believer in\ngirdles and the bag was cinched tight.\n“One last thing, Lady,” Teia said. She drew the short dagger again and\nstabbed it low in the corpse’s stomach to pierce the intestines. She almost\ngagged at the gases it released as she withdrew the knife, but those were\nsmells not out of place in a latrine.\nShe pierced the bag in several other places. The stones at Aglaia’s feet\nwould pull those lowest, so Teia made the holes near her head.\nThen she began stuffing the body down the latrine. Bit by bit, each grunt\nand heave a labor pang, Teia squeezed Aglaia’s body through the death\ncanal and out of this life.\nShit you were, my lady, and to shit you return.\nBut the body only dropped a few feet. With a muffled clang, the rocks\ninside hit metal. Teia froze for a moment, then remembered. This mansion’s\nindoor latrines had a metal plate below that swung open to drop waste and\nthen swung closed again to keep the odors below from being blown\nconstantly back up into the house.\nTeia found the handle, and with effort because of the weight of the body\non the plate, was able to slide it aside.\nLady Aglaia plopped like an especially large turd into the effluvia below.\nTeia slid the plate closed, went invisible, and waited in the hall."

Here, Teia\nhad already scouted the mansion for disposal areas, going as far as directing\nparyl gas between the walls and eventually down the latrines. Here there\nwas a holding area for the sewage—a septic pit?—Teia hadn’t known\nanything about sewage.\nBut with what she’d learned from Quentin, she’d made her bag. Enough\nmurdered bodies washed ashore every week on the Jaspers that Teia knew\nthey bloated with gases and floated to the surface, white ghastly things. So\nshe needed the rocks to keep Aglaia’s body down. She’d pierced the\nstomach to allow the release of accumulating gases and pierced the bag to\nmake sure it didn’t inflate and buoy the body to the surface.\nTheir hope—they hadn’t done this before—was that the body would\ndecay naturally in the sewage but that the bag would slow the rate of decay.\nThey didn’t want the body to bob to the surface, where it had a chance of\nbeing seen. They also didn’t want it to decay so quickly that anyone using\nthe latrine would smell death.\nInstead—they hoped—the air that blew through the sewage ducting\nwould have a chance to take the smell of decay a little bit at a time.\nTeia almost left before she remembered the hat box. As she slipped back\ninto Lady Aglaia’s chambers, she saw a slave on her way back up the steps\nto clean out the room.\nTeia grabbed the hat box with its Order mask and robes and walked to\nthe closet.\nDamn. Me.\nAglaia had gotten the box down from the highest shelf she could reach.\nUnfortunately, Aglaia had been significantly taller than Teia was. The shelf\nwas too high for Teia.\nTeia hopped and tried to shove the box into its spot.\nNot even close to high enough.\nOh, for Orholam’s sake, a stupid hat box!\nBut any wrong detail could give her away—even stupid ones. She had to\nbe a ghost, and ghosts don’t leave evidence. She looked at the door. She had\nonly one shot at this.\nIf she missed, it was going to be a disaster. This closet was a mess. Hat\nboxes were piled upon each other in huge piles. Even putting one on top of\nthe pile with too much force might make the whole collection collapse.\nTeia backed up and took a running leap and stabbed the costume box\ntoward its spot with a little toss at the end.\nShe landed on her toes, in the closet, a hair’s breadth away from\ncolliding with the entire stack. She tipped forward. She couldn’t see\nanything to balance herself against that wouldn’t knock down everything.\nBut just as the door slid open, she regained her balance and threw the\nmaster cloak closed about her. But she stepped on the hem of the cloak as\nshe stepped backward and fell—\nGracefully. She spun, taking the fall on her hip and tucking her knees so\nthe cloak spun around her, covering them."

She saw Aglaia’s half-full tray of food.\nShe sat and ate with gusto. She didn’t even look around. She hadn’t\nnoticed anything amiss.\nTeia took a few deep breaths to steady herself and regain her grip of\nparyl. She’d come this close to losing it. And that would have meant\nanother dead innocent, another body to dispose of.\nWhile the girl was distracted, Teia stood. Then she got her first look at\nthe hat box. She had left the closet door open, of course, and the hat box\nwas perched at the top of its tower. Precariously.\nThe air billowing gently into the room from the open door was enough\nto set the whole stack swaying.\nIf Teia jumped and missed, it would all come down—and having just\njumped, her cloak would be swirling around chaotically at the very moment\nthe servant girl looked toward the sound.\nThere was nothing Teia could do but pray she didn’t have to kill this\npimply sixteen-year-old kitchen girl.\nSo she did nothing. The girl finished eating in no time and stood. She\nglanced toward the closet and walked over.\nOh, Orholam dammit, what had she seen?\nBut the girl just walked to the closet, stood on tiptoe and pushed the hat\nbox back into place, and closed the closet. Then she grabbed the tray and\nleft without a look back.\nTeia breathed easily for the first time in many minutes.\nShe left quietly: out onto the balcony, a quick climb down to the street,\nand she was on her way to the Order’s meeting to find the priest. It wasn’t\nuntil she was halfway there that she realized that with this kill, she didn’t\nfeel damned, she didn’t feel disgusted, she didn’t feel satisfied. She hadn’t\nfelt anything at all.\nChapter 65\n“Can someone explain to me again why we drafters are charging toward an\nenemy that can paralyze drafters?” Winsen deadpanned. “I’m so confused.\nWe are all drafters, right?”\n“We’ll get there before they raise the bane,” Kip said.\nOf course he and Cruxer hadn’t gone alone. The Mighty had all come.\n‘Oh, so if I’m going to be in egregious danger, we all are?’ Kip had asked.\n‘We didn’t make it that far in the training,’ Cruxer had said.\nActually, not all of the Mighty had come. Though the new one, Einin,\nhad joined them, Tisis hadn’t. She’d been on a skimmer farther away,\nalready formulating plans for Big Jasper with her own command. Kip\nhadn’t waited to consult with her, much less asked her to come—but time\nwas of the essence, and she was no good in this kind of fight.\nNot that that was why she’d be furious.\nNow the Mighty sped across the waves together. Their skimmers were\nable to interlock together, and with all of them working the reeds, they\nmoved as fast as Izemrasen had.\n“And you’re so sure of that why?” Winsen asked."

It destroyed the most ships possible with one stroke, but\nhe’d have been better served if he’d waited until most of the ships were past\nthe trap. He would have sunk fewer in the first strike, but he’d have trapped\neveryone else in the bay where he could kill them at his leisure.”\n“So what’s that mean for us now?” Cruxer asked.\n“It means he’ll hold off until the last moment to spring his trap.”\n“Isn’t the last moment sort of… now?” Winsen asked.\nKip turned on him. “What do you want, Winsen? You want to let all our\nfriends die? I didn’t get the scout’s report until I got it. You want to live\nforever? Get out. I’m sick and tired of wondering if I can count on you.”\n“Bugger off,” Winsen said. “You’re the boss. Fine. Some accident of\nbirth put you one notch above the rest of us. Fine. It’s one notch, not twenty.\nYou’re the boss. I’ll follow you. That’s what we do. I’ll follow you to my\ndeath today, or some other day if we get lucky, but don’t expect me to enjoy\nit or kiss your ass on the way.”\n“Your bitching hurts morale,” Kip said. “It weakens us.”\nThe craft slowed perceptibly as Winsen stopped drafting, irate. “I\nweaken us?! Me?”\n“You can be a whiny little shit sometimes,” Ben-hadad said.\nWinsen looked around to the others, and seemed baffled at their\nagreement.\nBig Leo said, “This one time after I shit myself as we were escaping the\nChromeria, I was cleaning my trousers and the stain… I was like, what!\nWinsen, what are you doing in my pants?”\nWinsen’s rage evaporated as they all laughed. “Dammit, Big Leo.”\n“Wait, you shit yourself in battle, too?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Just the once,” Big Leo said defensively. “It was my first fight!” Then\nhe side-eyed Ferk. “Too?”\nEveryone looked at Ferkudi.\n“It was just a little pellet!” Ferkudi protested.\nThey laughed, and the blowing wind took their strife for the moment.\nKip looked over at Winsen, who met his gaze.\n“I’m in,” Winsen said. “I’ll try, all right? I just don’t want…” He wanted\nto say more, but he stopped himself.\nIt brought their present circumstances back into focus, though, even\nwithout him saying it. The Mighty looked at one another. That look was\nworse than scoffing. It was resignation.\n“Good day for it,” Ben-hadad said, looking at the beautiful blue sky.\n“Good day for what?” Ferkudi asked.\nKip sighed. “He means it’s a good day to die. Thank you very much,\nBen.”\n“I never understood why people say that,” Ferkudi said. “I don’t really"

So isn’t every day a bad day to die? Ben-hadad, why did\nyou say that?”\n“Ferk,” Cruxer said. “Ferk.”\n“It’s one of the things for the Box, isn’t it?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Yes. Yes it is.”\nFor Ferkudi, the Box of Things That Don’t Make Sense But Make Sense\nto Other People Don’t Worry About It It’s Not Important was filled with\nmany things: why people go back to lovers who treat them badly, why\npeople like cats (pretty much the same thing), metaphors involving cutting\ncheese, why one would eat intestine, why women don’t spend all their time\nlooking at themselves naked, why the number system was based on ten but\nthe time system wasn’t, why it’s normal for dogs to lick their balls in public\nbut Blackguards aren’t even allowed to clear their underwear from cleaving\nthe moon, and why he got that question so often about being dropped on his\nhead. As long as he had Cruxer’s assurance that it wasn’t important for him\nto figure out, he was perfectly content to put things in that box and put it\naway in a dark mental corner.\n“Anyone feel it yet?” Kip asked.\nHead shakes all around.\n“How stupid is Caul Azmith?” Winsen said. “It’s the same trap as last\ntime. How can one man lose two fleets to the same trap?”\nIt was a good question. Not that the man wasn’t dumb enough to do\nexactly that, but surely someone would have said something.\nBut it was finally obvious to Kip, unbelievable as the answer seemed.\nHe said, “We killed a bane at Ru. They think that means it’s gone forever.\nThey don’t believe us that the White King has any other bane at all. They\nmust have gotten word that a lightly defended fleet was coming, and they\nrushed out to sink it. Not a bad strategy.”\n“If we were lying to them,” Einin muttered.\n“Why would they think we were lying to them?!” Ben-hadad demanded.\n“They knew we were in a bad spot. We were asking for men and money.\nIn the same kind of situation, Dúnbheo lied to us to get our help, why\nwouldn’t we do the same?” Kip said.\nThey shared curses.\n“What’s the battle plan?” Big Leo asked.\n“That depends on… Are those sails?” Kip said.\n“There it is,” Cruxer said.\nIt was exactly as Izemrasen had described, except now the two fleets had\nalmost closed within cannon range. The White King’s ships were bundled in\na knot so tight it was impossible to see how many of them there were from\nKip’s vantage, but the Chromeria fleet was enveloping them with rank upon\nrank of ships.\nThe front ranks broke apart, every other ship slowly, slowly turning\nbroadside.

Then flashes of light blinked across the waves, followed by\nbillows of black smoke floating up toward their sails—curiously silent from\nthis far away. Those ships had turned forward again, as ahead of them those\nships that had kept going now took their chance to turn broadside.\nIt was only then that the sound of the first cannons arrived, a distant\nthunder from that slow storm now covering most of the horizon.\nNo fire was returned from the White King’s ships, and Kip couldn’t see\nany result from the shelling, though scores must have died in the moments\nhe’d been watching.\nAfter the speed and chaos and dexterity required for ground combat, this\nnaval positioning seemed graceless, ponderous. Give a man a sword and tell\nhim to chase down another man, and the contest was decided within\nminutes; one ship chasing another could easily last all day.\nAnd yet that apparent gracelessness was deceiving, Kip knew. There was\na reason why famous admirals were famous. When you had to turn a ship\nweighing tens of thousands of sevens with only wind, and waves, and\nmuscle, and had to judge exactly the rates at which your enemies could do\nthe same, so that you could arrive at some future position where you could\nrelease a broadside at them before they could release one at you, it required\na special brilliance to be successful. Add in needing to adjust any of your\nfigures due to your slaves’ exhaustion, injuries to crew, the weight of your\nship and of your opponent’s, timing to reload, then with possible damage to\nsails, rigging, oars, decks, or rudder, and you had to be brilliant to maneuver\na single ship. Commanding a fleet must require another order of thinking\naltogether—especially when also having to deal with the egos of your\nsubcommanders, like the idiot Caul Azmith, who’d broken ranks.\nThe single maneuver of interspersed fire, correctly executed, told Kip\nthat whoever was admiral of the Chromeria’s fleet now, he or she was\nprobably a genius.\nA genius who was about to suffer a crushing defeat.\n“Too late to get the Chromeria to pull back,” Kip said. “So we’re\nlooking for the White King’s superviolet drafters, maybe in separate small\nboats. It seems the superviolets have to do something to trigger the bane to\nrise—so if we can kill them before they do that, we’ve got a chance.”\n“I don’t see any boats out alone,” Cruxer said.\n“Winsen, you’ve got the best eyes,” Kip said.\n“Nothing. None alone,” the young man said.\n“If they’re trying to get encircled,” Cruxer said, “and they have more\nthan one bane, then maybe they’re planning to raise all the bane, all around\nthem at once.”\nKip caught where he was going. The bane would rise in a giant ring,\nmatching the encircling Chromeria fleet—and destroying all of it\nsimultaneously. “So the superviolets who are raising the bane have to be in\nthe middle of the formation. The command skimmer’s too big to penetrate\nbetween those ships. We’ll have to split. Ben, I know you said you were"

I see the core ideas already here. This\nhoneycomb structure here? You told me once in some other application that\nthat’s super strong.”\nBen-hadad expelled a breath. “Last resort, understand? And no more\nthan maybe half speed, at most. Slower for you and Big Leo. Even with the\nwind shield reinforced to be a wave shield, either the water will sweep you\noff or it’ll disintegrate if you go too fast. But this generation was never\nmeant—”\nAs he was speaking, an enormous cloud of ravens burst from the White\nKing’s fleet. But there was nothing random or independent about their\nflight.\n“Razor wings,” Einin said.\nWinsen cursed aloud. The birds were will-cast to seek out rigging or\ncrewmen and slice through them.\nOne of them exploded in midair.\n“And they’ve figured out how to rig them to be bombs,” Winsen said.\n“Bomb wings. Great.”\n“They can’t carry much explosive,” Kip said. “What are they doing?\nBen?”\n“They used pigeons before. But pigeons probably aren’t smart enough to\nbe taught to seek out the powder kegs,” he said. “These are ravens. I’d\nguess they’ve will-cast them to seek out the gun decks.”\nDamn. A single crazed raven flapping and cawing and threatening to\nexplode at any moment could delay an entire gun deck from firing, and that\nwas if it didn’t make it to the barrels of black powder.\n“What else have they will-cast?” Ferkudi said. “Are those shark fins?”\nBen-hadad looked over at Cruxer. “Commander,” he said. “You’ve got\nto stop us. This is suicide.”\nBut Cruxer had his eyes closed. And when he opened them, a smile\ncurled his lips and light lit his eyes. “Shh,” he said, and his voice was a\nwhisper under the storm. “Don’t you feel it?”\n“Feel what?”\n“The wind behind us is greater than the wind against us.”\nBen-hadad looked back and forth at the rest of them, their faces eager\nand fierce. The rattle of swivel guns and muskets and the taunting shouts of\nboth sides rolled across the waves, and only seemed to inflame the Mighty\nfurther. “Why am I the only one bothered by that being demonstrably\nfucking false?!”\nKip gave a few more instructions: where they should meet afterward,\nwhat their sign would be that they had to retreat, and a quick check that\nthey all had their flares and hullwreckers.\n“Ready to separate on your mark,” Big Leo said to Kip.\nKip knew he should be afraid. Or he should be worried that he was\nleading his friends to their deaths.\nThey might die.

He, uh, wouldn’t give his name.”\nGrinwoody was off doing Orholam knew what again. As the slave aged,\nhe was absent more and more often, and he always pretended it was on\nsome business for Andross and not that he was lazy and due for\nreplacement. But in his defense, Grinwoody would never let this happen.\nAndross peered at his vice chamberlain. “Do I look like a village\nmagistrate whom strangers may approach at will on the green?”\n“No, High Excellency.”\n“Then what do you mean he wouldn’t give his name?”\n“He was very convincing, milord,” one of the Blackguards at the door\nsaid, seeming intent to rescue the poor man. A new girl, Mina.\nAndross sneered at her. “And this is why they used to only elevate\nBlackguards who could make it through the night without wetting the bed.”\nShe withered.\nBut neither moved.\n“He was very compelling, my lord, and he gave proofs enough to satisfy\nat each station,” the other Blackguard, Presser, said.\nAndross barked, “Not at this one. I’m busy. And you, Presser, you’re old\nenough to shave by now, aren’t you? You should know better. And keep\nyour pup in line or I’ll kick her down to a scrub.”\n“My lord, many pardons,” the vice chamberlain said. “He said if you put\nhim off, to remind you of what a young woman said of you, forty years ago\nnow, ‘A man of Parnassian storms and no wonder, for in you is joined a\nvolcanic wit…’”\nIt was a crash of thunder heard when the sky is blue.\n“What? He said no more?” Andross demanded.\n“I asked. He knew no more of it, dangling as it is.”\nIt took Andross so long he felt embarrassed. His memory—No! It had\nnot failed him. Not yet. He was not so old. The scroll of years was merely\nso long, so densely packed with incident, and not filed in a library year by\nyear.

No. Not exactly\nimpossible. And it was impossible that it could have been sent by anyone\nelse.\n“Bring him in.”\nAndross had entertained a hope that he might recognize the old man. He\ndidn’t. Dark skin faded by the years, clothing fine and well maintained but\nshowing wear. Thus, middling nobility or a rich merchant dressing a bit\nabove his station. There were probably a dozen of the former sort that\nAndross could call to mind, and several hundred of the latter that he hadn’t\nbothered to memorize.\n“High Excellency,” the man said after the longest possible pause and\nwith the bare minimum tilt of his head.\nA lordling, then. A merchant wouldn’t dare so little respect.\n“Do you know how the rest of that sentence goes?” Andross asked.\n“No.”\nThe old man added no honorific. Very odd. There was something\nfamiliar about those eyes, as blue as the morning sky, but Andross was\ncertain he’d never met the man before. Perhaps he’d known a relation?\nThat didn’t limit the circle much. Andross met thousands of people each\nyear. One of the things that had most pained him about his long\nconfinement had been not meeting people, not seeing others overawed at his\npresence, or having occasion to prove that their awe was justified.\nIt niggled more than a little that this old man seemed… what was it? Not\nexactly hostile. Disgusted, maybe.\nContemptuous?\nOho, now, that tempted Andross toward violence.\nThe old man shook his head. “Disappointing. Here I’ve forgiven you a\nthousand times for all the ruin you brought to my house. No, ten thousand.\nEvery day three times with my prayers for every one of these long years, at\nleast when I could bear it. And yet still my heart longs to hate you.”\n“Excuse me?” Andross asked. Blankly curious.\n“I was told not to tell you my name, and that how long it took for you to\nguess it would tell us both something.”\nOh please. “How tiresome,” Andross said. “Do you have something for\nme, or not? You asked to see me, after all.”\n“No, I didn’t ask for this at all. I was sent to see you. You are to finish\nthe quote. She insisted you could.” He clearly had his doubts."

Better to get this over with, he supposed. “Ninharissi\ncalled me ‘A man of Parnassian storms and no wonder, for in you are joined\na volcanic wit and glacial emotions. When they mix, it is a cataclysm of fire\nand rain and lightning and molten rock, flames and floods, lava flows and\nmudslides, laying waste to everything and everyone in a thousand\nleagues.’”\nHis memory hadn’t abandoned him after all. Who else could recall such,\nso perfectly?\n“She adjudged you well,” the old man said. “No wonder she wanted\nnothing to do with you.”\nIt was a misstep. “Was Ninharissi your lady, then?” Andross asked.\n“No. But I see why the Third Eye gave me those words to say. They\nwere for both of us.”\nOf course. Now it made sense.\nThe message wasn’t from Ninharissi herself, but merely from a Seer\nwho had stolen them from the ether. A little magical eavesdropper, spying\non a couple’s intimate moments. Disgusting.\nAndross had hoped the message was some word from beyond the grave,\na treasure a dead woman had wished delivered to him while he was in these\nstraits.\nIt was all very disappointing, but it made sense. Of course, only the\nThird Eye could see where she had never been, and into the past as well as\ninto the future. She was an ally more dangerous than even Janus Borig, but\ncouldn’t be taken from the game, for she would be a foe far more dangerous\nstill.\nThus, Andross had made no move against her, but he was glad she’d\nchosen to stay far away.\n“How is Polyhymnia?” he asked. He wasn’t supposed to know that\nname. No one was. But swive her for pretending to speak for one he loved.\n“Has she some guidance for the war?” He felt some hope. After all,\nOrholam’s Seers might choose not to join sides in any normal war, but in a\nwar against heretics and pagans? Surely this visit meant she was answering\nAndross’s letters at last.\n“I don’t know who that is,” the old man said, “but the Third Eye told me\nshe’d be dead by the time I reached you. Murdered by the Order of the\nBroken Eye. She said anything she did to stop her assassination would only\nforestall it, wouldn’t affect the course of the war, and would have other\ncosts too great for her to countenance.”\n“Worthless to me, then. Figures. You know, I’ve met dozens of prophets\nand Seers through the years. Charlatans and half-wits, most of them. But at\nleast those could be used against the kind of people who believe them. Yet\nthe real ones were never any use at all.”\nThe near-blasphemy spurred no anger from the old Parian. He only\nstared at Andross calmly.\n“What are you here for, old man?” Andross asked.\nThe old man smiled, finally. “I overestimated you. I thought surely you"

And I’ve come, Andross Guile, to upend all\nyou know and break your glacial heart.”\nChapter 67\nAs the first cannons began firing at them, the command skimmer broke\napart.\nBut the enemy had no Gunner directing their fire. The shots—twenty of\nthem at least—all sailed wide, short, or long. Few of them were even close.\nStill, there was the familiar jolt of excitement at being shot at with no\neffect. That bracing, ‘Holy shit! I’m alive and I could have been dead and\nsomeone just wanted me dead and did all they could to make me dead, but\nI’m alive, hell yeah, you bastards!’\nThe Mighty were near enough the wall of galleys and galleons under the\nflying flags of broken chains on a black background that the roar of the guns\nwas nearly simultaneous with the gushers of the smoke and the splash of the\ncannonballs, jetting water into the air.\nKip’s eyes were dragged below the line of the cannons, though, in front\nof the ripples that spread around each as the shock waves left their imprint\non the waters beside the ships.\nIn a unison not possible for wild animals, dozens—no, hundreds—of\nsharks rose, dorsal fins in ranks, heading straight for the Mighty.\nA primal fear struck him then, thalassophobia, a dread that man was not\nmade for the depths, that the water was not his home, that this vast sea was\nitself hostile to him, hateful. If the foils of his skimmer hit a shark, Kip\nmight kill the shark, but the collision would certainly pitch him into the\nwater.\nHe would be helpless. Torn apart by those alien, unforgiving teeth."

Torn apart by those alien, unforgiving teeth.\nThe skimmer shivering as a musket ball ricocheted off the deck broke\nKip’s brief paralysis. He aimed it down lower into the waves. The increased\ndrag slowed him considerably.\nThen, as he closed in on the sharks, he aimed skyward.\nHe shot into the air, and felt a jarring bump from beneath propelling him\neven higher.\nIt turned him off axis, but Ben-hadad—Orholam bless him for being\nsuch a damned genius—had built the skimmers well. The foils weren’t\nedged but round, so when Kip hit the waves again, there was little danger of\ncatching an edge and flipping over. Instead, Kip skipped over the waves a\ncouple of times, then the foils dug into the waves and he was off again.\nDirectly toward dozens more sharks.\nBut before any of them could attack, on some unseen cue, the majority\nof them turned away and dove.\nKip had no time to figure out why they’d turned away, or what that dark\nimmensity was far beneath the waves.\nHe also had lost track of what was happening with any of the rest of the\nMighty. He could only keep himself alive now, and that took everything in\nhim.\nHe was within forty paces of the first ships now, and though the teams\nwere still reloading cannons and swivel guns, men on the galleons’ decks\nwere firing muskets toward him.\nSplashes pocked the water as he juked one way and then the next.\nAt the last moment before he crashed into a galleon’s hull, Kip veered\nhis skimmer hard sideways and accelerated as quickly as he could.\nThe Mighty’s lack of training as a squad on the skimmers nearly got him\nkilled. He veered directly into Winsen’s path, surprising the young man as\nmuch as the musketeers on the galley’s deck.\nWinsen popped his skimmer up into the air, and Kip ducked, taking a\nfaceful of water even as he blasted luxin skyward. Winsen’s skimmer was\nflung high into the air, and by the time Kip was able to clear his eyes, he\nheard a splash on the other side of the galleon.\nThen he saw the stern of the next ship, looming directly before him, and\nhe cut hard to port and inside the first circle of ships.\nKip glanced back just in time to see Big Leo follow his path, but this\ntime a red wight was ready for him. The young woman with burn-scarred\nskin oozing pyrejelly set herself aflame and leapt through the air into Big\nLeo’s path.\nHis immense chain swung in a quick arc and batted her aside as if she\nwere an overexcited puppy jumping toward her master with muddy paws.\nShe plunged into the waves, hissing and sizzling, and he swung that flaming\nchain once more above his head to regain his balance, slapped it into the\nwaves to extinguish the last red luxin-fed flames, and came after Kip as\nthey darted inside the outer circle of ships.\nThe second circle was entirely slave-rowed galleys without sails, their"

Whether hit themselves or just\ncowering before this terror, the warriors went down like sheaves of grain as\na scythe passed across the deck. They folded in blood and screams.\nTaking advantage of the chaos Cruxer was creating, Einin angled in to\nthe ship and slapped a hullwrecker down near the waterline, then zipped\naway.\nWinsen fought like a madman on a spring. He bounced his skimmer up\nto the height of a deck, loosed two arrows while he was in the air, put his\nhands back on the reeds, and bounced again as if the sea were made of\nboiled rubber. He killed the captain, the first mate at the wheel, he killed a\nbo’s’n, he killed every officer and fighting man who looked important—and\nthen he turned back around and kept killing until someone panicked and\nshouted the order to fire a broadside.\nThe young archer heard the order, though, and instead of popping back\nup from the waves, angled his skimmer downward and stayed underwater.\nThe broadside of twenty cannons boomed with a fury—raking death\nacross the decks of its allied galleon in the outer circle.\nWinsen popped up out of the waves, water sluicing off the skimmer as\nhe barely held on, blinded and cursing, and no longer holding his favorite\nbow—but alive. Three sailors, muskets now reloaded, ran to the rail and\naimed down at the temporarily immobilized young man.\nKip threw blue spikes as hard as he could from his awkward angle far\nbeyond the ship himself. The first wasn’t even close. The second shattered\nagainst the railing under the sailors’ hands, barely a miss. The third flew\nlow but passed underneath the railing and blasted the nearest sailor’s legs\nout from under him.\nBetween the blue shrapnel exploding in their faces and their crewmate\ngoing down, the two unharmed sailors panicked. One froze. The other\nstepped backward, tripped, and accidentally discharged his musket into the\nair.\nSeeing Winsen regain his balance and his velocity, Kip cut under the\nbeakhead of the next ship and in.\nThe directed explosion of the hullwrecker snapped out behind them, and\nKip saw a billow of smoke and showers of wood from the ship behind\nthem.\nAt the Battle of Ru, the Blood Robes had used a single rowboat filled\nwith superviolet drafters to raise the bane.\nKip had expected the same here, but perhaps with nine rowboats.\nThere were no rowboats.\nThis was a fucking dragon-ship.\nA dozen galleys had been lashed together, the disparate parts melded\ninto a whole with wood and burnt red luxin.

Cut in the brutal style of early\npagan art, this floating castle had the look of something crafted by a master\nartist equipped only with an ax. Brushed white pine skin yielded to spikes\ncarved from ivory tusks. The open maw, equipped with great spouts for\nshooting out burning red luxin, showed lips of burnt red luxin, like\nblackened, cracked skin. It had claws and eyes of atasifusta wood, ever-\nburning.\nIn a carven saddle, high on the dragon’s back and raised high above the\nwaves, was a black throne. Empty.\nBut that didn’t mean the rest of the dragon-ship was empty. Like fire\nants rushing up your trouser leg when you stepped full into their anthill, the\nBlood Robes on it were in a violent panic, frothing forth onto every surface\nKip could see.\nAnd all of them—red-robed though they were—were drafters or wights.\nThere were hundreds.\nBut that wasn’t what frightened Kip.\nBehind the immense throne was a tower of chains and gears. Six great\ncrank wheels were being turned by a dozen slaves each, and six taut chains\nwith links as large as a man raised pulleys at their apex at the foot of the\nthrone itself.\nA great deal of chain had already accumulated around each of those\ncrank wheels, and as Kip took a moment, he could feel a burgeoning\ntension in every color—like he’d felt in green before the Battle of Ru.\nThe bane were rising in a circle around the dragon-ship. All of them.\nThe Mighty were too late.\nKip’s heart jumped, but then he felt something immense nearby. He\nblinked furiously and felt as if between blinks something happened to his\neyes—had he been hit?\nHe glanced down, but in chi’s spectrum, and his gaze saw something\nbeyond his ken, a single slice of ocean down to the depths, being crossed by\na monstrous shape.\nA flutter of the eyes, as if clearing blood away. Blink. Nothing. Blink.\nAnother slice, half a degree departed. A curve of pectoral fin. Blink. Gone.\nA fluke. Gone.\nA whale?\nShe was turning, deep under the waves, even as dozens of sharks bit at\nher flanks and flukes.\nIt broke Kip out of his paralysis.\nHe hurled the retreat signal flares skyward for the Mighty and banked\nsharply away himself.\nAn explosion shook the distant waters out where the Mighty had\npenetrated the first ring of ships. Ah, Ben-hadad had put a hullwrecker on\nanother of the galleons.\nBut the inner ring that they had just penetrated had closed tight behind\nthe Mighty.\nGunports were rattling open on this side of the ships as the cannon crews\nslowly reacted to the threat that was the Mighty. Had the Mighty proceeded\nto attack the center island dragon, the cannons wouldn’t have been able to\nfire without endangering their own. But now the Mighty were turning back\ninto range of safe and accurate fire.\nA second explosion rocked the seas, this time on another of the ships in"

But now the Mighty were turning back\ninto range of safe and accurate fire.\nA second explosion rocked the seas, this time on another of the ships in\nthe inner circle, even as they sped toward it. Though the ship immediately\nsagged in the water, and all the cannon crews had been killed or stunned on\nthat one ship, it did nothing to the others, who started opening up.\nNor was that ship going to sink in time. The bane was rising behind\nthem, and if Kip and the Mighty didn’t make it several leagues away within\nthe next few minutes, they would all be paralyzed.\nThrowing another signal flare, Kip sliced out a wide, fast circle, and\neach of the rest of the Mighty slotted in seamlessly, re-forming the\ncommand ship one at a time.\n“Bane rising!” Kip gasped out as they finally locked in all together. He\nthrew over the steering to Cruxer as he peered into the sea.\n“Can’t dive together!” Ben-hadad said. “Too much drag.”\nCruxer steered their circle in close to the ship that they’d hit with the\nhullwrecker, hoping that the other ships would be reticent to fire up on their\nown comrades.\nAs they came out of that second circle, though, Winsen shouted a curse.\nHe pointed back in toward the great dragon-ship. “Breaker!”\nKip ignored him.\n“Breaker! Kip! For Orholam’s sake, man—”\nKip glanced up, trying to narrow his eyes so that he wouldn’t be blinded.\nHe caught only a terror of skimmers streaming toward them—the White\nKing had skimmers now?—no, they were sea chariots pulled by some kind\nof sea animals. Sharks? And sharks untethered and great swarms of razor\nwings clouding the sky.\nBut Kip said nothing. He jumped toward the rudder and cut so hard that\nall of them were nearly thrown off their feet and into the water.\nBefore they could even cry out in protest, the water exploded beside\nthem in a flash of dark skin and immense presence as the black whale\nbreached fully into the air, sharks snapping behind it, some of them\nlaunching into the air as well.\nIt was only the vast discipline ingrained in the Blackguard that kept\nthem on their reeds, kept them moving. Razor wings hit the waves all\naround them, some exploding, some trying to slash their bodies.\nThe black whale came down on the stern of the ship Ben-hadad had\nbombed. Waves and flotsam exploded from the dying ship, a cacophony of\nscreams and water and small explosions from the razor wings and dying\nmen and animals.\nKip slewed the command skimmer back and forth as he nearly lost his\nfeet, not so much in evasive moves as merely trying to regain his own\nbalance, but when he came out of the tight arc, there seemed to be a gap—a\ntrough of clear water.\nHe aimed the skimmer down into the trough and then up the other side.\nThe skimmer bottomed out in the trough, sliced into the following wave,\nthen shot into the air, over crushed hull and lumber and dying men.\nThey didn’t clear it completely, but the garbage they landed on yielded\nto the skimmer’s foils and weight and speed."

Then it dove before it reached the second circle of\nships.\nIt didn’t matter. The outer circle was looser, and the first ship one of\nthem had bombed was half sunk. Kip and the Mighty shot out into the open\nsea and safety.\nHe shot flares into the open sky—a retreat, in an old Chromeria code.\nThe Chromeria’s fleet didn’t heed it. Not that he could see.\nThere was nothing he could do.\nThey had tried. But that didn’t make him feel like any less a coward as\nthey fled.\n“There were hundreds of drafters on that dragon-ship,” Cruxer said.\n“We’re good. Maybe we’re each worth ten of them, but…”\n“Not a hundred of them, each, not at once,” Winsen said.\n“I’ve shit myself before,” Big Leo said. “But I’ve never run away.”\n“You didn’t run away,” Ferkudi said. “None of us did. I mean, except\nBreaker. He was steering. He gave the orders. So I guess he ran away, but\nthe rest of us—”\n“Ferk. Shut it,” Cruxer said.\n“They’re gonna die back there, aren’t they?” Ferkudi asked. “All those\nChromeria drafters and sailors and soldiers. I mean, is there any possible\nway they might—”\n“Ferk!” Cruxer said.\nThey skimmed in silence, and Kip wondered if at last he was the\nBreaker in truth. He had broken the Mighty’s streak of victories; he had\nbroken their foundational myth that they were invincible. In so doing had he\nbroken the Mighty itself?\nThey were no longer heroes of lore, legends in the making, indomitable,\nunstoppable, unflappable, brave and just and right and true and forever.\nMaybe they’d always just been boys who’d had some lucky fights.\nSeveral minutes later, when the Mighty were so distant Kip didn’t think\nthey would know the outcome of this battle one way or the other, a sound\nlike the earth shaking reached them, and mist exploded into the distant\nskies.\nBig Leo said, “I feel like I just got in a fight with my big brother and he\ngrabbed my fists and started hitting me in the face with them, chanting,\n‘Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself.’”\nThen a tugging sickness hit all of them, and even this far away they lost\nhalf their speed all at once. It was the call of a master to his slaves, certain\nof obedience.\nThe bane had surfaced.\nKip couldn’t see it, couldn’t feel it, couldn’t witness it—and yet he knew\nthat hundreds upon hundreds of their allies had just perished. Maybe their\nfriends had been on those ships. He hadn’t stopped the White King. He\nhadn’t saved his friends.\nHe’d failed, and he couldn’t think of any way that he could do anything\nbut fail again when the bane reached the Jaspers.\nChapter 68\n“I’m coming to the end of things, Quentin, I can feel it,” Teia said."

He never forgot to be\ncircumspect, even here in his own room. His room, it turned out, even had a\nsecret exit into a seldom-used hallway. There were, Teia’d found, several\nold, dusty, and baggy cloaks of various colors and qualities hanging near\nthe exit. Some White long ago had used this room probably not only for\nassignations but also as a staging area to go out incognito, probably to meet\nspies.\n“No,” she said. “I mean, sort of. With them, but not only with them. I\nfeel like—I think maybe Orholam’s letting me know that I’m going to die.”\n“It has been known to happen,” he said, contemplative. “If so it’s either\na mercy, to tell one to repent, or it’s a grace, to allow one to take care of\nunfinished business. Do you feel you have unfinished business?”\nShe shrugged. Funny that he didn’t think she needed to repent. “I mean,\ntaking down the bad guys and finding my father, but not really like\nspiritually or whatnot.”\nShe wasn’t sure if that was true, but Quentin was a luxiat, and\nsometimes he went full-on luxiat on her. It was all right. She was glad he\nhad something that worked for him, and he wasn’t obnoxious about it.\nHe didn’t say anything else. He was getting good at waiting silently.\nHe’d joked once that the wisest luxiat is a silent luxiat. Finally, he said, “No\none touches you, do they?”\nIt was heading toward night, and the sunset through the windows gave\nthe wood in this chamber a ruddy glow. She’d always liked the light in\nQuentin’s room. In this orangey, warm chamber, with his many books and\nthe simple, well-burnished beauty of his hardwood shelves (and, perhaps,\nQuentin’s company), there was no loneliness, only solitude.\n“Hadn’t thought about it,” she said.\n“I avoided touch for the longest time,” he said. “I told myself I was just\nthat way. Naturally averse to touch. It wasn’t that. It was shame. It was\nworse after I murdered Lucia, of course, but I’d had it even before then. I’m\ntrying to unlearn some things, Adrasteia, things that stand in the way of my\nmission. No one touches the destitute, the broken poor. It’s been part of my\nwork now to give them that connection, as valuable as the food and clothes\nI give them, I think. Of course, you minister to the body first, then the heart,\nand last, if you can, the soul. I think in this I’ve served you very poorly.\nBecause you have enough to eat and are dressed well, and because you ask\nme smart questions, I’ve somehow missed your poverty.”\n“‘Poverty’? Ha. I’ve seen poverty. This ain’t that.” She motioned around\nherself vaguely: as if to say, ‘Look at this room, these good clothes, all the\nprivileges of my new station, the very nice meal a slave brought to\nQuentin’s chamber only minutes ago.’"

You endure a poverty of heart. But\npoverty’s lie to you is the same. Poverty tells you that you don’t matter.”\nTeia felt suddenly naked. “Well, shit, Quentin.”\n“It wasn’t a condemnation of you. The opposite, in fact.”\n“I do so think I matter,” she said, but even she could hear the\ndefensiveness in her voice. She wouldn’t sound defensive if he were simply\nmistaken, would she?\n“Adrasteia, you think that what you do matters. The mission matters.\nBut outside of your mission, you believe you have no importance. That’s a\nlie. A lie that’s made you very good, very focused. Now the thing that you\nbelieved gave you your only significance is drawing to a close, so you’re\nterrified. Of course you are. It’s understandable, but it’s not a premonition\nof death.”\n“I could die at any moment,” she said. Sharp was hunting her, even now.\n“That’s true, but it’s true of us all,” he said.\n“A little more true for me,” she said.\n“A point I’ll concede,” he said. “Though if Sharp catches you, they’ll\nkill me, too.”\n“They what?” She’d never even thought of it.\n“They’ll kill anyone you spent much time with, trying to find your\nhandler.”\n“How did I not think of that?” She felt a sudden nausea, but it was too\nlate now. Even if she cut off all contact with Quentin today, they’d kill him\nregardless. She’d been seen with him and the Mighty before. It was how the\nOrder worked. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I swear I’ll do my best not to let that\nhappen.”\n“You’d do your best regardless, and I’ll die when Orholam allows it, and\nno sooner. I’m glad to aid you, and honored to call you friend.”\n“Friend?” she asked.\n“Is it such a high bar to clear?” he asked.\n“No, it’s not that. I suppose… I mean, you have been a friend to me, far\nbetter than I deserve.”\n“Oh, I disagree,” he said.\n“And I’ve been no friend to you,” Teia said. “Our entire relationship is\nbased on me taking.”\nHe shrugged. “I don’t see it that way.”\n“I didn’t tell you what happened,” she said. “With Aglaia.”\nAh. Maybe she did have unfinished business.\n“I took the lack of an answer as an answer.”\nSo he thought she’d succumbed, that she’d tortured that evil bitch. “I\ndidn’t torture her. I didn’t even speak to her.”\n“Did you kill her hard or easy?”\n“Quick. I’m not sure there is easy. But it was instant. It was your words\nthat inspired me, if you must know.

Tell\nme that I deserve a friend.”\nA lump rose in her throat and she swallowed hard on it.\nThe compassion in his eyes didn’t even waver. He shook his head. “I’m\na murderer, Adrasteia. I killed an innocent! You expect me to reject you\nbecause you killed a bad woman too eagerly?”\nTeia furrowed her brow. “Hadn’t really thought of it that way.”\n“Even my hypocrisy knows some bounds,” he said with a grin.\n“Besides,” he said, “it doesn’t work. Some people think they can force\nOrholam’s hand. You know, like they can enjoy their sins for their whole\nlife, then make a deathbed confession. That kind of thing. As if the Giver of\nJustice, the creator of the very concept, could be so easily fooled or\nmanipulated. Do you think that you could, by plucking Aglaia out of time at\nthis moment or that, really change her soul’s destination? Do you think\nyou’re so powerful? Really? That matter is between her and Orholam. You\nhave many powers, but that’s not one of them! Granted, trying to send\nsomeone to hell is a serious matter. But you’re not her judge. Being her\nexecutioner is quite enough weight for you to bear.”\n“You make it sound as if it all makes sense,” Teia said. “As if it all\nworks out.”\n“It does.”\n“All evidence to the contrary?”\n“I never said we get to see it all work out.”\n“Then maybe it’s time for us to finish that other discussion,” Teia said.\n“Because I think I have an answer,” Teia said. “You said when we approach\nthe big questions, we need to know if we’re approaching them rationally or\nemotionally. But the truth is we always approach them emotionally. There’s\nalways one answer we want. Though which answer that is varies from\nperson to person.”\n“You’re certain you’re ready to talk about evil now?”\n“Seems like before I do my best to kill people might be better for it than\nafterward.”\nHe answered that with silence, and she actually took the time to think\nabout it. Ready, really? She was and she wasn’t. And her heart needed the\nwords now, like a thirsty tongue needs water, even if it be a trickle licked\noff a stone and not a full glass.\n“Ready enough to hear. Maybe not to accept,” she admitted."

I’m a smart man, but often not a wise one, which can make for\nan impoverished theology or at least a poor application of it. But here’s the\nbest I’ve got. Why is there evil if Orholam loves us and has the power to\nstop it? My answer is that we are the apprentice painters, working under the\nmaster’s watchful eye. He is a good master, and He has sworn not to make\nour work meaningless. Every smudge and every blot and every unsteady\nline we draw will remain. The master will soften a line or turn the darkest\ngraffiti to chiaroscuro, but never will He take the palette knife to gouge out\nan imperfect piece of the work, for if He erased the imperfections made by\nour hands, where would He stop erasing? Everything we paint we paint\nimperfectly.”\n“Then the whole scheme is shit. He should paint it all Himself, were He\nnot too lazy,” Teia said. She wasn’t doing a good job of listening, though,\nand she knew it.\nQuentin flashed a quick, apologetic grin. “Sure, sure, if we are to call\nlazy the one who created the Ur, the Primes, and all the Thousand Worlds—\nnot a heretical notion, by the by, despite what certain scholars… never\nmind. If we’re to call lazy He who spread the stars with His cloak and\nblows the winds between them, who forms every beating heart and\nmountain and lake upon them, and is creating yet every life and love and\nevery chick within each egg, bursting out into the light… if we’re to do\nthat, then I’m not sure the word ‘lazy’ has a stable definition. But certainly,\nwe could conceive of Orholam as being so vast, so omnipotent, so\nintelligent that He could direct every moment of every man’s and every\nwoman’s and every child’s and every dog’s day. He could do so, and the\npicture created thus would be flawless, and every head in the cosmos would\nnod as one that it was flawless, for they could not do otherwise than nod in\nunison. For in their perfection, they must recognize His perfection. They\nmust bow and bob at His every command. They wouldn’t need commands,\nfor they would be but extensions of His fingers. Such creatures would be\ncapable of everything except freedom, and therefore, everything except\nlove. And for some reason, Orholam values love—not just of Him but our\nlove toward others, toward even ourselves. The master takes joy when the\napprentice grows in her mastery, when she sees the line for herself the first\ntime, when her hand can finally paint what her heart conceives, and when\nshe partakes of the beauty for the first time and the five hundredth.”\n“Murdered slaves and dead babies part of that beauty?” Teia asked\nbitterly.\nQuentin folded his hands. “Part of the beauty?

A wag asks from the secret bitterness of his heart, ‘So then, is this\nthe best of all possible worlds?’ If Orholam is watching, and Orholam is\nacting, is this the best He can do? Because the best He can do appears to be\nshit.”\nTeia was still a bit surprised to hear Quentin use such language.\nQuentin grinned, glad to have shocked her. “What? He made shit, too.”\nShe grinned momentarily, but the ache didn’t abate.\nQuentin said, “There was a master who loved his slave, so he freed him\nimmediately. Another master loved his slave, so he wrote into his will that\nthe slave should be freed after he himself died. Which of these loved his\nslave?”\n“The one who freed him.”\n“I agree!” Quentin said, “But the master who kept his slave would object\nthat what he did was for the slave’s own good: a free life is a dangerous\none, the free man might end up destitute! The master would guarantee a\ngood life for him, meaningful work, and protection—until he passed away\nand could guarantee it no longer.”\n“He’s lying,” Teia said. “Though maybe to himself first. It’s none of the\nmaster’s business what happens to that slave.”\n“But so long as the slave belongs to him, it literally is his business,”\nQuentin said.\nTeia blinked. “Well, sure, financially, but… but the master can’t call it\nlove, then. He’s just making sure no one destroys his investment, the way a\nfree man might destroy himself. The first master is assuming the financial\nloss in giving the slave his freedom. He’s not investing in property; he’s\ninvesting in a man. And not for his own enrichment but for the former\nslave’s.”\n“What happens,” Quentin asked, “if that freedman recognizes his\nmaster’s love and continues working in his house, though now as a free\nman?”\n“Everybody wins, I guess?” Teia said. “The master knows his former\nslave cares about him, and the former slave gets a fair wage and dignity and\nthe ability to leave if things change.”\n“But the same work gets done?”\n“I daresay that more work gets done in the good master’s house. Slaves\nhave ways of letting their will be felt.”\n“And yet you ask that Orholam be the kind of master who keeps His\nslaves as slaves forever and calls it love.”\nQuentin smiled, and she felt like she’d fallen into the kindliest trap ever.\nDespite Quentin’s gentle demeanor, Teia felt like she’d been slapped.\n“What? No.” Teia shook her head. “Look, I hear you. But that doesn’t\nclose the gap for me. Sure, blame war on men. There’s evil in my own\nheart. I fight it all the time. But… floods and cancer and famines? Why\nwould there have to be those for us to have freedom? Why would that be\nthe consequence of our evil choices? I don’t get it. If Orholam made the\nwhole system, He should have made it… I dunno. Better.”\nQuentin said, “There are those who claim that as men’s rejection of"

        "text": "whole system, He should have made it… I dunno. Better.”\nQuentin said, “There are those who claim that as men’s rejection of\nOrholam’s will for us has corrupted our very nature, so, too, those elohim\nwho rebelled have corrupted the natural world. But I don’t know.\nPersonally, I think the proper response to those who’ve suffered a tragedy is\nnot to teach them but to grieve with them. I’ve asked many times, and\nangrily, would it have upset some vast eternal plan if my father hadn’t had a\nseizure and drowned while bathing me in the river when I was four years\nold? Why did our dog Red pull me out but not go back that time for my\nfather, whom he’d saved from his fits before?”\nAnd suddenly, Quentin was too overcome with emotion to speak.\nIt seemed to surprise him even more than it did her.\n“I’m sorry,” he said, clearing his throat. “I haven’t told that story.”\nTeia got the idea that he meant ever, that he’d never told that story to\nanyone.\nHe dashed tears from his eyes and tried to smile to smooth it over. “I\nguess I can choose to be angry at that dog, or angry at Orholam for that day,\nor at Orholam for my father having the falling sickness in the first place. Or\nI can be grateful that He made dogs to love us and that Red saved my father\nfrom the fire and the waves four times before that day so that I might even\nbe born, and I can be grateful that that beautiful animal saved me that day.\n“In the face of life’s black mysteries, answers feel barren. All I know is\nthat I can only choose my attitude. The mysteries aren’t thereby untangled,\nbut when I choose gratitude, I see life flower. When I paint as if my art has\nmeaning, not just for today but also for eternity, it doesn’t make the aches\ngo away, but I’ve come to trust that my master will use my pain for a\npurpose.”\nShe saw the beauty in that way of seeing things. But it looked so far\naway from her vantage. She said, “You’ve got a lot of faith.” But then,\nthat’s why you’re a luxiat, she thought.\n“No. I had a profoundly diseased set of beliefs—so diseased they led me\nto murdering a girl—and now I have a pretty finely attuned sense for what\ndiseased beliefs look like. And the truth is, you don’t need finely attuned\nsenses to see them. You can judge a faith by the fruit it bears. When you see\nsomeone bitter with the world, ask yourself what they believe.”\n“And does that apply to me?” she asked. She was going for irony, but\nshe was afraid her own words were pure bitterness.\nHe didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.\n“Adrasteia, I believe you walk attended by the servants of the Most\nHoly. This is His work, His war, and He will not abandon you in your need.\nWhen you choose to do the task for which the maker made you, when you\nknow yourself free, but you come back to the master’s house to work\nanyway, you can excel in ways that others could never imagine. And you\nare excelling, even if you don’t see it.”"

And you\nare excelling, even if you don’t see it.”\n“I guess me excelling means nobody sees me, right? Especially the\nimmortals. Well, at least the one.”\nShe’d told Quentin about her dream about Abaddon. He’d blanched with\nfear but hadn’t been very helpful in giving her anything solid about the\ncreature. Too many contradictory claims in the texts, he said, many of them\nprobably planted by the evil one himself.\n“Be strong and of good courage, Adrasteia. We live in a world of\nearthquakes and landslides and floods, but we live in a world of\neucatastrophes, too.”\n“I don’t know what that even means.”\n“It means whether brought on by men or malevolent spirits, we live in a\nworld where hell invades earth from time to time, with devastating\nconsequences, far worse than anything we could imagine. But… but—\nalmost always, so far as I can tell, at the hand of men and women of\ngoodwill—sometimes heaven invades earth, too.”\n“You’re a man of faith after all,” she said.\n“Maybe I am,” he said, but sadly, for she saw his recognition that she\nwas using the title to push him away.\n“I feel so alone, Quentin.”\n“I wish I could be a better bridge for you,” he said.\n“These men I’ve been sent to k—”\n“Those men are fools.”\n“What? They’re the most capable spies I could even imagine. They’ve\nthrived in the shadow of the Chromeria itself.”\n“Fools.”\n“Have you not listened to my reports?” she asked.\n“Cunning, perhaps, but fools. When we think the darkness hides our\ndeeds from the Lord of Light, we are children who clap our hands over our\neyes and shout that we’re invisible. You are seen, Teia. Even in your cloak.\nYou are known.” He grinned, and it was scary to see the fierceness of\njudgment on his kind face as his voice lowered. “And, in the end, so are\nthey.”\nShe almost shivered, but she couldn’t let it go. “Quentin, I need to tell\nyou what I’m doing and where I’m going.”\n“No, you don’t. Just in case I’m caught. I’m not terribly brave, and I’d\nsoon fold under torture. You’ve said you’re coming to the end. I believe\nyou. I feel it, too. Adrasteia, you serve not just Karris, not just the\nChromeria, but the Lord of Light Himself. You will know what must be\ndone, and you will have the unique strength to do it.”\nShe reached to her neck by old instinct. The vial was gone, long gone. “I\nhope you’re right,” she said. She grabbed one of Quentin’s sheets of\nparchment and scribbled a quick note. “Take this to Karris.”\n“You know you shouldn’t trust anything about them to writing.”\n“It’s not about the Order,” she said. “It’s about you.”\n“What?”\n“I don’t know that we’ll see each other again, Quentin. Ever. Karris"

Might as well get two requests for the price of one, eh?”\nHe snorted, but the sorrow didn’t leave his eyes.\n“Fare thee well, Quentin. You’ve been a most excellent friend to me.”\nHe lifted a hand before she turned away.\n“Adrasteia, before you go… may I hug you?”\nShe hesitated. His overture spooled out like a coil of rope over a chasm,\nthin as spidersilk, but also perhaps as strong. “I think… I think I would like\nthat.”\nIt wasn’t magic. A hug didn’t fix everything. Perhaps it didn’t fix\nanything at all. But it did feel good.\nReally, really good.\nShe might have cried then, finally. Maybe just a little.\nChapter 69\nKip had approached docking his armada at the Chromeria as if it were a\nmilitary assault. His little army was his pry bar, and a pry bar is good for\nnothing if you can’t wedge it into place.\nSo he hid most of his ships beyond the horizon, low and mastless as they\nwere, and came in with Ben-hadad, Cruxer, and Tisis on skimmers, all of\nthem dressed in blacks nearly identical to Blackguard garb.\nThe docks had been transformed in the time the Mighty had been gone:\nexpanded to deal with the crush of refugees and the ships necessary to\nsupply them from all over the satrapies, but also with additional\nfortifications. There were towers, more ballistae, and the walls themselves\nwere taller and likely thicker, too.\nThey did all seem to be staffed by Andross Guile’s Lightguard, though,\nmaking Kip almost hope some small violence was necessary.\nHe and the first wave broke up, seeking out the harbormaster and her\napprentices and besieging them by any means necessary: Cruxer charming\nthe woman with his good looks, Ben-hadad faking a medical emergency,\nKip with a thousand questions, and Tisis distracting half a dozen\njourneymen herself with charm and cleavage, having changed into her finest\nsilks and a giant hat that blocked the view of the men and women\ndisembarking behind her. Meanwhile, other skimmers docked in a steady\ndrip, drip, drip.\nA few of the men who’d left Daragh the Coward to join Kip had been\nthieves (a really long time ago, before they’d totally, completely, utterly\nchanged, sir!). Skilled ones, too, they bragged. He’d directed these to go\ndeep into the crowds immediately, waiting on spotters who looked for any\nmessengers sent toward the Chromeria. It was a slender hope, of course,\nwith so many people jamming the docks."

It was a slender hope, of course,\nwith so many people jamming the docks.\nKip accepted an interruption by one of his new Mighty with the\njourneyman he was arguing with and headed for the Chromeria himself.\nWithin two blocks, Ferkudi, Cruxer, and Winsen fell in with him.\nClearly, someone was awake, though, doubtless alarmed at the\nburgeoning number of unknown ships in their harbor, because Kip saw\nseveral messengers running from the Chromeria toward the docks. He even\nheard one waylaid by a barking dog. Apparently the Cwn y Wawr had\nlanded successfully.\nBy now Tisis should be halfway to her safe house in a defensible\nmansion in a Ruthgari neighborhood. If Kip were arrested, she had to be\nsafe. She would direct the army.\nThe streets of Big Jasper felt different than they had a year ago. Not only\nwere they twice as crowded, dirtier, and more hostile, but they also felt\nsmaller and more scared. What had seemed to Kip to be the center of the\nworld, snug and smug in its towering superiority, was now a too-tall cairn,\nstone stacked on stone, wondering if the wind would blow it down.\nThey made it unimpeded all the way to the Lily’s Stem and crossed that\nluxin bridge onto Little Jasper. An honor guard of Ruthgari soldiers in green\nfell in behind them—Eirene Malargos’s ambassador’s doing, no doubt. So\nTisis’s skimmer-sent letters had reached him.\nThen they were joined by four of the Ruthgari Satrapah Ptolos’s own\nguard. Actually, Kip wasn’t even sure if Ruthgar was still led by Satrapah\nPtolos these days. There had been rumblings that Eirene Malargos was\nconsidering taking over personally in this time of crisis instead of ruling\nfrom behind.\nSomeone had cleared out a path through the various petitioners and\nnobles in the great hall at ground level, and everyone turned to watch them\nwalk through. Kip saw hostile faces from the white-clad Lightguards, but he\nand his entourage entered the lifts without being impeded.\nNo one asked where they were going. Their escorting soldiers set the\nplates and took them to the audience-hall level.\n“Just, uh, in case I don’t get another chance to say it,” Ferkudi said. He\ncleared his throat. “Uh, it’s been an honor to serve you, my lord.”\nBig Leo grunted an affirmation. Ben-hadad cleared his throat in\nagreement.\n“More than that, for me,” Cruxer said quietly, not turning his head, his\nshoulders back. “This work saved my life after, after Lucia passed. It’s been\npurpose and a pursuit worthy of my whole heart.”\nThe rest rumbled agreement, and Kip’s heart swelled for these men who\n—\n“Ah shit, you’re all makin’ me weepy,” Winsen deadpanned. He dabbed\nat a dry eye.\nBig Leo smacked the side of Winsen’s head.\n“Dammit, Leo!” Winsen said. “I keep telling you, don’t—”"

I just get cranky when I put my life\nin the hands of a man with a pucker like a paper press.”\n“What does that even mean?” Ferkudi asked. “And which man?”\nKip closed his eyes, a smile stealing over his face at their banter, at their\ninability to stay serious for more than a ten count. These men would face\ndeath for him—and they believed they were facing it for him now, in these\nserene halls. He’d brought them here, and they had no illusions that this\nplace was safe.\n“He’s talking about the promachos,” Cruxer told Ferkudi.\n“Yeah, but still,” Ferkudi said, “what does that mean?” He looked\naround. “Does this one go in the Box?”\n“We killed Lightguards when we left,” Cruxer said. “And those men’s\ncomrades surely gave their side of that story, and only their side of the story,\nwhile we were gone.”\n“I’m not stupid,” Ferkudi said. “I know all that. What’s that got to do\nwith a promachos’s pucker?”\nBen-hadad snorted. “I really hope that we live long enough for ‘What’s\nthat got to do with a promachos’s pucker?’ to become a saying for us.”\nBig Leo said, “Our lives are… contiguous on the promachos’s mood,\nFerk, so Win’s hoping that—that can’t be right. ‘Continuous’? No, not that,\neither.”\n“I really didn’t think I was the subtle one,” Winsen said.\n“‘Contingent’?” Ben-hadad suggested.\n“Ah, that’s it,” Big Leo said.\n“I still don’t—” Ferkudi said.\nKip felt a sudden surge of love for these big apes. They were nervous.\nChatty. Nettlesome. And yet they were here. With him.\nThey could’ve had a secure kingdom in Blood Forest, for a while at\nleast. Fame, for a while at least. And yet they were here, for him.\nWith the honor guard there with them, a mature man would never crack\na joke. Kip was a fugitive, and honor guards could turn to actual guards all\ntoo easily.\nExactly how far being a Guile would benefit Kip depended completely\non Andross Guile’s whim.\n“It means we hope the old man’s been eating his prunes,” Kip said as the\nlift doors opened.\n“I still don’t—”\n“Orholam’s scabby left nut, Ferk!” Ben-hadad said, turning, not noticing\nthe doors were now fully open and dozens of nobles and retainers and men-\nat-arms lining the hallway were looking at them. “He means that if that\nbatshit-crazy old man is cranky because he’s constipated, we’re fucked!”\nBen looked at the faces of his friends, and then followed those to the\naghast faces in the hall behind him. “Oops.”"

Anything Kip did would merely make it\nseem like Ben-hadad was repeating an attitude Kip had modeled before. But\ngive Ben-hadad this: his brain only stayed in panicked paralysis for a single\nheartbeat.\nBen-hadad limped out of the lift first, leaning heavily on his cane,\nexaggerating the limp. “War wound,” he said, too loudly, rubbing his ear as\nif he were part deaf. “The wights knocked me a bit senseless.”\nHaving seen that Andross Guile himself wasn’t in the hallway, Kip let\nhimself take a breath.\nAfter all, if his grandfather decided to kill him, it wouldn’t be over\nsomething like this. “Commander,” Kip said. “See that your man is\nappropriately disciplined later. For the moment, we’ve things to do.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nThey strode forward past the whispers, and surrendered their weapons to\nthe Blackguards standing at the audience-hall door.\nOut of the side of his mouth, Ben-hadad muttered, “I said, ‘Oops.’”\nKip recognized one—and only one—of the Blackguards at the door. Jin\nHolvar had recovered from her wounds, but looked older and grim as she\nextended her hands for their weapons.\n“You know,” Cruxer said to Kip, unbuckling his sword belt and handing\nit over, “it stings not to be able to go armed in front of the White and the\npromachos, especially given that you’re family, and I’m a legacy, and all of\nus were so close to being Blackguards. I mean, I understand it. And it\nwouldn’t be so bad if the Lightguards didn’t get to go armed here while we\ndon’t. But they do.”\nJin Holvar grimaced as if she agreed, but she maintained her Blackguard\nprofessionalism.\n“No need to salt the wound,” Kip said. “The Blackguards here already\nhave to share duties with the men who murdered Goss—and he was a\nBlackguard nunk at the time, wasn’t he?”\n“Yeah, definitely, it’s true. He was,” Big Leo said, looking hard at\nHolvar but pretending to speak to Kip. “Even if a Blackguard wanted to\nforgive everything that happened to your old friends who had to flee\nafterward, that’s still a huge offense, completely unprovoked as it was.”\n“Huge?” Ben-hadad said. “More than that. Unforgivable.”\n“It’s all right,” Cruxer said, leveling a hellstone stare right at the\nLightguards flanking the Blackguards at the door. “Jin was in the infirmary\nthat day with us. She knows the truth of what happened. When men without\nhonor attack you, there’s little you can do to stop the first treacherous blow.\nAll you can do is make them pay later. The Blackguard being the august,\nhonorable company that it is, I’m sure they’ve made those cowards pay\nsince then.

Before\nthey could answer—or apologize, Kip suddenly felt like an ass—she pushed\nopen the door.\nAnother gauntlet of expectant faces filled the audience chamber, but to\nKip they were an undifferentiated blur. As war-blindness narrows your\nvision into a tiny cone, so was Kip’s peripheral vision obliterated by his\ndread at what he was going to see on the dais at the front of the room.\nHe walked forward, hearing only his blood whooshing in his ears as he\nwas announced. He should have been paying attention to which honorifics\nthey added to glean clues about what kind of reception he was going to\nreceive, but all he could see was Karris and Andross, standing together, one\nall in white, the other in red.\nHis half brother wasn’t here. Thank Orholam for that.\nThe cares of war had had the opposite effects on Karris and Andross.\nKarris had lost weight, none of it muscle. She had never carried excess\nsoftness, but now she appeared to have buried her sorrows in relentless\ntraining. Her face was harsh and placid to gauntness. Her dress left her\ngranite shoulders bare, and her hair was bleached to a platinum white.\nEverything she wore was either white leather, or shimmering white silk\npulled taut, or steel. Even her cosmetics were cold, her cheekbones\nheightened to make her look angular and icy.\nAnd then Kip saw her eyes. She was stunned at him.\nAnd then he knew this was all her court dress. It was her war face. She\nwas the Iron White. This wasn’t a mask or a disguise: it wasn’t not her, but\nit wasn’t all of her, either.\nHe wasn’t sure what she was seeing in him, but he turned his eyes to\nPromachos Andross Guile, from whom he would receive his doom.\nAndross seemed to have thrived on war. He looked hale, vigorous. His\nskin was bronzed from the sun now, and he had an energy and assurance\nthat made him a lodestone to the eyes. The misanthrope’s bitterness had\nmelted away into stern purpose. For the first time, Kip saw a bit of the\nAndross Guile his grandmother had fallen in love with.\n“He looks like Gavin,” Karris said beneath her breath. Kip didn’t think\nhe was supposed to hear it.\n“No,” Andross said. “He looks like Gavin’s brother.”\n“Dazen? How so?” Karris asked, not looking away.\n“Not Dazen,” Andross said. “Sevastian.”\nStanding now before them, Kip made a low court bow. “High Lady\nWhite.

While slaves had fed them peeled grapes and\ndormouse pie, Conn Arthur had gutted his own brother, both brothers’ lives\nburnt out defending satrapies that should have been far more united.\nOther men’s blood. Other men’s sweat. Other men’s tears and bile.\nAnd they had denied him even the Blackguard. They played their games\nwhile satrapies burned. He had thought them giants, speaking from the\nheights. They weren’t giants. They were dwarfs on a tower, shouting down\nwith tinny voices at those who labored in the mud, hiding their puny legs\nunder great fields of cloth as if large pretenses would make them larger than\nlife.\nSuddenly, Andross Guile broke the long silence, as if he had just seen\nsomething that pleased him.\n“Grandson!” he said. “Welcome back!”\nIt was meant to shock Kip, to throw him off balance. But Kip was a\nchild no longer. He wasn’t about to lose the initiative.\n“I come with dire news, and I come with help,” Kip announced. “The\nWight King is coming. He’s destroyed your fleet. We tried to help, but it\nwas a rout.”\nGasps and little cries of denial from the audience.\n“Koios is coming here?” Karris asked, a dry fury in the gaze she shot\nAndross. “Who could’ve guessed?”\nThe old man’s face hardened. “And our fleet, which was supposed to be\nspread out in every direction protecting Sun Day pilgrims from pirates, just\nhappened upon this fleet? And concentrated their forces?”\n“They had sea chariots for scouting. If they saw an invasion fleet coming\nwhat do you expect they’d do?”\nAndross Guile opened his mouth, but Kip cut him off, saying, “There’s\nmore.”\n“Out with it,” Andross Guile said.\n“Koios is floating the bane here. Six or seven of them. The bane\nparalyze drafters. It’s why we couldn’t help the fleet more than we did. He\nalso has forty or fifty thousand soldiers. All this we’ve seen with our own\neyes.”\nThroughout the hall, denial turned to horror. How was the Chromeria to\nfight fifty thousand soldiers and untold numbers of wights without its\ndrafters?\n“But there’s good news,” Kip said, raising his voice.\n“Pray tell,” Andross Guile said, eyes flashing.\nKip said, “I can stop them.”\nChapter 70\n“This is like one of those festival games, isn’t it?” Gavin said, coming up to\nthe gap. “The promise of an amazing prize if only you do something that\nlooks simple… but is actually impossible.” He looked into the abyss before\nhis toes and tried to still the turning of his stomach.\n“Many have made the jump with greater infirmities than your own.”\n“I’m infirm now, huh?”\nThey had climbed every circle, and Gavin had just tucked away the last\nboon stone into his constricting and now heavy pilgrim’s garment.

The\ncrown of this great tower couldn’t be more than a half circle away. But here,\nrather than sitting right in front of the next gate, the pilgrims’ rest area sat\nright next to an enormous gap in the trail.\nOrholam came up to stand beside Gavin at the precipice. “It’s not so\nfar.”\n“Not so far?” Gavin asked, incredulous. It had to be seven paces.\nGavin had endured a lifetime’s worth of trials to get this far, and he’d\nkept his pilgrimage mind-set as well as he could. But this was impossible.\nLudicrous. It was suicide.\nHe leaned forward over the abyss. Wind buffeted him, and he staggered\nback, heart seizing up in his chest.\nHe rubbed the black eye, but even that did nothing to soothe him.\n“I can’t make that kind of jump,” Gavin said. “There’s no way in hell\nyou can make it.”\n“Nope. But like I said, this isn’t my pilgrimage.”\nGavin turned on the old man. “You’re not going with me?”\n“My task was to get you here,” Orholam said. He smiled a toothy smile\nand patted himself on the back. “‘Good job, old boy. Well done!’ ‘Oh,\nMaster, you’re too kind. I was pretty good, though, wasn’t I? Especially\nconsidering the load I had to carry up this tower!’” Plopping down his pack,\nOrholam sat and dangled his legs over the drop.\n“Load?!” Gavin said. “I oughta kick you off this damned tower!”\n“Meh. How do you think I plan to get down? Walk?”\n“Huh?” Gavin asked.\n“Below here, it’s a… what do you call it? The entrance to the, uh, the\nthing you slide down.”\n“What? The chute?”\n“Chute, that’s it! Yeah, I mean, after the initial plunge, which is\napparently quite bracing. You saw where it spits you out at the bottom of\nthe tower. Safely, too, albeit likely with damp undergarments. This is a\npilgrimage to the Father of Mercy. Failure doesn’t mean death here. If you\nfall, you slide down the chute and start over. Or give up, I suppose.”\n“Start over?”\nGavin looked across the gap, despair welling up in him. How was he\nsupposed to leap seven paces? Maybe at his strongest he might have leapt\nso far, but now?\n“It’s customary to take a meal as one contemplates this test. Hmm.”\nOrholam was looking around. “There were benches and tables… once.\nWood, I guess. No sign of them now after the centuries. Sad. Imagine the\ndedication of those who carried tables and chairs up through all that we’ve\njust seen, merely to ease the burdens of others who’d climbed! Come, sit.”\nGavin was looking at the gap. In his prime, healthy, unencumbered, he\ncould’ve cleared it. Probably.\nMaybe.\n“How strong are you, Guile? You look well—”\n“Thank you.”"

You look well—”\n“Thank you.”\n“—considering your age and what you’ve been through.”\n“Let me take that back,” Gavin said.\nHe had regained much of his strength, even through the climb, oddly.\nHis body felt strong. Against the strop of successive circles, his mind had\nbeen honed to a keen edge.\nBut Orholam wasn’t wrong in adding in that consideration of age: Gavin\nwasn’t of that strength which in the old days shook the pillars of the earth.\n“Are you going to throw the blade across?” Orholam asked, seeing\nGavin contemplating its weight, turning it in his hands.\n“And risk losing it in this wind? No way.”\n“Leave it here?” Orholam asked.\n“And trust you with it?”\n“You could do worse.”\nJumping across while holding the Blinding Knife—Blinding Sword?—\ntempted serious injury. And that was if he could clear the gap at all with all\nthe weight he was carrying. If the blade slowed his run up to the edge of the\nprecipice even a little, Gavin wouldn’t make it.\n“How the hell would old people make it across this?” Gavin asked. “You\nsaid there were wood tables. Was there a plank or something, too? A little\nwalk of faith, huge drop-off to either side, have to step exactly right or you\nfall?”\n“That’s how you see Him?”\n“Accurately, you mean?”\nOrholam shook his head sadly. “It’s said that the gap adjusts to be a\nperfect test for each penitent.”\n“Adjusts?” Gavin asked. “So for some old lady, it’d be like a big step?\nYou should’ve told me! I’d have brought an old lady with me. Oh wait, I\nsort of did. How about I make you go first?”\nOrholam shrugged. “I’m not crossing. I’ll jump if you try to make me.”\n“You’re serious? You can’t be serious. You got all the way here and now\nyou’re gonna quit? Half a turn from the top? You don’t want to see if He\nreally is there?”\n“This isn’t about me, Guile,” the old rower said.\n“It is now. I need you. If you’re not going to help me, I deserve to know\nwhy.” Right before I throw your geriatric ass off the no-chute side of the\ntower.\n“That will of yours. No wonder it got you in trouble.” Orholam sighed.\n“Very well. This is my penance. Many years ago, and for many years, I\nrefused to go where Orholam told me to go. Now He told me to come here.\nAnd, as I understand, to go no farther. So here I am, standing at the door\nand knocking, but I won’t go in uninvited.”\n“‘As you understand’? Change your understanding!”\n“Here I stand. I can do no other.”\n“I guess I should’ve expected this much help from Orholam in my hour\nof need.”\n“I never claimed to be the Lord of Lights.

But one of us is finished with the lies and dodging\nresponsibility.”\n“How is it, my friend, that after all this climb, your heart is still hard\nagainst one who loves you most?”\n“What you want’s impossible. Fuck you, friend,” Gavin said. “I’m sorry\nI ever saved you.”\nThe old prophet seemed unperturbed. “I’ll be here praying for you. That\nis, unless you do me some violence that prevents it. That edge over there\nwill see me miss the chute and fall to my death.”\nThe fires of rage burned only for a few moments more. Without further\nfuel, they dimmed. The old man wouldn’t fight him.\nDid Gavin really want to kill another person who didn’t resist?\n“No,” Gavin said. “Killing deluded old men is exactly what I got tired of\ndoing with my life. Plus I’m not going to let you die thinking you’re a\nmartyr.”\nHe turned away. The gap remained. The gap was impossible.\nWhatever happened to ‘Impossible is what I do’?\nThe penitent’s robes held Gavin’s boon-stone burdens wonderfully, but\nthey were burdens nonetheless. And heavy, no matter how well carried.\n“Tell me again. What exactly happens if I fall?” Gavin asked.\n“You slide down to the bottom, where you may either give up or climb\nagain.”\n“All the way to the bottom? Are there shortcuts on the way back up?\nLadders or something you didn’t tell me about the first time? Is it easier the\nsecond time? I learned my lessons on my first trip, O wise and great\nmaster.”\nOrholam shook his head. “Oh! But there is an important bit I may not\nhave told you? Didn’t I tell you that where the celestial realm and ours\noverlap, time works somewhat differently?”\n“Yes.” And I totally believed you.\n“It’s nearly Sun Day now.”\n“What?” Gavin asked. It had certainly seemed a long climb, but long as\nin days, not weeks.\n“If you fall? Your next climb will take a year. The next try takes ten.\nSome few have left behind all their lives and family to climb for a century,\nperhaps more.”\n“I know. You said that. I just didn’t really believe you. We didn’t see\nanyone else on our climb.”\n“And yet we passed many, and more passed us. You think the creator of\nthe Thousand Worlds has made only one path of pilgrimage?”\nOkay, lots of religious obfuscation there, but it was possible that there\nwas some sort of anomaly here on this island that made time seem warped.\nIf so, it made sense that primitive peoples would build a monument in such\na place. How perception and reality overlapped with will-casting was\nsomething Gavin didn’t understand well. No one did, he thought. He had to\ntake the threat seriously.\nWhether it was all lies or all the truth, though, he had to finish this\nclimb."

A fall could well kill\nhim, even if it wasn’t meant to. Maybe it was true and earlier pilgrims had\nhad multiple chances. That didn’t matter. Gavin had to make it on the first\ntry. Full stop.\nHe had to get to the top before Sun Day, or Karris would die. Magic had\nto die, or Karris would.\nOne try.\n“Well, it’s not like I haven’t been here before,” Gavin said, looking off\nthe edge.\n“On a real pilgrimage?” Orholam asked.\n“How ’bout you pray silently, and not fall to your death?” Gavin\nsuggested.\nOrholam shut up. For once.\n“Here, as in facing the impossible, with no help, certainly not from you,”\nGavin said.\nSeven gates he’d cleared, claiming seven stones he was supposed to be\nable to redeem to get seven boons. Gavin had planned out what boons he’d\nasked of Orholam, too, with feebly growing hope in his heart:\n1. That Karris will live\n2. That I recover my powers\nPerhaps this was a cheat, asking too many things, for it would require\nthe restoration of his color vision, and to be able to draft all his colors again,\nand to split light again. He didn’t know how legalistic Orholam would be\nwith His boons, or how general Gavin could be, or how audacious the\nboons requested could be. But audacity had served him well in his life.\n3. That I get vengeance on those who have wronged me\n4. That I will reign again as Prism\n5. That Kip will get the father he deserves\nWhether that would be Gavin himself (only better than he was now), or\nif that was some other father figure, Gavin didn’t know. Either, maybe.\n6. That I will save the Seven Satrapies\nNot just limp along through this war, but really, really make it. Thrive,\neven.\n7. That Karris will forgive me\nMaybe that was too much to ask. Maybe the boons couldn’t force people\nto do what they didn’t want to do. That would be the kind of stricture\nOrholam would abide, wouldn’t it? Something easier, then:\n7. That Marissia will find happiness\nYeah, she deserved that. That she would have an overflowing life\nsomewhere, with someone better to her than he’d been.\nThat was the order, too. Funny, his priorities. The only one he thought\nwas in an acceptable place was the first: Karris. Even a year ago, he’d not\nhave put that there.\nAnd really, the survival of the Seven Satrapies should be his highest\npriority.\nOnly one goal was fully un-self-interested. Nope, wait: No, not even\nsaving the Seven Satrapies was really disinterested, was it? Hard to be the\nPrism over nothing, wasn’t it?\n“What do you call it when you realize you’ve been an asshole your\nwhole life?” Gavin asked.\n“A good start?” Orholam offered."

Beautiful and weighty.\n‘That Marissia Will Find Happiness’ lay heavy in his hand as he hefted\nit.\nI didn’t come this far to only come this far.\nHe tossed the boon stone off the side of the tower. Something shifted in\nthe world, or in him, but he couldn’t tell what it was.\nNo matter. He couldn’t make the jump while he was still weighed down\nwith so much.\nHe opened the pocket that held Greed’s boon stone, but it caught in his\nfingers. He had to think for a long time what boon he would sacrifice here.\nIn the end, he decided to give up ‘That I Will Reign Again as Prism.’ He\ntossed the orange stone aside and instantly felt lighter.\nHe shrugged his shoulders, tested how his body felt.\nHe stared heavenward, and dread filled him.\nI feel lighter because I’m giving up my hopes.\n“What are you doing?” Orholam asked.\n“You know the thing about me?” Gavin asked.\n“I know many things about you.”\n“The most important one.”\n“I think I’m not supposed to say aloud what I think that is,” Orholam\nsaid. “I could pray for wisd—”\n“I’ll do whatever I must to win.”\n“A universal failing of the Guiles.”\nNext pocket, opened. Sloth’s stone.\n‘That I Will Save the Seven Satrapies’ dropped by the wayside.\nIt was a death.\n“I should have known,” Gavin said, “that any hope You’d give would be\nshort-lived. Deceptive. You are astonishing in Your parsimony. You give\nand You take away, I suppose? Is that what we humble pilgrims are to\nlearn?”\n“It seems to me that He’s taking nothing from you,” Orholam said.\n“You’re throwing them aside.”\n“The gap’s too wide!” Gavin snarled.\nBut words changed nothing.\nRed. Dagnu’s stone. Gluttony. Kip. Was asking for happiness for Kip\nsomehow Gavin being gluttonous?\nIt wasn’t. Sure, Gavin wanted everything. Could never ask enough. But\nwasn’t asking a boon for Kip selfless? How could Orholam oppose that?\nI want to give him something so good, he’ll never ask for the truth about\nhis real father, whom I killed.\nGavin looked at the red boon stone. Sorry, Kip. You deserve better.\nHe tossed the stone aside, closing his eyes.\nHe bounced on his feet as if unaffected, testing his weight. Still too\nheavy, too encumbered. Three stones left. He knew what he should toss\naside next. He opened sub-red. Anat’s stone, goddess of Wrath. His\nvengeance. If Orholam made him focus his request, what would he choose?\nVengeance on all wights for Sevastian’s murder, as his Great Goal had once\nbeen? Vengeance on Koios White Oak for this damned war?

Vengeance on his father?\nHe touched the raw wound that was the sub-red boon stone.\nTossing it away was like tearing away a scab that had an unhealed\nwound beneath it.\nThe warmth fled from the world, and it took some of the life from\nGavin’s limbs with it.\nIf I recover my powers, I can take vengeance myself. With my powers,\nI’m Prism Gavin Guile. With my powers, I can do anything. This time I\nwon’t waste it.\nNow he had only two boons left he could ask: First, that Karris would\nlive—that she would triumph! Yes, he would be audacious on her behalf.\nSecond, that he recover all his powers, fully, with the full span of his years\nleft in them, that he could last another twenty-one years as Prism, at least.\nWith only two boons, he’d ask no half measures.\nGavin began limbering up his muscles. He checked the very edge of the\nprecipice for grip, both as he would launch into his jump and where he\nwould land. He would roll on the other side, he thought.\n“When you fall, do you wish me to climb with you again, or do you\nwant to come alone?” Orholam asked. “My instructions weren’t clear about\nif I was supposed to accompany you for more than one attempt.”\nGavin didn’t deign to reply. He walked to the very edge. He examined it\nas if this were complicated.\nIt wasn’t. He couldn’t make it across. Certainly not so burdened.\nHe pulled the last two boon stones out: ‘That Karris Will Live’ and ‘That\nI Recover My Powers.’\nHe weighed them in his hands.\nIf he fell, the next trip would take a year.\nHe didn’t have a year. Nor did she. She’d be dead.\nFine, God. I can save her myself.\nHe hesitated before he could toss aside the blue that was her boon,\nthough.\nThis isn’t me putting my powers above her life. I can’t trust Orholam. I\ncan’t trust anyone but myself.\nThis is… this is me committing myself to using my powers for her. I\ncan’t do anything for her if I’m dead. I gotta look out for myself first. For a\nlittle while. So I can serve everyone.\nHe threw away Karris’s life.\nHis throat tightened. Without turning, he said, “You tell Orholam, next\ntime you see Him, that this is bullshit. This whole thing. Everything He’s\ndone. All of it.”\n“Seems to me you’ll do what you have to in order to be able to go tell\nHim yourself, Guile.”\n“Yeah, I will.”\n“It also seems to me that if you tossed the sword aside instead, you\nmight be able to carry a couple of those stones. But what do I know?”\nSomehow, Gavin hadn’t even thought of the sword. He’d grown\naccustomed to the makeshift scabbard banging against him with every step.\n“The sword’s like my testicles, friend,” Gavin said.\n“Not the genitalia one usually hears a sword compared to.”"

It’s a weak spot, but not one I’m willing to part\nwith. Losing the sword is not an option.”\nSo long as he had the sword, perhaps he could compel Orholam to give\nhim a boon. Or kill Him, as Grinwoody demanded. But Gavin would do\nwhat it took. Whatever it took.\nBut he hadn’t turned away from the gap as he spoke. He cracked open\nhis left eye—the crystalline black eye—and he saw his trajectories. A\nhundred different attempts played out in front of him: he jumped too early;\nhe stumbled on the last step; he tried to run along the wall for a few steps\nand then leap.\nAgain and again, he fell short, his body slamming into the wall on the\nother side, rebounding off the stones and into the abyss. There was no case\neven where he just barely grabbed the edge and then clambered up. Going\nfrom a full sprint to a full stop by colliding with a stone wall didn’t leave a\nhuman grabbing much of anything.\nOdd that the eye didn’t account for the wind, he thought. Too irregular,\nperhaps. But it gusted fitfully up and across the gap, sometimes with\nstartling force. It would certainly confound attempts at a wall run: a wrong\ngust would blast his feet from any step, and any lost step would mean a fall.\n“Burn in hell, Orholam,” Gavin said. He tossed the last boon stone\naside.\n“Why do you cling so tightly?” Orholam asked.\nNow he looked again. The cold rationality of the black jewel showed\nhim it was still too far. Just barely too far, but too far.\nTight, ill-fitting, pulling at his legs with every stride, the pilgrim’s\nclothes had only been good for their pockets. Gavin stripped them off.\n“Unique approach,” Orholam said. “It may make for some real\ndiscomfort as you shoot down the, um, chute.”\n“I don’t intend to fall,” Gavin said.\n“No one intends to fall,” Orholam said. “Well. Except me. I intend to\nfall. So not really fall, I guess. Jump.”\nStill too far on all but the luckiest jump.\nGavin tore his pilgrim’s clothes into strips, cutting them with the edge of\nthe Blinding Knife where necessary. He bound the pieces together into a\nmakeshift rope and then tied it around the hilt. He checked and double-\nchecked his knots.\nThen, before he went through with his stupid plan, he walked to the edge\nof the precipice again, set the sword at his feet, and looked at the jump\nthrough the cold eye of death.\nSure enough, he could still louse this up. But if he didn’t carry the\nsword, more than half the time, he would clear the gap.\nThose were the best odds he’d faced in years.\n“Are you going to try what I think you’re going to try?” Orholam asked.\n“If you think it’s a stupid idea, I agree with you,” Gavin said. “So shut\nup.”\nHe checked the rope yet again.

No way was he going to come this far\nand then drop the Blinding Knife out into the abyss because he was\ncareless.\nThe top of the tower was only a single level above him now: one gap\nand a single corkscrew turn of the stairs. With his hand protruding into\nempty air, he could spin the sword on the rope like a sling and toss it up\nonto the roof.\nIt took him half a dozen tries to get the sword to land above him, on the\ncrown of the tower, and stick… up there somewhere. He had no idea what it\nlooked like up there, so he had no idea if this could work.\nHis plan had been to throw the blade up there, jump the gap, and then\nrun up to the roof to grab it again before Orholam Himself—or the magic\nnexus, or whatever—noticed.\nBut the sword stuck, and when he tugged on the rope and it stayed stuck,\nhe couldn’t help but hope that maybe one test in his life would turn out to\nbe easier than he’d guessed. Maybe it was well and truly stuck. Maybe it\ncould hold his weight. Maybe he could use the rope to swing across the gap.\nMaybe he could just climb the rope to the tower roof instead of risking his\nlife on the jump.\nHe pulled harder.\nThe sword pulled free and flipped, speeding straight at his openmouthed\nface.\nHe dodged out of the way at the last instant—and then nearly lost the\nrope and sword both from his nerveless fingers as the sword continued its\nfall.\n“Throwing a sharp sword into the sky and then tugging it at your face?”\nOrholam said. “Not the smartest thing I’ve seen you do.”\n“Probably not the dumbest either,” Gavin said. He started spinning the\nsword again.\n“Hard to say. Lotta contenders.”\nGavin shook his head. “I’m kind of going to miss you, old man.”\n“Only ‘kind of’?”\n“Only kind of.”\nIt took Gavin another ten tries to get the blade to stay up there again. He\npulled on it, and it slid easily off, almost striking him as it fell again.\nTelling himself that it was better to take a few hours now than to take a\nyear to make the climb again, he threw the sword back up onto the top of\nthe tower dozens of times more. It never stuck fast enough for him to be\nable to put his own weight on it and simply climb. The roof must have no\nconvenient ledges, and the sword was certainly no grapnel.\nThis was one test Gavin couldn’t completely break by cheating: he\nwouldn’t be climbing a rope to the top.\nHe’d have to jump the gap.\nBut at least he could do it without trying to hold a sword in his hand.\nAfter one last good throw, where the sword seemed to land deeper and\nthus more safely than most of his tosses, Gavin said, “If I hand you this\nrope, will you promise just to hold on to it until I get up there and can take\nit back?”\n“You’re trying to pull a fast one on the Creator Himself,” Orholam said.\n“You think I’m gonna help you with that?”"

He released the\nrope slowly, hand hovering in case it dropped suddenly.\nBut it stayed.\n“What is that sword to you, Guile?” Orholam asked.\n“It’s my hope,” Gavin said. “Be a pal and don’t throw it into the abyss,\nwould ya?”\n“Guile.” Orholam shook his head, reproving. “You know better. If it\nfalls, it will be from your ineptitude, not my intervention. Orholam lets men\nchoose; how could I do otherwise?”\nGavin took a deep breath. No point in delay. Delay would only give the\nwinds time to nudge the blade toward the edge. Besides, he knew exactly\nwhere to place his feet to take the correct number of steps, and which type\nof jump was most likely to carry him across the chasm.\n“Goodbye, old man,” he said. “May we never see each other again.”\n“I think that unlikely,” Orholam said. “But go now. Go find your\nanswers, if you dare.”\nGavin wiped the soles of his feet clean, rubbed his hands together, and\nbreathed, breathed. He said, “A lack of daring has never been my problem.”\nThen he sprinted toward the gap.\nAnd he leapt.\nAnd he, Gavin Guile, who had fallen so far, only to climb so high;\nGavin Guile the indomitable, the dauntless; Gavin Down but Never\nDefeated; Gavin Guile soared through the air as the winds plucked at him\nand tried to turn him from his purpose—and he landed safely on the other\nside, rolling once and then coming to his feet.\nHe stood and whooped, recklessly baring his teeth at the gate so few had\neven seen.\nIt was simple gold, adorned in a spare Ptarsu style, latched but not\nlocked. There were no boon stones here for having made the jump. Perhaps\nfinishing the pilgrimage was supposed to be reward enough. Orholam lay\nbeyond, supposedly.\nGavin pulled the gate open.\nA membrane hovered in the air between him and the last stair: the lock\nto which Grinwoody had claimed only Gavin himself could be the key. The\ntest only Gavin himself could pass.\nWithout hesitating, Gavin pushed into it. It bubbled and clung and\ngripped, seeming to catch on the fragments of his dead power like splinters\ncatching on a wool tunic, but he pushed through, and soon stood gasping on\nthe other side.\nThen, grinning his fierce broken-toothed grin, victorious, he sprinted up\nthe stairs two at a time to his destiny.

I’m asking you to say it.”\n“I deemed it the best course.”\n“And how hard was it to convince you, Andy? I know you had many\nlovers before our marriage. Are you bored with me? I know that since\nSevastian died I’ve not been the eager lover I once—”\n“Stop! This had nothing to do with you, or that.” I take a breath. There\nwere deeper wells of suffering here than I was aware of. But her anger\ntriggers something at my core, burning and furious.\nI beat down the flames. As I so often do.\n“Flirtation wasn’t enough,” I say. “I gently floated bribery, but her\nfamily is wealthy and she loved her position at the library. There was\nnothing I could give her. And she was so young and innocent, there was\nnothing to use as blackmail. I didn’t have the time to hire agents to put\npressures on those she loved, or the security that I could do so without her\nsimply reporting it. So I seduced her.”\n“Did you enjoy it?” she practically spits.\nI go cold. “It had been more than a month since I last shared your bed,"

So I seduced her.”\n“Did you enjoy it?” she practically spits.\nI go cold. “It had been more than a month since I last shared your bed,\nand that had been a perfunctory goodbye, not the desperate lovemaking of a\nwoman likely to be driven mad by jealousy, my dear. Yes, I enjoyed the\nrelease.”\n“‘Release,’” she says. I used the word to imply that the sex had been a\nmere physical process, but somehow she turns it into an indictment of our\nwhole marriage. As if I want to be released from her. From my vows.\nBut I’ve already said more than I would’ve, were I fully in control.\n“Anything else?” I growl.\n“Did she enjoy it? How was it? For her. For you.” Felia has retreated\ninto cold bitch.\nI take a deep breath, and then another, until the red recedes, until I can\nsee her with compassion again. My Felia. She has been so alone, and\neverything she loves has been threatened. First Sevastian taken. Then\nGavin’s growing distance. Now this thing we must do with Dazen. And now\nme.\nFelia is afraid she’ll lose me, too.\n“Did I give her the first orgasms of her life? Did I turn her into a wanton\nwho craved my cock like the desert-parched crave water? Did she wake me\nin the morning with her mouth hot on me? Did she beg me for acts that\nyou’ve avoided since soon after we wed? Did she pursue me as you have\nnot in years? Is that what you want to ask? Why don’t you ask this question,\ninstead, and ask it of yourself: in the pursuit of my goals, was I ever a man\nto take half measures?”\n“Never,” she breathes, unblinking, but her hands have gone to her\nstomach, like a man with a gut wound in war, wanting to know how bad it\nis, needing to know, but not daring to find out.\n“Why don’t you ask what you really want to know? Did I hold her\nafterward? Did I let her sleep with her head on my shoulder in your place?”\nAll the questions slip from my grasp like hounds eager for the hunt. I can’t\nbear for her to be dishonest in this. Felia doesn’t care about the mechanics\nof the thing, where we’d fornicated or how many times I’d brought the girl\nto the storms and the rain. She wants to know if she can be replaced.\nThe love of my life is fierce, and she is bleeding, and that’s my fault as\nmuch as it is Orholam’s and Orea’s and Ulbear’s.\n“Fee,” I say gently. “Let there be no darkness between us. Having\ndecided the bed was the only battlefield by which I could seize our prize,\nyou’re damn right I didn’t tiptoe over those marriage oaths you released me\nfrom. Doing that could have meant I did it all for nothing. Do you want to\nhear how I alternated between mumming the masterful, attentive lover such\nas she’ll never know again in her life and the guilt-wrenched husband who\nneeded to go back to his wife and children, just so that she was ever\ndesperate for me and ever fearful to lose me?

I don’t fear that I’m not the\nequal of that poor girl; I fear I’m not the equal of your imagination. A man\ncan’t fall in love at first sight with a woman; he falls in love with what he\nimagines she is. She is the canvas onto which he casts his hopes and\ndreams.

This is madness dressed up as fear. I’ve\nproven my troth a thousand times. You know about all the women who have\ntried to seduce me since we married. You know about the old lovers who’ve\ntried to ignite my interest again since I became the Red. I hold you in my\neyes, Firuzeh Eszter Laleh Dariush. My Felia, my Felia Guile, how could I\ntrade you? What kind of magic cunt would a woman have to have to even\ntempt me for an instant? From you? You! A woman who could be empress,\nshould she will it? You think I would trade that girl’s gullibility, her\nweakness, for your strength?”\nBut I still see fear in her eyes.\n“If you believe that,” I say, “you haven’t lost me, you’ve lost yourself.”\nShe searches my eyes, for any falseness, I suppose. If I could play so\nmany others so skillfully, so cruelly, could I not play her, too? I try to open\nmy gaze to her, as we did when we were young, but I can only see red.\nAfter only a moment, I can see her gaze turn inward. “I don’t feel\nstrong. Not anymore.”\n“You’re strong enough.”\n“I don’t think so,” she says.\nI point and raise my voice. “Door’s that way.”\nIt’s a slap in her face. She literally gasps. “Would you let me go?

Unfortunately, cowardice is,\ntoo.”\nShe looks me in the eye for the longest time. “We haven’t made love\nsince you got back.”\nI raise my hands, palms up. Whose choice was that?\nBut then I understand. Even this many years into our marriage, this new\ncircumstance requires new responses: knowing her wounded, I’ve made\novertures only. Hurting, reactive, she’d needed determined pursuit instead,\nwhile I had been certain that determined pursuit would get me an explosion\nof anger.\nIt would’ve. I see that now.\nBut perhaps we’d needed that to lance this boil. I hadn’t needed the\nfight, hadn’t wanted the mess and fallout of a huge argument, so I thought\nwe didn’t need it. An error.\nShe lets it go. Looks down. Turns back to the table.\nShe says, “The worst of it is that I’ve seen copies of this scroll before.\nSo at first I thought it was all for… nothing.”\nAs she finishes the sentence, I walk up behind her. I breathe in her hair,\nlooming over her, hands bracing on the table to either side of her, but I don’t\ntouch her.\nShe puts her hand on my sleeve to push open the cage of my arms, but I\nhold, and she doesn’t push hard.\n“I need your everything, Fee,” I tell her. “Without you, I am utterly\nalone in this world. A candle on a rampart with a storm coming. An ox\ndragged from the path by the weight of the empty yoke where his partner\nbelongs. I can’t do the work set before us without you, heart of my heart. I\nneed your wisdom. I need your kindness. Your perspicacity. Your hand on\nthe oar. I need that strength in you that you’ve always underestimated.

I long to grab her and take her, to make the decision for\nher that I can tell she doesn’t want to make. But I don’t.\nNever has our union been of a weaker partner bowing ever to the whims\nof the greater. Nor can it be. In all the world, she is the one flower I will not\ncrush beneath the wheels of the great siege engine that is my will.\nShe doesn’t move.\nThe moment stretches beyond bearing.\nI won’t wait forever. I won’t see my need turned to weakness, my\nhunger turned to starvation. I pull back.\nBut she snares my sleeve, and as a rider controls all the raging mass of a\ncharging warhorse with a few narrow strips of leather, I am stopped.\nIs this a partnership after all?\nSometimes I wonder if she is not far the greater of us.\nShe doesn’t make me wait long enough to pursue the thought. She wants\nto know she has my full attention. She tilts her neck a little, to let her hair\nfall clear of the spot I kissed before.\nI know she needs this. I know she wants to punish me a little. I know she\nneeds to feel my pursuit, but it irks me, too, to be bidden like a dog. I am\nAndross Guile.\nI shake my sleeve free of her grip and pull away, but before she can turn,\nbefore she can say a word, I grab her hair and kiss her roughly on the other\nside of her neck. Twisting her, I lift her onto the table and find her lips.\nIn the tales, every time true lovers come together, it is with such\nfervency and effortless skill that the heavens and the earth are shaken and\nnothing can ever be the same. Such is a lie, of course, but it’s another\nexpression of the central flaw of the glass that drama holds up to reality:\neverything depicted in that glass matters.\nIn reality, lovemaking rarely changes things. Most isn’t even that\nmemorable. In most lives, the heavens and the earth are shaken rarely by\nlovemaking, or perhaps never.\nBut sometimes they are.\nEven with the ancestral gift of the Guile memory, the next minutes\ndisappear in the turbulence of feelings unmoored from thought and pulled\ninto the deep waters of passion.\n“Sorry,” I mutter, some time later.\nI had absolutely intended to tear her Ilytian lace undergarments to show\nher my unbridled desire for her. The roughness following that had… not\nbeen the result of a rational internal dialectic.\n“You can make it up to me—”\n“I can, huh?”\n“—but there’s nothing to forgive.”\n“What?” And then it hits me. “You hexed me?”\n“You can’t hold it against me after I confess it, right?”\n“Felia!” I don’t know whether to be mad or a little proud of her. She\nused to be such a stickler for the Chromeria’s rules.\n“I wanted you to be rougher,” she says matter-of-factly.\n“You could’ve asked.”\n“I wanted you to apologize afterward. And to have to make it up to me."

I’m not sure I can walk.”\n* * *\n“There were a couple of words that have changed meaning in our own\nlanguage since those earlier translations, but it was all solid scholarship.\nAnd then I saw this.” She points to a single point on the lambskin, right\nwhere the redaction begins.\n“What’s that?” I ask.\n“A flaw in the leather? A stray quill mark? A stain of any kind from the\nintervening centuries.” She shrugs. “A good translator or copyist wouldn’t\nspeculate, but only communicate what she knows. But when I look at the\nwhole scroll, and see what’s missing and how, it seems to me that whoever\nredacted this was in a hurry here. There are numerous places where he or\nshe was sloppy. These three dots here at the end of the line, if I guess where\nthe lines of text fell, could be all that remains of the three horns of a ‘shin.’\nThis could be the foot of a ‘khaf sofit.’ It could as easily be ‘resh’ or ‘nun\nsofit’ or ‘tsadi sofit’ or ‘zayin’ or ‘dalet,’ but when I compare his earlier\nhandwriting, his ‘shin’s were tall and elegant, and his ‘khaf sofit’s extended\na little lower than the others.”\nShe’s getting into the minutiae. But she sees my impatience.\n“If I’m right,” she says, “then this dot”—she lays a piece of parchment\nover the area and draws a delicate curve—“is part of an aspirate, a breath\nmark, as in the way ‘Or’holam’ was once written. It’s the right time period.\nBreath marks in punctuation only started falling out of scholarly usage\nsome eighty years later, with Polyphrastes’ Dictions.”\n“But this mark obviously isn’t for ‘Orholam.’ You’ve discovered\nsomething else,” I say.\n“‘Discovered’ is too strong. I’ve ‘speculated.’”\n“Tell me.”\n“I’ll show you instead.” She lines up the parchment edge over the\noriginal scroll so that one edge just touches the breath mark and, farther\ndown the absent line of text, the three dots of the missing ‘khaf sofit’\nprotrude. “You understand, what I’m doing here is by no means\n‘translation.’ It’s a guess, not scholarship.”\nI say nothing, and she picks up a quill, shaved precisely as the ancient\nParians shaved theirs to give the proper calligraphic quality to edges and\ncurves. Her lettering is not only beautiful, it is also such a match for the\nScriptivist’s handwriting that it would make a forger proud. The spacing\nand size of the letters is exact. She starts from the breath mark and moves\nleft, unhurried. “There is nothing internally or in the other writings of the\nScriptivist to support this,” she says as she draws the ‘khaf sofit,’ its three\nhorns coming above the edge of her parchment to touch the three dots on"

She finishes the phrase and steps back.\n“‘On a broken stone, the black fires of hell, on earth once more shall\nunleash the two hundred falling glories of heaven.’ Literally, ‘the falling\nstars.’ But when it’s ‘two hundred,’ it’s never literal. The ‘two hundred\nfalling stars,’ or ‘fallen stars’—it’s a euphemism sometimes shortened to\n‘the two hundred.”\n“The celestials,” I say. “The elohim, the old gods.”\n“Those who rebelled against Orholam and were cast from His court.”\n“Or marched out in defiance of the tyrant, if the heretics have it true,” I\nsay.\n“The Braxians?” Felia asks. “The Cracked Landers believe anything that\njustifies their thirst for power.” She grows quiet. “Like all of us do,\nperhaps.”\n“You mean you and I?” I ask.\nFor a moment, her eyes are an open door to the soul bleeding within.\nI forget, sometimes, that her greater sensitivity means that she suffers\nmore than I even can.\n“I don’t want this,” I say. “Do you? Are you perverting this translation\nso that we can do this to our boys? That’s not the Felia I know you to be.”\nBefore tears can gather once more in her eyes, I say, “So don’t lump us in\nwith those desert assassins.”\nShe is defeated. “My lord husband, look at Gavin’s last letter to you.”\nShe hands me a parchment, not Gavin’s letter, which was in code, but the\ndecryption of it.\n“How did you get this?” I ask.\n“Read.”\nShe’s made a mark next to a paragraph: ‘Father, I have him on the run\nnow. Dazen doubtless hopes to retreat to the mountains around Kelfing, but\nwe’ve a plan to entrap his army at a bend in the river near a town called\nRekton.’\nI look at the map Felia has spread on the table. She sweeps a hand over\nTyrea, and the little dot that is Rekton on the Umber River. In orange luxin,\nnames appear—old names, though. “At the height of the Tyrean Empire,”\nshe says, “there was a city here, its name lost to time. It was a holy city,\nconsecrated to Anat Sub-red, before Karris Atiriel or her followers\ndemolished it. There’s a great dome of rock there. Anat’s Dome, or Anat’s\nFurnace, the Lady of the Desert’s milk-swollen breast or her pregnant belly,\nthey say. Upon it, the ancient Tyreans sacrificed their sons and fed their\nblood to the sands, begging the goddess to make their desert bloom.” Her\nvoice grows distant. “How blithely I condemned them as monsters,\nAndross. What mother worthy of the name could murder her sons and\nbelieve that, of such enormity, good would come? I couldn’t imagine…\nHow could we let this happen?”\n“Felia,” I say, “how can you even ask that? While you translate this? If"

The wrecked town\nwas settled by refugees from other places, who eventually called it Rekton.\n“Andross, if Janus was right about Dazen, and if all these leaps of\nintuition are somehow correct… What if ‘the black fires of hell’ means\n‘burning hellstone’? ‘Living hellstone’? ‘A great rock’ could be ‘the Great\nRock’… Andy, it could mean, ‘Breaking the Great Rock, black luxin shall\nunleash the Two Hundred once more upon the earth.’” She takes a deep\nbreath. “Gavin is trying to trap Dazen at Anat’s Great Rock.”\n“And,” I say, a dread birthed full grown from my heart in an instant,\n“Dazen can draft black luxin.”\nShe looks out the ship’s porthole. “What we’ve sacrificed—and what\nwe’ve stolen from that poor librarian—has bought us all we needed to know\nto avert catastrophe, but too late. Gavin sent this letter a week ago. There’s\nno way we can get to Rekton in time to stop them.”\nChapter 72\nThere were only two ways Teia could uproot the entire Order of the Broken\nEye, and tonight was her last chance to take the option that didn’t involve\ndozens of loyal Chromeria soldiers dying. Tonight, it seemed, the priests of\nthe various sects were meeting with the Old Man of the Desert himself to\npull together the details for the Feast of the Dying Light.\nOr, as not-evil fucks called it, Sun Day Eve.\nThe Braxians didn’t celebrate the summer solstice as the longest day of\nthe year; they celebrated it as the day after which the days would get\nshorter. That sort of made sense for the desert-dwelling Braxians, who’d\nsuffered under the blistering, debilitating heat of their desert summers, but it\nstill seemed kind of evil to Teia. Doubly so now, because these new\nBraxians weren’t desert people at all; the new followers of the Order just\nhated Orholam.\nShe could be wrong, of course. She’d been shadowing Atevia—\nShadowing? she thought.\nNo, T, stop thinking. Last time you thought too much, you nearly had to\nexplain ‘nocturnal emissions’ to a luxiat.\nShe’d been, ahem, shadowing Atevia pretty much constantly, and she’d\nstill missed the plant. The barrel-chested wine merchant/pagan priest had\nreached into a pocket and suddenly flinched in a way that made it obvious\nhe’d found something there that hadn’t been there before. Then he’d made\nhis way hurriedly into a nearby alley, looked around furtively, and opened\nit. It must have been only a few words, because he closed it before Teia\ncould lean around him to read it."

That meant there was a\nmeeting tonight, or ‘before tonight,’ didn’t it?\nHaving failed, up till now, to find the Old Man’s hidden office and a\nmaster list of the Order’s members, Teia now only had two ways to destroy\nthe Order of the Broken Eye. First, find out where they were holding their\nbig joint ritual for the Feast of the Dying Light. Through some pretense,\nKarris could gather a bunch of soldiers at the last moment, not telling any of\nthem or their commanders why, and then have them sprint to the place (so\nas to give no traitors time to send a messenger on ahead of them).\nThen Karris’s soldiers would attack the meeting directly.\nThere likely wouldn’t be any arrests. The Order knew that if they were\ncaptured, Orholam’s Glare awaited them. They would surely rather fight\nand die than face that. And the Order, fighting? That was a daunting\nprospect. How many Shadows would be gathered there with them?\nSuch a clash would likely be the end of the Order, but it would also\nlikely be a bloodbath for both sides. And the Chromeria might still fail to\nget all its leaders. Teia would be there to help, but the leaders would have\nexit strategies, and everyone was disguised—how could Teia block every\nexit? She was only one person.\nMaybe if she found the place early enough, she could scout it out and\nmark all the exits? But the Order would have Shadows and others double-\nchecking that the site was secure beforehand.\nThat wasn’t a situation she wanted to get into.\nShe might not have any choice.\nThe second option was much better: Teia would follow Atevia to this\nmeeting with the Old Man and then track him to his lair, interrogate, and\nkill him. Somewhere, likely in that very room, he would have code books\nand a list of members, maybe even her father’s location.\nEven if things went wrong (and there were plenty that could), simply\nhaving the Old Man’s identity in addition to Atevia’s would be enough for\nKarris to triangulate the rest.\nOnce the Old Man and the priests were known to be dead, people like\nAglaia who were on the outer circles of membership would start running for\nthe exits—and when captured and facing the Glare, those folks would start\ngiving up their contacts.\nAnd Teia was close now; she could feel it. Tonight.\nTeia had guessed that today or tonight there would have to be some sort\nof meeting of the priests to discuss the Feast.

He’d been looking for a fire for the message; that’s what it was.\nAnd he hadn’t found any lanterns outside, because it was so near to Sun\nDay it was both light outside and still quite warm. Thus, the tavern.\nAnd now the note was gone. Argh! Teia’d failed again.\nDesperate now not to lose him, she was falling in behind Atevia when\nshe caught something out of the corner of her eye. It struck her as out of\nplace, for some reason.\nShe stopped. Looked.\nJust the tavern door opening. Swinging shut now, actually.\nNothing.\nShe turned back to Atevia, but then stopped. Nothing?\nWho’d stepped out of the tavern?\nShe scanned the busy street, but there was no one close.\nA chill shot down her back. Sinking backward, backward, she widened\nher eyes all the way to paryl.\nAnd saw it: the whisper of the color-filtering edge of a paryl bubble.

The\nShadow inside was invisible, and if she hadn’t looked in just the right place,\nshe wouldn’t have seen it.\nThe Shadow—was it Murder Sharp himself?—turned and moved the\nopposite way down the street.\nTeia was frozen between them. It might not be Sharp. There were other\nShadows. If she followed this person and it wasn’t Sharp—\nBut then she saw the shape dip toward an alley and pause. A moment\nlater, the paryl dropped and Murder Sharp appeared, settling his hood\naround his shoulders as if he were just another pedestrian emerging from\nthe alley. He continued on his way, heading away from Teia and Atevia.\nHe must have been in charge of delivering the notes to summon the\npriests and then making sure they destroyed them afterward. Only Murder\nSharp would be trusted with the priests’ identities.\nTeia’s heart thudded. This was her chance!\nBut already Atevia was disappearing around a corner, fifty paces away.\nSharp might be headed to the next priest, or he might be headed to the Old\nMan’s secret office, or he might be headed home for a nap or even out to a\ntavern for all Teia knew. If she ran, she could kill him before he knew she\nwas there and then… maybe Atevia would still be easy to find. Maybe he\nwasn’t on his way to the meeting right now.\nOr maybe this was a trap. How close must Teia have come to Murder\nSharp when he’d been planting the note? They might have brushed\nshoulders, only saved by the fact that neither had been actively drawing in\nmore paryl and that they both had to keep their gazes cast down most of the\ntime, only stealing glimpses of the world lest their eyes be seen floating in\nthe air.\nIf she’d gone into that tavern, she’d have surely bumped into him.\nLiterally.\nHoly shit.\nBut that didn’t matter now. Focus, Teia!\nMurder Sharp was the greatest danger to her by far… but Atevia was the\nkey to her mission. He might not go to the meeting right this moment, but if\nhe did, she would fail Karris, she’d fail every slave she’d murdered to get\nhere, and she’d fail every person those pagan priests tonight would order\nkilled in the future.\nBut letting Sharp go was like ignoring the loaded gun pointed at her\nhead.\nAm I a shield, or an assassin?\nTeia clenched her fists so hard her knuckles popped—then ran after\nAtevia.\nChapter 73\n“Clear the hall,” Andross said loudly, before anyone else could react. “This\nisn’t a matter for open court.”\n“Summon the Spectrum,” Karris said to Trainer Fisk—except he wasn’t\na trainer any longer; the man who’d once helped cheaters try to keep Kip\nout of the Blackguard was now wearing a commander’s band on his\nBlackguard blacks.\nCommander Fisk? The Chromeria really is in trouble.\nAlready giving hand signs to the Blackguards at the door too fast for Kip\nto follow, Fisk then said, “Same orders as before, regarding…” He looked\nat Kip. “Ahem.

The other young Lord Guile?”\n“Yes!” Andross said, though Commander Fisk had been speaking to\nKarris. “For God’s sake, don’t let him in here, not for any reason.”\nCommander Fisk shot a glance at Karris, but obeyed. Clearly, he\npreferred to get his orders from her, though he was technically under both\nthe promachos and the White.\nKip recognized two of the Blackguards as being from his own cohort,\nTana and a light-skinned Abornean named Rivvyn Shmuel, who was as\nbroad as his smile. They looked so, so young. The other two were so old\nthey’d obviously been called out of retirement. Both had pretended not to\nrecognize him, either from a misplaced sense that Blackguards shouldn’t\nacknowledge anyone—sometimes the young were overzealous—or they’d\nbelieved that he and the Mighty had abandoned the Blackguard, and were\nshunning him.\nTana and one of the old Blackguards went outside the door. That still left\nGrinwoody here, which irked Kip. He’d never liked the wizened old legalist\nfrom the first moments they’d met. And if Andross seemed healthier than\never, Grinwoody had sunk further in on himself, curling up in his age like a\ndead spider.\n“Tell me everything,” Andross ordered.\n“‘Us,’” Karris corrected.\nAndross rolled his eyes. “Well, no one’s thrown you out, daughter, so\nyou’re certainly permitted to listen in.”\nShe smiled pleasantly while her knuckles went white on the arm of her\nchair. “How have you been, Kip?” she asked. “You do look so well. Married\nlife appears to be agreeing with you.”\n“More than ‘agreeing.’ Tisis is an unalloyed blessing. The best thing in\nmy life.”\n“Oh, I’m so happy to hear that!” Karris said. And if she started a new\nconversation to irk Andross, now she seemed truly involved in it. “It is so\nhard to find the right partner in this life, and seeing that you’ve done so\nbrings me greater joy than you can know.”\n“Are you very much done?” Andross asked.\n“Indeed!” Kip said as if answering Andross, but then said, “… High\nLady White. And I’ve felt for some time now, grandfather, that I needed to\nthank you in person.”\n“What?” Andross asked.\n“I’d not have married Tisis if not for you. You proved your wisdom and\ninsight are beyond my comprehension. I was… quite dismissive of Tisis at\nfirst and would never have courted her. I wouldn’t have guessed what an\nideal partner and powerful ally she would be for me. You showed your\nsuperior insight and wisdom, and truly blessed me by arranging it.”\nAndross scowled, as if uncertain if Kip was mocking him or giving him\na real compliment—which he actually was. If you wanted to compliment\nAndross Guile, Kip guessed, you should do it early in a conversation,\nbefore he did something to infuriate you—which he surely would. “Why\nare you talking about this now? Is she pregnant yet?”"

Is she pregnant yet?”\n“No,” Kip said. And there it was. He was already mad.\n“Then lay off the camp followers and get to plowing your own field,\nboy. You need lessons? A long, fatherly talk?”\nThough he’d thought that his time in Blood Forest would have cured\nhim of any shyness, Kip felt himself flushing hot.\nGrinwoody spoke to Andross, none too quietly. “Perhaps the young lord\nsuffers from a malady of the intimate sort? Spilling his seed before he\nreaches the fields? Softness rather than steel in the plow? I could suggest a\nphysicker who might help.”\n“I’m sure you’re quite expert in maladies of the intimate sort, calun,”\nKip said to Grinwoody. “But I’ve been quite satisfied in those matters, as\nhas my wife, thank you.”\n“Faking, surely, but it’s good she wishes you to feel competent,”\nAndross said.\n“It’s your fault, you know,” Karris said.\n“Excuse me?” Andross asked.\n“Gavin told me all about your books of genealogy, how the family\nlooked at marriages like the horse breeders you all once were. He said it\nwas the trade-off your family had made for its huge drafting potential and\nmany other gifts—that your line had never had many children. And Felia\nhad what, one sister? with very happily married and active parents, too,\nGavin said.”\nAndross said, “Oh, I know the Guiles’ lack of fecundity well enough,\nthank you. It was the reason I was willing to make such deep compromises\nin the areas of talent, intelligence, strength, and charisma when I decided to\nmarry one of my sons to a White Oak. Along with their stubborn\nfoolishness, your family had a history of breeding like rabbits.\nUnfortunately, it seems the last trait in you was trumped by all the former\nones, as you wasted your childbearing years with your intransigence.”\nKarris was silenced, her mouth open.\nGrinwoody smirked triumphantly, lickspittle that he was.\n“But enough,” Andross said. “A wise man provides himself a quiver full\nof arrows, but the warrior who finds himself down to two defectives doesn’t\nsimply give up fighting, does he?”\n“‘Two defectives’?” Kip said, accidentally speaking out loud. Andross\nseemed glad to have landed a blow. But Kip continued, “Two? So Zymun’s\nfinally been showing you his true colors, huh? Has he been raping the\nservants?”\nHe saw the sickened, guilty look on Karris’s face and the flash of anger\non Andross’s.\n“More than one, then?” Kip asked. As if Kip hadn’t warned them Zymun\nwas a serpent.\nShit! He shouldn’t have asked about Zymun. It was enough for him to\nknow that they knew something was deeply wrong with his half brother.

Once he did, he wanted to confront the man in\nfront of them about it. But that time would come. Soon.\n“To the matter at hand,” Andross suggested.\nFor once, they were all quite willing to agree.\n“What is this weapon you claim to have?” Andross asked.\n“You haven’t figured it out yet, grandfather?” Kip asked as if it were\neasy. “How to counter the bane?”\n“I have many ideas. The question is what your single one is. And\nwhether it’s right.”\n“Our forebears knew about the bane, and they knew far more than we\ndo,” Kip started. “Yet another thing the Chromeria has hidden that\nendangers us all.”\n“They couldn’t have imagined the nine kingdoms of old united,” Karris\nsaid. “They surely couldn’t have imagined fighting more than one bane at a\ntime.”\n“Nonetheless,” Kip said. “The ancients didn’t leave us defenseless. The\ndefenses are all around us.”\n“I’m not in the mood for games,” Andross said.\n“The Thousand Stars and the Tower Mirrors,” Kip said. “They weren’t\nintended to be expensive amusements or symbols of Orholam’s kindness or\neven complicated instruments for executions—though they are all those\nthings, too. They’re weapons. They were made to fight the old gods.”\nKarris believed it instantly. Kip could see her faith on her face, as if\neverything was finally coming together, here at the end of things, perfectly\nin time. Andross looked like he was having to do far more work, fitting this\npotential revelation into an intricate rubric of what he already knew and all\nthe terms and conditions this revelation would have to fulfill to be true. But\nhis initial read seemed cautiously positive.\n“How?” Andross asked. “How exactly?”\nKip swallowed. “I don’t know exactly. That we have to fight six or seven\nbane rather than one like ancients would’ve prepared for? I think that’s why\nwe need someone who can juggle more things at the same time than anyone\nelse. Someone with immense power, and someone with an implacable will,\nable to roll back the very stone of history careening down a hill to crush this\nempire.”\n“Someone really special, huh?” Andross said.\n“You probably want to know about the threat, and how I’m sure of it,”\nKip said.\nAndross looked like he wanted to nail Kip up on that ‘someone’ remark,\nbut he let it go for the moment. So Kip gave them a summary of what had\nhappened since they’d last had messages from each other.\nIt turned out that though both had sent numerous letters, few had gotten\nthrough, so repetition was necessary. Naturally, he skipped things that he\ndidn’t think they had any need to know. He was sure they were doing the\nsame to him. And certain questions couldn’t be asked, such as if Karris had\nheard anything from Teia. Kip had hoped she’d be on Blackguard duty\nwhen he came in. He’d have to wander by the barracks on his way out.\nWhen he got to his account of the naval battle, Andross went purple with\nrage."

Instead, it was with Caul Azmith. He looked,\nbriefly, like he was going to blame Karris for it.\nShe said quietly, “I was able to bust him down to captain of a single\nship. It was as big a step down as I could manage without your political\nbacking. Which I didn’t seem to have at the time. Maybe we should\nremember who made him a general in the first place?”\nKip could see the answer by the pinched look on Andross’s face.\n“If he manages to survive this battle,” Andross said, “and his sort always\ndo, somehow—a death will have to be arranged. Make a note of it,\nGrinwoody. And notify me the next time any of his relations are up for any\ntype of office anywhere. That family needs to end.”\n“Not that I have any love for the Azmiths, but if we’re gonna make a\nwhole family pay when one of its members causes a few thousand deaths,\nthe Guiles are in a whole lot of trouble,” Kip said.\nAndross’s eyes flashed. “Didn’t you come here to beg some favor of\nme? Reconsider your attitude, boy.”\n“Look, old man!” Cruxer burst out, from nowhere. “Kip left a throne to\ncome here to save you. Wealth, position, security? He gave those up out of\nloyalty to the Chromeria—and even to you. You sent no help to us when we\nwere dying for the Seven Satrapies, and yet here he is. Because he’s a\nhundred times the man you are. So if anyone ought to check his attitude, it’s\nyou.”\nEveryone was stunned to silence.\nKip was reminded that Cruxer naturally deferred to authority, but this\nwas also the young man who’d broken Aram’s knee out of the blue when he\nsaw authority endorsing injustice.\nAndross waved to the Blackguards at the door. “Remove this failed\nBlackguard trainee. I can’t abide mediocrity.”\nCruxer didn’t even look to Kip to countermand the order. He strode\ntoward the door.\n“Oh, Grinwoody,” Andross said, projecting his voice so that Cruxer was\nsure to hear him, “check if Inana ux Holdfast is still getting a pension for\nher time in the Blackguard. And cancel it. Check to see if perhaps she’s\nbeen overpaid for years and owes a ruinously large debt.”\nThat was Cruxer’s mother.\nThe young commander of the Mighty flinched as if struck, but he didn’t\nturn.\nHe walked out.\nAndross looked at Kip to see how he’d react.\n“You’re speaking,” Kip said icily, “as if you’ll be giving out pensions or\ncollecting debts next week, much less next year.”\n“Make your demands,” Andross said as if bored. Kip knew it was a put-\non.\n“I need to figure out the mirror array. So I need unfettered access to it,\nimmediately.”\n“You haven’t figured them out yet?”\nKip had already answered that. “I will,” Kip said."

I’ll grant you this, you have\ngrown into the Guile arrogance.”\n“It’s not arrogance,” Karris interjected. Her eyes were thoughtful. “Is it,\nKip?”\n“I don’t claim to be free of it,” Kip said. “But I don’t think this is that.”\n“What is it, then? You think you can undercut your brother at the last\nmoment?” Andross asked.\n“Half brother,” Kip said. “And no. It’s not pride. It’s purpose.” Kip\nturned his hands up, as if offering himself.\nHis grandfather’s eyes flicked to Kip’s left wrist momentarily, and\nnarrowed, and Kip saw him sink in thought. For a moment, Kip couldn’t\nhelp but think, I just told you there’s an invasion imminent. Shouldn’t you\nbe issuing some orders?\nBut Andross had shown himself quite willing to jump, once he decided\nwhich way. These few moments now, in his estimation, were worth the\ndelay.\n“Send a runner to Carver Black,” Andross said to Grinwoody. “I want to\nmeet him here before the Spectrum meeting.”\nGrinwoody bobbed and headed out.\nAndross turned to Kip. “You would bring light against the bane. You\nwould save the Jaspers and the empire. And it has to be you. Special,\nspecial you.”\n“Special in that I’m the only full-spectrum polychrome we’ve got who\ncan do it.”\n“Nonsense. We’ve got plenty of full-spectrum polychromes.”\n“Plenty?” Karris asked. “Half a dozen? Ten, if some have come for Sun\nDay?”\n“The time for the Chromeria to ignore things they don’t like is over,”\nKip said. “High Lord Promachos, I’ve got a genius for drafting a lot of\ndifferent colors not only serially but simultaneously. And I’m almost as\nWill-full as you are. I’m a Guile, and there’s no one better equipped for\nthis.”\n“Are you the Lightbringer?” Andross asked quietly.\nIt seemed as if history itself pulled sharply at the air through clenched\nteeth. No one moved.\nKip knew what he needed to say.\nVoice firm, level: “I am.”\nAnd everyone breathed differently. The course was set. They were\ncommitted. Whether Andross was going to imprison or kill them for\nblasphemy, or if he’d fall in line behind them, was out of their hands now.\n“The most important man in history,” Andross said quietly. “Standing\nbefore me. My own… grandson.” His tone was impossible to read.\nMockery? Thoughtfulness?\nBut Kip thought he felt a current of grief in Andross’s voice, as if he\nweren’t mocking Kip but marveling at how the universe was mocking him."

Even if I look like the big hero for a\nmoment, you’ll be the most important man in the room again the very next\nday.”\nKip could feel the Mighty looking at him. He hadn’t talked about that\npart with them.\n“You think that’s what I care about?” Andross asked.\n“Yes,” Kip said instantly.\nWinsen snorted.\nDammit, Win.\n“We should make him Prism,” Karris said. “It solves three problems for\nus at once.”\n“Three?” Andross asked. “What’s the third?”\n“Kip dying? Getting killed by all the luxin he drafts?” Karris asked.\n“Funny, that sounded more like a solution to me,” Andross said. He\nseemed to have sunk into a dark place where no one could follow.\nKip wasn’t sure which problems Karris was talking about. That only a\nPrism was supposed to use the array atop the Prism’s Tower was one.\nKarris said, “Zymun will be furious if you let Kip impinge on what he\nbelieves to be his rights as Prism-elect, even if he isn’t Prism yet. And we\nneed to talk about that issue anyway. Our time is running out.”\nAh, that was the second problem solved by naming Kip Prism first. Sort\nof. Zymun would still be furious, of course, just not in a position to do\nanything about it.\n“It’s impossible,” Andross said.\n“Displacing Zymun?” Karris asked.\n“Making Kip Prism.” As if those weren’t the same thing for some\nreason.\n“Why?” Karris asked.\n“Literally impossible,” Andross said.\n“Oh, right. Shit,” Karris said. Then she blanched and held her head in\nboth hands and swore again.\n“So… you figured it out,” Andross said, not even turning to look at her.\n“Finally.”\nFigured what out? Kip thought.\n“I wondered if you had,” Andross said. “What with your little holy cadre\nof faithful young luxiats. Have you told them yet? Or was it they who told\nyou?”\nKip wanted desperately to know what they were talking about, but he\nknew his best chance to find out was to keep his mouth shut.\nAndross seemed amused that she didn’t answer. “You’re one of only two\non the Spectrum who know now.”\n“You’ve been weeding out everyone else,” Karris said. “Why?”\n“Then you haven’t figured it all out, after all. You might want to look\ninto your beloved Orea Pullawr’s legacy more closely. The old White\nwasn’t quite so blameless as you’ve liked to believe. Her husband even less\nso.”\n“Really?

So much to do.” Dismissive asshole.

Your leave?”\nAndross waved him to go, then stabbed a finger at Kip. “What’s that?”\n“What’s what?” Kip asked.\n“On your arm. Is that a tattoo?” Andross asked.\nHe meant the Turtle-Bear on Kip’s left wrist with its freshly bright luxin\nlines in every color. Kip had been drafting a lot recently. He hadn’t even\nthought to cover it up.\n“We can talk about that later,” Kip said. “If I get around to it. So much\nto do. There’s a war coming? Maybe we should talk about that?”\n“The adults will talk about that when Carver Black arrives,” Andross\nsaid. “You know the Chromeria absolutely forbids tattoos.”\n“I know. I don’t care.” It was an old and remarkably stupid prohibition.\nDuring an early and contentious era before colored lenses were widely\navailable, some lighter-skinned drafters had tattooed blocks of their drafting\ncolor on their arms to give themselves an ever-present color source. In a\npartisan power play, the dominant Parians, whose darker skin made color\ntattoos less helpful to them, had pushed through a prohibition on all tattoos\nto solidify their perennial hold on the Blackguard. What would happen to\ntheir dominance if lighter-skinned warriors could negate the advantages of\ndark skin and gain ever-present color sources simply by getting tattoos?\n“You can’t afford to thumb your nose at the Spectrum when you come\nbegging favors. We’ll talk more about that thing on your forearm, but for\nthe moment, how about putting on something with sleeves?”\n“Of course,” Kip said. And in moments, he was pulling on Ferkudi’s\ncoat.\nAndross studied him all the while. Then he pursed his lips. “Yes.”\nYes? Oh, to the mirror array. He was granting permission. Thank\nOrholam.\nA secretary produced a quill, parchment, and Andross’s promachos seal.\nAndross wrote a brief note himself. As the secretary made copies, Andross\ndrew up another writ granting Kip provisions and shelter for his forces.\n“I’ve more defenders coming,” Kip said, taking the parchments.\n“They’ll need accommodation and supplies, too. We traveled at greatest\npossible speed.”\n“We’ll take care of your people,” Karris promised. She walked with him\nto the door as a sweating Carver Black came in.

If you’ll be on the Prism’s array in\nsome manner during the battle, then there’s a question of the disposition of\nyour forces. You won’t be able to lead them personally. We’ll need to\nintegrate them with our forces.”\n“Yeah,” Kip said. “It’s not a problem I’ve got a great solution for yet.”\nThis was not a kind of fighting his people had trained for, nor was an\neffective defense a simple matter of putting warm bodies into the correct\nplaces.\n“Then I wonder if you’d be willing to consider my solution,” Karris\nsaid. “A general who I’d hoped would lead our invasion of Blood Forest is\njust arriving. If I get my way, he’ll head up our defenses.”\nYeah, hell no, I’m not handing my people over to anyone, Kip managed\nto not say aloud.\n“Forgive me for speaking bluntly,” he said instead, “but I’m afraid I’ve\nhad my fill of the Chromeria’s idea of effective military leadership.”\nShe winced, accepting the justice of that, but then asked slyly, “Would it\nchange anything if I told you the general I have in mind is Corvan\nDanavis?”\nChapter 74\nWith her heart in her throat, Teia shadowed the merchant through the\npilgrim-clogged streets.\nUnless she misjudged, the leaders of the Order of the Broken Eye would\nmeet tonight, within hours. It would be Teia’s last chance to fulfill her\nmission.\nThrough Quentin, Karris had left Teia a single question: ‘If I give you\nanything and everything at my disposal, can we stamp out the Order of the\nBroken Eye within the next two days?’ Teia was to leave a marker to get her\nyes or no to the White immediately.\nAll of Teia’s hunting and killing had led her to this street, tracking\nAtevia, and Atevia would lead her to the Old Man. The Old Man would\neither be carrying his papers or he would have to check them after this\nmeeting, so he would surely head to his secret office.\nTeia might be able to kill the Old Man of the Desert today, with the\nentire Order to follow as soon as Karris could mop them up.\nWhen Atevia’s steps took him to the Embassies District, Teia’s chest\ntightened further. It didn’t seem that a heretic would head toward the\nChromeria and the attendant higher density of luxiats and spies of all kinds,\nnot for an important meeting.\nThen he turned in to the Crossroads, the former Tyrean embassy that had\nbeen converted into the city’s finest restaurant and kopi house.

Excellent food and drink, a fine and discreet brothel downstairs,\nsuperviolet bubbles for privacy upon request, private meeting rooms for\nhire, and dozens of egress routes all made it a haven for spies and those\nneeding to meet with or even recruit them. There were so many legitimate\nreasons to enjoy the Crossroads, the illegitimate ones could hide in plain\nsight.\nBut all the things that made it a great place to meet clandestinely (as so\nmany did) seemed to Teia to also make it the worst place to meet\nclandestinely: because so many did. Everyone was watching to see who\neveryone else was meeting with.\nA certain kind of spy might enjoy hiding in plain sight, but Teia couldn’t\nbelieve that the leadership of the Order of the Broken Eye would be so\nbrazen.

Atevia was wine merchant to the nobility. The Crossroads\nwould be a major account, or had the potential to be one, Teia supposed.\nAtevia was here for his actual business. Maintaining contacts with a huge\nnumber of important people was simply part of his job.\nAs Atevia seemed to be concluding his work with the manager, Teia slid\ncloser.\nThe manager slipped out from their table and said, “Oh, there are some\nbarrels in the cellar that I’m afraid have gone bad. Could you check on\nthose for me?”\nAtevia grinned and said, “Well… if you insist.”\n“Oh, I do,” the manager said, winking. “There’s a new, ahem, barrel I\nthink you really need to sample.”\nTeia actually thought they were still talking about work until Atevia\nreached a hand down to adjust himself on the stairs.\nOh, gods, she really was naïve. Conspiratorial winks? The new barrel\nAtevia needed to sample… in the basement, which happened to be a\nbrothel?\nDammit, T, how naïve can you be?\nTeia had given up her chance to kill Murder Sharp—not to do anything\nproductive, not to save anyone, but to wait around while Atevia emptied his\ncoin purse before his big meeting tonight.\nSuddenly, a bubbling cauldron of bile in her boiled and spilled over,\nhissing and spitting as it hit the flames of Teia’s frustration and\ndisappointment.\nShe wanted to wreck this man. She wanted to ruin him. She was going\nto follow him to his whore. She’d experiment on him: see if she could make\nhim go limp, then back off, let him get aroused again, then make him go\nlimp again. Hell, maybe she could figure out how to trigger his climax"

That might be handy, too, not least for\nTeia to protect herself in the future—assuming she had one. And such\npractice wasn’t exactly possible on terrified slaves, who don’t tend to spend\nmuch time aroused.\nAs she followed Atevia into the Crossroad’s basement, she knew she\nwas acting out of all proportion.\nShe barely knew this man. Why did she hate him so particularly? Why\ndid she want to punish this one so much?\nSomething about him grated her. So he was stupid, lustful, deceitful,\nsmall. Murder Sharp was worse—a hundred times worse—and she didn’t\nhate him, not exactly. She feared Sharp. Hated how vulnerable he made her\nfeel, tried to convince herself she could stop him from making her feel that\nway again, but she didn’t despise him.\nA beautiful hostess in a white silk chemise that barely hung past her\npudenda greeted Atevia at the base of the stairs. She clearly recognized him.\nThe hostess’s dark kinked hair was a perfect halo around her head, and\nwhen she walked, leading Atevia to a room, she stepped as if walking on a\nrope, her hips swaying with each deliberate step.\nAtevia didn’t look anywhere else.\nThe woman glanced back over her shoulder, saw his appreciation, and\nsmiled beatifically. She was either a very good mummer or she actually\nenjoyed her work.\nAmazing how we deceive ourselves, and tell ourselves we do good, Teia\nthought.\nAnd then she was struck with the thought that maybe she wasn’t exempt\nfrom that ‘we.’ This woman helped men cheat on their wives; Teia\nmurdered people. She couldn’t really look down on her. The woman was\nmost likely a slave herself, making the best of a bad life she hadn’t asked\nfor.\nTeia was the last person who should be judging her, but Teia’s hatred\nwas like a flame right now, lashing about, looking for fuel to feed on\nwherever it could.\nShe tried to hold off that fire, push it toward some barren, analytical\nplace.\nWhy did she hate this man who seemed beguiled by the lowest of sins,\nlust? A mere sin of the body, of weakness. It was common, trivial.\nYet entangling. Teia’s own mother had—\nIt hit Teia in the face.\nAtevia Zelorn was the very image of Teia’s mother. Blinded by lust,\nchoosing to disregard the suffering of those who loved them, Atevia was\nselling out his family, while Teia’s mother had literally sold her family.\nTeia’s father had tried to give mother all the better things in life she said she\nneeded, and had traveled farther and farther abroad to get them for her—\nwhich had only given her more opportunity to cheat on him.\nTeia was going to destroy Atevia Zelorn for his treachery, but his treason\nto the Chromeria seemed paltry to her compared to how he’d betrayed his\nfamily.

For orgasms with strangers?\nTeia hadn’t had one yet, but to her it looked like the pleasure was\nsomething better than a good drunk but less intense than a poppy high. That\ncouldn’t be enough to destroy yourself over, could it?\nBut that wasn’t all there was to cheating, was there? Her mother had\nseemed as eager for the sops to her vanity as she was for the lovemaking\nitself.\nWhat did Atevia Zelorn gain for his treachery? Money? He had money.\nIf he had more, what would he use it for? More visits to brothels? Chasing\nwhores’ feigned care when he had a woman who loved him back home?\nTeia was going to wreck him, and when she killed him, she’d do it so the\nfamily wasn’t humiliated, so they didn’t have to pay for his sins. But he was\ngoing to pay—as her own mother had never had to.\nThe room had an antechamber, and the hostess held open the door but\nwent no farther.\nTeia slipped inside behind Atevia.\nHe closed the door behind him, locked it, and opened a side bureau. A\ncurtain separated this antechamber from the rest of the room. As Atevia\nbegan undressing—no thanks—Teia streamed paryl at the curtain.\nIt was impenetrable to her gaze, filled with some metal. Huh?\nShe heard a door far on the other side of the curtain close and then a\nlock being slid home. What was this?\nShe turned and saw Atevia pulling on white robes. He draped a chain-\nmail veil over his face.\nTeia’s heart almost stopped. The veil. This wasn’t a visit to a prostitute.\nThis was the meeting.\nEverything before this was pretense: the cellar barrel tasting was a\npretense for a visit to a prostitute, which was the pretense for this.\nUnfortunately, after he was dressed, Atevia stepped through the curtain\nwithout holding it open far enough for Teia to come in, too. He closed it\ncarefully behind himself, shutting Teia out.\nShe could hear the men’s voices clearly enough, but they exchanged\ngreetings in some language Teia didn’t understand, that she didn’t even\nrecognize.\nOrholam have mercy, was the Order so good at keeping secrets that the\nleaders only spoke Braxian?\nBut apparently not all the men (three men? four?) were equally adept\nwith the tongue. While a tenor gave his report fluently, he had to stop\nseveral times to clarify words for one of the others. “Yes, the bane,” the\ntenor said. “All of them, if he is to be believed.” Then he went back into\nBraxian. Then later, at a cough from the same man, who was confused\nagain, the tenor said, “C’mon, bawaba, you have to know the word. We use\nit in our own ceremonies!”\n“I just didn’t hear you,” the man complained. His voice seemed oddly\nfamiliar.\nTeia wondered if Quentin knew Braxian. Or could learn it quickly.

There were two books in Quentin’s\nworld: The Book of Everything Quentin Knows, and The Book of\nEverything Quentin Will Surely Know Soon.\nBut what was she going to do? Magic him into the room? Write down\neverything they said phonetically?\nGood luck with that, T.\nThen Atevia gave his own report. He was fluent, damn him.\nWhen the slow one asked him to translate a word, Atevia did so by using\nother Braxian vocabulary, which was apparently helpful enough for the\nother man—though not for Teia.\nYet another man spoke, and Teia heard the rumble of the voice distorter.\nGiven how the others deferred to him, she guessed that could only be the\nOld Man of the Desert himself. He spoke the longest, with frequent\nquestions for and from all of them, but Teia understood none of it except\none instance of the word ‘black powder’ in a sentence otherwise\nunintelligible.\nApparently old Braxian had no word for that.\nWonderful.\nFragmentary as it was, she’d heard ‘black powder,’ ‘bane,’ and ‘gates.’\nThat, and the instructions that the faithful prepare themselves and bring\ntheir weapons.\nWhen wasn’t clear. To the Feast? After the Feast? Halfcock had said\nthey had a plan, but what was it?\nShe’d been assuming the entire reason for the meeting was all last-\nsecond preparations for the Feast tomorrow night.\nThe least fluent one began his report. He had a nasal baritone, and he\nquickly gave up. “I’m sorry, I’m working on it, but by the Diakoptês,\nhaving to puzzle out how to actually speak Braxian from old scrolls? And\nit’s not like I have any chances to practice with anyone. I can’t—”\n“Enough, proceed,” the Old Man said.\nTeia could hardly pay attention to him, though. From the lack of tension\nand the lapsing out of Braxian, it was clear that the more sensitive part of\nthe meeting was finished. From here, she could tail one of the others, and\nfrom learning his identity, eventually reveal one additional congregation\nfrom that one additional priest. But if she were lucky, she could follow the\nOld Man of the Desert himself.\n“There’s a problem with the, the abad el shams. Shit, that’s not right…\nthe poppies. We have none.” Oh, that was it! This priest had sounded\nfamiliar. He was the one with the haze smoker’s harsh voice who’d ordered\nTeia to strip when they’d initiated her into the Order.\nThat bastard.\n“Ezay deh?” the Old Man demanded.\n“The Chromeria’s been buying them up for medical supplies. One of our\nregular sources admitted that he’d guessed we wouldn’t pay him as much as\nthe Chromeria would, and he was too afraid to try to charge us more, so he\nsold all he had to them. He is willing to procure toad caps for us, though.”\n“Those taste positively foul. I can’t bring a wine strong enough to cover\nthe taste! Even with incense and spices,” Atevia said, lapsing out of the\nBraxian as well."

Or with enough honey…”\nThe Old Man sighed. “I’ll arrange for enough poppy to be accidentally\nreleased from the Chromeria’s stores. Which of you will pick it up? Murder\nSharp maak yakhod balo menak.”\nMurder Sharp what? What the hell was that?\n“I can get it,” Atevia said glumly. “Directions?”\nThose, naturally, were all given in Braxian.\nTeia wondered what would happen if she tried to kill these men here and\nnow. Orholam, if she’d been thinking, she could have brought a grenado\npacked with shrapnel. With her skills and her cloak, though, what were her\nchances of killing them all if she went into that room now?\nIf she attacked though, even if she killed them all, she wouldn’t get the\nlist of all the members—and she needed that list. Without it, the Order\ncould start right back up again. And she wouldn’t find out where they had\nher father.\nSo she had to follow the Old Man. He was the center of everything.\nFollow him, identify him, wait until he went to his secret office. Then Teia\ncould kill him and be certain the Order would implode.\nShe was close now, close to success for the first time. Close to saving\nher father.\nThey’d all entered the room from different directions, so it made sense\nthey would leave different ways, too. And all cloaked and hooded, no doubt.\nShe thought she’d gleaned as much as she could from eavesdropping—they\nwere just talking about who was going to bring the drugs and alcohol to the\nparty now, and not even in Braxian. Now she concentrated on getting the\npositioning of each of the priests within the room to try to give herself the\nbest chance of following the correct one when they all left.\nShe was going to have to make a guess on which one to tail. The Old\nMan of the Desert had his paryl spectacles.\nTeia would have to be masterful.\nShe guessed that the men would at least leave the room by the same\nways they’d entered, in order to change back into their street clothes. That\nmeant being in this room was useless to her. She already knew where\nAtevia lived.\nIt was time for Teia to gamble with her life yet again.\nInvisible, she put an ear to the outer door. She couldn’t hear anything.\nPricey brothel, give it that—thick walls so you didn’t hear what your\nneighbors were doing. More importantly, she supposed, they didn’t hear\nyou. She was going to have to risk it.\nShe eased the door open far enough to peek, saw the hostess leading a\nwoman down the hall. Teia closed the door quietly. She extended paryl\nbelow the door and across the hall and waited. When she felt someone\nbreak the tendrils, she waited another couple of heartbeats and then eased\nthe door open."

The hostess was five paces farther down, showing\nthe woman to a room.\nThe halls were a rabbit’s warren—much larger than she would have\nguessed from above. Within a minute or so, though, Teia had scoped out\nseveral entrances to a larger chamber, where the Order’s high priests were\nmeeting, and a few nooks in which she might hide without using paryl.\nNone too soon, either. She was standing at an intersection when a door\nopened on each side. Identical cloaked figures stepped out simultaneously.\nShe was on the opposite side from where Atevia had entered, so neither of\nthese men were him. She had only two choices, and the Old Man of the\nDesert might not have been either of these men.\nIt was the flip of a coin.\nThis is on You, Orholam. If You want me—\nThe man to her left bobbed his head as he turned his back toward her\nand raised a finger toward his face as if pushing up a pair of spectacles.\nSpectacles? Like the paryl spectacles the Old Man had?\nNow the question was how far they worked. Teia could see paryl about\nthirty or forty paces out in sunlight, maybe twice that far in the dark. Were\nthe spectacles that good? What if they were better?\nShe followed at a safe distance, thought she lost him when she was\noverly cautious coming out of the Crossroads, but identified him again by\nhis gait—she hoped. The master cloak gave her a huge advantage, though,\neven when she didn’t use it for invisibility. She started with it as a worn\ndeep-blue cloak, folded it down on her shoulders and changed it to a green-\nand-black check pattern, and bound a scarf around her head quickly before\nshe came up the stairs out of the basement, and then went with a muted\nbrown to go with a wide-brimmed petasos she stole from a merchant’s stall\nbefore she got to the Lily’s Stem.\nShe had to hurry when he got to the Chromeria, but she lost him in the\ngreat hall. She caught a glimpse of a man who might be him, wearing a\nslave’s garb and entering the servants’ stairs.\nTeia hesitated.\nThis was where things got even more dangerous. If he were aware of her\nat all, this would be where he sprang his trap. If she went invisibly, the Old\nMan might notice her paryl. If she went visibly, any Chromeria slave or\nservant might stop her coming up their stairs—she wasn’t dressed as a\nslave, and sightseers and supplicants for the White often tried to jump the\nlines by doing that.\nThe last options were for Teia to go as a slave and possibly be\nrecognized, or go as a Blackguard and definitely be recognized.\nWould the staff know that a certain Blackguard was missing? What\nwould Teia do if a Blackguard came down the stairs? The Blackguards\noften used the stairs for convenience or speed. After all, technically, they,\ntoo, were slaves.\nCursing inwardly at the stupidity of it all—Teia should be the one secure"

After all, technically, they,\ntoo, were slaves.\nCursing inwardly at the stupidity of it all—Teia should be the one secure\nhere, and the Old Man afraid, not the other way around!—Teia wrapped\nherself in a paryl cloud and darted into the door. She was exhausted from all\nher drafting, and from the tension, but she couldn’t give up now.\nHer boiled-rubber-soled shoes were nearly silent as she jogged up the\nsteps.\nDoors opened and doors closed, casting echoes down the great spiraling\nstairs where Kip and the Mighty had nearly died fighting last year. Too\nmany openings and closings. The stairs were sometimes empty for several\nminutes, and at other times they were as busy as at the Lily’s Stem. To her\nhorror, now seemed like one of the latter times.\nTeia poked her head out the first door she thought she might have heard,\nknowing it might be met with a sword.\nBut there was nothing.\nShe ran up another floor, threw the door open. A young slave woman\nsetting down a clean bucket of water by her mop looked up, and seemed\ncurious that she didn’t see anyone there.\nNext floor, nothing… nothing… nothing.\nHe was here. The Old Man was here in the Prism’s Tower. He was close.\nBut Teia hadn’t found him in time. She’d hesitated too long, been too\ncareful.\nThis had been her last chance to root out the Order of the Broken Eye\nwithout getting her friends killed. It had been her last chance to save her\nfather.\nTeia’s last hope fizzled, sputtered, and went out.\nShe made her way woodenly to the dead drop and left her sign for\nKarris: Can we stamp out the Order? ‘No.’\nTeia had failed.\nChapter 75\n“In two or three days now,” Karris said to her gathered luxiats, “all the\nwork we’ve done will be tested. The King of Wights—the man who once\nwas my brother—is coming. He will attack. And if he has his way, he will\nnot stop until this island is nothing but blackened rubble and blood.”\nIn the dangers and the heavy labor she’d demanded, her originally\npicked one hundred had first dwindled down to sixty-five luxiats, and then\nsurged to nearly two hundred. Some were surely spies, but what did she\ncare, so long as they helped her work?\nShe’d even said so, openly. She’d come to revel in the power of the\ntruth.\n“In our time together,” she said, “you’ve served better than I could’ve\nasked. You’ve brought new purpose to the people of the Jaspers, and lent\nyour muscles and your voices to our empire’s defense and to Orholam’s\ncause.”\nShe could see in their faces that they felt uneasy at her praise, and at the\ntiming. Midnight, for one of their meetings? They’d been careful about\nwhen they met, before, but not exactly clandestine.\nThis felt different. There was an urgency here.\n“You think this sounds like a farewell,” she said bluntly. “It may be. Too\noften, this empire has fought senseless wars over who would get to wear the\npurple.

Looking back, we can have clear\nhearts about the work we’ve done: the defenses repaired, the stores refilled,\nthe people inspired. Looking ahead, my charge to you is simple.\n“Serve where there is need. Carry water to the thirsty. Carry the\nwounded to help. Comfort the dying. Carry gunpowder and shot. If you feel\ncalled, take up arms. But let me now be clear. I am not asking you to live\nfor this people. I’m asking you to die for them. I’m not asking you to die as\nmartyrs—have some humility and leave that for your betters.” She grinned,\nand they laughed at her inversion: too humble for martyrdom? But then she\ngrew serious. “I’m asking you to die as heroes. A martyr surrenders her life\nwillingly; a hero fights to the end. Fight to the end.”\nShe paused, and saw in the somber faces not fear but resolve.\n“Know that I’m not asking you to go where I’m unwilling to lead. For\nsome time I have had the growing sense that I shall die during this fight\nmyself.” A sense? Well, it had been only that—until she’d seen Teia’s\nsignal. Now it was a full-fledged premonition. The Order couldn’t be\nstopped. All of Karris’s grand purposes were being stymied.\nA quiet chorus of denials went through the assembled young women and\nmen, though, and their faces were writ with dismay.\n“I’m not telling you that to elicit your pity or, Orholam forbid, your awe.\nI tell you because the knowledge of my own mortality has brought a\nquestion before me in a way I can’t help but answer. It’s a question I want\nto present humbly to you as well. Pray on it, and then act on your answer.\nLook to me to do the same.” She took a moment to look at their faces. So\nyoung. So full of light and courage it broke her heart. “You and I have been\ncalled to serve. If the next days are our last, how dare we waste them in\nfear?”\nShe saw swallowing, and heads nodding. Many of those gathered were\nthe bookish sort, not men or women who were quick to act. “Run the course\nOrholam lays before you. I know you’ll make me proud.”\nThere was no cheering at that. The weight of the moment had settled\nover all of them, her not least of all.\nIt was as honest as she could be without someone trying to stop her from\ndoing what she knew she had to do. She’d made her peace with it.\nWhen Ironfist demanded her hand as the price for his armies, there was\nno way to say no and still get those armies.

I won’t be without error, she’d promised, but when I\ndo err, I’ll pay the price for it.\nIn committing bigamy, she would save her people by dishonoring the\ntwo men who meant the most in the world to her. In deliberately breaking\nher oaths, she would dishonor her office and undermine every other oath\nshe’d made. She would undermine everything she’d been trying to\naccomplish in the Magisterium.\nThere was no way out of her impending marriage that wouldn’t cost\nlives and honor. So she would buy the armies with her own dishonor, and\nthen her own life. She would go out and fight Koios, seeking death. And if\ndeath eluded her, she would suicide. Not out of despair, but to expiate\ndishonor. It wasn’t death before dishonor. It would be death in order to\nmake dishonor end.\nIt wasn’t what she’d hoped for. It wasn’t what she wanted. But she was\nwilling.\nNo one seemed to want to leave, but finally, one awkward young man\ncame forward. “High Lady,” he said quietly. “This time I’ve spent serving\nwith you has been the best thing in my life. This is why I wanted to be a\nluxiat. I have a premonition that I’m gonna die in this battle. Will you bless\nme?”\nHe knelt in front of her.\nAnd so she blessed him. And then the next young luxiat. And then she\nblessed each and every one of them in turn, with an encouraging word here\nand there, but sometimes only a long, weighing look into their eyes, as she\nhoped she showed them Orholam’s approval reflected in her own.\nLast came Quentin in his silks and cumbersome gold chains. He didn’t\nkneel as the others had; he merely waited, as any other slave would—at\nleast until everyone else had left.\n“You’re planning to do something rash, aren’t you?” he asked.\n“Not rash, no. I’ve thought about it for quite some time.”\n“All this talk of dying…” Quentin shook his head. “Would you like to\ntell me more about that?”\n“No,” she said, and tried to soften the rebuff with a smile. But it came\nout sad.\nQuentin cocked his head. “You told me once that you’d had a word from\nOrholam, through Orea White and the Third Eye? That He would repay you\nthe years the locusts have eaten?”\n“Yes,” she said. Her lip twitched ruefully.\n“You believed it once. Do you not anymore?”\n“No. I believe it,” she said. “But I don’t know that I’ll get to see it.”\n“How is that kind of belief different from not believing?” Quentin asked.\n“We go to battle, Quentin. People better than me die every day,” she\nsaid.\n“People who don’t have His promise.”\n“I’m a warrior. I don’t shy away at the face of death. This is why I was\nentrusted with this office. To fight.

No, that wasn’t true; it had come straight from red and green.\nQuentin said, “How may one adopted by Orholam Himself be truly\ncalled an orphan?”\nI found my father with half his brain dripping from the ceiling, that’s\nhow.\nSure. In some abstract, theological sense, Orholam was her father. But\nthen, He was everyone’s.\n“And you’ve been drafting again,” Quentin said. “Are you trying to be a\nhero, or a martyr?”\nBut she only said, “Maybe when you’re older, you’ll understand.”\n“That’s a bit patronizing,” Quentin said.\n“‘Patronizing’ is having a child lecture me,” she said.\n“Not merely a child, a slave no less,” Quentin said, lowering his gaze. “I\nstepped out of line, High Lady. I beg your pardon.”\n“Of course.” But the red was still hot in her.\nHe knelt. “High Lady Guile, will you bless me?”\nIf she had only days left, how did she want to live? How much of a\nhypocrite was she to inspire the luxiats to live generously, obediently,\nselflessly—and then hold back now?

She stepped back from the door,\nwhere she’d just accepted a messenger’s note.\nThey were staying in a fine house on the northern end of Big Jasper—as\nfar from the Chromeria as possible. Kip wanted warning if Lightguards\ncame to arrest him, and Cruxer didn’t want to make it too easy for assassins\nfrom the Order to find him, either, so they were staying in a smaller\nbedroom in a house with many doors, with sub-red drafters stationed\neverywhere. Cruxer was also insisting they take different routes every time\nthey traversed the Jaspers, and a dozen other precautions. Kip played along,\nthough he thought if anyone wanted him dead badly enough, they could\nprobably accomplish the deed.\n“What’s that?” he asked, bare-chested, arms in a fresh tunic he was\ndonning for the evening. He thought he’d done pretty well speaking with\ntwo of the most powerful people in the world, but when Tisis presented him\nwith freshly pressed clothes, the morning’s nervous sweat had made her\nargument for her. These were for a different kind of battle, and if he had to\ngo fight them somewhat alone, he was glad that Tisis was his shield bearer.\n“A note from your grandfather.”\n“Did you check it for poison?” Kip asked.\n“Kip.”"

And the rest appears to be, um, in his own hand, I think?” She\nextended it to Kip, who quickly wrestled the tunic over his head.\nTisis set to the various laces while he read. Not that they didn’t have\nservants for this sort of thing, but she liked taking care of him. He liked it,\ntoo. These small moments of closeness, of feeling normal, were treasures,\nhe thought.\nSomething hit him as he saw that scrawl on the pages. “Whoa,” Kip\nsaid.\n“Right?” Tisis said.\n“No, no, I haven’t even read it yet. I just… I just felt like I had a\nflashback, but I have no idea to what. Like someone dropped a seed in my\nbrain, but tamped hard the earth so it can’t break the surface. Like I’ve seen\nthat handwriting…” In a card. He shook his head as if to clear cobwebs.\n“They examined this for magic, right?”\n“More than once. In every spectrum. Even chi.”\nThat made Kip touch the pendant at his neck. He double-checked that\nthere weren’t any holes in the gallium. There weren’t.\nAll right. No need for his chest to feel so tight. It was just a letter.\nFrom the most controlling and malevolent man I personally know.\nHe read it: “‘Kip, would you please give me the honor and the great\npleasure of joining me for a few games of Nine Kings?’”\nKip couldn’t help but grin. What the hell?\n“‘I fear this may be our last chance to play, and to speak frankly with\neach other. I have missed your company, though I understand if the feeling\nisn’t mutual. I should be most gratified if you would join me immediately\nafter dinner. Naturally, you may bring whatever protection you require,\nthough we will play alone. I would love also to meet your bride anew.\nPerhaps tomorrow at breakfast?’”\n“A bit to digest there, huh?” Tisis said. “I particularly like the bit about\nmeeting me ‘anew.’”\nThe last time Andross and Tisis had been in the same room together,\nAndross had arranged for Kip to walk in on her stroking the old man under\nthe covers. “I actually kind of do like that part,” Kip said. “Wouldn’t mind\nforgetting about… that.”\nShe twisted her face. “I’m halfway between mortified, still, and wanting\nto slap his evil face.”\n“I should like to see that very much,” Kip said.\n“But it would invite questions that I don’t really want people asking,”\nTisis said. “You need to go, don’t you?”"

But…”\n“But not Andross.”\n“No, not from the master himself.” And there it was again: something\nthrumming in Kip’s memory that he couldn’t quite grab. The Master.\n“The messenger apologized, said he came as soon as he could. But if\nyou’re supposed to meet after dinner, you need to go as soon as we can get\nyou dressed. Do you think it’s a trap?” she asked.\n“They don’t need a trap. We’re in the web already,” Kip said.\n“I can’t go with you, can I?” she said.\n“If I get killed, you have to get our people off the island. Otherwise,\nthey’ll all stay and fight to avenge me. You know how these Foresters get.”\n“I’d fight to avenge you, too, you know,” she said, smoothing his hair.\n“I’m a Forester myself.”\n“If it comes to that, you fight with a pen in one hand and a scepter in the\nother,” Kip said. “You’ll do far more damage.”\n“I know. But I don’t have to like it.” She swallowed, and he saw for one\nmoment the depth of her fear for him. And he saw the bravery she showed\nin controlling it.\nShe straightened his light jacket—a fashion necessity, she assured him,\ndespite the warmth of the evening—and tucked away his necklace. Finally,\nshe laced his sleeves at the wrists to cover his Turtle-Bear tattoo and\nspritzed him with some scented water. “Remember how you walk.\nShoulders back, string from the top of your head,” she said, but all he heard\nwas, ‘I love you, I love you.’\n“Like a marionette,” Kip said, smiling at her in the mirror.\nHer breath came out ragged.\nShe cleared her throat and, still looking at him in the mirror, said, “Lift\nyour left arm.”\n“When I walk?” he asked.\nShe smacked him, but smiled.\nHe did it.\n“Which arm did the man in the mirror raise?” she asked.\n“Uh… his right?” Kip said. He hadn’t meant it to come out as a\nquestion. He tried again, and immediately felt foolish. “Yep, definitely his\nright.”\n“You know why? No, don’t give me that look.”\nHe’d been giving her a look. He couldn’t deny it. “Because our eyes—\nand how the light bounces—and stuff? I mean, the light travels correctly,\nbut we reverse the image when we imagine that there’s actually a person\nover on the other side of the mirror. Why are you frowning?”\n“No, it’s a hint.” She shook her head. “I’ve been afraid of this meeting\nfor you for a long time.”\n“You have?”"

The figure in the mirror raising the wrong arm is\nour hint that between reality and perception, things can get twisted.”\n“I remember. The first kind, anyway.” She meant actual physical\nmirrors, where his own distorted perceptions could confirm lies about\nhimself while he believed he was seeing objective truth.\n“The second is others’ regard. We judge ourselves by how others see us,\nand oftentimes that’s exactly what we need to do in order to correct our\nerrors of self-judgment. But you’re going to see Andross Guile.”\n“Not a man who has much regard for anyone,” Kip said.\n“It’s ten times worse, Kip. You meeting with your grandfather is more\ndangerous for you than facing ten thousand enemies.”\n“It’s just a silly card game,” Kip said. “I’ll lose a few rounds, he’ll feel\nsuperior, and we’ll call it a day.” But something in his guts twisted. Andross\nwas going to make him put wagers on the games. Kip just knew it. Wagers\nhe would certainly lose.\nShe sighed quietly. “Are you reassuring me or yourself?” But she didn’t\nwait for him to answer. “Kip, he’s dangerous to you because you admire\nhim so much. You hate what he’s done, sure. But you’ve compared yourself\nto him from the first time you met him. You’ve aspired to be what he is.\nAnd you’re actually so much more than he is.”\n“He’s smarter than I am.”\n“Sure. So? A man whose intelligence is leavened with humility is doubly\nwise.”\n“He’s more cunning. More connected. More masterful. More\nknowledgeable. More—”\n“He’s a hundred things more! And not one of them matters. I worry what\nyou’ll see when you look in his eyes, Kip. Because he’s warped. People\ncome away from meeting him hating themselves and hating the world.\nPeople meet with you and they come away with hope. You’re a thousand\ntimes the man he’ll ever be—no matter what happens. No matter what.”\nKip swallowed. “I love you.”\n“I know, you fat fuck,” she said.\nHis eyebrows shot up, and she laughed at shocking him, and he\nremembered the phrase from their earlier talk about how he’d scorned\nhimself.\nBut now her face went somber. Her hands rested on his shoulders, and\nhe could tell she was appreciating how solid they were, how broad.\n“Remember to see yourself as you are in the eyes of those who love you.\nThat’s what it means when we say ‘Orholam holds you in His eyes,’ Kip.\nAnd I do, too. Swear to me you’ll push back against everything else.”\n“Honey,” Kip said, admonishing her, “I’m a Guile. I don’t know how to\nnot fight.”"

I don’t know how to\nnot fight.”\nShe grabbed him as he turned to go, her fingernails digging painfully\ninto his arms. “Then you fight. Fight for all of us. I love you.”\nChapter 77\nQuentin wasn’t in his room, but Teia was already in the damned tower, so\nshe went looking for him in their old restricted library. She needed to report\nher failure.\nThe door was closed. Of course.\nShe sighed and eased it open, as if the wind had pushed it, peeked\nquickly, and let it close again.\nNo one was in sight.\nShe peeked again, then slipped inside.\nThe sound of laughter arrested her. Quentin, laughing? With someone\nelse?\nFirst, that was very strange, and then it oddly felt like he was cheating\non her.\nShe ghosted closer, drawing paryl to her fingertips. She didn’t recognize\nthe man as she approached from behind, though. Tall, lanky, with long dark\nhair, a dark beard, the frame of spectacles over his ears. Baggy sailor’s\ntrousers, but a fine dark tunic, not a luxiat. She streamed paryl out toward\nhim, the light cutting through his clothing to show her what weapons he\ncarried.\nIt was veritable armory. Large pistols in queer sheaths at his hips,\nsmaller ones on little frames up his sleeves loaded with springs, knives, and\na sword-breaker, and two spare sets of spectacles.\nThis was no visiting scholar.\nShe felt a sudden sheen of sweat on her upper lip. Had Quentin ratted\nher out? Was he working with the Order?\n“Perfectly safe,” Quentin said. “No one comes here.”\nShe reached across the room and slipped little blades of paryl into the\nman’s neck. The paryl illuminated him further as she closed in on him.\nSome kind of odd, broken-and-repaired contraption encased one knee that\nhad ugly scars around it; maybe an open luxin connection there?\nQuentin was laughing along with a wight?\nThe little holy hypocrite. I thought I knew you, Quentin.\nTeia readied a second strike for him.\n“You can’t expect the old boys to give up all their secrets without a\nfight,” the stranger said, tucking a stray bit of hair behind his ears. Or\nsecuring his spectacles? There was something about that voice—\nThe man launched himself backward, staying in his chair as it tipped\ntoward the floor. Before he slammed into the ground, he caught himself\nwith both feet on the underside of the table, even as a mechanical ka-chung\nrang out. Teia found herself staring into two small pistol barrels that had\nsprung from the man’s sleeves into his hands even as he hung upside down,\ntilting in his chair. Her paryl daggers into him had been shattered by his\nsharp movement. His spectacles glittered with sub-red. But behind\neverything unfamiliar, behind even the unfamiliar spectacles, were eyes she\nknew well.\n“Oh, hello, Teia,” Ben-hadad said.\nHe shoved hard against a spring-loaded pistol, resetting it. Then the\nother."

Oh, this one lost its flint. Of course it did. Again. Could you lift\nme back up? Little awkward here. Quentin, you gonna just stand there?”\nQuentin looked over at Teia helplessly as she shimmered back into\nvisibility. Ben-hadad was not a heavy man, but Quentin was the very\nantithesis of muscular. He couldn’t lift him by himself.\nTeia heaved Ben back to a sitting position.\nHe stood up and grinned. “Hey, look at me, huh?”\n“… Yeah… I was…”\n“And holy shit, little Teia, look at you,” Ben-hadad said. “Bet no one\ncalls you ‘little Teia.’”\nNo one talks to me at all.\n“No,” she said. “You’re back. You’re back?”\n“We’re all back. Come to save the day.”\nWas he joking? It wasn’t funny. “I’ll put on my damsel hat. Whaddaya\ncall it?”\n“A wimple?” Quentin asked. “Sorry. Don’t mind me. Not even here.”\n“No, not to save you, Teia. Shit. We needed you to save us. Can’t think\nhow many times we bitched about you being gone.”\n“Yeah?” she asked. There was suddenly something raw in her throat.\nThey were standing close, but neither had moved to embrace. She suddenly\nthought she was going to cry. “‘All of us,’ you said?”\n“Yeah, Kip’s back too.”\n“No, no, I meant, you’re all back? Everyone? Everyone made it?”\n“Oh, oh yeah. We’re all right. Well, except Winsen, but then, he wasn’t\nall right when we started. In fact, we’ve been trying to arrange for him to\ntake a few good blows to the head to see if it might straighten him out a\nbit.”\nTeia smiled wanly.\n“Nah,” Ben said. “Actually, even Win is less of a dick than he used to\nbe. A little bit less. Most of the time.”\n“Sometimes?”\n“Yeah, only sometimes,” Ben-hadad admitted.\n“But you’re okay? Really?”\n“Yeah, I mean, I, I took the worst of it since we left.” He gestured to his\nknee with the contraption, hidden under those baggy pants. “Actually, I\nguess you saw me get this injury. But I can walk now. Even run when I\ncan’t avoid it. Well, usually—just kind of broke my brace, but it’ll be good\nin no time.”\n“Yeah?” she said.\n“You been through the shit, huh?” Ben-hadad said, looking at her\nclosely.\n“Did Quentin tell…?”\n“No, no,” Ben-hadad said. And Teia saw that Ben wasn’t only more self-\nassured and more grown-up-looking than when he’d left, his brash\nintelligence had also been tempered by suffering.\n“You been through it, too,” Teia said."

Even if\none of them is Winsen.”\n“Ha! I’d rather be alone,” Teia said. But the word ‘alone’ bounced off\nthe walls, ricocheting into her chest.\nBen-hadad’s nose wrinkled. “No, you wouldn’t. Would you?”\n“No,” Teia said, looking away. She couldn’t break down. Ben didn’t\nknow what she’d done. Ben couldn’t offer her absolution. “So how is\neveryone?”\n“Kip’s good,” Ben-hadad said.\n“That’s not what I asked,” she said. “But since you brought him up, sure,\nlet’s start there. How is he?” She thought her voice was admirably level. No\nhint that her heart was in her throat.\n“Happily married.”\n“I, I didn’t—! I wasn’t asking—C’mon, Ben! Don’t be like that.”\n“Teia, I know you. It’s fine. It’s what you wanted to know and I’m happy\nto tell you. You want to know about her?”\n“No! No, not really, no.” She cursed. “Maybe a bit?”\n“She’s one of the Mighty now. Has been for quite a while, I guess.”\n“Oh.” She really did take my place in everything I loved, didn’t she?\n“She can’t fight for shit. But she’s saved our lives probably more than\nany of us. That’s why we’re Mighty, right? Different strengths, all pulling to\nthe same purpose.”\n“Yeah, yeah, that’s great.” For you. Thanks for reminding me what I\ndon’t have, you clueless dick.\n“We didn’t know you were supposedly gone or whatever, so Tisis\nthought I might see you on duty. She gave me something for you.”\n“Why didn’t she bring it herself?” Teia asked, suspicious.\n“The Order sent a team to kill Kip back in Blood Forest, so with them\nand all our other enemies, we decided our leaders shouldn’t all be in the\nsame place. She’s staying as far from the Chromeria as she can while still\nbeing on Big Jasper.”\n“They—what?!”\n“Yeah, right, we’ve got a lot to catch up on. Can I just do this thing so\nQuentin can get back to telling you just how damned smart I am?”\n“Language, please…?” Quentin said, wincing.\nBen-hadad looked at him quizzically.\n“He’s fine with any words except whatever dishonors Orholam or\ndisrespects a listener,” Teia explained. “Or something like that.”\n“It’s a bit more nuanced than—” Quentin started.\n“Let it go,” Teia said. “Both of you. Ben? What are you talking about?\nWhat ‘thing’?”\n“Here,” he said, digging into his pack. He pulled out a folded little cloth.\n“It was Tisis’s idea, but…” He unfolded it.

He’s said he’s gonna\nmake you run until you piss blood or something? I dunno, some saying he\ngot from his father. And he said ‘urinate,’ of course, not ‘piss.’”\nShe took the patch in trembling hands, and tears welled up in her eyes.\n“Now, Quentin, tell her I’m brilliant!”\n“None was gainsaying the claim,” Quentin said. “Though none were yet\nqueuing to support it, either.”\nTeia knew Quentin well enough now that she could tell he was teasing.\nBut the flash of humor helped her push back the tears.\nMaybe Quentin knew her a little bit, too.\n“This is relevant, right?” she growled.\n“A little,” Quentin said.\n“A little?!” Ben-hadad protested.\nQuentin said, “Our old monopodal friend here, it turns out, is rather\nadept at reading schematics, and knows a fair bit more of engineering\nhistory than I do, as well. It’s embarrassing really. I think I read straight past\nreferences to this very thing. It turns out that at the time of the Chromeria’s\nconstruction, there were several different units of measure in use, with\ncertain professions preferring one and others another. There were\nconversion tables, but always with a margin of error.”\nTeia had no idea what he was talking about, but sometimes it was faster\nto just listen, so she nodded along as Quentin continued. He was\nridiculously excited about seeing someone else be smart in a realm he\nhimself was ignorant of. Almost enough so that Teia found it contagious.\nAlmost.\nHe went on. “It was a known problem, so there were corrections used on\nlarge-scale projects like this, but the head engineer made the teams work\nlevel by level and purposefully didn’t correct for the conversion errors, and\nat each level, he brought in his own master carpenters and masons to ‘fix\nthings up’ and conceal the errors.”\n“But,” Ben-hadad said, finally breaking in on his own story, “there are\ncertain things that really do have to be where the plans say they are: flues\nfor the kitchen’s fires, openings for the lightwells into classrooms and the\nsignal crystals, and so forth, so by guessing which those might be, and\nknowing how much the total errors would be, then you see that the hidden\nrooms will be clustered high in the towers where the errors could\naccumulate, with maybe a few more in the depths of the bedrock of the\nbasements.”\n“Not the basements,” Teia said. Her heart was in her throat. “This’d be\nup high. Quickly accessible.”\n“That’s what Quentin said you were looking for. So let’s go.”\n“Go?” Teia asked.\n“Yeah,” Ben-hadad said, pointing to the pages of notes and equations\nhe’d scribbled. “I’ve got ten or eleven possibilities for what I assume are\nfour to nine spaces, depending on the size.

I can either spend about four\nhours honing my equations to figure out which guesses are most likely… or\nwe can just go look.”\nTeia felt like a huge weight she’d been carrying had suddenly been lifted\nfrom her shoulders. The Mighty were back. Her boys were home, and her\ntotal and abject failure to find the Old Man’s office was about to be\nmagically mended with a wave of Ben-hadad’s brilliant equations.\nFor the first time in so long that it felt like the first time ever, she felt\nfluttering in her breast, a stretching out of the delicate wings of hope.\nChapter 78\nKip walked to Promachos Andross Guile’s apartments clad for silken war.\nUnder Tisis’s direction, he’d been shaved and scrubbed and oiled, nails\ntrimmed, hair cut, muscles pounded, joints stretched, measurements taken,\ncomplexion and eyes compared to various charts, clothing of various\ncoloring and texture held up for her approval. Then she made him do push-\nups and sit-ups and pull-ups. Washed him again, and made him do push-ups\nwhile she sat on his back before examining him critically one last time,\nnodding, and pulling on his tunic, strapping on his spectacles holster,\nchecking his hair one last time, and pushing him out the door.\nIt felt ridiculous. He’d seen Andross just yesterday with none of this\nartifice. But he trusted Tisis, even if his entire upper body felt so swollen\nthat he was going to have to twist sideways to get his shoulders through the\ndoor.\nCruxer knocked for him and was greeted by Grinwoody, who ushered\nthem in with his typical greasy smile.\nAndross’s apartments were no longer the dingy dark they had been when\nKip first came. Now they sparkled, window shades open wide to the light.\n“Grandson, welcome! So good of you to accept my invitation,” Andross\nsaid as if they were a normal family. He came over and took Kip by the\nshoulders, and there was a little flicker of surprise at how firm they were.\n“I see you were right. I did choose well for you,” Andross said.\n“My lord?” Kip asked.\n“Your bride. This is her doing, I can tell. When you left here… you were\nnot, shall we say, who you are now?”\nKip wasn’t sure if his grandfather somehow knew about his push-ups or\nmeant something else entirely. “Sir?”\n“Slimmed you down. Made you happy. Showed you how to dress\nappropriately. Before, you were a Guile in spirit, but only in spirit. You\ncouldn’t truly be a Guile until you looked like one. We’re a handsome\nfamily, and it matters. I’d hoped that by giving you a beautiful wife I might\ninspire you to make something of yourself. I see it worked. And from what I\nhear, you’d not have fared nearly so well as you did if she were only a nice\nbody. Can’t tell you how pleased I am with that. It seemed terribly unjust\nthat Eirene Malargos’s sister had a reputation for being deeply stupid. I\nhoped and gambled that it wasn’t true.”"

How had Kip forgotten what it was like to\nbear the full brunt of Andross Guile’s abrasive personality? “As above, so\nbelow, huh?” Kip said.\n“How’s that?” Andross asked. He gestured. “Please, sit, sit.”\n“Like Orholam, you set the course before me. I merely ran it.” Were\nthey really going to pretend Andross had meant Kip well? That all the\nblessings Kip had enjoyed from his marriage were the point of what\nAndross had done? Taking a seat in a chair that probably cost more than a\nhouse in Rekton, Kip said, “I’m just so glad that the marriage also cemented\nthe Malargos family to us, and kept Ruthgar from making a separate peace\nwith Koios.”\n“Well, not everyone can start marriage with love, certainly not poor fat\nboys from the farthest reaches of the empire.”\n“Actually, poor fat boys from Tyrea have a pretty good chance of\nmarrying for love. It’s everything else they don’t get.”\nAndross paused. “I’ll yield to your greater experience on that.\nRegardless, good work making what I gave you your own.”\nAnd suddenly Kip wanted to bury his fist in his grandfather’s pleasant,\npatronizing face.\n“She’s been a joy to me. Thank you,” Kip said instead, smiling as if the\nold man were in his dotage and needed to be humored.\nAndross caught it, and the jovial superiority drained from his face. But\nthen he recovered. He wagged a finger and turned away. Grinwoody rolled a\ntable over to them, covered with labeled decks and scores of cards spread\nfaceup for modifying any of the decks.\n“Have you had any chance to play?” Andross asked.\n“None,” Kip said. “But I feel I have a different perspective on some of\nthe cards now. Not sure if that’ll help me in the game, but it’s been quite\nvaluable in life.”\n“They’re not so different,” Andross said, “life and the game.”\n“Here I thought we were working to prevent that,” Kip said.\n“How so?” Andross asked. It was actually a bit of a relief that he wasn’t\ntracking exactly with Kip’s thoughts today. The old man was unnerving.\n“We’re trying to prevent there being nine kings again?” Kip said.\n“Ha! Well. True,” Andross said.\n“Promachos Guile, we both know you’re better at Nine Kings than I am.\nYou’re also the promachos. You can ask or order almost anything of me,\nand I’ll simply have to give it to you. I’d love to play you sometime—\nwithout stakes other than perhaps my bruised ego. But not today. Maybe\nyou’ve done everything you need to do to prepare for the coming battle, but\nI haven’t. Every game I play against you is for stakes I can’t afford, and\nwith the decks stacked against me. I won’t play.”\nAndross looked amused. “A good play itself.”\n“Thank you.”"

I won’t play.”\nAndross looked amused. “A good play itself.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Which is why I preemptively took it away from you.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Kip, do you think you’re the first young man to see that the games of\nhis elders are stacked against him? Do you think you’re the first to rage\nagainst the game upon finding out that you’re not much of a player?”\n“Look, old man—”\n“Yes, I am old, and how old are you now? Even out of your teens yet?”\nThat caught Kip up short. But he didn’t bother to answer.\n“Even in our world, where drafters, and the children of noble families,\nand most of all those who are both, must mature early, you are still very,\nvery young.”\n“My uncle Dazen set the world on fire by the time he was my age,” Kip\ncountered. “And my—”\n“You consider that an achievement?” Andross interrupted before Kip\ncould start on his father’s deeds.\n“He moved the world by his will.”\n“No, he didn’t. He didn’t even set the world afire. He provided a spark\nto one powder keg among hundreds. He invited other fire throwers to his\nbanners because he was so desperate for support, and they came because the\nold grievances were so strong.”\n“You backed him into a corner,” Kip said. “And you did nothing to\ndisperse all that powder, though you were in a position to do so. It was your\nfailure.”\n“Perhaps you know less about that history than you think. You ascribe\nmore power to me than I had at the time.”\n“Do I?” Kip said.\n“I came from the outside myself, Kip. I was a nothing like you. I started\nfrom the bottom of the nobility to get where I am now. I had to make\ngambles, time and again, that would make your testicles quiver. And I\ndidn’t win every time. When the war broke out, I was still heavily in debt\nfrom all the bribes it cost me to get onto the Spectrum, and there were\nmasterful players at that table who’d seen me coming and wanted me\nruined, if not dead. You see me now and believe that I was ever thus.”\n“No, I hope that you weren’t,” Kip said. “You never got around to\ntelling me how you closed off the chance for me to simply leave and not\nplay your games.”\nAndross’s eyes flashed, but then he suddenly smiled, and this time it hit\nhis eyes. “This, this is why I’ve longed to play you again, Kip. You give me\nthe uncomfortable pleasure of playing against an opponent who will bring\nout the best in me.”\nKip couldn’t help but suddenly remember those moments when he’d\nactually missed sparring with the old man. But this was insanity; they didn’t\nhave time for this.\n“But to answer your question: unattached young men are destabilizing,”\nAndross said. “Like the lover of fire who burns down homes for pleasure\nand wouldn’t altogether mind if the flames took him as well, a young man\nmight tell you to go sodomize yourself, even if it’s the worst possible thing"

This is why young men go to war. It’s\nwhy they gamble ruinous amounts. It’s why they jump off heights to\nimpress others and bear the pain of their injuries for the next fifty years.\nAnyone who might kill himself to hurt you is dangerous, hard to predict.\nYou were one of those. You’re not any longer. Why do you think I gave you\na wife? Why do you think I gave you the Mighty? Why do you think I let\nyou recruit your own army and have success with it? Because every bond is\na fetter. Every extra thing you love makes you easier to predict.”\n“You didn’t give those to me,” Kip said.\n“Didn’t I?”\nFuuuuck.\nAndross’s eyes glittered at the doubt he saw in Kip’s, and he went on.\n“I’d hoped you’d have a child on the way by now. I figured a young man\nwho grew up without a father would be loath to abandon his own child. But\nyou do have a wife to think of, and friends you wouldn’t want anything bad\nto happen to.”\nKip didn’t want to believe that the very happiness he’d enjoyed had been\nafforded to him by Andross Guile, and he knew the man wasn’t above\ntaking credit for things he hadn’t done, but he was the master.\nThe phrase pulsed in Kip’s head: ‘The Master.’\nThat card. But it triggered no further memories or visions.\n“You know you’re insufferable, right?” Kip asked.\n“A common trait of the Guile men.”\nKip shook his head, trying not to smile. Dammit. “How do you do this?”\nhe asked.\nAndross waited for him to clarify.\n“How do I like you, after all you’ve done? I should…” I should abhor\nyou, Kip thought, but it wasn’t the time to say such things.\n“Water seeks its own level,” Andross said.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” Kip said.\n“It means we’ll be playing three games.”\n“That doesn’t answer my question in the slightest.”\n“The first two will have stakes high enough to keep your interest, and by\nthe time we’re finished with the third, you’ll understand why this is not only\nworth the time you’ll be spending away from preparing for the battle, you’ll\nunderstand that what we’re doing will quite likely decide the battle.”\n“We’re on the same side,” Kip said, disbelieving. “If you want me to do\nsomething, just ask.”\n“I want you to play three games with me to decide the fate of the\nworld,” Andross said.\nKip had walked into that. He thought for a moment. What leverage did\nhe have to refuse?\n“Please,” Andross said. He gave a serpent-cold smile.\n“Since you asked so nicely,” Kip said.\n“Stakes for the first game are a secret for a secret. If I win, you tell me\nwhat happened to all of Janus Borig’s cards.

Everything you know.\nIncluding the ones you left out last time.”\nThat sounded suspiciously non-terrible, though Kip knew there had to be\nsome angle on it. “Understood. And if I win?”\nIdly, Andross spun a ring on his finger. “I’ll tell you your mother’s\nstory.”\n“You mean my real mother.”\n“Well, if you want Karris’s real story, you’ll have to ask her yourself. I\nthink there are some things you might learn about the woman who called\nherself Katalina Delauria that might change how you feel about her.”\n“What do you mean by that? What do you know about my mother?” Kip\ndemanded. He’d sworn he didn’t care about her anymore, but his emotions\nwent so hot so fast that he saw he’d only been fooling himself.\n“Quite a lot more now than I did even a month ago. I had a visit with\nLina’s father. Most illuminating.”\n“I have another grandfather?!”\n“Tragic story. Lina and Asafa were very close. They corresponded until\nshe became convinced it was too dangerous for her to continue doing so.\nThat, of course, was long after she’d run away. He’d love to meet you.\nWould you like to meet him?”\nRun away?\nToo dangerous?\nKip had a whole other family?\nHis grandfather’s name was Asafa? Kip could meet him?\nThe questions piled on top of each other, throwing Kip’s heart to the\nwinds—until he saw Andross’s coolly smug smirk.\nThis was Andross Guile’s favorite thing in the world, wasn’t it?\nKnocking people off balance, then lording his greater knowledge over them,\nthen manipulating them with it: this was his real game.\n“There’s a battle coming. This is all moot,” Kip said.\n“I like to plan for the future, even if it looks like there is none. That’s\nwhat makes us emerge from them stronger.”\n“Are you going to cheat?” Kip asked.\n“Only if you let me,” Andross said. “Are you familiar with Keffel’s\nVariant?”\n“I know what it is,” Kip said. It was a set of custom rules that made for a\nfaster game. He’d never played it.\n“It’s good for an analogy,” Andross said. “And it’ll give you a chance\nfor luck to help you.”\n“Classic decks?” Kip asked. The variant started the game at noon rather\nthan morning, when the most powerful cards could be played immediately,\nand had an initial mechanic where you drew seven cards but had to discard\ndown to four. Using classic decks, you had some idea what your opponent\nwould be going for. Typical games were a quick slugfest.\n“No, my decks,” Andross said.\nInstantly, Grinwoody began sweeping cards from the surface of the table\nas if they’d been there for nothing.\nOf course. Asshole. With the many cards out on the table, Andross had\nmisled Kip into believing that Kip would be constructing his own deck.\nInstead, this was just another way of the old man putting him off balance.\n“It’s traditional that the guest be allowed to choose the deck pairing,\nisn’t it?”"

Do\nyou know, I once stooped to playing Grinwoody? So capable in so many\nduties, and has surely seen me play a thousand times. Yet hopeless.”\n“Almost as bad as I am?” Kip asked.\nAgain Andross smiled.\nGrinwoody said nothing, but now brought over a heavy tray, seeming to\nstruggle with the weight with the infirmity of his age. He set it on the\nplaying table and pulled back the top. It unfolded to reveal a score of decks,\neach nicely inset in a samite surface.\n“You choose the pairing. I choose which deck.”\n“May I take a moment?” Kip asked as he started going through the\ndecks.\n“As you were so adamant to point out, we don’t have all day,” Andross\nsaid when Kip paused halfway through rifling through the second deck.\n“Of course, grandfather,” Kip said. “It’s just been a while. Green Apple’s\nGambit?” he asked, gesturing to the deck in his hand.\n“With four substitutions,” Andross said. “As usually constructed, that\ndeck’s a little slow, I always thought it needed a tertiary path to victory,\nthough in my games I’ve never used it.”\n“Never needed it?” Kip said.\n“I’ve tended to be lucky,” Andross said. It was, perhaps, the first modest\nthing Kip had ever heard come out of his mouth.\nDammit. Andross had here collected the legendary decks of history, but\nthen made his own adjustments.\n“Brier and Fire. Good one,” Kip said, rifling. “But… lots of\nsubstitutions.” He frowned.\nHe was at a greater disadvantage than he’d thought. It didn’t matter how\ngood his memory was, not with a time pressure like this. Studying each\ndeck, recalling how close it was to the classic decks and rating its strengths,\nand then discarding most of the commentary he’d memorized to evaluate\nhow strong it would be in this weird game variant?\nKip said, “I’d need days to prepare adequately for—oh, I see. This is an\nanalogue for our defense against the White King. Not enough time to do\nwhat I’d like, so what do I do instead?”\nAndross snapped his fingers, and Grinwoody disappeared to go fetch\nsomething. “Perhaps you read too much into a game.”\nIt wasn’t fair—but Kip had agreed to it. Any time he spent whinging was\ntime wasted.\nHe had to look at the weird rules as part of the game, not as the terms of\nthe game. He got to pick the decks, out of which Andross would choose\nwhich one he wanted. Most people would think it was obvious to choose\ndecks that were as equal as possible. With equally good players, it would\nbe.\nBut why had Andross chosen this variant? And why these decks?\nTurn the question from a disinterested analytical query to a human"

And why these decks?\nTurn the question from a disinterested analytical query to a human\nquestion, and it suddenly made sense to Kip. “I see: I can’t use my memory\nto simply pick the best decks and play it out as others have done before us.\nNeither the choice of decks nor the exact strategies involved in our game\nwill have been covered by any book I might have read. So this is another\ntest.”\n“Not a test. I simply don’t want to play against your memories of what\nsome card master from some earlier era did. I want to play against you,”\nAndross said.\nSo Kip turned everything backward. At the disadvantage he was starting\nfrom, he needed a deck that counted on luck. Of course, the games’ masters\ntended not to rely on luck, but many decks had secondary strategies—if you\nget unlucky and don’t draw X, Y, or Z, you might still be able to win by\nusing A and B together. Many of the classic decks, however, eschewed\nthose secondary strategies in order to make the original strategy even\nstronger. They’d simply take the loss if they got particularly unlucky.\nOver many iterations, skill prevailed over luck.\nWhich meant that skillful players naturally gravitated toward decks\nrewarding skillful play, and few players were more skillful than Andross. So\nKip decided not to go with the classically paired decks at all. Instead, Kip\nlooked for a two long-shot, luck-dependent decks that even Andross\nwouldn’t have played against each other. In a minute, he had the two.\nAndross frowned.\nEach, in this variant, should be pretty weak—unless they drew one key\ncard. The first deck was generally considered to be too complicated to be\nused regularly in standard play, Nine Mirrors. The second was Delayed\nDestruction, which hadn’t been played in centuries because Sea Demon and\nanother card in it whose name had been lost were now considered Black\nCards—forbidden from legal play.\nKip wasn’t sure what Andross would have used to shore up the deck,\nthough, so he looked through the two decks for whatever changes the old\nman had made. “The hell?” Kip said. “What’s this?”\nSea Demon was in the deck. Naturally. But so, too, was the nameless\ncard, lost to the mists of time. It was not nameless here: “Sea Giant?”\n“You’ve learned something about will-casting in this last year, I hear,”\nAndross said.\n“Indeed,” Kip said. “And it’s left me with many questions.”\n“Dolphins can be will-cast, but only by someone they like or by\nsomeone very strong. Whales can’t be will-cast at all. There are accounts of\nmen breaking their minds against them, like waves against the rocks of the\nEverdark Gates. But sea giants, enormous and peaceful as they were, sea\ngiants were trivially easy to will-cast. It is how the pirate kings first\nestablished themselves. A few dozen will-cast sea giants and a pirate queen\nnamed Ceres established such a stranglehold on the sea that they named it\nCeres’s Sea. But then the other pirates attacked her, or she was murdered,"

But then the other pirates attacked her, or she was murdered,\nand her followers couldn’t control the sea giants, or she murdered the\nunderlings she had in charge of the sea giants—or perhaps none of those\nstories are true, but however it was, somehow their reins slipped from\nhuman fingers. The sea giants went insane, and destroyed every ship they\ncame upon, everywhere.\n“Nautical trade came to a standstill. There’s simply no defense against\nthem. A few very strong will-casters had limited success against them, but it\nwas rarely duplicated. Without nautical trade, every one of the nine\nkingdoms became utterly dependent upon its neighbors, and that only gave\nthem all another reason for war. When the Chromeria gained control, the\nsea giants were hunted to extinction. The whales left thereafter. No one\nknows why.”\n“How do you know all this?” Kip asked.\nAndross shrugged, as if to say, Really?\n“These cards. They’re very similar.”\n“They’re the same, some say. Having no sea giants to compare our sea\ndemons with, I have no way of telling. But some have said in bygone eras,\nbefore such talk was too dangerous, that our sea demons now are the last of\nthose will-cast sea giants. They roam the seas, senescent, angry when\nroused from their near-immortal torpor.”\n“Reminds me of someone,” Kip said.\n“Damn, kid. I should beat you with my cane.”\n“You know interesting stuff,” Kip said.\n“Oh, high praise! You little shit. Have you decided yet?”\nKip shuffled through both decks one last time, trying to memorize them.\nThen he extended them.\nAndross took Delayed Destruction, leaving Kip with Nine Mirrors.\n“Pick that for the name?” he asked.\n“Not re… er, of course. I was hoping you’d ramble on about the Great\nMirrors as a conversation piece,” Kip said. “Have to confess, learning about\nthem would probably be a lot more useful to my immediate future than\nlearning about moldy old sea demons.”\nIt actually would’ve been a clever plan, if Kip had been quick enough to\nthink of it.\n“Really?” Andross said.\n“Not really. But I found a Great Mirror in Blood Forest. Triggered it.\nHuge thing, still pristine. Had been underground for centuries, it looked\nlike. I don’t suppose there’s actually… nine of them?”\nAndross gestured to Grinwoody to pour them some drinks while he\nshuffled his own cards, his liver-spotted hands moving as deftly as a\ncardsharp’s. “The Nine Kings cards are a repository of ancient knowledge,\nsome of it very unpopular with the censors of their eras, some of it\nunpopular with later ones.” He flipped half his deck from one hand to\nanother in a move that seemed to defy physical laws. “It’s also just a game.\nHow many Mirror cards in that deck?”\n“Three?” Kip said. He hated that it came out as a question.\n“But three doesn’t sound scary. Three Mirrors? In a game called Nine\nKings? Nine Mirrors, much better.”"

Six scared\nadolescents who’d dropped out of the Chromeria, who’d washed out of\nBlackguard training and been chased off the Jaspers by a half-trained band\nof thugs.”\n“Those thugs are your Lightguards. Who you also gave a pretty\nawesome name, much as we hate you for it. Hated.” Kip cleared his throat.\n“‘The Lightguard’ is a name that either calls ironic attention to itself or,\nmaybe one time in twenty, might have encouraged those thugs to make\nsomething of themselves. The latter is a gamble I lost, but I still win. They\nknow everyone hates them, and they depend utterly on me, so they’re\nfiercely loyal to me.”\n“Except for that incident where Zymun sent them to kill me and the\nMighty.”\n“Well, yes, except for that. But they only obeyed him because he told\nthem that they would actually be fulfilling my will by fulfilling his. He, too,\nis a Guile.”\n“I can’t believe you’re keeping him close,” Kip said. “He’s poison.”\n“He says the same about you. Shuffle?”\nThey shuffled for each other, and Kip kept his eyes tight on Andross’s\nhands. One last cut of the decks, and they handed them back to each other.\nAndross chose the setting as Big Jasper and set the sun-counter at noon.\nKip went first.\nHe drew his cards: a tough polychrome named Katalina Galden, Red\nSpectacles, a musket, a good sword, Blue Spectacles, a green-drafting\nBlackguard with a musket proficiency, and a red-drafting Blackguard. It\nwould have been a great hand for the normal game, good for offense and\ndefense early. In a normal game, it would have put him in an early lead that\nAndross might never have recovered from.\nBut at full noon, and with two draws? Every card Kip kept in his hand\nwas one less card he could draw, one less chance to get the powerful cards\nhe needed. He flopped them all down.\n“The discard pile is faceup in this variant,” Andross said.\nKip hadn’t recalled that. Great.\nThe old man studied Kip’s overturned cards. “A tough call. But the right\nplay.”\n“A compliment?” Kip asked.\n“Doled out in heaping measure, when deserved,” Andross said. He\ndiscarded three. They didn’t help Kip at all. They were three cards you’d\ntoss regardless of what you were pursuing.\n“I knew her, you know.”\n“Katalina Galden?” Kip asked. “Any relation to that asshole Magister\nJens Galden?”\nKip looked at the cards he’d drawn.

He’d been walking down another mental path\ncompletely. And then he remembered. This was how Andross Guile\noperated: overload your opponent with too many things to think about, and\nthen drop a bomb with a burning fuse in his lap and see what he did.\n“How many people in history do you think were smarter than you are?”\nKip asked.\nBut the counter didn’t work.\n“She was a dear friend of your grandmother’s,” Andross said. “For a\nlong time. She, more than anyone, I think, is responsible for our family’s\ntroubles. She lied to me. She lied to us.” She? Oh, she Janus Borig.\nKip got to go first, so he laid out nearly all of his cards. “How so?” Kip\nasked, suspicious.\n“I was going to say, ‘So beware of trusting anything she told you.’ But\ninstead you’re surprised,” Andross said. “So you think she’s a truth teller?\nBecause she’s a Mirror? Because ‘Mirror’ implies a passivity?”\nAfter his talk about mirrors with his wife not two hours ago, Kip felt like\neither history was bringing something together for him to understand or this\nwas just one of those times where you learn a new word or concept and\nsuddenly you’re seeing it everywhere.\n“I know this much,” Kip said, trying not to show how troubled he was.\n“She didn’t try to kill me before even meeting me.”\n“No, she was more interested in using you to kill someone else,”\nAndross said. He played three coccas; they were smaller ships, but each\ncapable of decent damage. If Kip got the direct attacks his deck depended\non, he would have to waste valuable turns taking them out.\nKip was screwed. The game had barely started, and they both already\nknew he was going to lose. He looked at the card he’d drawn: Yellow\nSpectacles. Garbage.\nYeah, Luck, go bugger yourself.\n“I’m sure anyone who has a message you can’t control must be\nuntrustworthy,” Kip said, more furious at his cards than at his opponent.\n“From today forward I will get all my intelligence from you alone,\ngrandfather.”\nA muscle in Andross’s jaw twitched, but he took a slow breath. “Do you\nknow, it’s so frustrating. I’m making all the same mistakes with you I made\nwith Dazen. I’m a better player than this. Fine.” He seemed to be choosing\nhis words with care, and Kip had to hide his astonishment that he’d thrown\nhis grandfather off his own planned path for once.\n“She told me,” Andross said, “when I first ascended to the Red seat on\nthe Spectrum, that she wanted to paint my portrait for her cards.

If one excludes the procedure and discovery and\nweapon and monster cards, that fact alone would acknowledge me as one of\nthe four hundred fifty-seven most important people throughout history to\nthat point. Slightly more, actually, but I didn’t have an accurate count of the\nBlack Cards then, and of course, there were many important people who\nnever sat for their portrait, but they’re the less famous for it. What the\noriginals of these cards did, though, was known to very few.”\nAndross played Amir Bazak on one of the coccas, and Red Spectacles,\nand equipped them on him. Amir had turned himself into a human bomb,\npenetrating the enemy lines during a battle through subterfuge and then\ndrafting so much red it killed him in an explosion that took out thousands\nand opened a gap in the line. It was a weak card, easily killed—if you had\nsomething to kill it with.\n“But you knew,” Kip said. It was hard to imagine Andross Guile not\nknowing any secret. “You knew what the cards did.”\n“I married well, into a family that knew… most of it,” Andross said.\n“But Borig was clever. I think she’d already seen more than I guessed. She\nled me to believe that a card could only cover the time period up until its\ncreation. Seems logical, right? And I believed that each person could only\nhave one card. She lied. So tell me, my cleverer grandson, why would that\nbe a problem?”\nIt wasn’t the flattery of being told he was historically important, Kip\nrealized. Though he imagined that flattery had meant quite a lot to Andross\nGuile, even if he didn’t want to admit it.\nBut Andross would have pushed past the flattery.\nCommemorating a mere Red? Andross had set his sights so much\nhigher, and would soon achieve so much more. If Andross had believed that\nhe was destined for much greater heights than merely being the youngest\nRed in history, then…\n“Ah,” Kip said. “You had plans. You knew that you were going to be\npromachos someday. Or maybe Prism? The White?”\n“Something like that,” Andross said. “Regardless, I should have known\nbetter. I was a young man, with a young man’s weaknesses. I thought\npotential meant something. I thought I was so very devious in having her\npaint my card before I had done most of the things I’d planned. See, I was\nworried about what my enemies might do with such a card after it was\ncompleted. I knew I deserved a card. So if I could get her to do my card\nearly, then even if my enemies got it, the information they learned about\nme, being solely retrospective, would be of limited use to them.\n“But the truth was I hadn’t done anything up to that point to deserve a\ncard.

No, her lie was different. She told me—or I assumed—that it\nwas only possible to have one card. After all, no one else has ever had more\nthan one, and though I’m a proud man, I hadn’t considered myself quite\nthat special. Reflecting on it later, I realized that I didn’t know that others\nhadn’t had multiple cards made of them, with only one kept for later use. I\nonly knew the cards that had entered the registers. It’s possible the Mirrors\nhave pulled this trick before. Lucidonius has no card, so far as we know, but\nthere is an account of there being a Mirror during his era who met an early\nend. It was attributed to the Order, but they are a convenient scapegoat,\naren’t they?”\n“You think Janus Borig made another card of you?”\n“That’s the question I think you will answer. Right. About. Now.”\nAndross played Sea Demon.\nKip couldn’t kill it in one turn, and the cocca alone could kill him next\nround, so it was now impossible for him to win.\nHe’d been focused during the game, focused on winning, on Andross’s\nwords, and that tight focus had allowed his mother to blur into\ninsignificance in the background. But now she came back into his vision,\nonly for him to see her retreating into the distance. Andross wouldn’t give\nKip her story; he never gave anyone anything, especially not something of\ngreat value to them.\nKip hadn’t thought it would affect him, but suddenly it felt like losing\nhis mother all over again—and even worse now. Andross wasn’t going to\nlet Kip find his grandfather, either, for his grandfather Asafa would likely\ntell Kip the story himself, and Andross wasn’t about to give up a prize for\nnothing.\nIt was a moot point. Kip was going to die in this battle. It shouldn’t hurt.\nHe didn’t have time to prattle on with some old stranger anyway.\n“Looks like a small man on a little ship wins it for you,” Kip said. “An\nunlikely hero, what with sea demons and Great Mirrors about.”\n“But a hero nonetheless… because I was willing to lose him.”"

Not that I’m opposed to learning lessons from\nmere games or other unlikely places. Speaking of which, there’s the matter\nof our first wager. I believe you have a story to tell me about what happened\nto Janus Borig’s cards.”\nChapter 79\nEven as Gavin ran up the steps to the Tower of Heaven’s roof, he noticed a\nchange from the hewn conformity of all the stairs he’d climbed in the entire\nhike up until now.\nThe steps became irregular, a more natural shape, with uncut stone,\nalbeit worn by the passage of many thousands of feet over untold years.\nComing out on the top of White Mist Tower felt not like reaching the top of\none of the Chromeria’s seven towers but instead like summiting the stone\ncrown of a mountain. The top wasn’t carved flat, but gently curved.\nIt reminded him, quite suddenly, of the crest of Sundered Rock before he\nand his brother had shattered it.\nSo long lost in darkness, that memory surfaced as sharply as did the\nblack stone beneath his feet. For the entire climb, the black stone of the\ntower had been an oddity. Was it meant to evoke the black humility of a\nluxiat’s robes? The imagery had never gelled for Gavin. Luxiats showed\nthey had no light of their own, but surely this pilgrimage should be toward\nlight. Maybe a tower black at the base, but lighter as one climbed? That\ncould make sense.\nInstead, White Mist Tower was unrelieved black.\nA part of Gavin knew he should move fast. He should grab the blade\nbefore anything else. He’d circled halfway around the tower with the last\nstair, which put the sword at the far side. But running before he knew what\nwas here might be rushing heedless into danger—rather than running to\nsafety. And a sight here struck him like Orholam’s own raised fist.\nHere, finally, at its topmost height, the Tower of Heaven poked its head\nabove the wall of white mists that had obscured the rest of it for ages. Only\nhere, at its crown, was Gavin high enough to see out beyond the mantle of\ncloud cloaking both tower and island.\nThe rising sun, dimmed for all the timeless days he’d been here, shone\nbrilliant, awakening the horizon with fire. White fire, to Gavin’s color-blind\neyes, but the sun was beautiful yet, even stripped of its colors by a cruel\ngod.\nThe thought brought him back to himself. Brought him back to threats\nand death and killing. He couldn’t see the sword on the opposite side of the\ntower’s top, hidden as it was by the rise of the stone hill that was the\ntower’s center—but he didn’t see anything else, either.\nThe summit was empty.\nThe pilgrimage ended in nothing.\nI crossed half the world to come to God’s own house, and He’s not at\nhome.\nProbably never was."

It\nrevealed only bleak nothingness rendered in starker tones than his natural\norb saw. Brittle stone, a tower not of heaven but of lies. This temple was all\nfaçade. Men had labored for a thousand years to build this tower to the\nheavens, and when they reached it, they found themselves punished only\nwith the death of their delusions and a loneliness plunging as deep as this\ntower was tall.\nIn piling up a tower to heaven, they only burrowed down exactly that\ndeeply into hell. In the light of this open air, they’d found a darkness as\ngreat as the black cell under the Chromeria.\nOn the day they’d finished, there had surely been some festival, some\ncelebration with serious prayers from serious luxiats. Together, those\ngathered had surely shouted to heaven, ‘We built You a house! Come and\nlive among us, Orholam! Fulfill the promise of the ages!’\nWhat had they done when there had been no answer?\nHow long had it been before scandalized luxiats, seeing their own power\ndissolve with other men’s beliefs, concocted some excuse for Orholam’s\nabsence?\nThey’d lied then as they did now, because all their power rested on it.\nIt was what Gavin had always suspected, but it was like suspecting your\nwife had cheated, dread growing in your heart as you became more certain,\nbut the relationship not dying until you heard the admission from your\nbecursed-beloved’s own lips.\nGavin staggered. He fell to one knee. He clamped his eyes closed as his\nchest tightened and shut off his breath.\nHe covered the eye patch and opened only his natural eye, praying to no\none, but praying that his wounded natural orb would see things differently.\nPerhaps the black stone told him bleaker news than it ought.\nThe darkness receded slowly from his vision like an oily film slowly\nsliding earthward, but even here in the beauty of a sunrise as he hadn’t seen\nin what felt like ages untold, the fundamental truth remained: there was\nnothing here.\nNothing here meant everything Gavin had done—everything, for his\nwhole life—was a breath exhaled into the storm. Worse, there being nothing\nhere meant there was no nexus of magic. No nexus meant there was no\nnexus to kill.\nThat meant there was no way to save Karris.\nWhat was Gavin to report to Grinwoody? ‘I went but there was nothing\nthere’? Who would believe that? Before the White Mist Reef had closed off\nthe isle, disillusioned pilgrims must have said the same thing a hundred\nthousand times to those who’d not made the journey, and yet the people of\nthe satrapies had chosen to believe instead the liars who’d returned\nswearing they’d encountered Orholam here.\nKarris would die. Gavin would, too, even if he made it home. How\ncould Grinwoody let him live?\nHe had no future.\nBut it was worse than a mission failed, and all Gavin’s happiness stolen."

Everything Gavin had ever\ndone had been in the service of lies. His own, and others’.\nHis brother’s death, and everyone he’d murdered for the Freeing, it had\nall been only men wrestling for power, cloaking themselves in respectability\nby invoking a god who had nothing to do with any of it, because He didn’t\nexist.\nBut though broken and barely able to breathe, Gavin fought his way to\nhis feet.\nHe’d knelt long enough.\nSo his suspicion was right, and his long-held intuition was wrong. So his\nfirst great goal would go unmet. The world was as it was. Only one thing\nwas left for him to do.\nHe would pick up the sword, and he would hack at the very peak of the\ntower until he broke the Blinding Knife. He would carve the word ‘Lies’\ninto the very rock. And then, one last time, he would fly—as he hurled\nhimself from the tower to a well-deserved death.\nChapter 80\nKip considered lying, of course. He was still a Guile.\n“My father had hidden a box in a training bag. I was kicking it when I\nheard something break. I was drafting, maybe all the colors at once, and I\nopened the bag and the cards flew out onto my skin. I… somehow absorbed\nthe cards. Not on purpose. I lost consciousness and nearly died, but Teia\nwas able to revive me. When she pried the cards off my skin, they were\nblank.”\n“But you Viewed them,” Andross said.\n“Not in any way that I could make sense of,” Kip said. “I saw them all at\nonce. It killed me. Literally. My heart stopped. It, it felt like… It obliterated\nmy mind. I couldn’t tell who I was anymore.”\n“But they’re not lost,” Andross insisted. “You’ve the Guile memory.”\n“In any meaningful sense, yes, they’re lost,” Kip said.\n“‘In any meaningful sense’? So in some other sense they’re not. Tell me\nhow they’re not lost. Tell me what you experienced.”\nOf course it was like this. Kip had inadvertently destroyed the world’s\nmost valuable intelligence. Of course Andross was going to go after the\nscraps.\nSo Kip started talking. What did it matter, now, with their doom coming\ndown on their heads? Kip ended up telling him about the Great Library and\nthe immortal or djinn or whatever Abaddon was, with his broken ankles and\npistol and that cracked mask of a visage. He skipped the master cloak. That\nwas Teia’s secret now, not Kip’s.\nAndross got a funny look as Kip told him about the immortal, but if it\nwas disbelief, clearly he decided not to challenge Kip on it right now.\nThat was the great joy of speaking with Andross Guile, of course: you\nknew everything you said would be used against you sooner or later.\n“Tell me every card name you remember.”\nKip told him. It didn’t take very long. He ended by saying, “And there"

He was writing a letter to the Color Prince, a treasonous letter about\nbecoming Dagnu. He was cowled, though, as you used to be. And his hands\nwere stained crimson like a red drafter who’s gone wight.”\n“Ah, that’s why you tried to assassinate me after the Battle of Ru,”\nAndross said.\n“That is… not what happened. And we both know it,” Kip said.\n“No, it’s not,” Andross admitted. “You remember no more of that card?”\n“No. Not then or ever. One glimpse.”\nAndross believed him, he could tell.\n“Now, I’ve fulfilled the terms of my wager,” Kip said. “More than\nfulfilled them.”\n“Tell me about these flashbacks you ‘sometimes’ get.”\n“That wasn’t part of the deal,” Kip said.\n“They’re part of the cards you destroyed, and it may be the key to saving\nus all, and who better to help you disentangle a puzzle than I?” Andross\nasked.\nSo Kip told him all about that, too.\nAndross ended up shaking his head. “Off saving one satrapy when you\ncould have been uncovering the mysteries of the Thousand Worlds that\ncould save us all.”\n“Perhaps,” Kip admitted, “but I’m not a man to sit idle while my people\nbleed.”\nIt caught Andross up short. He marveled at it. “An honest statement of\nyour limitations, but without apologies nor posturing that those limits\nsomehow make you superior to other differently gifted men. Hmm. I know\nmen twice your age who are less comfortable with themselves.”\n‘Comfortable with myself’? Kip thought that was the first time anyone\nhad ever said that about him. But he supposed he had made some progress\non that front in the last few years.\n“You didn’t get all the new cards,” Andross said.\n“Excuse me?” Kip asked.\n“Gavin left the bulk of them where he hoped you would find them, but\nsome he considered too sensitive for you.”\nA shock passed through Kip, tightening his throat and turning his bowels\nto water. “How would you even know he did such a thing?”\n“It’s what I would do. There are some things I wouldn’t want my own\nson to know.”\n“And?” Kip asked.\n“Naturally, I found them.”\n“He left them for Karris, didn’t he?” Kip guessed.\nAndross Guile only hesitated a moment. “Curious,” he said. “That’s the\nkind of thing Felia would have done. That much of an intuitive leap, so\nquickly.”\n“Does Karris know about them?” Kip asked.\n“Of course not. You don’t show the other players your hole cards,\nespecially not literal ones.”\nHe flicked his gaze up to Grinwoody, who he suddenly realized was\nhanging on every word, as if he knew none of this. “More whiskey, calun,”\nKip said."

Maybe Kip should have called him by name to insult him.\n“Where’s this going?” Kip asked.\nAndross weighed him while Grinwoody served them both. Though he’d\nchosen a fast-game variant, he now gave no indication of hurry in his\nmanner and seemed not to worry at all about the calamity bearing down\nupon them.\n“The truth?” Andross said.\nA smart-ass comment leapt to mind, but Kip the Lip clamped his jaw\ntight shut. Hectoring Andross wasn’t going to help anything.\nAndross waved Grinwoody away. “Go, now, for a bit. Some few things\nare too secret even for you.”\nGrinwoody retreated to stand with his back turned toward them, close\nenough to hear and return instantly if Andross called. Andross produced a\nlong key, opened a locked drawer in the table, and withdrew a card box. He\nhanded it to Kip.\nNonchalantly, Kip flipped open the box. And his heart stopped.\nIt was the deck he’d absorbed. The new deck Janus Borig had painted—\nthe deck Kip had destroyed, erased.\n“Not originals,” Andross said. “These cards can’t be Viewed. They’re\npaint and gold and parchment and lacquer only. There is no magic in them.”\n“How did you…?”\n“Janus had enemies. She kept this deck far from her home in a place she\nthought was safe. She hoped that if she were killed, some future Mirror\nwould might be able to use these to re-create her work.”\n“How’d you get them?”\n“Please,” Andross Guile scoffed.\n“You killed her? She was too dangerous to you.”\n“Don’t be ridiculous. I don’t destroy what I might better use. And I had\nmany questions for her. Some other player did that, and not necessarily\neven a major one.”\n“Why have me describe them if you already have them all?” Kip asked.\n“For one reason above all: it tells me you’re honest, that you’ll make\ngood on a wager, even to me. I had to establish that first. Now, with that\ndone, I believe it’s time for our second game,” Andross said. “If you win,\nI’ll give you Gavin’s card. The original.”\nKip’s heart seized. His father’s card?! The original? That meant he could\nView it.\nAnd if it truly wasn’t retrospective, and if he used it properly, he could\nfind where his father was now.\nIt was everything he’d hoped to do, simply offered by his grandfather.\nBut that was if he won.\nIf the reward for victory was so enormous, what would the cost of losing\nbe?\n“Wait,” Kip said. “Why wouldn’t you want me to View that card\nregardless? Don’t you want him back? What did you see when you Viewed\nit yourself?” Andross wasn’t a full-spectrum polychrome, but surely he\nwould have—\n“I’ve not tried.”"

Perhaps if you win,\nyou’ll find out what they are. I don’t know. That’s what makes it such very,\nvery good bait. I mean, such a very good wager.”\n“What’s the price of defeat?” Kip asked.\nA cat who’d stolen your dinner couldn’t have grinned with the mixture\nof malevolence and self-satisfaction that Andross showed. “You lose, and\nI’ll show you another card. You’ll View it for me and tell me everything you\nsee.”\n“That… doesn’t sound that bad,” Kip said.\n“Well, then, you win, win or lose.” Andross voice was so blithely\npleasant, it could have been honey and melted butter.\nWhich was all the evidence Kip needed that it was covering the taste of\narsenic.\nAndross Guile would never offer uneven stakes that were tilted toward\nhis opponent.\nKip wanted to think, How bad can it be?\nBut he remembered the card The Butcher of Aghbalu. He remembered\nthe months of nightmares he’d had from watching the massacre unfold—no,\nnot just watching but partaking in it, over and over. What if the card was\none of those cards?\nBut it was his father against that.\nDid it matter now? Kip wasn’t going to be able to save him. But Karris\ndeserved to know. The Blackguard deserved to know. Someone might help\nhim, even if it wasn’t Kip.\n“Ah, one further stipulation,” Andross said. “Whichever way the game\ngoes, you have to View whichever card you get, and you have to answer my\nquestions about it.”\n“So you win, win or lose, too,” Kip said.\n“Yes, isn’t it nice that we can play a game so mutually beneficial?”\n“Why do you want me to do this?” Kip asked.\n“My son has a knack for showing up at the last moment and wrecking\nall sorts of plans. Usually the enemy’s, but not always. Either card you\nView might tell us my son’s location. Should he arrive quite suddenly in the\nnext day or so, I should like very much to make sure that I enact the correct\nplan for this most important Sun Day.”\nNow, finally, Kip understood why Andross had said there was nothing\nmore important for them to be doing than this. Preparations for battle? The\npeople they each commanded could do most of those. Unfolding the past\nand the present itself? Only they could do this.\nAnd it meant helping his father either way.\n“Let’s play,” Kip said.\nAndross chose conventional rules. Kip chose decks he was familiar\nwith. He even added cards from the array Grinwoody brought in once more,\nbased on what he guessed of how the Black Cards would affect the\nstrategies.\nIt was close. Damn close.\nHe came to his last turn. His facedown deck held fourteen cards. He\ncould only draw one, and any one of four cards left in that stack would give\nhim the victory."

Out of fourteen.”\n“How do you know I don’t have it in my hand already?”\n“A man doesn’t pray over his last draw when he has the winning card in\nhand.”\nOf course Andross knew exactly what Kip was looking for. Kip couldn’t\nfind it in himself to hate the old spider, not for this. Hating Andross Guile\nwas like hating the weather. If the sun burns your head, you don’t shake\nyour fist at the sun; you blame yourself for not wearing a hat.\nThe game had been fair. Kip had watched for any cheats, eagle-eyed.\n“You want to back out?” Andross asked, amused. “The odds are against\nyou. Failure might break your spirit… Breaker.” He said it with a light\nderision, as if Kip was trying on names like a child tries on his parents’\nfancy clothes and big hats.\n“Not ‘Breaker.’ I prefer ‘Diakoptês,’” Kip said. For some reason\nGrinwoody flinched at that. “My father told me once that the odds were\nagainst us, but that odds are for defying.”\nKip drew.\nHe lost.\nChapter 81\n“Grinwoody,” Kip said. “Go fetch a bucket for me. I may vomit. Also, get a\nphysicker. One with experience starting stopped hearts. Or better yet, the\nBlackguard Adrasteia.”\n“Teia’s disappeared,” Andross said. “Some time ago now. Absent\nwithout leave. I think they thought she might have gone to join you and\nyour Mighty. No?”\nKip shook his head.\nIt was terrible, but the first thing Kip felt was relief. He wasn’t going to\nhave to face her yet. Not that that was really in the top ten things he ought\nto worry about right now.\nThen his chest tightened as Andross went to a combination safe and\nopened it. He brought out a tiny vellum book, barely larger than a card\nitself. With careful fingers, he unwound the string from the button holding it\nshut and lay the covers open. Without touching any part of the card, he\noffered it.\nKip took the card by the edges, careful not to touch its face. He lay it on\nthe table before him. The card depicted a golden ship, glowing in the sun,\nsails full-bellied, cutting through easy seas. It was exquisite art, as all of\nJanus Borig’s had been, and obviously done by her hand.\n“Some water, calun,” Kip said. After all this time, he’d finally learned\nnot to say please to a slave. Not that Grinwoody was any normal slave. “But\nopen the window first. I need full-spectrum light.” He turned to Andross.\nThis card didn’t look threatening in the least. “The Golden Mean?

Anyway, it was sold to an Ilytian cannon\nmaker from Smussato named Phineas, and from there it’s been seen in\nnumerous ports, though of unknown ownership. Not least, it was here. On\nthe Jaspers. Not five weeks ago.”\n“How do you know it has anything to do with Gavin?” Kip asked.\n“Because I tried to View it myself.”\n“And?”\n“Searching an item card for one person who’s touched it isn’t a matter of\nstrength of will but of singularity of focus. I think you have that in a way I\ndon’t. When I look for Gavin, my attention is bifurcated, and my intentions\nare muddied. I was able to establish only that he has been on that ship in the\nrecent past. You’ll do better.”\nGrinwoody set down Kip’s water, and there was an odd intensity about\nthe man, a tension about him that touched those Blackguard senses that Kip\nhad begun to develop, something that spoke of danger. Kip looked at the\nolder man then, but Grinwoody was all placid subservience. Surely he’d\nmerely been echoing the tension in his master, who was meeting with a man\nGrinwoody surely thought might be a threat to Andross. After all,\nGrinwoody had had Blackguard training himself.\nKip dismissed it. Why was he focusing on a mere slave rather than on\nthe fiercest intellect he’d ever known?\n“Open the windows,” Kip said.\nBut Grinwoody only looked to his master.\n“The drapes are open,” Andross said.\n“That gives me seven colors,” Kip said. “I have a feeling I’m going to\nneed nine.”\nAndross gestured, and Grinwoody went and opened the large windows,\nbathing Kip in unfiltered light.\nThere wasn’t need for much of any color, and Andross helpfully had\nblocks of every color large enough for Kip to draw source from, but as Kip\nfinished with chi—his pupils squeezed down to nothing—he understood\nAndross’s fear of the cards for the first time. Kip’s gallium necklace felt\nheavy against his chest, concealing the chi bane within it, and Kip felt a\ntwinge of fear as he thought for the first time, What if there’s a card of this\nnecklace? What if Andross knows everything?\nBut unhurried, Kip stared at the Golden Mean card on the table and set\nhis fingers down on it, one by one, concentrating on his father alone.\nKip was the eager face of the prow cutting through azure waves, his\ndecks gliding frictionless through the upbearing seas. He was the strain of\nthe mast against the wind, two old friends leaning against each other as they\nwalked home tipsy.

And from the lack\nof distress in those somehow-distant voices of his crew, these were mere\npractice volleys with the many cannons.\nFather, where are you?\n“I feel him lying on the deck of the forecastle,” Kip said, eyes closed.\nHis senses were limited; it wasn’t like standing on the ship himself, but\nmore an awareness of things within a certain bubble of the ship. “He’s\nskinny. Wearing an eye patch? Talking with someone, but I can’t hear what\nthey’re saying. Now he’s talking to Gunner. I recognize him, somehow.\nThey’ve got a man strapped over the mouth of a cannon. A huge cannon\nmounted on the forecastle. Um… lost it.” As Gavin stood up, his body no\nlonger touching the deck, but only his feet doing so, he became harder to\nhold.\n“There was some kind of luxin storm,” Kip said. “But he slept through\nit, maybe?” Kip had sharpened his focus to his father at the wrong time, it\nseemed. He would have liked to know what an orange-luxin storm looked\nlike—but he wasn’t going to try to go back now. “And now it’s a new day.\nWe’re circling something for a while. An island and—whoa. There’s a battle\nnow. Maybe, maybe a battle. Lots of men running. Gavin’s climbed up into\nthe crow’s nest. He’s shouting.” His mouth moved as he shouted, and Kip\ntried to read his lips. “I think he just shouted, ‘Sea demon.’ There’s\nsomething terrible happening. They’re firing my guns. They dropped my\nstarboard anchor.”\nKip grunted as the anchor tore free of his decks like someone tearing off\na fingernail. Then the cannons boomed, his decks strained, the oars rattled\nout. “Something—” And then Kip felt the bony hammer of the sea demon’s\nhead crush him against the anvil of coral. Gavin was flung away. Decks tore\nlike paper. Men were smashed, rigging tore, and bits of Kip’s consciousness\nwere flung into the seas: a shotgun blast of wood and rope and blood and\nmetal.\nHe tore his fingers away from the card and found himself in the room\nonce more. “He’s gone.”\n“Gone? Dead?”\n“I think so. He was flung from the crow’s nest. The ship was crushed\nagainst a reef by a sea demon.”\n“Go back. Be certain!”\nKip didn’t argue. He wasn’t going to give up on his father, not while\nthere was still a chance.\nHe found the time again and replayed it once more—though it felt like\nrubbing an open wound. He went beyond it, tried to search the seas.\nHe could feel the presence of sharks before his awareness faded from\nthose scattered, dead bits of himself. “The bay is full of sharks,” he heard\nhimself saying. “With several sea demons outside it. But I can’t feel him\nanywhere now. There’s… there’s a bit of the forecastle left, perched on the\ncoral.”"

Nothing for a time, and then the awareness of a single\nsoul clambering up onto the forecastle.\nBut it wasn’t Gavin Guile. It was Gunner.\nKip stayed with him for days, but Gavin never came, and Gunner only\nseemed to get more and more desperate.\nHe pulled his hand away once more and told what he’d seen. “Maybe…\nmaybe he made it ashore?”\n“Several sea demons, you said?” Andross asked.\nKip nodded. He wished suddenly that he could have seen Andross’s face\nwhen he’d first given him the news that his last surviving son was now\nalmost certainly dead. Maybe there would have been a flicker of humanity\nin it then, but now he spoke with the merciless focus of a captain steering\nhis ship straight through a sandbar, scraping off the barnacles of wife and\nsons and grandsons and throwing into disarray everything in his life not\nbolted down, but always, always winning through the sand to victory and\nposition and pride.\n“He might have lived,” Kip said. “A reef means there’s an island close,\nright?” If he survived the initial collision. If he were flung into the bay\nrather than the open sea. If he weren’t knocked unconscious by the fall. If\nhe made it past the sharks.\nIf, if, if.\n“Was there a wall of mist? At the reef?”\n“Not… not that I was aware of?” Kip said. “But… awareness isn’t so\ngood in the cards. Why?”\nAndross hmphed. “There are stories that the sea demons circle White\nMist Reef. If you saw several of them, he must have been there. I wonder\nwhy. But it doesn’t matter. It’s an island, you said. Even if he survived, even\nif he finds another ship, there are sea demons infesting the waters there.\nVery well. That tells me all I need to know. Gavin’s dead, or at least dead to\nus. He’s not coming back. Certainly not in time to help. Not in time to\nchange anything. Which tells me that our last game is necessary.”\nHis father was dead. There would be no Gavin Guile swooping in to\nsave him at the last moment. It had been one thing to hear he was gone, and\nanother to admit it might be true but hold on to hope, but now? “I’m done,”\nKip said, moving to stand. “I don’t want to play anymore.”\n“You get out of that chair and I will pop your eyes out with my thumbs\nand fuck your skull until you bite off your swollen black tongue and drown\nin a bucket of your own blood.”\nFor a moment Kip was a terrified little boy again, his mother hurling the\ncooking pot and the fire poker at him, shrieking at him like a wounded\nanimal. He dropped back into his seat, baffled.\n“The gold box,” Andross said to Grinwoody, his voice abruptly cool\nonce more, though he didn’t take his eyes off Kip. “And the Ilytians. And\nput the decanter on the table.”"

He put the\ncrystal decanter of amber liquor on the playing table itself. Then he brought\nout the Ilytian bladed pistols Kip had last seen Gavin wearing. Andross\nchecked them to confirm they were loaded and laid them across his lap,\npointed toward Kip.\n“Eighteen-year-old Crag Tooth,” Andross said. “Their very first batch.\nIt’s worth a fortune. I opened it especially for you.” His former savagery\nhad evaporated, but Kip would never forget it. Andross waved Grinwoody\naway.\n“My lord…” Grinwoody said. “I must protest. This one has shown\nreckless disregard before. I worry for your safety.”\nKip was still blinking, trying to recover his breath and his wits.\nAndross said, “Do you know, I paid more for this whiskey than I did for\nGrinwoody?”\nTrying to repair his façade of calm detachment, Kip said, “The market\nprice of slaves was a sadly overlooked part of my education.”\n“‘Education’?” Grinwoody asked coolly.\nAndross laughed. “His owner noted his intelligence and was training\nhim as a legalist before his ability to draft manifested, and was putting him\ninto Blackguard training. He wasn’t the only dual-use slave I bought, of\ncourse. The others were very interested in honor… prestige… making a\ndifference. Grinwoody said only two things to me. Do you remember,\nGrinwoody?”\nThe old slave inclined his head but made no move to finish his master’s\nstory.\n“He asked, ‘Will you beat me if I don’t deserve it?’ I told him no, and\nI’ve kept my word. I’ve only beaten him twice. Both times for\nimpertinence. Both times in the first year. After he understood the\nboundaries, we’ve gotten along quite well. And then when I asked if he\nwould die for me if necessary, he said, let’s see, how’d he put it? ‘For you,\nyes. I’d prefer not to die for a lesser man.’ A lesser man, you understand,\nKip? This slave, this nothing, he dared to judge his betters, but not so far\nthat he wouldn’t do his duty. He didn’t really want to be in the Blackguard,\nbecause Blackguards have to guard whoever happens to be Prism or on the\nSpectrum or sits in the White’s High Seat or, horror of horrors, the Black’s\nLow Seat if necessary. He could tell that some of them were great, whilst\nsome were merely born to a lucky station. He fulfills his duties to the\nutmost, but he doesn’t step beyond his station. You understand?”\n“Oh, that’s a very subtle lesson, High Lord Promachos,” Kip said. “I\nwon’t forget who’s who here. I guarantee it.”\nAndross lifted the bottom of the box out and revealed two decks. “Look\nthrough these while I tell you the stakes.”\n“I’m not going to like this, am I?” Kip asked, accidentally saying it\naloud.\n“That depends,” Andross said. “How’s your marriage?”"

Did you think I was going to let that slide?”\nKip shuddered, and he wasn’t rightly sure if it was from disgust or rage\nor fear.\n“If I went to Rath, Eirene Malargos would have put me in a cage,” Kip\nsaid. “Metaphorically if not literally. She’d never have let me leave the\npalace.”\n“Much may be accomplished from a single building, if it’s the right\none,” Andross said. “I should know.”\nKip realized the old man had practically ruled the world from the\nPrism’s Tower, so he couldn’t exactly contradict that. “Only if one’s already\nestablished the right contacts out in the world. I’m a young man, not an old\none. I don’t have the web you do. What I did was far more valuable to you\nanyway.”\n“At this point, the outcome is less the issue than your obedience is.”\n“You’re upset because I showed you that you were wrong,” Kip said.\n“You’re so far removed from every human emotion, you have no idea what\nloyalty even looks like. I could be the king of Blood Forest right now if I\nhadn’t decided to come here and save your ass, old man. You want me to\nleave? I’ll go.”\n“You seem to think I’d give you that option.”\n“You seem to think I couldn’t take it.”\nAndross sighed. Then he lifted the pistols from his lap. He cocked them.\nOne stayed close to his body, a backup, out of reach. The other he extended\nover the table, the blade under the barrel reaching like an accusing finger.\nKip didn’t move back, and Andross tapped that dagger point against his\nforehead. “Kip, you didn’t come here to save me, and those you came to\nsave can’t leave with you, so we both know you’re not going anywhere. It\nisn’t in you to run from a fight, not even one you think you’ll lose. You\nleaving was always a bluff, and I’ve called it.”\nIt was true.\n“You’re an asshole.”\nAndross chuckled as if it were a compliment. “A man who’ll never risk\nbeing seen as an asshole is a man who doesn’t believe in anything.”\n“You only believe in yourself,” Kip shot back.\n“No,” Andross said. “Not for a long while now.” He set the pistols down\non the table between them. He spun one so it pointed toward him.\nKip realized he might mean a couple different things by it, but he didn’t\ncare to guess. “So what do you believe in?”\nAndross took a sip of his whiskey. “I believe I’ll finish the game.”\nKip threw his hands up. “Always the game!”\nAndross opened a drawer and pulled out two zigarros.

He offered the other to Kip, who\naccepted. He trimmed and lit his own, only then noticing that Andross was\nglancing at his luxin-reactive Turtle-Bear tattoo as he did so.\nOrholam! Was everything Andross did about gathering intelligence?\n“Look at us, Kip. While others scurry about like ants whose home has\nbeen stepped on, we smoke and drink and play cards and decide the fate of\nthe world. What happens to our world for the next century turns on the next\ntwenty minutes here in this room, and none of those below even know it.\nDoesn’t it make you feel like a god?”\n“I don’t want to feel like a god,” Kip said. But he wasn’t sure that was\ntrue. He’d told Tisis he was going to die, and he believed it. But he didn’t\nwant to die.\nHe sipped the whiskey, and even he could tell that it was very smooth. It\nalmost didn’t taste like chewing on peat. He sucked on the zigarro, and\ncouldn’t tell much about it except that blowing smoke was itself actually\nkind of satisfying. “What are the stakes?” he asked, defeated.\n“If you win,” Andross said, “I’ll make you Prism. And I’ll protect you\nfrom Zymun, who’s plotting to kill you. There are caveats, though. Not\neven I can do such a thing instantly. The Spectrum would find its spine and\nrebel if I forced such a thing through with no notice at all, and we can’t\nafford that now. But Zymun will be dealt with, and you’d be Prism-elect for\nthe next year. But you’ll have the full force of my powers protecting you\nduring that time. I swear that, should you win this next game, you’ll be the\nnext Prism.”\nJanus Borig had told Kip he wasn’t going to be the next Prism. But she\nwas a Mirror, not a Seer, right?\nBut Zymun being dealt with? Kip having the authority to be able to\ndefend these islands, without interference?\nMaybe Janus had meant Kip would die before he became Prism.\n“That’s a… tempting prize,” Kip said. “I’m guessing you have some\ntruly odious stakes you wish me to offer in return.” His chest was tight. He\nknew this old spider.\n“So suspicious, dear grandson.” Andross puffed on his zigarro, the ash\nglowing red with each puff like the evil eye winking at him.\n“And…?” Kip said. “What are your stakes?”\n“King Ironfist will arrive very soon. He has a young cousin whom he’s\ngoing to make the Nuqaba. Maybe already has. She’s eighteen, maybe\nnineteen years old. Devout, though everyone knows her dear older cuz will\nbe directing her every move.”\n“King Who?” Kip interrupted.\nAndross looked genuinely shocked for a moment. Then a big, toothy-cat\ngrin spread on his face. In the least convincing voice he could probably\nmanage, he said, “Oh, Kip, I’m so sorry. Do you really not know? Have you"

Now, what were you saying?”\n“This actually depends on you accepting the reality of the situation,”\nAndross said, growing serious.\n“I don’t see what you gain from that kind of lie,” Kip said. “I can check\non it in no time, and we’ve both got things to do.”\nAndross said, “Not a lie.”\n“Ironfist wouldn’t betray the Chromeria. His brother died for me.”\n“Yes—because of me, as he sees it. And then his insane, treasonous,\ndrug-addled sister the Nuqaba died under mysterious circumstances—which\nhe also blames the Chromeria for.”\nRightly, Kip guessed. And just like that, he believed it. He’d changed\nsince he’d left the Chromeria, why wouldn’t Ironfist? Andross had stripped\nhim of his position, and then tried to murder him? Oh God. “So he’s\ndeclared himself king?” Kip asked.\n“There are places in this world where one is either at the top or dead.\nPerhaps he believed Paria was one of those. Regardless, we need to bring\nParia back into the fold. For the war, and for all the other wars that will\nfollow if we don’t.”\n“You seriously lost Paria? Brilliant leadership, grandfather!”\n“And you’re going to help me get it back,” Andross said, eyes flashing.\n“What’s this got to do with this girl, Ironfist’s cousin or whatever.”\n“If I win, you marry her.”\n“Wha—I’m already married.”\n“Ah.” Andross gestured with his zigarro as if Kip had a point, as if it\nwere too bad.\nKip’s brow furrowed. What in nine hells? “Not even a promachos can\nabsolve centuries of Magisterial teachings against polygamy, and I can’t\nimagine the Parians would countenance having their Nuqaba be the second\nwife of anyone.”\n“Of course not,” Andross said blandly.\n“You’re not suggesting…”\n“Ruthgar’s fate is tied to ours now. They cannot leave us. Your marriage\nto Tisis has accomplished what the satrapies required. Now you’ll put her\naside. Your marriage will be annulled—you were a minor at the time of\nyour oaths, and you both married against the consent of your families. It\nwill simply be acknowledged not to have happened. Rather than lose face,\nEirene Malargos will have to pretend it’s mutual. Marriage dissolved,\nexcused as the passions of youth, and so forth. No problem. Your failure to\nproduce a child will actually be helpful. A child would have been a\ncomplication.”\nOrholam’s agonies. It was exactly what Tisis had predicted, only much\nearlier than even she had guessed.\n“Why would you do this to me?” Kip asked, breath short.\n“The Parians have a fleet and the best mundane fighters in the world. We\nneed both. In fact, with what you’ve told us about the White King’s fleet,"

In fact, with what you’ve told us about the White King’s fleet,\nwe now need them both far more than I thought we did just a week ago.\nAnd he and his fleet are almost here. If we are to have any hope of victory,\nIronfist must be convinced to join us. A man who’s declared himself king. A\ntraitor, you understand, must be convinced to make common cause with us,\nor the empire will end.\n“He will demand we recognize him as king. He will want guarantees—\nand we will be in no position not to give them to him. Naturally, losing\nParia would be our fallback position. But better to lose Paria than the whole\nempire. What I hope to accomplish? Immediate rapprochement with Paria,\nalbeit with special status granted to Ironfist himself for the rest of his life.\nHe will be rewarded with very choice ‘presents’ at your wedding as ‘small\nsymbols of our long love for Paria and its leadership.’ Ironfist will be made\nvery wealthy; he will have enough power and the control of his Nuqaba to\nmake sure he isn’t betrayed or imprisoned in the future; and we will have\nsaved the empire from this immediate crisis. And if I don’t miss my guess,\nas a wedding gift Ironfist will grant you substantial lands in Paria that the\nGuiles haven’t owned since my grandfather’s and great-grandfather’s time.\nYou will spend your time between your lands and the major Parian cities,\nmaking sure no new rebellion is planned against the empire, and making as\nmuch of yourself as you will. When I die, you will take over family Guile,\nhaving been given all the advantages I never had.\n“Naturally, that’s only one way the negotiations may go, but I need to\nknow what cards I have in hand so I can do the best for the Seven Satrapies\nthat may be done, and after that the best I can do for the Guile family, and\nafter that the best for my grandson’s oh-so tender feelings.”\n“This is disgusting,” Kip said.\n“This is survival, you preening microcephalic baboon! Exactly which\npart of survival do you object to? Morality’s a warm blanket, but it’s not\nworth dying for, and it’s useless to the dead. I have been the one who’s paid\nthe price for our survival until now.

Now it’s your turn. You want the power? You pay the price.”\nKip tried to keep a level voice, tried to speak to Andross in a way he\ncould understand. “You’re asking me to go back on my oath.”\n“I’m asking you to save a million lives with your semen and your tears\n—and you’d prefer they die instead?”\n“I swore Tisis a solemn oath. I—”\n“When you swear to do what you don’t have the power to do, that makes\nyou a fool, not a liar.”\n“I swore a hundred times!”\n“You swore a hundred times because you knew the keeping of that oath\nwas out of your control.

He was willing to break Tisis with his\ndeath but not with his betrayal.\nNot even if it saves tens of thousands of lives in this battle alone?\nHundreds of thousands or a million eventually?\nHe said, “You loved Felia, you adored her, she was the heart of your\nheart. I know she was. Even those who hate you remark that she, she was\nthe one thing in this world you loved. Would you have betrayed her? Would\nyou have betrayed her for all the world?”\nAndross’s face grew still and his eyes, gleaming like iridescent-edged\nrazors, turned inward. “For all the world, Kip, I did.”\nAnd Kip felt suddenly like a young dandy lecturing an old veteran on\nthe costs of war.\nThis was war for the fate of the world. This was war as seen from the\nvantage of politics, with prices paid in grief and private wounds and terrible\ncompromises and personal failures that could cost the deaths of entire\nfamilies or entire empires. Andross was the high commander, sacrificing\nunits to gain objectives, sending envoys to their deaths on mere slim\nchances, and making grand gambles that could cost everything. The\ncurrencies were different, but what warrior, having cut down an unarmed,\nfleeing enemy, could say that his way of fighting was cleaner?\nIf anyone should understand Andross Guile now, it was Kip.\nKip himself had thought Antonius Malargos a limited general for\nunderstanding tactics but never strategy. Andross must be looking at him\nthe same way right now.\nThe old man spoke again, almost gently. “That bit where we’ll excuse\nyour first marriage as foolish young love isn’t a convenient lie, son. I gave\nyou this year to enjoy life as lesser men may. But this is our yoke. Lesser\nmen give their sweat in labor, give their blood in battle, and give their tears,\nbut their love is their own, if they’re strong enough or lucky enough to\nclaim it. Our duties are different from theirs. Our bodies are pampered, but\nwe pay the price with our souls. We belong not to ourselves. All men are\nbrothers in this, all are captives twisted on the rack until the executioner,\nLife, has wrung all our vital fluids from us: sweat, and blood, and tears from\nthe commons; and blood, luxin, ink, semen, and tears from us.\n“We need those ships and those men, grandson. Excellent mundane\nfighters, against the bane? Who else has a chance? Ironfist’s fleet could stop\nthe armada and the bane before they even arrive! And Ironfist likes you. If I\ntie his family back into ours, we can survive this.\n“I’m getting ahead of myself, but naturally, should we survive, you’ll\nhave to produce an heir immediately, especially after not producing one\nwith your first wife… but even should Ironfist make the marriage\ncontingent upon children being born to our families, it still buys us a fleet\nfor this week. So after the battle, stop drafting sub-red for a while. Impedes\nfertility.”"

Kip hadn’t even noticed his return.\n“But if I win this game,” Kip said, “all those things will still be true.\nYou’ll still need the fleet. You’ll still want everything else long-term, too.”\n“I have another grandson to marry off, worse luck for that poor girl. If\nyou win, I’ll just have to gamble that with time so pressing, Ironfist won’t\nbe able to look too deeply into Zymun’s affairs or his character. I had hoped\nto spend him elsewhere. But I’ll have you know: if you win—if you\nbecome Prism, things might actually be worse for you. Ironfist might\nalready know about Zymun’s character. Then you won’t be able to blame\nme when you put Tisis aside.”\n“You make this sound like it’s all cold intellect and unblinking rationale.\nIt’s not.”\n“Oh?” Andross asked.\n“You’re punishing me.”\n“Oh, absolutely.”\n“Why? I brought an army of drafters back here! I’ve done more for this\nfamily than anyone. And more for the Seven Satrapies, too!”\n“Your disobedience destroyed my plans,” Andross said.\n“Your plans were shit! You underestimated me. You thought I was\nworthless, so you gave me a worthless post as a hostage in Ruthgar’s\ncourt.”\n“I don’t like to dwell on plans that went nowhere—”\n“Because you can’t admit that what I did was better. You, O Mighty\nAndross Guile, you were wrong!”\nAndross shook his head slowly. He tamped the ash off his zigarro.\nFinished his last sip of whiskey, then stopped Grinwoody from pouring him\nmore. “My tea now, I think,” he said. Then he looked at Kip once more.\n“Finished?”\n“Yes,” Kip said.\nHe was only delaying the inevitable.\nHe was going to have to play, wasn’t he?\n“Then know this,” Andross said. “If you’d obeyed me and gone to\nEirene Malargos, the Nuqaba would have been obligated to stay another\nweek or month while the preparations for your official wedding to Tisis\nwere made.

All that, grandson, is on you. All that happened so you could\ngo play boy soldier.

Nor would I\nhave let Eirene treat you like a hostage, much less a prisoner. Do you really\nthink I’d let the world see a Guile disrespected?”\n“If you’d told me, I wouldn’t have…” Kip said, but he sounded pathetic.\n“And you showed me you were trustworthy when?” Andross asked\nsharply.\nIn the last year, Kip had begun to feel that he was a somebody. That he\nhad something to contribute. That he was smart, brilliant even. That he’d\ndone good things.\nAnd he had.

How does this man make all my\naccomplishments look like shit before my own eyes?\nAnd if he can still do this to me—even if it’s not fair, and I fear that it is\n—then does that not, in itself, prove that he is better than I? Ten thousand\nmen might follow me to likely death, but Andross can turn a hundred\nthousand by his will and word alone.\nWho, then, is the greater? Who’s smarter?

The dying might march into the grave smiling behind Kip’s\nbanners, yet they would still be marching into the grave.\nHow exactly did that make Kip better than his grandfather?\nHow we must seem like insects to this man. Kip was a smart man. He\nknew that now. Without arrogance, without joking self-deprecation. It was a\nfact. But Andross Guile was as high above him as a man was over dogs.\nBy chain, or beatings, or simply by voice and with wagging tail and\nlolling tongue, in the end, Kip would obey him.\nHe might as well take the offered treat.\n“I’ll play,” Kip said, and it was a betrayal, and it was inevitable, and it\nwas freedom. “But there’s a condition.”\nChapter 82\n~The Master~\nThree years ago. (Age 63.)\n“It’s over, dear,” she says. “We were wrong. Join me in the Freeing this\nyear. Maybe we can find forgiveness for our sins together.”\n“We just need to hold out,” I say, adjusting my dark spectacles even as\nthe sun sinks low on the horizon. “The world needs us.”\n“So we believed,” Felia says quietly.\n“The time’s fast approaching. We knew what we were in for. Forty years\n—that’s only a few more!”\n“So we believed,” she says.\n“The Lightbringer is to be the greatest man of his era. Who else could it\nbe? Who is greater than I?”\n“You are a great man, Andross Guile,” she says calmly.\n“You’re patronizing me.”\n“Never,” she said, and I believe her.\n“You’re mollifying me, then? Why? Are you afraid of me now?”\n“It was never your greatness I questioned.”\n“That? Again? After all these years?! You think me a monster now?”\nHer tone sharpens for the first time: “Do you think me a fool? You think\nyou can hide your eyes from me? Your wife?”\nI look away. “Something can surely be done. I’m not finished yet—”\n“Take them off!” she snaps.\nI remove the dark lenses, revealing my broken halos.\nHer jaw tightens first, but then her mouth quivers.\n“It’s not—it’s not like they say,” I say. “It’s not madness.”\n“Of course you would say that. They all do.”\n“BUT IT’S ME!” I roar.\nIt is exactly the wrong thing to shout when one is a red wight. But she\ndoesn’t shrink. Closes her eyes only for a moment. There is no fear or\ntension on her face when she regards me.\nGod. She thinks I might kill her. That I really am mad. And yet she\nshows no fear.\nI cannot imagine such courage.\n“It’s me,” I whisper. “I always was special. I always was different. I was\nmeant to do—to, to be… but somehow it’s all gone wrong. This can’t be\nhappening. I couldn’t—we couldn’t have been wrong. We worked it out\nperfectly.”\n“There’s only one man in the world who could have fooled you, my\ndearest,” Felia says."

That this was all self-delusion? The hundred\nprophecies, the, the things we’ve seen? You think I wanted to do what\nwe’ve done?”\n“I think reason is the devil’s whore.”\n“I hate that line. Always have.”\n“You’ve always misunderstood it,” Felia says. “It doesn’t mean reason\nitself is corrupt. It means we use her to get what we want. We are the devil,\nand our reason is nothing more to us than the means by which we achieve\nour gratification. There’s always a purpose behind the questions we ask, and\nthere’s always an answer we’re really seeking, even if we keep our\npreferences secret even from ourselves.”\n“Now, that is a handy rhetorical bludgeon,” I sneer. “I can be accused of\nbeing nefarious or deceptive or malign at will. I’m simply so sneaky that I\ndon’t even know it myself.”\nShe takes a deep breath. “I don’t think you wanted to hurt… anyone.”\n“I’m not so fragile. You can say his name,” I snap. The red is rising in\nme.\nShe tries. But a wave of grief goes over her face. Maybe I can say his\nname, but she can’t. She hasn’t said Sevastian’s name three times since he\ndied.\n‘Since he died.’ Curious that I put it that way. Even in my own mind.\nI’ve always put it that way, even when I only think about him, don’t I?\n“I love you, Andross,” she says finally.\n“I’ve never doubted that.”\n“You should’ve. Because I didn’t, at first.”\n“What do you mean? You mean when we courted? Of course you did. I\nstill have your letters. I still have that night at the pyre dances with\nNinharissi emblazoned in my mind as with flames.”\nBut the memory doesn’t even elicit a smile, though it always has in the\npast. “No,” she says. “I had an instinct about you. I was so young. But\nsomehow, I felt the heart of you, more clearly and instantaneously than I\nhave ever understood another soul in all my life. Perhaps Orholam Himself\ngave me a special charism. Or a burden. For I didn’t choose you blindly.\nThat’s my curse. I chose this. When my father put you off for an entire\nweek? We made up all that stuff about Ninharissi later, after it was taking\nme too long. We did it because we worried it would sabotage the start of our\nmarriage, and make you think twice about me.”\n“What?!” I ask.\n“Did you really think my father became the richest man in the empire by\nbeing an affable goof who laughed too much at his own jokes like a\nsimpleton? Or that my mother was the boozy, brazen older lady susceptible\nto a bit of flattery? Andross, come on. We Dariushes are oranges all. Even"

He tried to be polite,\nbut thought you were a bit daft.”\n“It was a dragon, and it breathed fire! And I swore that little shit to\nsecrecy.” I’m suddenly glad he’s dead. Little fucker. I hope he was inside\nthe palace when they torched it.\nOf course, I can’t say any of that aloud. I can’t tell Felia anything she’ll\nfind wight-ish.\nGods fucking in a fire, what am I going to do if she threatens to report\nmy current state? One look at my eyes and… The law’s the law. That law\napplies even to men normally above it. It’s the one law that can’t be bought\nor bent. Voluntarily or not, wights must die. All the Chromeria’s power rests\non that plank.\nShe goes on. “I asked my father to put you off while I went to sit vigil,\nto ask what Orholam intended for me.”\n“I thought that was when I was still on my way.”\n“I try to wrap the little deceptions in as much truth as possible, so I don’t\nhave to worry so much about slipping later on. I haven’t got your memory.”\nI say, “I figured that was simply a good way to go party with your\nfriends for a while.”\n“If by ‘party’ you mean ‘pray,’ and by ‘friends’ you mean Janus Borig.”\nJanus Borig, one of my least favorite people. “The Mirror. That lying\nbitch.”\n“Are you so surprised a Mirror should deceive?”\n“Did she lie to you?” I ask. “Or was I special in that, too?”\n“Never to me,” Felia says. “She confirmed that I was right about you.”\n“Right about what?” I ask gruffly.\n“That you were unstoppable. That you would become the most powerful\nman in the world one day. That if any impediment stopped you from\nproving yourself peerless, you would smash it. That you would not be a\nPrism, but you would be a promachos one day. And that if you couldn’t rise\nwithin the structures of the Seven Satrapies, you would go outside them and\nrise regardless and take vengeance on all who stopped you. That you were a\nbad man, but one who had goodness in him. Goodness, we both hoped, that\nmight grow.”\n“You did tell me you were afraid of me, that night,” I say.\n“‘Afraid’ was the most tepid and colorless word I could find for how I\nfelt about you,” she says.\n“Thank you for that, dear. That is a story I could have gone down to the\ngrave not knowing. Lovely that you share it now. Thank you.”\n“I fell for you soon after that,” she says mournfully. “I did. Even though\nI could never claim real ignorance about what I was doing. I didn’t know\nwhat awaited us, but I knew who I was getting into it with.”"

You’re saying things that have never\nbeen true.”\n“You think me senile? Me?! I’m the mad one? Not you, the wight?”\n“You wouldn’t have approved of the things we did if you hadn’t\nbelieved. You wouldn’t have joined me in them.”\n“Andross, I didn’t love you so much I wanted to take over the world\nwith you. I loved the world so much that when you did, I wanted to be there\nto keep you from destroying it.”\n“You believed in what we’re doing. I know you did.”\n“Maybe I did. For surely the Lightbringer must be a man unstoppable.\nAnd then I fell in love with you, and I justified everything. I made my\nreason a whore. If you were the greatest man ever, that made me the right\nhand of the greatest man ever. That made me special. That justified my sins,\nmy suffering. Whatever was good for us was surely for the good of all. It is\nthe same convenient deception the powerful so often believe. And for it, I\nknow I’ll answer. But it didn’t matter what I believed. Not really. The\nLightbringer might be greater than Lucidonius himself, so of course you\nwould believe that person must be you. Lightbringer! Ha! You went to\nLucidonius’s statue and wept, because by the time he was your age, he’d\nconquered the world. You think you’re the Lightbringer because you\ncouldn’t bear to stand in another man’s shadow! You needed it. You need it\nstill. The text of every prophecy was illuminated by that need in you.

I won’t share a room with you anymore. Your face is\nas revolting to me as a bloody mirror.”\nChapter 83\nAndross had already been extending a pair of decks toward Kip, and his\neyebrows dipped, lips tightened. “Yes?”\nKip’s heart had leapt into his throat.\n‘You won’t be the next Prism,’ Janus Borig had told him. But was she\ntelling him—or was she steering him? But Kip wasn’t so worried about\nwhether the prophecy was predicting the future or forming it; he was\nwondering how it could help him.\nLike, if I play to become the next Prism, I’ll definitely lose. But if I play\nfor stakes other than becoming the next Prism, maybe I can win? But how\ncould the outcome of the game be affected by the choice of the stakes? It\nwas the same game, and Kip certainly wasn’t going to play differently\ndepending on what he won; he had too much to lose to give it anything less\nthan his best regardless. It didn’t make any sense.\nAnd Andross was the cold, unblinking master of Nine Kings. He\nwouldn’t play differently, either.\nUnless… unless the stakes were high enough to rattle even Andross\nGuile.\n“Please,” Andross said languidly. He sipped his almond tea. He didn’t\noffer Kip any. “Take your time. I’ve no other pressing matters to attend to\nwhile you sit there in uffish thought.”\nJanus Borig had said something else that night she died, hadn’t she? Not\njust ‘You won’t be Prism.’\n“If I win, I don’t want to be named Prism; I want you to publicly\nacknowledge me as the Lightbringer.”\nThe teacup hovered halfway to Andross’s mouth. His lower eyelids\ntensed and his eyebrows moved almost imperceptibly—merely surprise, or\nwas that fear?—then his lips narrowed and his eyes tightened, back into an\nexpression Kip had seen before.\n“Now, that was interesting,” Kip the Lip said. “Why would you be afraid\nof that?”\nThe anger hardened. “Not ‘afraid.’ It’s certainly audacious. I guess you\nlearned something about overawing your opponents when you demanded to\nbe made satrap in Dúnbheo. Well done. It won’t work here.”\n“My God,” Kip said, ignoring him. “You think you’re the Lightbringer!”\nThe stricken look on Andross’s face was priceless. And it was\nconfirmation.

He banged down his teacup and snatched up\na pistol and bolted out of his seat, sending his chair crashing. He cocked the\njaw and pointed the pistol at Kip’s upturned face. His hand trembled.\nKip looked at him, serene.\nAndross’s finger lifted from the trigger. He lowered the cockjaw,\nclearing his throat. Then he put the pistol back down on the table and sat in\nthe chair, which Grinwoody had put back in place.\nGrinwoody mopped up a bit of spilled tea.\n“Yes, I do,” Andross said. “Forty years of preparations, and gathering\nprophecies, and sacrificing… everything. Everything, that I might save our\nempire, and our very world. Well done, Kip, you have found me out. I\ndaresay not even Grinwoody had guessed it. Had you, Grinwoody?” he\nasked, turning to him.\n“No, my lord. I stand in awe, sir, that one could possibly conceal\nsomething so profound about one’s identity from the person at your very\nshoulder.” The slave bowed deeply, respectfully.\n“But… but you’re not even a full-spectrum polychrome,” Kip said. This\nhe hadn’t meant to say aloud.\n“Am I not?” Andross asked.\n“Holy shit,” Kip breathed. “You kept yourself from drafting half your\ncolors for forty years?!”\n“It was the least of my sacrifices, I assure you. But—” He raised a finger\nsuddenly, as if to forestall questions about what the other sacrifices were.\n“But I’ll admit that it’s not escaped my attention that there are certain ways\nof reading the prophecies that could indicate you are he, and certain\nqualifications that you currently lack might, after all, not emerge until\nyou’re older. I’ve thought about this no small amount. So… yes. Yes,\nshould you win, I will begin paving the way immediately; I will protect\nyou; and I will fully champion you the moment you’re ready to announce\nyour identity—in the unlikely event it’s not immediately apparent to the\nwhole world.”\n“Wait…” Kip said. “Just like that?” He’d imagined getting a little more\npushback. “I’m asking you to tell everyone I’m the most important person\nin history, not you. And you’re okay with playing a game for that? A single\ngame. Where I could get lucky.”\n“I think luck shall have very little to do with it,” Andross said.\n“I’m asking you to wager everything you’ve spent forty years pursuing,”\nKip said, though he wasn’t sure why he was arguing against his own case.\n“That’s like twice as long as I’ve even been alive.”\nThe irony of Kip taking his side evidently wasn’t lost on him, as\nAndross suddenly smiled. “There is now nothing in the world that could\nkeep me from this game, and this wager. For you see, I won’t be playing\nagainst you, Kip. I’ll be playing against Orholam Himself. For the answer\nto the question ‘Who is the Lightbringer?’ is not a name; it’s not a man or a\nwoman.

The answer to that question answers how Orholam interacts with\nthe world—if He does so at all.\n“I’m asking you to wager the most important thing in your life,”\nAndross said. “It’s only fair that you demand the same of me. Grinwoody,\nthe decks.”\nKip sat stunned, silent. There were too many questions—what\nprophecies did Andross know that Kip didn’t? If he were a full-spectrum\npolychrome, why had he had Kip View cards for him? What did this all\nmean?—but the cards were in front of him now, and those questions would\nhave to wait. He had to win first.\nShaking himself, breathing deeply, Kip began studying the play decks\nAndross had constructed mostly from Janus Borig’s new cards.\nHe looked up. “You didn’t.”\n“Seemed appropriate,” Andross said.\nThe old man had constructed decks to reflect the coming fight. There\nweren’t enough legendary characters who’d earned their own cards to fill\ntwo entire decks, but he’d done as well as he could. Plenty of wights on the\none side, the White King, drafters aplenty, lots of ships, and seven bane.\n“Six bane?” Kip suggested.\n“Your people may have only seen six, but I believe superviolet will\nshow up. That Danavis girl has a way of doing her own thing. In the last\nmonths, I’ve had reports from Aslal, Smussato, Cravos, Wiwurgh,\nGarriston, and Ru of a woman matching her description, traveling alone,\nwith no obvious transportation. The ravishing fairy princess in white and\ngold with amethyst eyes. Not the color of amethyst, but with jewels crusted\nover her very eyes themselves. And at the joints of her fingers, in some later\naccounts. Always inspecting old ruins. And the prophecies suggest seven\nwill come.”\nKip felt sick. He believed it. No matter what she’d told Kip, he’d held\non to some small hope that she was going to stay out of the battle, that she\nhadn’t forgotten herself completely.\n“We could’ve been a good team, you and I,” Kip said, finishing up with\nthe White King’s deck.\n“Pick a deck,” Andross said impatiently. “Ah, one moment.” He grabbed\nthe Chromeria’s deck before Kip could pick it up and snatched out a card,\nhanding it to Grinwoody. “Won’t be needing this.”\n“What was that?”\n“Gavin’s card. Since you established he’s not coming back in time, if he\never does.”\n“I’d like to see that card,” Kip said.\n“Really, right now?” Andross said. “It’s not an original. You can’t View\nit.”\n“Oh. Right. I… later, then.”\n“If you win,” Andross said.\n“That weakens the deck,” Kip said. Certainly his father’s card would\nhave to have been a powerful one.\n“Then pick the other deck, moron.

All you want,\nagainst all you have,” Andross said. “Isn’t that the wager life always\noffers?”\n“Agreed,” Kip heard his voice say. “More liquor, calun.”\nAs Grinwoody poured for him, Kip turned the next card of the\nChromeria deck, and chuckled. “Now, that’s a good one. After all you said\nabout him, you gave the Chromeria Ironfist?”\n“Without Gavin, the Chromeria needs Ironfist, or it loses every time.”\nAndross rubbed his nose for a moment. “Think of Nine Kings as an aid to\nthinking, the way an abacus is an aid to arithmetic. At some point one\nshould grow beyond the need for the physical prop, but the cards are\nactually best for those like you, who have difficulty looking at their friends\nand seeing them as a list of strengths and weaknesses—you, who would\nvacillate before spending two lives even if their deaths are necessary to\nforestall ten thousand more. This is why Nine Kings is more valuable for\nyou, but I am better at it, and better at politics as well.”\n“What you miss,” Kip said, “is that my friends will fight for me in ways\nthey would never fight for you. When led by one they know loves them,\nthey perform better than a number on a card could possibly capture.\nEverything that is most important about this game can’t be captured by a\ngame.”\n“Then you take the Chromeria deck,” Andross said. “Perhaps the cards\nwill fight extra hard for you.”\nKip shouldn’t have let him get away with that, shouldn’t have let him\nget under his skin. The Chromeria was clearly the inferior deck, but his\nvictory would be all the sweeter when he shoved Andross’s nose in it like\npressing a dog’s nose to his shit.\nIt was a mistake, and Kip knew it, but he couldn’t stop himself. “Fine,\nI’ll take it.”\nAndross separated the decks and shuffled them under Kip’s watchful\neyes.\nKip reshuffled and let Andross cut both decks.\nThe old man smirked. “It takes years to become a proficient cardist.”\n“With your memory?” Kip asked.\n“It’s the dexterity that’s challenging as one ages, and finding the time for\nthe continual practice.”\nIt was as close to an admission as Kip was likely to hear. “How many\ntimes have you cheated me that way?” Kip asked.\n“You think I had to cheat, before?”\n“Had to?” Kip said. “No. But you’re the kind of man who likes to\nguarantee victory, aren’t you?”\n“I’m also a man who likes a challenge.”\n“No doubt the only reason I’m still alive,” Kip said as they dealt out\ntheir cards.\n“There are others.”\n“Oh, pray tell,” Kip said lightly.\nAndross waved it away, studying his cards instead."

The other cards don’t have that spacing.

Is Aram still sucking at Zymun’s teat?” Kip asked.\n“Oh, yes,” Andross said. “He much preferred to report to me secretly on\nwhat Zymun is doing than be executed for his little indiscretion.”\n‘His little indiscretion’? Setting the Lightguard on Kip and murdering\nGoss, rather than letting them escape, was an indiscretion?\n“If I punch you in the face, do I lose automatically?” Kip asked.\nAndross merely considered him with his dead, shark’s eyes.\n“Aram’s men murdered a friend of mine,” Kip said. “One of the\nLightguards demanded to see me, and Goss said he was me. They shot him.\nNo other words spoken. So I know all this is a game to you, but you can go\nfuck yourself.”\n“You want justice for that? Fine. These are small matters for men such\nas us. Tell you what: as a gesture of goodwill, I’ll execute the man who\npulled the trigger, and Aram too. Done and done. The triggerman\nimmediately.

You should have\nbeen more than a great man; you should have been a good man.”\n“Your turn.”\nThey played the next few turns in silence.\nAndross was playing slowly. It wasn’t like him. It was, however, a good\nstrategy when your deck is significantly stronger—\nThere was a sharp rap on the wall. Grinwoody announcing someone.\nAnd then Kip saw that Andross really was running the game as a\nsimulation of the battle to come. The old man wouldn’t attack until noon,\nwhen he could play a bane, just as the White King wasn’t attacking until\nSun Day.\nAndross really thought he was going to get some insight about the battle\nfrom this.\n“High Lord, there’s someone here to see you,” Grinwoody said.\nAndross’s lip curled. “Grinwoody, I didn’t think that you could possibly\nfail to understand what this game means. Or what ‘I’m not to be disturbed’\nmeans.”\n“It’s Satrap Corvan Danavis, my lord.”\n“What?! How did he get here so fast?”\n“Upon your command that you not be disturbed, I turned away the\nmessenger bringing news his ships had been spotted, and also the\nmessenger who announced Danavis was coming directly here. You’ve been\ncloistered for quite some time.”\n“Grinwoody.” There was a warning in Andross’s tone.\n“My apologies, my lord,” Grinwoody said. “I’ll show him in\nimmediately.”\nAndross bundled his cards back together, squared the edges, and laid\nthem facedown on the table. He put his teacup on them, and drew on his\nzigarro while Kip followed his lead, each watching the other closely to\nmake sure neither took advantage of the disruption to cheat. Then they both\nrose and moved away from the table, each giving it a wide berth, and for the\nsame reason.\n“Kip!” Corvan cried out when he saw him.\nKip’s heart warmed instantly. Kip knew a lot of people who’d changed\nmonumentally in the last two or three years, but Corvan was almost exactly\nthe same—except he’d grown out his mustache and hung little gold beads\ninto it, as he’d worn it long years ago before he’d moved to Rekton.

Here was a\nman who was simply himself, whose idea of hiding his identity had been\nmoving away and shaving off his famed mustache, without even changing\nhis name. His eyes held the same old mix of sternness and contentment,\nwith an undertone of abiding grief, but there were no regrets there. He\nlooked strong.\nThey embraced, and Kip felt like a child again for half a moment.\nExcept now he was taller than his old guardian.\n“I hear those books you kept pilfering from my shelves have done you\nsome good,” Corvan said as he released Kip. “Though I’ve not heard a\ntactician’s account of the Battle of Dúnbheo yet. Everything I hear is all\ngiant bears and last-second traps and magic.”\n“I’ll be happy to fill you in,” Kip said, letting the man turn to the\npromachos.\n“Satrap Danavis,” Andross said respectfully. “Welcome to the\nChromeria. We are so sorry to hear about your bereavement.”\n“I received your funerary gifts. They helped ease my burdens,\nPromachos. Thank you.”\nAndross gestured that it was nothing.\n“Now I feel like an asshole for not sending anything,” Kip said. “I’m\nsorry, sir. I only found out you’d even remarried at the same time I heard of\nyour wife’s passing—yesterday. I’m so sorry.”\n“They were the best days of my life,” Corvan said. “And we knew they\nwould be short. She told me all along, though she couldn’t guess the details\nuntil recently. An assassin from the Order of the Broken Eye, we both\nbelieve.”\n“From the Order?!” Kip demanded, irate.\n“A Seer is most dangerous to the most dangerous people,” Corvan said.\n“Grandfather, you didn’t hire them for that, did you?” Kip asked.\nThe air suddenly tingled as if they were all waiting for a bolt to strike\nand its thunderhead to blow out all the windows.\n“No,” Andross said coolly.\n“Oh, good,” Kip said. “He had to be thinking it, and I thought it would\nbe good for him to see your face when I asked. I thought he might be too\npolite to ask.”\n“On the matter of my wife, I wouldn’t let etiquette—or anything—get in\nthe way of my vengeance,” Corvan said.\n“I only ask,” Kip said, “since you’ve had such a good working\nrelationship with the Order in the past.”\nAgain, the clouds boiled, but no thunderbolt struck.\n“When one is in power, one must frequently deal with unsavory\nelements,” Andross said, “worse than assassins, even. Which is why\nsometimes one must hold one’s nose and deal even with traitors. But that\ndoesn’t make one a traitor oneself, does it, Corvan?”\nCorvan Danavis was quivering with the effort to contain himself. “A\ntraitor? You refer to King Ironfist, I suppose?”\n“He brought you here, didn’t he?”\n“I’ve arrived here with an army, just in time, from what I hear. Without\nIronfist’s fleet, we’d not be arriving for another two months.”"

Without\nIronfist’s fleet, we’d not be arriving for another two months.”\n“Has your army disembarked, then?” Andross asked.\n“No. I came on ahead. The White seemed eager that I should see the\nstate of the defenses immediately—”\n“And King Ironfist doubtless told you to go on ahead.”\n“Yes,” Corvan said.\n“Without your soldiers. Who are isolated on their own ships, perhaps?\nShips disarmed, ostensibly so they have room for more soldiers?” Andross\nsuggested.\nCorvan froze as the implications dawned on him. “He… he wouldn’t.”\n“You’ve not brought us an army, Satrap,” Andross said. “You’ve brought\nIronfist ten thousand hostages. You were right, Grinwoody. All his years\nserving at the highest level, and Ironfist has no loyalty at all.”\n“It grieves me to be right,” Grinwoody said. “He is of my own tribe, my\nlord.”\n“Well, we’ll deal with all that presently,” Andross said. “First things\nfirst.”\n“He’s disembarking himself to negotiate the surrender,” Corvan said.\n“Or… at least that’s what he told me.”\n“He meant it. Only, he didn’t mean his surrender,” Andross said icily.\nCorvan cursed under his breath.\n“But he’s disembarking? When? Soon?” Kip asked. “Shit! We’ve got to\nfinish this game quickly, grandfather. I’ve got to make sure my commander\ndoesn’t find out Ironfist’s here.”\n“I don’t imagine King Ironfist will have any trouble with one of your\npuppies,” Andross said.\n“This one he might,” Kip said.\n“You’re in the middle of something?” Corvan asked. “I’m sorry I\ninterrupted with such bad news. You’re in the middle of… a game?” He\ndidn’t bother to conceal a note of disbelief.\n“Hardly,” Kip said, “but please stay. That is, if you don’t mind\nwatching.”\n“I’d be delighted to see the era’s greatest mind at work.”\n“Thank you—” Kip and Andross said at the same time. They even sort\nof inclined their heads the same way. That was weird. Kip hadn’t been\naround this man at all growing up.\nThe blood is strong.\nCorvan said, “Your pardon, my lords, a slip of the tongue. ‘Greatest\nminds.’”\n“After I win,” Kip said, “I’d like to go over some ideas on the Jaspers’\ndefense with you.”\nThey took their seats, Grinwoody having already scuttled about on his\nlittle roach legs to provide a chair for the satrap.\nKip brushed the art on the cards with his fingertips in frustration. He had\nto settle for playing a Lightguard, though the sun was high enough he could\nhave played a more powerful card if he’d had it.\nAndross played the Red Bane.\nKip flopped Cannon Island onto the table. “This deck isn’t good enough.\nIf Janus Borig had had time to complete—”\n“No sniveling,” Andross said. “You had first choice of decks.”"

He dropped\nanother bane, and attacked.\nKip didn’t defend, soaking up the damage like he was the damned\nTurtle-Bear.\n“Why isn’t there a Turtle-Bear card?” Kip asked suddenly. Surely he had\nto be important enough to get a card, right?\n“A what?” Andross asked, not that interested.\n“Come on, you were looking at it earlier.” Kip put down his cards,\npushing his chair back. He showed off his tattoo. Swapping spectacles of\nvarious colors, he quickly worked through the superviolet, which gave the\nedges their nice borders, then as he drew in blue light, zigzags of blue shot\nthrough his forearm, just above the wrist. A rounded rectangle. Kip drew\ngreen, and color suffused the outlines. Yellow, and the colors gained\nrichness.\nCorvan Danavis inhaled sharply. “What did you call that card?” he\nasked.\nKip ignored him until he finished, and the tattoo stood sharp and clear\non his forearm. “Turtle-Bear. I’m the Turtle-Bear,” Kip said.\n“Where did you get that?” Andross asked easily.\n“Fighting Abaddon,” Kip said, as if it were a small thing. “Like I told\nyou.”\n“The art style’s Atashian, isn’t it?” Corvan asked. “I recognize that\ncreature, though I’ve never heard it called a turtle-bear.”\n“What have you heard it called?” Kip asked, though now, in looking at\nit, it seemed different than he remembered. The Turtle-Bear that had been\nseared into his arm had been a fat, round little thing, furry in all the wrong\nplaces, awkward as Kip himself. Now it seemed elongated, stronger, not\nnearly so ridiculous, like a juvenile…\n“My maternal grandmother was Atashian,” Corvan said. “She had this\nancient brooch that looked like that. She told me Atashians believed men\nwere born with two natures. One was usually symbolized by the monkey:\nthe chattering dung-flingers of the forest—social, passionate, but all-reliant\non the tribe, attacking those the group disliked without an independent\nthought in their heads, warm, caretaking, but always looking to the group\nfor approval. The other nature was usually symbolized by the snake: cold,\ndispassionate, patient in ambush, not shaken from the truth by anyone or\nanything, but also uncaring, heartless, rejecting company heedlessly. They\nbelieved that only when one brought these natures together, not lukewarm\nbut cold and hot in the appropriate times, fur and scale, could one be truly\nwise. Only by bringing the contrary animal natures together could one\nbecome fully human, whether monkey and snake, or dog and scorpion, or\nturtle and bear. And the greatest of these become dragons.”\n“A Dragon would be helpful now,” Kip said lightly. He looked at"

He looked at\nAndross Guile, who was watching cold as an asp. “Don’t suppose you’ve\ngot a Dragon in the deck I missed?”\nAndross’s eyes glittered darkly.\n“Luxin-reactive tattoo dyes. A nice parlor trick,” Andross said. “An art\nlost long ago. We’ll talk about who in Blood Forest holds this secret, if we\nlive long enough. In the meantime, let’s finish the game, shall we? Here,\nthis will drain your excess luxin.”\nAndross handed Kip a little cylinder much like the testing sticks used in\nthe Threshing. Kip pressed his finger firmly on the black point and watched\nhis colors swirl down into the stick’s bone-white body. Unlike the ivory of\nthe testing sticks, though, here the colors dyed the stick fully their color and\nthen faded in turn, swirling away like smoke.\nThey all waited until every color was gone, and then a few more\nseconds.\nWithout looking up, Andross said, “Grinwoody. The integrity of our\ngame is intact?”\n“Absolutely, my lord. I watched most carefully.”\nAndross picked up his own deck and motioned that Kip could do the\nsame.\nKip picked up his cards.\nHe had two turns left before Andross won. No more stalling.\nAndross played another bane. That he appeared to have an\ninsurmountable lead wasn’t slowing him down.\nKip supposed he could should feel flattered for that.\nHe did not feel flattered.\nAndross pushed his eligible cards forward to attack Kip’s sad selection\nof defenders. Cannon Island could take out the Blue Bane but would be\ndestroyed. Kip’s Lightguards and galleys couldn’t stop the other bane, and\nany of the Lightning cards Kip might have could only take out a few of\nAndross’s galleys, which was pointless.\nThe game was over. Kip was dead. He was going to lose everything.\nKip didn’t lay down his cards, though. He played two Lightning cards,\nkilling the attacking galleys.\n“Petty,” Andross said.\nStill not touching any of the cards, Kip said, “I block the Blue Bane with\nCannon Island. Oh, and I block the Red Bane and Dagnu with Ironfist.”\nThere was no Ironfist on the table. Everyone stopped for a moment, then\ndouble-checked to see if there had been some mistake.\n“I see he has an interesting Rage mechanic that kicks in when he\ndefends against a superior attack.”\nEveryone in the room looked at Kip like he was mad.\nCheck it yourself, Kip wanted to say. But you don’t tell your prey how\ngood the meat in the trap will taste. You let the bloody scent in the air do the\nconvincing.\n“That card’s a Lightguard,” Andross said.\n“Oh, but he’s fighting extra hard for me,” Kip said archly, and he\nthought, like Súil did.\nIf there was one thing Andross Guile couldn’t stand, it was\ncondescension."

His fingers broke the delicate layers of luxin across the face of\nthe card, shattering the spiderweb-thin portrait of a Lightguard that Kip had\ncopied with paryl and then laid atop Ironfist’s portrait.\n“This is—” The old man went wide-eyed as he saw Ironfist staring out\nof the card. He was uncomprehending for a long, long moment. “This is\nimpossible,” he breathed.\n“I believe my Ironfist kills off both of your bane and your Dagnu,” Kip\nsaid. “Good round for me. Shall we—”\nAndross held up a finger. “Grinwoody?” he hissed without turning.\n“My lord,” Grinwoody’s voice trembled. “He hasn’t touched that card\nsince he played it. I swear. He has no sleeves. The number of cards\nremaining in his deck is correct. I…”\nBut Andross’s eyes tightened. He sniffed. Then he wafted the card\ntoward his nose. The luxin scent, tiny as it was, must not have dissipated\nfully. “You cheated,” he said. “You’re disqualified. You lose.”\n“I did nothing disallowed by the rules.”\n“You substituted a card!” Andross said.\n“No, I played it legally at noon. Nor did I announce it as anything other\nthan it was,” Kip said. “Some men simply don’t look under the surface to\nsee things as they truly are, grandfather.”\n“You little fuck!” Andross jumped to his feet.\n“So help me, if you hit me—” Kip started.\n“What? What will you do?” Andross demanded.\n“The question isn’t what I’ll do,” Kip said.\nAndross’s eyes twitched tight. Then he glanced at Corvan.\nCorvan hadn’t moved, but he sat with the languid grace of a killer.\n“Whose play will he back, grandfather? Corvan practically raised me.\nHow much loyalty have you inspired in him? Grinwoody was so intent on\nthe game, did he search the satrap before he came in? Thoroughly?”\nCorvan leaned to one side, and a large pocket on his cloak seemed to\ngape open a bit; it held something heavy.\nA vein throbbed in Andross’s neck as he mastered himself. “Then let’s\nfinish the game. I’ve got a chance yet.” He dropped a musket on one of his\nwights. It left each player with a sliver of life.\nKip drew a Blackguard and dropped it onto the table. With a Blackguard\nbacking him, Ironfist was able to attack twice.\n“And that’s game,” Andross said, his voice tight, his eyes unfocused.\n“You win, and you may have doomed us all.”\n“Nice playing you, too. Let’s never do it again,” Kip said.\n“Get out of my sight before I do something red,” Andross said, not\nlooking up.\nKip and Corvan left, with Kip expecting a musket ball between his"

She ran into him, losing\nher grip of paryl and shimmering back into visibility.\nShe looked around quickly, but there was no one in the halls. “Sorry,”\nshe whispered.\n“What is it?” Quentin whispered to Ben.\nBen looked at them both quizzically. “It’s… quiet?” Ben-hadad said.\n“Oh, you both thought—no, I didn’t mean for you to be quiet.”\n“Oh,” Quentin said, straightening. “Yeah, I don’t like to bother anyone,\nso I memorized when the various lectures and special events are in session\nso I can encounter the fewest people possible.”\n“For all the levels?” Teia asked. “Not just where your room is?”\n“Well, I didn’t know when I might need to drop in someplace else, and I\nalready had the scheduling book…”\n“Of course,” Teia said. “Totally logical.” When your brain is the size of\na watermelon.\n“I thought we’d like to avoid people as well,” Quentin said. “Though\nwith all the preparations for the defenses and for Sun Day itself tomorrow,\nthere are more people about than usual.”\n“They aren’t still having the parade, are they?” Teia asked.\n“Of course they are,” Quentin said. “There’s tens of thousands of\nterrified pilgrims in the city. You want to take away the one thing that will\ngive them hope? Plus, we don’t know for sure if an attack will even come\ntomorrow. Honoring Orholam first might seem like the worst idea militarily,\nbut there are a lot of us who think it’s the best idea. Naturally, there have\nbeen some compromises on the parade route and the disposition of drafters.\nIt will be the least, shall we say, lavish Sun Day celebration in many years.”\n“Worst Sun Day ever, you mean,” Ben-hadad said, shooing them\nforward to walk once more, silently counting out his paces.\n“On the contrary,” Quentin said.\n“How so?” Ben asked. “Fourteen more paces, I think.”\n“A pagan invasion, on Sun Day itself?

In front of them was a\ndiscipula, carrying a mop and bucket. She wore her hair in a bun with\nflyaways everywhere, was maybe fourteen years old, and looked even\nyounger.\nThey had never met, Teia was sure of it.\n“Teia Darksight?” the girl said.\n“Huh?” Teia asked.

Ben-hadad was\nannoyingly handsome.\nBut another part of her was already doing what was necessary. Paryl\nshot from Teia’s fingertips and into the girl’s chest. In a moment, Teia had\nthe knot ready to slam home to sever the nerves that told the heart to beat.\nShe’d loused up.

Teia had killed innocents before, but\nthose had been innocents she’d been forced to kill. This was forced only by\nher own error.

They hadn’t had that long together.\nShe hadn’t gone into specifics. He didn’t know the stakes. He thought they\nwere just messing around in areas where maybe someone might realize they\nshouldn’t be.\n“Subtle… T,” he continued. “I think you’ve got a new nickname! Subtle\nT!”\n“Is this the door?” she asked. Subtle T was exactly the kind of name that\ncould stick. It sounded laudatory to outsiders, but could either be praise or a\nquiet mock among comrades.\nIt made her miss the Mighty. These damn boys. It made her miss her old\nlife.\nPatch or no patch, she could never be part of the Mighty now. It was a\nfantasy to think she could ever pick up where she’d left off.\nShe’d never stopped to think what would happen after she took down\nthe Order, had she? It had seemed such an impossibility, her mind had\nsimply refused to go further.\nThere was no further.\nBut enough of that now. Teia had to be present, had to be sharp. Enough\nof thinking about that girl—that poor, innocent girl who would tire in a few\nminutes as her heart was slowly starved of blood, who would go lie down to\nnap and never rise.\n“Yeah, this should be it,” Ben-hadad said.\nSilently, Quentin was staring at Teia. She hadn’t told Quentin about\neverything she could do now, but Quentin knew.\nBen knocked on a door.\n“What are you going to do if someone answers?” Teia asked.\n“Hadn’t thought that far ahead,” he said.

Orholam have mercy, she’d gotten good at\nlaying death traps, but not so good at removing them.\n“Clara.”\n“What do they have you mopping for?” Teia asked.\nClara gulped. “Atarah called me a slatte—ahem, a name. So I tried to\nslap her, but I sort of missed? and I broke her nose instead.

It’s\ncomplicated.”\nOrholam, I can’t kill her. You’re the god who spares the innocent. Can\nYou keep this girl’s mouth shut? Because I can’t do this anymore. I can’t\nkill the innocent anymore, not to justify a hundred other murders. Not to\njustify saving a thousand lives someday, maybe.\n“I’m working for the White,” Teia said very quietly. “It’s a secret\nmission. I’m not supposed to be on the Jaspers at all. If you tell anyone you\nsaw me, people will die. Me among them. Can you… can you not tell\nanyone you saw me for one week? I’ll probably be dead by then anyway.\nIt’ll be a juicier story if I turn up dead, and then you can tell everyone. But\nif you tell anyone now—even your friends—Clara, I can’t even tell you\nhow bad it could go. A lot of people will die. Good people.”\nClara shrugged, offended. “I can keep a secret!”\nRight, and how many fourteen-year-olds will admit they can’t? “One\nweek,” Teia said. “Two if you can.

Unless I turn up dead, then tell whoever\nyou want.”\nHer duty had become like that old little flask of olive oil that she’d\ngripped so hard in her fist that her fingers cramped. Holding on to it had\nmeant everything, everything. Now she prised her fingers open one by one.\nOrholam, this is Your war. If You want us to win, You’re going to have\nto handle this little girl. I’m done killing innocents.\n“You’re serious,” Clara said. “I thought you were just going to make\nlove with that boy and were looking for an empty room.”\n“Ben?” Teia said. Oh hells. Now she’d said Ben’s name.\n“He’s cute!” Clara said.\n“Cute?” Teia asked. “No! I mean, sure, he’s fine. But he’s like my\nbrother—look, I’m not talking about this!”\n“Will you show me paryl tricks?” Clara said. “I think it’s what I want to\nstudy. I’m a yellow myself, but I love research, and no one’s done credible\nresearch on paryl since Aldib Muazon.”\nThis was turning all sorts of directions Teia hadn’t expected. But maybe\nthis was salvation. “If…” Teia said. “If you show me you can keep one\nsecret, I’ll tell you more.”\nI am screwing the future me.\nBut I’m totally fine with screwing the future me. If I’m alive to be\nscrewed, that’s a win.\n“It’s a deal. Can I… can I get my mop?” Clara asked.\nI almost killed this girl, Teia thought. “Of course.”\nIn five minutes, the girl was gone, happily humming.\nTeia didn’t know if she’d just signed a hundred death warrants, but\nsomehow the worry that she had sat side by side with a specter of faith that\nit was all going to work out.\nShe was afraid to examine that specter for fear it would fall apart at a\ntouch, but it sat there, quietly, at the corner of her eye. And when she took a\nbreath, it was a little less tight than her breaths had been for a year.\nThe room, as it turned out, did have a secret door, hidden behind a\nhinged bureau. The magister who lived here was using it to store her extra\nclothing and books and a couple skins of good brandy.\nOf course some of the secrets would have been found over the centuries\nby others.\nThe next hidden room they found had been converted to a private drug\nden, with narcotic plants growing everywhere next to an access to the\ntower’s lightwell and pornographic texts on the shelves. The next, on\nanother floor, hidden among the married couples’ apartments, appeared to\nhave been found but then lost again for decades, with a heavy coating of\ndust, a desiccated rat on the floor, and a single pair of wadded-up men’s\nunderclothes that looked brittle with age.\nThere was a story there that Teia wasn’t sure she wanted to know.\nAs they found each, Ben-hadad seemed to home in more easily on the\nnext, as if not just the architecture but the architecture of the builder’s own"

Then I’ll\ntake you to the place I think it really is now.”\nThe access room to that one was occupied, but Ben-hadad came up with\nsome breezy lie and the old magister toddled her way off to lunch.\nIn the hidden room behind her apartments, they found a corpse, nearly\nskeletal, facedown, with the back of his head caved in.\n“Dead many years, I’d guess,” Ben-hadad said.\n“But when he was fresh, how could they not smell him?” Teia asked.\n“These rooms aren’t airtight.”\n“The infirmary occupies the entire floor below us. I’d imagine many\nunpleasant aromas escape. Or perhaps the occupant was herself the\nmurderer, and had stayed long enough that the odors disappeared. A\nmystery.”\n“But not our mystery,” Teia said.\n“Agreed,” Ben-hadad said. “If we make it through all this, we’ll dig\ndeeper and see if we can get him justice.”\nThey left that room undisturbed, and with as little evidence of their\npassing as possible, in case the current occupant was the murderer herself,\nas unlikely as that seemed. Regardless, they wouldn’t want to spook her.\nBut they didn’t head back to the slaves’ stairs.\n“This last one…” Ben-hadad said. “This last one’s special. We can’t use\nthe stairs. It’s accessed from the lift.”\n“From the lift?” Teia asked. “But the lifts have got to be the most\nfrequented areas in the towers.”\n“Not at the top levels they’re not.”\nThe idea that the Old Man of the Desert might have access to the top\nlevels of the Chromeria shot a chill through Teia. But it wasn’t like it was a\nnew idea to her. She’d figured the Old Man had to be a high-level diplomat\nor noble or even Blackguard. Of course he’d be rich, and he’d have access\nto all sorts of disguises. But knowing that his lair was within spitting\ndistance of the Blackguard barracks—an assassin lord, right under the noses\nof those whose main purpose was to stop assassins?—sickened her. It made\nit real. Ironfist wasn’t just a one-off. They were everywhere.\n“It would have to be quick to access,” Teia said.\n“It’s between floors. You get to it from the back of the lift. A quick\npause, set the brake, reset the weight to an empty lift, and the lift returns to\nthe top floor automatically.”\n“So the Old Man has to be someone who gets on the lift alone often,”\nTeia said. It narrowed her list a little. A Blackguard captain? “No, never\nmind. That isn’t true,” she said. “I was assuming the Old Man would have\nto visit his lair often. But he might only visit fortnightly, or even monthly.\nAnyone who takes these lifts regularly would have many chances to be\nalone briefly enough to get into such a room.”\nShe wasn’t going to find out who he was in time. She was going to fail\nagain."

She was going to fail\nagain.\nTeia went invisible, and they all got on the lift.\nIt was surprisingly easy to find, when they knew where to look. It was\ntwo and a half floors down from the top of the Prism’s Tower. Just below\nwhere security started.\nThey pushed against the wall, and a narrow section simply sank in and\nswung open on hidden hinges, the seam invisible in all but bright light.\nThere was a small vestibule on the other side with a brake so that an\nempty lift could be halted on its passage up or down.\nTeia carefully checked the vestibule for traps, then they released their\nbrake on the lift and soon watched it go, summoned by someone far below.\nAfter parting a curtain and stepping into the darkness beyond the\nvestibule, they found a stone letterpad with the entire Old Parian alphabet\non it.\nHer heart sank.\nWhen Quentin moved forward to examine it more closely, she said,\n“Careful. It’ll be trapped, somehow. The wrong code could wash the whole\nroom with fire, for all we know. Maybe this one, maybe the one beyond.”\nQuentin stepped away gingerly.\nWith paryl, it was obvious that five of the letters had been smeared with\nfinger oils more often than any of the others. Some of the letters looked like\nthey hadn’t been touched in years, and some had maybe been touched\nirregularly.\nTeia relayed everything to Ben-hadad, who wrote down the letters in\ngroups according to how much they appeared to have been touched.\n“Well, there’s good news,” he said.\n“You’ve taken up code breaking in the last year?” she asked.\n“Not that good.”\nOf course not. She hadn’t thought she’d be so lucky.\n“It’s long,” he said, “and people are lazy, so it’ll probably be a word, or\na phrase. Unfortunately, that means there’ll be repeats of letters, which\nmakes breaking the code harder. And we don’t know how long the phrase\nis. And I don’t know Old Parian well enough to guess at letter frequencies.\nAnd it’s possible that if we make any errors, something bad will happen.”\n“I’m still waiting for that good news,” Teia said, as Ben watched the lift\nshaft to time an approaching lift.\nWeights plunged past them, and a moment later, a group of discipulae\nchatting with each other zipped by, none of them noticing the three in the\ndarkness.\n“Ah,” Ben-hadad said, “that’s what this drawing is. Correct number of\nweights on the line to tell you the lift is empty. Nice engineering all around.\nHere’s an empty one now.”\nWeights plunged past their faces; the desired number, apparently,\nbecause Ben applied the brake, and stopped the empty lift in front of them\nperfectly.\n“You were saying?” Teia prompted.\n“I was? Oh, oh, right. Well, if there’s one great thing about being\nbrilliant, it’s that other brilliant people like talking to you. I know someone\nwho might help.”\n“Might?”\n“She didn’t like me that much. Back in the day. That was a long time\nago, though.”"

You’ve got to be joking. The woman’s a bitter little tyrant!”\nTeia had strong memories of her being the worst of their magisters.\n“Yeah, but she’s also the only magister I know with an interest in\ncryptology. Six hours.”\n“Six hours?” Teia asked. “To figure this out? How—”\n“Actually, I have no idea,” he said. “I was just picking a number.\nQuentin, you memorized which magisters are lecturing where, right? Of\ncourse you did. You can point me in the right direction. Now, let’s get out of\nhere before someone notices how long this lift has been stalled.”\nChapter 85\nThe world had not stopped moving simply because Kip was spending hours\ngambling its fate with his grandfather. Andross had handed Kip a few things\nand then hustled out of his apartments to take care of a dozen tasks for the\ndefense of the Jaspers. As soon as he himself stepped out of the old man’s\napartments with Corvan Danavis, he was met by no fewer than five\nmessengers, not only updating him on the state of the defenses and the\ndisposition of his forces but also asking that he request horses or oxen and\nwagons and various other things the Foresters needed permission for.\nKip directed those to report to the new high general, Corvan Danavis,\nwho took it all in hand easily and promised to take care of it.\nWinsen and Big Leo were there to guard Kip. Kip sent one of the\nmessengers to find Ben-hadad—he was going to be figuring out mechanical\nthings, so he needed the man’s engineering brilliance. Then he sent Winsen\nto go find Cruxer to summon him urgently.\n“You tell him anything you have to to get him to come to me, you\nunderstand?” Kip said.\n“Your wife said not to leave you for any reason,” Win said.\n“And I’m telling you to move your ass to save Cruxer from doing\nsomething stupid. Come back with him.”\nWinsen, nonplussed about being pitted against Tisis, looked over at Big\nLeo for help, but the big man shrugged. “As soon as you get back, there’ll\nbe three of us with the boss.”\n“You say that like Breaker’s the real boss,” Winsen said, but he left.\nCorvan was scanning documents that had been brought to him by the\nnumerous messengers that were also waiting for him—he’d learned it was\nfaster and more accurate, he said, than listening through an entire report.\nNot much seemed to surprise him about what he heard and read, though\nat one point, he said, “The Chromeria’s stockpiled that much black powder?\nThe books never tell such things, but if we win, Karris will be the reason.\nBrilliant. Go on.”\nHis messengers were soon given orders in a clipped shorthand that they\nscribbled on parchment as he spoke. He’d checked his own outgoing\nmessages, approved them, and sent them out before Kip was finished\nhearing the second of his."

He’d checked his own outgoing\nmessages, approved them, and sent them out before Kip was finished\nhearing the second of his.\nThey spoke together as they made their way to the lift.\n“You brought how many war hounds?!” Corvan asked. “Cwn y Wawr–\ntrained?”\n“I’d more say they are the Cwn y Wawr,” Kip said, triggering the\nsummon plate for a lift.\n“Great, great, great. A hound’s speed and slipperiness will make them\nperfect message carriers. It’ll help with a real problem of communication.\nThe battlefront is going to be the entire circle of the walls if we’ve got\nseven floating bane to deal with.”\n“Uh… maybe you can rotate them through messenger duty?” Kip said.\n“They’ll serve where ordered, but you ever try to get a terrier to ignore a\nrat? Believe me, once you see them in their armor, you’re going to want\nthem fighting on the front lines. Or as a reserve.”\nCorvan nodded, and explained his strategies in broad strokes. He knew\nthe Jaspers like the back of his hand, and had clearly been thinking about\nthis for weeks, if not months. Bonus of being married to a Seer—who had\nalso told him not to tell everyone at the Chromeria exactly what he was\npreparing for, for some reasons that she refused to explain—a drawback of\nbeing married to a Seer.\n“I wish we had hours and hours,” Kip said as they got on the lift. He\ndecided to take it down with Corvan, though he needed to go up to the roof.\n“There are hard things we need to talk about, son,” Corvan said. “I’ve…\ngot a lot of explaining to do to you. And forgiveness to ask.”\n“There’s nothing to forgive,” Kip said. “You cared for me more than\nanyone. And I, the son of your enemy. The man who cost you everything.”\n“That’s… not… It’s far more complicated than that. And not at all clean.\nI’m afraid I shall lose whatever respect you have for me.”\n“Never,” Kip said. “Master Danavis… I mean, High General Satrap\nDanavis, I’ve been in impossible positions now myself. Sometimes men do\nthings in the heat of a moment, but I judge men by what they do day after\nday.”\nThe cloud didn’t move from Corvan’s visage, though, only darkened.\n“We need to talk about your daughter, too,” Kip said. “But not here.\nSomeplace absolutely secure.”\nCorvan shook his head as if it weren’t necessary. “I met with her briefly\nsome time ago. I know what’s she’s decided. I can guess where she’ll be\ntomorrow.” Corvan’s jaw tightened, and his brow furrowed against his\ngrief.\n“I’m so sorry,” Kip said.\n“Me, too,” Corvan said, his face not moving a whit.\nThe lift had taken forever, but finally a free one came and they got on.\n“We’ll talk more,” Kip said. “But you… you think your soldiers are\ngoing to make it to join in the defense?”\n“Yes,” Corvan said.\n“Which means you agree with me that Ironfist is going to relent.

I knew in my heart he couldn’t be a traitor. Not really.”\n“Kip, she didn’t tell me that. She said… she said someone’s going to die\nbefore Ironfist’s people join us. Someone who could avoid it, but almost\ncertainly won’t. Someone who doesn’t deserve to die.”\nKip blinked. “Could be a training accident, then. Someone disembarking\nfrom the ships, slipping or something.”\n“Could be,” Corvan said, but his eyes were pained.\nThe lift stopped, but he didn’t open the doors.\nCorvan looked down at his feet. “In the Prisms’ War, I found purpose\nand friendship and status, and at its end, I lost all those, and my best friend,\nand my wife, and I… I did things. I got lost for a long time, Kip. I wish I’d\nbeen better to you. A lot better. You deserved more.”\n“We’ve work to do,” Kip said. “We’ll talk later. Oh, one last thing!” He\nleaned close to Corvan and whispered in his ear, even then cupping his hand\nover his mouth so his lips couldn’t be read, even though they were alone in\nthe lift. “As satrap, you’re entitled to Blackguard protection. Refuse it. You\nunderstand?”\nThe Blackguard had been infiltrated by the Order. If they were going to\nmake a move, just before or during a battle was exactly when the Order\nwould do it.\nCorvan understood. He held on to Kip’s forearms for a moment. “I don’t\nknow that He cares. I’m not sure that He even exists, but may Orholam\nguard you, son.”\n“And may He bring you light in your long night, sir,” Kip said.\nThen they parted ways, and Kip wondered if it was the last time he’d\never see the man.\nChapter 86\nCommander Ironfist had been a legendary figure before he left the Jaspers.\nStriding victoriously into Karris’s audience chamber, every eye upon him,\nKing Ironfist was utterly terrifying.\nIn accord with Parian customs since the time of Lucidonius, the old\nCommander Ironfist had dressed modestly, wearing long-sleeved tunics and\na carefully folded ghotra to cover his hair. That modesty was a centuries-old\nantidote to the more-ancient-still flamboyance of the pagan Parians who had\ncome before them. In the Paria of old, the kings and queens had preferred to\ndelight the eye and boggle the mind.\nKing Ironfist joined the ancient kings now, and he certainly overawed all\nwho saw him. His hair—uncovered—was twisted with gold dust and glue,\ninto a great free crown of jumbled curls around his head. On one eyelid,\ncribbing from the Nuqaba, was painted the ancient Parian rune for Justice.\nOn the other was Mercy. He wore an eye patch, flipped up now, which\ncould be lowered to cover the one or the other.\nOn the patch was stitched a fiery orb, an orange eye aflame. His tunic"

His tunic\nwas as tight as a Blackguard tunic, sleeveless, revealing biceps that looked\nlike they could shake the pillars of heaven. But instead of modest black, this\ntunic was all bold checks of gold and white, brilliant as the sun itself, belted\nwith white leather around a slim waist that emphasized the enormous\nbreadth of his shoulders.\nOn his left wrist, he wore a manacle and a cruel heavy chain. According\nto the tale, it was the chain he’d literally torn from a rock wall trying to save\nhis sister, the Nuqaba, from being assassinated. He wore a necessarily broad\ngold bicep band with a hook by his elbow, from which he suspended the\nend of the chain so that it was held tight along his forearm.\nIronfist was a king who’d broken chains. Now he used his chains to\nmake war.\nAt his heels, sniffing the air like wolves first catching the scent of a\nsheep pen, were two enormous war hounds, a terrible midnight and a\nsmaller albino.\nBut more frightening than the vestments or the hard tattoos or the new\nscars or the uncharacteristic showiness of his garb or even the damn-near\nhorse-sized dogs was the look of dull rage in his eyes.\nKarris had known angry men. Habitually angry men were always\ndangerous, but unfocused, undisciplined. You had to keep an eye on them\nthe same way Karris would keep her eye on those hounds, but when such\nmen attacked, it was usually with more ferocity than skill.\nFor her entire tenure in the Blackguard, Karris had also known\ndangerous men. Such men would use force when necessary, coolly,\npassionlessly, and with great skill.\nBut when a dangerous man got angry, you could be in for something\nelse altogether.\nIronfist’s quiet brother, Tremblefist, had gone into a battle rage once, and\nthereby earned himself a Name. It had taken the blood of five hundred to\nquench the Butcher of Aghbalu’s rage. Ironfist was his brother’s equal with\na blade, and far more experienced than that young man had been.\nKarris had never wanted to see Ironfist truly angry. She had prayed she\nnever would.\nToday, her prayer had been denied.\n“High Lady!” Ironfist boomed, coming forward on quick steps. Two\nwarriors flanked him, draped in bold colors, a man with a bocote-wood lion\nhelm with lion’s teeth and a woman with claw scars on her face and\nwearing a baboon helm. Each was as tall and lean as the hellstone-tipped\nspears they carried. Drafters, and if Ironfist had deemed them fit to\naccompany him before his old command, they were surely formidable\nwarriors indeed.\nNot one of the twelve Blackguards attending Karris wasn’t sweating.\nIronfist motioned to his Tafok Amagez to stay back—right at the point\nwhere the Blackguard were about to challenge them to stop.

If anyone could take apart the Blackguard, it was Ironfist.\nHe said, “How you’ve changed since you came under my tutelage when\nI was a new trainer, and you that scrawny noble girl hoping to find a\npurpose in the Blackguard.”\nShe said nothing. Let him set the landscape of this discussion. She owed\nhim that much.\nBesides, if she didn’t hear him out, she wouldn’t know where to put\npressure and where to yield so fast his weight carried him off his feet.\n“‘The Iron White’ they call you now,” he said, sweeping a quick hand at\nthe gathered nobles and courtiers and Colors and every maid and servant\nimportant enough to finagle their way into this meeting. He moved it so\nsharply, not a few of them flinched. “And that, not so long after you\ndropped Karris White Oak to become Karris Guile, then Karris the White. It\nseems you’ve gone through many names in a short time.”\n“And you, many masters,” Karris said. The retort hit like a whipcrack.\nHe blinked as if slapped, but he didn’t even slow his walk. Two steps\nsilent, three, before he paused, just outside where the Blackguard would\nstop a man—but still too close for this man to get.\nThen he said, “Yet now you’ve lost your name altogether, and I my\nmasters.”\n“Have you?” she asked, but she said it gently, quietly. “Have you, my\nold friend?”\nSomething in his mien wavered like a blossom struggling to open on a\nday of jumbled sunshine and rain.\nThen it closed tight again.\nHe put his hands down to his sides and patted the heads of the great war\nhounds. It was, of course, forbidden to bring war hounds into the audience\nchamber. A war hound was either a heresy or a target: either an animal that\nhad already been will-cast, or an innocent beast that might be will-cast\nunder your nose by malevolent forces.\nKarris had allowed them in without complaint. What else could she do?\nShe’d allowed Kip to keep his, albeit not in the audience chamber itself.\nAt Ironfist’s tap, the smaller white hound with its pink eyes sat. Ironfist\nreached up and pulled down his eye patch over the Mercy tattoo, leaving\nonly Justice.\nDamn, damn, damn.\n“Perhaps we could move to a more private setting?” she asked now.\nIronfist was a reasonable man. Had been, anyway. Perhaps she could find\nthat man again, if only she could get him away from all the eyes that\ndemanded he act like a king instead.\nBut there was little or nothing of the old Ironfist here. This man looked\nindeed like the kings of old: harsh and terrible and primal. He said, “The\nChromeria’s secrecy and lies are what have brought us here. You need my\nfleet. You need Seers Island’s army. The White King’s armada will arrive\ntomorrow, and attack then or the next day. You have no time.”\n“You need us as much as we need you,” Andross Guile called out from"

He walked in quickly,\nconfidently, like a man twenty years younger. “We can win without you. On\nthe other hand, you know that if the heathen destroys us, he’ll come for you\nnext. The King of Wights is not a man to be content with less than all the\nworld. Joining us is your only hope of stopping him.”\nThe crowd in the audience chamber was riveted. For some, this was\nconfirmation of the rumors that the White King was coming. Others were\nhearing it for the first time. All of them knew Ironfist by name at least, and\nall of them knew he’d declared himself king. Hell, not a few of them\nprobably liked him more than they liked Karris or Andross.\nKarris had a sudden paranoid thought wondering if he’d arranged for a\ncoup. What if he’d packed this chamber with his own loyalists?\nBut no, surely Commander Fisk would have guarded against such\nthings. Right?\nBut still, her throat was tight. Who knew where else traitors lurked, if\nIronfist himself could be one?\nKing Ironfist was looking at Andross Guile with open disdain on his face\nas the old man took his seat next to Karris. “Horseshit. You offer your help\nfor hypothetical troubles while you yourself face extinction now. We’re not\nequals here, so let’s skip the oily preambles, snake. You need my armies.\nI’m here to tell you the price for them.”\nAstonishment rippled through the crowd. No one talked to Andross\nGuile like that. No one.\nAnd then anyone who remembered that Andross had stripped Ironfist of\nhis command of the Blackguard saw the depths of the antipathy between the\nmen. This was not going to be pretty. This was why Karris hadn’t wanted\nAndross here.\nAndross didn’t say anything immediately. Didn’t bring his old\ncommander to heel with a word.\nAnd if he didn’t, everyone saw, it had to be because he couldn’t. Thus,\nIronfist was telling the truth when he announced their weakness. The\nJaspers really were that vulnerable.\nAnd suddenly, the people were afraid.\nPerhaps, working with paints mixed from vermilion rage and white-hot\nanger and black vexation, a painter as talented as Janus Borig might have\nbeen able to capture the spirit of Andross Guile now being publicly\nhumiliated by a slave.\nBut he mastered himself and merely twitched a hand as one would to a\nservant: ‘Go on.’\nKarris knew she should intervene, soften the grind of stone on stone\nbetween these two men: Ironfist, fed up with the years of injustices, and\nAndross, unable to believe a slave would step so high out of his proper\nplace.\nBut she had no words. Her heart was in her throat.\nKing Ironfist tilted his head, thoughtful, almost taunting.\nIt was coming now. Ironfist would propose the alliance, the kind that\ncould only be sealed by her marriage. She would have to marry Ironfist\ntonight. With this attitude, he wasn’t going to let his men off their ships"

And ‘done’ meant signed, sealed, and consummated.\nThough she was a grown woman, somehow she hadn’t let herself think\nthat last part through. She would see it through. She knew that. She wasn’t\ngoing to faint this close to the finish line. But how could she bear to take\nthis angry stranger’s weight upon her? Once they were behind closed doors,\nwould he become, somehow, her dear friend again?\nBut there would be no reprieve, no hoping he might delay the\nconsummation, no blotting herself out with drink as she’d done with the\nreal Gavin Guile—Ironfist might know that story, and he could give her no\nexcuse to annul the marriage. She would take him to her bed, and she would\ndo it sober, and she would meet his eyes while she did it.\nWould she feign pleasure while she betrayed the only man she’d ever\nloved?\nOrholam have mercy, what if she felt pleasure?\nWould she hold back some position, some act, hoping to hold on to\nsome piece of her own soul?\nFor some reason, until now, Karris had thought of dishonoring her office\nand dishonoring Ironfist and Gavin as somehow external: those would be\nacts others would judge unfairly, not understanding why she did them or\nhow much good she was accomplishing. When she’d thought of her\nbetrayals, she’d imagined only before she did what had to be done, and\nafter.\nNow she couldn’t help but imagine the during.\nBut she would do it. To save her people, she was going to do it, even if\nfor every moment of it she imagined Gavin somehow walking in on her, she\nwas going to do it.\nFinally, King Ironfist spoke, looking at Andross. “I gave you the best\nyears of my life. My brother, Hanishu, did, too, and then he died for you.\nAnd in return, you threw me out like garbage, and then you ordered the\nmurder of my sister.” Now the new king stared at them both, and Karris\nwasn’t spared the heat of his gaze.\nShe suddenly felt things sliding off-kilter, like a wagon too heavily\nloaded careening down a thin mountain road suddenly jumping out of the\nsafety of the ruts to where the cliffs waited.\n“This is not a negotiation. This is an ultimatum,” King Ironfist said.\n“You’ve taken my family from me. You want my help? I want a dead Guile.\nYou, old man. Or you, Karris. Or Kip. You decide.”\n“Or Zymun?” Andross asked quickly, as if he were merely gathering\ninformation.\n“Ha! How much of a fool do you think I am?” Ironfist barked. “No. I’m\nnot here to solve Guile problems. I’m here to be one. You decide. I’ll be\nback at midnight to see the deed done. If you don’t, we join the White\nKing.”\nWithout another word, without a look back, Ironfist and his retinue\nstrode from the hall, their footsteps echoing loudly in the utter silence of"

Andross had been so sure Ironfist\nwould do the rational thing, the thing Andross would do. But Ironfist wasn’t\nrational; he was grieving; he was furious, and he was hell-bent on revenge.\nIronfist was sounding a death knell that couldn’t be unrung. The\nsatrapies would die—if not tomorrow, then next year. After this, even if\nParia and the Chromeria together defeated the White King, this blood\nIronfist demanded would be answered with blood. But Karris couldn’t\nblame him. Not in the least. Ironfist hated injustice; it was something she’d\nalways admired about him. And she and Andross had murdered his people\nfirst.\nAnd now it was going to bring them all to ruin.\nChapter 87\nKip looked around the open top of the Prism’s Tower and tried to enjoy the\nsunshine, tried to breathe. It was a beautiful day, and the view was peerless,\nbut he couldn’t help but look to the horizon, as if the White King’s armada\nwould appear at any moment. He went to the edge, where the great cables\nhe and the Mighty had once slid down to safety had been repaired and once\nagain concealed.\nIt actually might be a good way to get messengers from the Chromeria\nout to every corner of the Jaspers as quickly as possible. They had signal\nmirrors for many messages, but he’d have to mention the option to Corvan.\nKip sighed. He was just trying to take his mind off the tightness in his\nchest.\nBig Leo was standing watch, impassive, and it reminded Kip of the last\ntime they’d been alone.\nWhat had Big Leo said to him? That every time he tried to be someone\nelse, he failed, and when he was only himself, he succeeded?\nKip looked down at his arm. I’m not Gavin Guile. I’m not Andross\nGuile. I’m the fucking Turtle-Bear.\nHe had to figure out the Mirrors himself.\nThat would have been a lot more comforting if he’d figured out anything\nat all, but even finding the mechanism on the roof by which Prisms\nbalanced had taken him an embarrassingly long time. A multifaceted crystal\nhung there, and one could address it standing, or actually strap into a raised\nframe.\nHuh, that was strange.\nKip eventually figured out the leather belts and the locks and strapped\nhimself in. He released the pins, and the huge crystal swung down hard\ntoward his face. He jerked back against the belt with a squawk as it banged\nto a stop a thumb’s breadth from his forehead.\n“You all right there?” Big Leo asked sardonically.\nKip cleared his throat. “C’mon, that didn’t make you nervous at all?”\nBig Leo just stared at him.\n“As you were,” Kip said.\nTentatively, he rested his face against the crystal. He could see through\nthe lowest clear layers as the rest pressed against his skin. He reached his\nwill into it."

He reached his\nwill into it.\nNothing. No, not quite nothing. It felt like he’d put on a yoke that hadn’t\nbeen hitched to a plow. The leads were there, just untethered.\n“Get me out of here,” he told Big Leo.\n“That was quick,” Big Leo said.\n“Well, I am a genius of magic,” Kip said.\nBig Leo looked at him flatly. “But seriously.”\n“We need to go downstairs,” Kip said. At least, that’s where he hoped\nthe answers were. “I’m blaming this all on you if it doesn’t work.”\n“Mmm-hmm,” Big Leo said.\nWiseass.\nThey made their way past checkpoints again. On the way up, they’d\nbeen staffed by Blackguards Kip and Big Leo hardly had known. But\napparently they’d gone and gotten others.\nTheir welcome was warmer than Kip had expected. The Lightguards had\nhad all the time in the world to paint Kip and the Mighty as murderous\ntraitors. At the very least, the Mighty had left the Blackguard at a time when\nthey’d really needed good people.\nInstead, he saw Gill Greyling waiting for them.\n“Gill!” Kip said. “They made you a trainer? Those poor nunks!”\nThe man flashed a huge smile. “I get along with the slow and clumsy.”\nKip laughed as they embraced.\n“Where’s Gav?” Kip asked.\nHe felt it instantly. Every face fell.\n“No!” Kip said. But he saw the truth of it on Gill’s face. “How?”\n“We’d been out looking for your father. Gav had been pushing it for a\nwhile, drafting too much. We got ambushed by some wights. He saved two\nof his brothers in the fighting, but blew his halos.”\n“He make it back here?”\n“Yeah. The White herself took care of him for the end.”\nKip muttered a curse.\n“You should go see her, Lord Guile,” Gill said. He called him Lord\nGuile, not Breaker.\n“Yeah, I know,” Kip said. He supposed Gill thought Breaker was his\nBlackguard name, and though it was forgivable under the circumstances,\nKip had still abandoned the Blackguard.\n“Promise me.”\nKip squirmed. It wasn’t like Gill not to let things go. “Look, we didn’t\nleave things so—”\n“She’s got one son she can’t abide and one that she loves but drove\naway. Promise me.”\n“I’m not really her son. She made that very clear—”\n“Gav spent his dying breaths making her see what kind of a cockroach\nZymun is. She gets it now. But if you make my brother’s sacrifice moot,\nyou’re turning your back on us. Or have you already done that?”\nKip swore under his breath. “Come on! Don’t be—fine! I’ll do it.

He\ncursed again. “Gill. Trainer. I’m sorry. About…”\n“I know,” Gill said.\nMoments later, Kip and Big Leo stepped off the lift at the tall, wide-\nopen level that housed all the tower’s mirrors. Dozens of mirror slaves were\nhard at work prepping for Sun Day. It was the biggest day of the year for\nthem. Not only were there all the festivities and parades to prepare for,\nmany of which required special lenses and tight coordination, but they went\non all day long, on the day of the year with the most intense sunlight.\nMistakes in coordinating the mirrors not only were deemed harbingers\nof bad luck, but they could also send errant burning hot rays into the crowds\nof pilgrims. Small smudges on the mirrors could turn them into a smoking\nruin. Untrained or sick staff could fall to their deaths with the rigors of the\nlong, long day. Thus, today was filled with everything from checking the\nhealth of the slaves here and on the Thousand Stars throughout the Jaspers,\nto checking and filling the cleaning solutions for the mirrors themselves, to\ndrilling the star-keepers on hitting their sequences during the parades.\nKip had served with the mirror slaves before; it was a favorite\npunishment for nunks, and the slaves had laughed at the nunks’ sweating\nand bumbling, saying that day was nothing compared to Sun Day.\nThere were no nunks here now. Kip figured they’d probably just get in\nthe way. He started looking around for the slaves’ overseer, but couldn’t see\none immediately. That was odd. Usually the overseers made a real effort to\ndistinguish themselves above their fellows.\n“I see how, I just don’t understand why, Overseer Amadis,” a boy said.\nKip homed in on the conversation and wove through the workers to the\neast side of the tower. The boy who’d spoken was watching as an older man\nswung a mirror from one position to another. But the mirror he was\nswinging was blackened, melted.\n“Because we’ve got no backup mirrors. We use what we’ve got,” the old\nman said.\n“Why not take it out altogether?”\nOverseer Amadis looked up at Kip. “My lord, will you give me one\nmoment to deal with this?”\n“Of course.”\nHe turned back to the boy. “Because it’s the counterweight to Valor’s\nmirror. We’ve got two hundred twenty-seven position changes tomorrow,\nand without this mirror in place, that bolt in the frame may snap.”\n“But why do I have to clean it? It’s melted!” the boy asked, but then his\nhead dropped. “My pardons, Overseer.”\nA female slave nearby who was scrubbing the floor on hands and knees\nshook her head. “Little Alvaro doesn’t want to work. Thinks he’s too good\nfor it. Surprise, surprise.”\n“Because if you keep it clean,” the overseer said, “maybe it’ll make it\nthrough the day without shattering. It’s brittle as is. And because everyone\nelse needs to clean theirs. Letting your mirror get dirty is the worst thing we"

Letting your mirror get dirty is the worst thing we\nkeepers can possibly do, isn’t it, Ysabel?” the overseer said, turning to the\nsneering woman scrubbing the floor.\nShe turned back to her labors, muttering.\nKip looked from her to the blackened mirror. Clearly there was some\nstory there, but it didn’t have anything to do with him.\n“Alvaro,” Amadis said, “son, you’re only just coming out from under\nthe cloud of suspicion she put on you. You serve well tomorrow, and you\nget moved to a rotation on the real mirrors. If you loaf because it doesn’t\nseem to matter to you… You’re a smart kid. You want them to look at you\nlike you looked at Ysabel a year ago?”\nThe boy shook his head with a fair facsimile of humility, accepting his\ncorrection.\n“Sorry about that,” Amadis said. “These two should not be kept together,\nbut we make do, like everyone. How may I help you, my lord?”\n“I’m afraid I’m going to throw a wrench into your plans,” Kip told\nOverseer Amadis. “But it’s for something more important than Sun Day, I\npromise.”\nUnsurprisingly, the overseer was less than delighted at what Kip wanted.\nThere were things a slave—even an exalted one—couldn’t promise. Every\nwarden would have to be summoned to sign over control of the mirror\ntowers in their neighborhoods. Orders would have to be cleared with the\nappropriate authorities. The luxiats in charge of the Sun Day parades would\nhave to confer.\nKip understood immediately, likely more than Amadis did.\nThis man didn’t have the power to say yes. He wasn’t an arrogant ass\njealous of his small bubble of authority, but he served those who were. No\none wanted to be held responsible for saying yes, so everything would go as\nslowly as possible. The luxiats in charge of the parades would confer, then\ndecide they couldn’t approve such a thing themselves, and summon a High\nLuxiat. He’d be briefed at length, then deliberate. Then he’d decide he\ncouldn’t decide himself, and so on until Sun Day of next year had passed.\n“At long last,” Kip said to Big Leo, “it turns out my time getting\nstonewalled in Dúnbheo was valuable for something after all.”\nBig Leo grunted and stretched against the massive chain he wore draped\naround his neck. It actually made a few slaves stop what they were doing.\nHe didn’t ask Kip to explain, though. Sometimes, he was at least as difficult\nin his own laconic way as Winsen.\nKip said, “Overseer Amadis, you have access to messengers, right?\nGood. Send urgent messages directly to the High Luxiats and High Lord\nBlack and the luxiats in charge of the parades and the wardens that Lord\nKip Guile requires—well, all the things I’ve asked for, you parse them out\nappropriately to the appropriate ones.

These mirrors will be slaved to the gem before\nyou can reach the roof.” He swallowed.\n“That feel good?” Big Leo asked as they headed to the exit.\n“Nah,” Kip said.\nBig Leo said nothing.\n“Maybe a little.”\n“—know why you think you’re special, Elos?” a boy was saying at the\nsame moment. “Because you’re an arrogant little shit.”\nKip stopped at the door. Had he heard ‘Elos’? Like that green wight\nGaspar Elos way back in Rekton? He could have sworn…\nHe looked back, but all the slaves were hard at work, double-time.\nNah, must have imagined it.\nHe headed back to work.\nChapter 88\nIt was no pleasure to cut through the layers of defense Kip had set up at his\nheadquarters. If Teia could do it, so could other Shadows. The best of them\nanyway.\nFine, there was some pleasure in it: for the first time, she was able to\nexperience the blend of using her magical and her physical dexterity\nwithout having to dread why she was doing it. Before now, an infiltration\nmeant she was going to commit murder.\nToday, she was simply going to… what exactly?\nShe wanted to talk to Kip before they died. Maybe she knew something\nthat could help him. Maybe she could do something to help him. Hell, she\nwas an assassin, wasn’t she? She could probably make all sorts of his\nproblems go away.\nAnd for Kip she’d do it. No questions asked.\nAfter all, what was one more soul in her ledger?\nThere was one paryl drafter in Kip’s entourage. Slow girl, paryl leaking\nout of her like a sieve, inefficient, unfocused. Teia could have gotten past\nher without even being invisible.\nStill, she had to be careful. Anyone who glimpsed a heel or the eyes of\nan otherwise-invisible intruder was going to shoot first and ask questions\nlater, literally.\nTeia was good now, but enervating a finger before it twitched on a\ntrigger? She wasn’t that good. And paryl certainly wasn’t going to stop a\nmusket ball.\nIt took only half an hour of being on the street until she slipped into\nKip’s suite, not completely certain that she’d managed to silence the hinges\nfrom outside the door, though she had wrapped them in layer after layer of\nparyl.\nThis was not Kip’s suite, she realized as she got inside.\nIt was Kip and Tisis’s suite.

The plush rug under Teia’s foot sank\npleasantly, but then—\nClick.\nOh shiiiiit.\n“I would hold very still, were I you,” Tisis said, laying down the quill\nand raising her gaze, studying the emptiness in the air as if she might see\nthrough Teia’s invisibility. She took a deep breath as she realized she really\ncouldn’t. “Trouble with being a Shadow: your eyes have to be visible to\ngather light, so you like to only look up in little glimpses, huh? Keeps you\nfrom studying ceilings carefully.”\nGathering the folds of the master cloak between her eyes and Tisis, Teia\nlooked up to one side. Half a dozen muskets and crossbows pointed at\nvarious angles toward her and around her, in case she jumped away from\nthe trap she’d just stepped into. All of them were behind a sheet of glass\nthick enough to defeat paryl from penetrating it, but thin enough that a bolt\nor musket ball would have no such difficulty. She assumed the other side\nhad another half-dozen as well.\n“I’m not here to hurt you,” Teia said.\n“Teia, I presume?” Tisis asked.\nTeia shimmered into visibility and took down her hood. “Ben-hadad’s\nwork?” she asked, pointing a thumb to the death trap. Thanks for telling me\nabout this, Ben. Jackass.\n“His design. An underling did the work. That’s why it’s not armed yet.”\n“It’s not armed?”\n“I know how bureaucracies work. I figured that if someone ordered an\nassassination by a real Shadow, getting permission and then setting it up\nwould take at least until this evening, whereas you might come\nimmediately. But that was just a guess. I’m glad I was right. Nice to, um,\nsee you.”\n“I’m, uh, real glad to see you again, too,” Teia said. Because getting\ncaught in a stupid trap like a moron is exactly how I wanted to reintroduce\nmyself to Kip’s gorgeous and competent wife. “So I can step off this?”\n“Of course,” Tisis said.\nBobbing her head to look down at her feet, Teia stepped off the pressure\nplate.\nA thwang and the sound of breaking glass made her head snap up.\nShards of glass fell from its frame in front of the weapons to the floor,\nshattering. One crossbow had discharged.\nTeia’d heard too many tales of men being fatally wounded without\nrealizing it to feel relief immediately. Had that been a breeze she’d felt on\nher neck?\nShe reached up to the back of her neck. It was dry, mercifully dry. But\nsomething tickled her neck. She pulled it into view: a clump of her hair, cut\nby the crossbow quarrel.\nIf Teia hadn’t dipped her head to look at her feet…\nTheir gazes locked.\n“I am so, so sorry!” Tisis said, horror writ on her features. “I swear to"

About Ironfist becoming King Ironfist?\n“Kip said your mission was your secret and your burden—he only\nshared it with me because I needed to know to help him rule—but he\nwouldn’t extend that circle further until we got here, where it might affect\nCruxer’s work.

Which meant Kip didn’t know, either.\nTisis said, “I mean, we know he lost his position here. Kip meant to\nspeak with his grandfather about that, and see if he could be reinstated. He’s\nbeen furious about it.”\n“It is so much too late for that,” Teia said. “You… didn’t hear about\nParia?”\n“What about it?” Tisis asked.\n“Who cares about Paria now?” Cruxer said. “He’s here. He’s all right,\nisn’t he?”\n“We were deep in Blood Forest,” Tisis told Teia, “and the river was\nblockaded. We had no news, no messages at all for several months, and few\nbefore that.”\nTeia hadn’t written anything to them about Ironfist being in the Order;\nshe didn’t dare trust any messenger, and they’d had no secret code together\nanyway.

You can see threats with\nparyl no one else can. You thought Orholam was calling you to stay here.”\nWho would have thought that a man nicknamed ‘the Lip’ could keep his\nclosed so well? But as much as Teia usually would have thanked Kip for\nthat carefulness, now it just meant she had to march further out of the\nshadows to tell them the whole truth. “That’s… all true. But it’s not all the\ntruth. Cruxer, I’ve been infiltrating the Order of the Broken Eye for Karris,\ntrying to get the information to destroy them from the inside.”\n“You?” He grinned, but with a hint of desperation, as if he felt his\ndisbelief crumbling. “Come on. Like some kind of spy?”\n“And an assassin.” It felt like a sinkhole had opened in her gut and it\nwas swallowing all the world.\n“A what?” He smirked, cocking his head. But his eyebrows were\ndrawing down, and upturned corners of his mouth collapsed down around\nbared teeth.\n“The White ordered me to do everything I had to in order to get in as\ndeep as I could.”\n“And?”\n“So when the Order sent me to kill the Nuqaba, I did. She was Ironfist’s\nsister.”\n“Teia, what the hell?”\nIt all had to come out. Disastrous as she’d always known it would be.\nShame rolled over her at what she’d become, but she stabbed deep,\nlancing the boil. “Ironfist was there, Crux. As I killed her. That bitch had\nchained him to the wall. She was delusional, high, totally… murderous. She\nwas gonna kill him. Her own brother. But—but he begged me to stop.\nBegged me not to kill her. Told me how he was in the Order himself, how\nthis had to be a mistake.”\n“Well, well, surely—he was lying to save her, right? I mean, that’s his\nsister, and he, he wouldn’t want you to become an assassin, Teia. He’s a\ngood man. Honorable. He’d only lie to save you and her, you know that!\nThat’s the kind of man he is.”\n“He didn’t know the assassin was me, Crux. Not at first. He couldn’t see\nme, but he knew it was the Order coming for her. He was calling out names\nof… of the other Shadows that he knew personally. He knew way too much\nfor it to be a lie. He said he’d joined them when he was a boy, asking them\nfor vengeance on his mother’s killer. He was appealing to an Order assassin\nlike… like we were on the same side. I couldn’t believe it, either. But it’s\ntrue.”\n“No,” Cruxer said, and his face contorted.\nTeia could have stabbed Cruxer in the back herself and not seen such a\nlook of profound betrayal.\n“Cruxer,” Tisis said softly. She moved toward him tentatively."

Her voice was reluctant but\nfirm.\nHe shook his head. “The Order tried to kill your husband once already.\nYou really don’t want me there with him?”\n“Cruxer…” Tisis said, pleading.\nThe commander said, “Breaker will seek Ironfist out the moment he\nhears he’s at the Chromeria.

It would be\nvirtually unbreakable.\n“He was working on some magic to make it less visible or more visible\n—even glowing if you wanted it to—but I don’t know how far he got with\nthat.

You’ll have to ask him.”\nTeia wanted to study it, wanted to test the weight and the magic, but\ninstead she wrapped the weapon expertly around her waist in a quick-\nreleasing knot. “I…” What could she say to this woman, for whom she’d\nonly had evil thoughts?\n“Should go,” Tisis said. “We’ll speak again.” There was a little drop-off\nin her voice though, as if she was consciously holding back ‘I hope, if we\nlive.’\nTeia turned. She didn’t know how to do this. And there was work\nsummoning her that she did know how to do.\nAs Teia closed her hood around her face, and began to shimmer out of\nvisibility, Tisis said, “One more thing. He gave it a name. He called it\n‘Sorry.’”\nTeia paused. Then she went.\nChapter 89\nIn all her years as a young noblewoman, then as a Blackguard, and then as\nthe White, Karris had never heard the audience chamber so quiet. The\ncourtiers filed out in silence. The Blackguards cleared the room in silence.\nNow she and Andross stood in silence.\nShe stood at the great windows, watching the sun go down. A summer\nsquall, disappointingly small, was blowing in off the horizon.\nWhen she’d been in this room before, there had always been a buzz of\nvoices, chattering and tittering as this or that noble tried to prove himself a\nwit through his whispered observations. Even as a Blackguard clearing the\nchamber of threats—or more often, simply collecting forgotten bags or\nscarves and the like—there had always been the small talk of work. Since\nshe’d become White, moments of silence had become treasures.\nBut not moments shared with Andross.\nThe sun set. There was no green flash after the last sliver of sun\ndisappeared, no divine promise that it would all work out.\nAndross stood at a window, looking out on the futile drizzle of the late-\nspring rain, lightning illuminating his figure inconsistently, even the rumble\nof thunder seeming somehow impotent.\nFor the first time in a year or more, Karris was reminded that he was\nindeed an old man, ancient for a drafter.\n“I didn’t even think it worth mentioning that he might demand the price\nin blood,” Andross said. Karris didn’t know if it was even meant for her\nears, he said it so low. “He shouldn’t have been able to seize power at all.\nSatrapah Tilleli Azmith was there, ready to rule. Messages had been sent.\nShe knew the danger Haruru was creating. She was going to return Paria to\nits loyal course. What are the odds she’d have a stroke the same night?”\n“Zero,” Karris said.\n“Excuse me?” Andross asked. Then, sharper, “What did you say?”\n“I had her killed. She was the Nuqaba’s spymaster. I found out that\nyou’d ordered the Nuqaba murdered, and I judged Azmith an even greater\nthreat.”\nHe looked at her with those tired eyes, and she couldn’t tell if the brief\nflicker of life in them was surprise that she’d learned of his own contract,"

And you used some goddam\namateur to do the deed. My assassin does his job professionally—then\nyours comes along and bungles everything mine was accomplishing. Of\ncourse Azmith was the spymaster! That’s how I knew she was practical\nenough to deal with.”\nKarris wasn’t about to tell him that his assassin not only wasn’t a man\nbut was also the same assassin as hers.\nBut still, how could I have sent Teia into that?\nI didn’t, though. She was already being sent. I was just trying to take\nadvantage of a bad situation and turn it into an opportunity. I was trying to\nbe someone other than who I am, and I’ve reaped… this.\nAndross had murdered the Nuqaba; it was his fault that Ironfist was\nfurious. But Karris had murdered Azmith; it was her fault that Ironfist had\nbecome king.\n“There was a moment there,” Andross said, “when Ironfist demanded\nblood, and I swear I saw relief on your face.”\n“Relief?” Karris said. “You think I’d choose blood over marriage?\nEspecially this marriage? Ironfist has been my dear friend for many years,\nand in case you hadn’t noticed, is quite a handsome and powerful man. If I\ncannot have my Gavin, I could hardly hope for a better marriage.”\nAndross narrowed his eyes at her for a long moment, then said\ngrudgingly, “I suppose so.”\n“It should be you,” she said, “who dies.”\nHe laughed. Waited. Then chuckled. “That’s all you’re going to say?\nYou’re not even going to make a case for it? Tell me how old I am, maybe?\nHow I’ve ‘lived my life already’? Surely you can dig deep and find some\nreason why the actual promachos is less important than a White.”\n“You know all the reasons I could bring up, but there’s only one that\nmatters.”\n“Oh?” Genuine curiosity filled his face. He stood up straighter, and\nsomething of Gavin Guile appeared in him.\nKarris said, “You should volunteer to die because you love Kip. I know\nyou do. I know there’s something more than avarice and power in you.”\nAt that very moment, there was a crack of thunder and lightning, the\nfaint sizzle from the antennae above the tower as it was hit.\nAndross laughed immediately. Immediately he laughed. “Love? Kip?”\nHe laughed again.\nThat goddam lightning. A surge of hatred at this old man had coursed\nthrough her as fast as the lightning strike, but it had also been illuminated\nby that lightning striking at exactly the wrong moment: she doubted her\nwords for a moment even as she said them—and he saw it.\n“You didn’t leave things so well with Kip, did you?” he asked.\nShe had no answer for him. But he caught the guilt in her eyes."

But he caught the guilt in her eyes.\nHe said, “I’m the promachos. This is a matter of war. I could simply\nchoose. I could make my life easier for once and choose that you die. But I\nwon’t do that. That’d make things too easy for you. When you were young,\nyour choices ruined my family, and you’ve pretended ever since then that\nthey weren’t your choices at all. Now it’s your family on the line, your boy,\nand your choice. I choose this much: Ironfist won’t have my blood. So.\nYou’re the hard-ass; you’re the Iron White. You choose who dies. This is\nyour fault, so as I recall you telling me once with such great glee, ‘You shit\nthe bed, you clean it up.’”\nChapter 90\nIt was time. It was all for this.\nIronfist had demanded apartments in the Prism’s Tower befitting his high\nstatus and bullied an underchatelaine until he was moved to the one with the\nsecret exit he’d discovered years ago.\nThe execution was scheduled for midnight. He guessed that tonight’s\nouting might take an hour. Maybe even two. But there was no way he was\ngoing to cut it too close, so he was giving himself four hours. A king didn’t\nhave to explain himself to anyone, so he’d simply retired to his rooms early.\nHis own guards outside his door had been joined by a pair of\nBlackguards that he didn’t even recognize.\nThings had changed a lot in his absence. After the loss of so many\nBlackguards at Brightwater Wall, he’d sped up the training of replacements\nhimself, but he couldn’t imagine that two nunks who’d been made full\nBlackguards in a year’s time could possibly be up to the high standards he’d\nmaintained for so many years.\nIt irked him to think of poorly trained men and women in his beloved\n’guard, but that was outrage that belonged to another life. Besides, it had\nbeen under his leadership that a single cannon shell had taken out so much\nof the Blackguard.\nOne shell, one lucky shot, had obliterated several hundred years’ worth\nof training and magical excellence and more than a million danars in\nrecruitment and training and contract costs.\nIronfist hated guns. Hated how they could render moot so many\nthousands of hours of training. But tonight he checked his own carefully.\nHe carried a fine Parian flintlock, as excellent as any Ilytian work, or so the\nsmith had insisted. Ironfist double-checked the black powder and frizzen\nplate, and twisted the cockjaw screw a bit on the flint so it was held tighter.\nHe put the pistol carefully in its holster bag and drew his ataghan. He\nchecked the forward-curving blade and that its fit in the scabbard wasn’t too\nsticky.\nHe’d already instructed his Tafok Amagez not to disturb him until it was\ntime for the execution. They knew to obey. He was dressed in white and\ngold. He didn’t bother with a disguise. If he were seen, he was too\nrecognizable for any disguise to be of much use."

If he were seen, he was too\nrecognizable for any disguise to be of much use.\nThe passage was too tight to bring everything he wanted to bring. As a\nbig man, he’d always been tempted to carry too much for missions simply\nbecause he could. The line between wanting to be prepared and actual\nparanoia was slippery. Especially when the rumor he’d heard involved\nactual, literal immortals.\nTaking a deep breath, he tucked the bit of lambent white luxin he’d kept\nfor so long into the pistol bag. The orange seed crystal he draped around his\nneck, and tucked under the tight cloth against his skin. He might hate the\nthing, but he couldn’t deny it was useful sometimes.\nEnough delaying.\nHe pulled on the bedpost, twisted a brazier, and pushed on the wall. It\nopened on not-quite-silent hinges. Perfect. That meant no one had been\noiling them in the past year.\nThe secret passage was not so much a passage as a pit. There was a tiny\nledge and then a ladder with many broken rungs rising and dropping into\ndarkness. From the top, every prime-numbered rung had a trap built into it,\neither breaking off or triggering knives or something equally pleasant. The\ntraps and the tightness could easily turn the whole shaft into a\nslaughterhouse, so Ironfist hadn’t told Kip and his Mighty about this exit on\nthat day they’d needed to escape, the day Hanishu had died.\nOne of Kip’s friends had been killed and another crippled because of\nIronfist’s decision. But that’s what commanders do.\nAnd kings, he supposed.\nClosing the panel behind him, he mounted the ladder in the secret\npassage.\nThe moist, cold wind licked at his face as he descended in utter\ndarkness. Just beneath him, rung thirty-seven was already broken off. There\nhad once been horizontal doors to shut out the humid breeze, but they’d\nbeen left open, and the hinges had rusted open in some time period when no\none had known or taken care of this secret. That was what had exposed the\nsecret to a young Watch Captain Ironfist: the sound of that damp wind,\ncirculating air up and down the crooked shaft, and on some few nights\nwhistling. It had driven Ironfist crazy until he found an entrance.\nSomeone else had known of the passage, and Ironfist had never found\nout whom. The whistling only happened rarely, and he’d later realized it\nhad been when that other person exited one of the lower levels on a windy\nday.\nSkip forty-one. Whoever had created the ladder had helpfully left Old\nParian numbers inscribed in the ladder every twelfth rung, so one could\nenter at any entrance and not have to memorize which rung a particular one\nmight be. The trouble with skipping rungs, however, was that you had to\ncount with both your feet and your hands—and the numbers started at the\ntop of Prism’s Tower, though Ironfist had never found an exit or even\neavesdropping holes up that high.\nMaybe some previous Prism or White had filled those in, but it wasn’t\nexactly the kind of thing Ironfist could have asked anyone about."

And before now, he’d always made his ascents and\ndescents during the day, so that he could burn a lux torch without worrying\nthat the light would shine through the cracks into all the rooms along the\nroute and announce his presence.\nNow the darkness whispered to him as he slithered through its fist. Small\nmen probably think that being a big man only has advantages. The squeeze\nbetween rungs forty-three and forty-seven argued differently. Ironfist had to\nremove his sword belt and pistol bag and hold them above his head, and\nthen he had to wedge one shoulder down into the vise. He got stuck.\nHe couldn’t breathe, and he almost forgot everything. His lowest foot\nwas touching forty-seven, the next trap rung. He had to skip that one.\nHe was wedged in tight, taking little shallow breaths.\nI’ve done this.\nBut never in this hellstone darkness.\nHe closed his eyes. They weren’t doing him any good anyway. He\nvisualized what he knew to be true. Then he expelled all his breath and slid.\nThe forty-eighth rung was as jarring as ever. His shin pressed so hard\nagainst the forty-seventh rung that he was terrified it would trigger whatever\ntrap lay there, as ever.\nFunny how he never remembered that in time. Not ha-ha funny, rather\nha-ha-I’m-glad-I-didn’t-wet-myself funny.\nBut he’d made it. And from there, he worked down to the bottom of the\nladder without incident. He found the hinges by touch, and applied oil to\nthem, using a boar-bristle brush to push the oil into all the cracks as well as\nhe could. A little noise above had been comforting. Here, it could be\ncatastrophic.\nThen he listened at the hidden door for several minutes.\nThis door opened to the passage between the back docks and the\nChromeria’s main hall. Large, serious gates covered both front and back.\nIronfist had had one of his men surreptitiously check that his keys to the\ngates still worked. They did.\nThank Orholam for lazy or ignorant successors. Of course, usually a\ncommander of the Blackguard trained his or her successor for a year or\nmore. Ironfist had simply been deposed and banished. That still stung. He’d\nvalued that office far more than he valued being a king.\nAfter hearing only silence, he opened the door. The hinges were quiet,\nbut not silent, and his heart thudded with tension.\nWaiting was agony for any soldier, but Ironfist thought he hated it more\nthan most. He was a frontal-assault man, not a skulker in shadows.\nBut then he was in the passage, and there was no one in sight. He closed\nthe hidden door carefully, and headed toward the back docks.\nIt was a relief to see the gate, because there was light there—even the\nnatural darkness of night was brighter than that terrible passage, and the\nmoon was shedding considerable light.\nIn peacetime, only the front gate was guarded—after all, the gates"

There were two Blackguards stationed at the\nback gate.\nIronfist didn’t know who these men or women were—men, judging by\nthe silhouettes in the darkness—but he had to be willing to kill them. If\nnecessary.\nBut it shouldn’t be necessary. Having found an escape tunnel, Ironfist\nhad figured no one would build an escape tunnel that would lead to a locked\niron gate. It had taken him months, but he’d found it: a simple hidden room\nthat had a crawl hole out the back.\nIt was open to the outside, and a skulk of foxes had taken up residence\nin this cozy cave. Which meant that even after Ironfist’s first, horrific\nencounter, it still—years later—stank of musk and fur. He’d liked foxes,\nbefore.\nResponsible commander that he’d been, he’d collapsed the tunnel so that\nthere were no secret entrances into the heart of the Prism’s Tower.\nBut he’d only collapsed the outermost few feet. He could dig through it\nif he must.\nIf the Blackguards stationed back here stayed exactly at their stations\nuntil they were relieved rather than walking back into the tunnel when they\nheard their replacements coming, it would be necessary.\nHe really, really didn’t want to deal with the stench of a fox den and the\npains of digging underground. It would add an hour to his night. It was only\ngoing to take a few minutes for him to find out.\nIn a quarter of an hour, the shift changed. At a call from deep inside the\npassage, the Blackguards outside opened the gate, came inside, closed and\nlocked it behind them—and then walked into the tunnel to meet their\nreplacements, chatting in worried tones about the impending execution and\nthe looming fight.\nGood luck, at last!\nIronfist slipped out soon after they passed his hidden room, then slipped\nout through the gate, locking it behind him.\nThank Orholam. He’d been starting to worry about time.\nHe walked at a low crouch until he was well out of sight on this cold,\ndrizzly night. The Blackguards might chat with their reinforcements for\nseveral minutes, or they might come immediately. He wasn’t going to risk\nanything. Not tonight.\nOnly steps away from the boathouse where his objective lay, a voice\ncalled out from a shadow, freezing him.\n“I never thought you could do this. Not you.”\nCruxer!\nCruxer couldn’t have been more than eighteen years old now, but there\nwas no trace of a boy in his voice or his eyes. His sword was already drawn,\ntunic dripping with rain. He’d been lying in wait.\n“How did you—” Ironfist began. But it was the wrong question. If only\nhe had the Guiles’ golden tongues.\n“I went to your rooms to speak with you. Some of your men are still\nloyal to the Chromeria,” Cruxer said. “They told me you asked one of them\nto test your old keys on these gates. So I know something’s back here."

So I know something’s back here.\nPerhaps you’re to let in some invaders? Order assassins, maybe?”\n“No,” Ironfist said, but he felt a chill down his back at the mention of the\nOrder.\n“You’re in the Order,” Cruxer said.\n“I… was.” Ironfist didn’t consider himself the most emotionally attuned\nman, but the orange seed crystal against his skin magnified his awareness of\ncurrents of feeling—and Cruxer felt as jagged as shattered hellstone, all\ndark glittery points ready to slice.\n“All those years you were commander. They were all a lie.”\n“No.”\n“You infiltrated the Blackguard for the Order of the Broken Eye,”\nCruxer said.\n“I thought I could hold them together,” Ironfist said. “That they didn’t\nneed to be opposed. That the old wounds could be healed…”\n“So you’re a weasel as well as a traitor,” Cruxer said.\nAnd suddenly Ironfist saw that this young man was as hard and\nunforgiving and as foolish as he himself had been at that age. And as\ndangerous.\n“Cruxer, stop. You’re already in my zone.”\nThe kill zone was the area inside of which an armed opponent could\ncomplete a lethal assault before you could defend yourself. It could be a\nsurprisingly large area, especially for a tall, quick man with a long reach\nand good training, like Cruxer.\nIronfist wasn’t going to just let him stroll inside the zone, but making a\nmove toward his own ataghan would start them down a path to misery.\nWhen blades sing, words fall silent.\n“Son, I can tell you everything, but you need to give me time to\nexplain.”\n“Time?” Cruxer asked. “How much time does it take for the orange bane\nto corrupt a man?”\nIronfist was stricken. Shit. He knew about the orange? The seed crystal\nwas barely covered by his tunic’s neckline. If Cruxer saw it, what would he\ndo?\n“This isn’t you doing this, is it?” Cruxer said. “The orange bane has\nchanged you, hasn’t it?”\n“It has affected me,” Ironfist admitted. “But—”\n“Did it give you the idea to make yourself king?”\n“Well… maybe. I’m not sure, but—”\n“And to demand blood for blood?”\n“I—that’s not what you think.”\n“Treason and murder aren’t what I think?”\n“I’m not going to go through with it! Son, you know me!”\n“I know you? Which you? I looked up to you. You were everything to\nme. Everything I dreamed of becoming. You were the standard I fell short\nof. And it was all a lie. You’re here opening the gates for the Order,” Cruxer\nsaid.\n“No, no! This is my vengeance on the Order. They’re the ones who\nkilled my sister.”\n“Your sister was insane. A loose cannon in storm-tossed seas. She was\ntrying to kill you. You want me to believe—How about your brother’s\ndeath? You don’t blame that on the Guiles?”\nIronfist hesitated. “No. Not—”"

The Order\nwas just a tiny regional power halfway across the world from here. And\nthey were the only ones who could save my sister. I thought I could keep\nmy vows to them and to the Blackguard—I was all the way over here!”\n“Our Blackguard vows include renouncing all other vows. And reporting\nthem.”\n“I was a kid!

But I decided not to compromise my integrity ever again, and\nthat’s the difference between us.”\nCruxer wasn’t taking his eyes off him. The young man was totally keyed\nup. And if Ironfist remembered his speed correctly, Cruxer was well within\nkilling distance. Any wrong move Ironfist made was going to end badly.\n“Son, you have to believe me. I’m here to do the right thing.”\n“Through treason and murder?”\n“I know it looks bad. It’s a stratagem.”\n“That the orange revealed to you,” Cruxer said.\nIronfist felt pierced through. He’d lied to Cruxer already, and the young\nman had seen through it. If he was caught in one more lie, this would be\nover. “Yes,” he said softly. “It’s for the greater—”\n“Say ‘the greater good’ one more fucking time!”\n“Easy, easy. Cruxer, please…”\n“We’re soldiers! We’re guardians! That’s who we are. We obey! The\ngreater good isn’t for men like you and me to decide!”\n“Son, sometimes you still don’t know your ass from your elbow. A man\nnever gets to put his conscience in someone else’s care. Every one of us has\nto decide what the greater good is.”\nCruxer’s face hardened, and Ironfist knew he’d made a mistake. Cruxer\nsaid, “You come upstairs with me now. You cancel the execution and I’ll let\nthem decide what to do with you.”\n“I can’t do that. We have to play this my way.”\n“Oh, we do?” Cruxer said, stepping forward.\n“Yes! Dammit, Cruxer, stay back!”\nIf Cruxer attacked, he’d lunge with that sword, but Ironfist wasn’t\nexactly unarmed. People saw the heavy chain on his arm and thought of it\nas costuming, or a slow offensive weapon if he unslung it. But as it was,\ntight from wrist to elbow to shoulder, it could also make a bit of a shield."

But as it was,\ntight from wrist to elbow to shoulder, it could also make a bit of a shield.\nIronfist said, “I’m here for Gavin Guile. My contacts told me he’s here.\nLocked up in a special cell beneath the Chromeria. There’s a hidden\nentrance out here. I can save him. I’m the only man on earth who can save\nGavin Guile.”\n“Really? He’s been here all this time?” Cruxer said, scoffing. “Fine,\nthen! Let’s go upstairs, tell Karris.”\n“We can’t. The Old Man’s here. If he gets word—and he will!—if he\neven suspects what I’m planning, he’ll kill Gavin before we can move.”\n“Oh, the Old Man of the Desert himself? Him, too? This gets more\nconvoluted by the moment, doesn’t it? But then, lies do that, don’t they?”\n“The Old Man’ll be at the execution. I have from now until then to save\nGavin Guile, and you are burning precious time here, son.”\nA flicker of doubt crossed Cruxer’s eyes.\n“We need Gavin Guile or we’re doomed. He’s the Lightbringer,” Ironfist\nsaid.\n“No, he’s not,” Cruxer said.\n“He drafted white luxin at the siege of Garriston. I saw it. I have a piece\nof it. Here in my bag. I can show you!”\n“Don’t you pull anything from that bag! You think I’m an idiot?”\n“Cruxer, you know me. Let me explain.”\n“Toss me the pistol bag.”\n“I’m not tossing you my bag. Just—I will move so slowly. You have\nevery advantage—”\n“Slowly. That’s the key, isn’t it? I know something about will-casting\nnow, Commander. Takes a few minutes to will-cast a person if you don’t\nwant them to notice, doesn’t it? You’re doing it to me right now, aren’t you?\nBet you’ve got orange seed crystal in there, huh?”\n“No, no!” Will-casting?\n“Then why are you stalling?”\n“Because you’re right on the edge and I don’t want either of us to die for\nno reason!” Only then did Ironfist realize he’d just lied, sort of. But he\nwasn’t will-casting with the orange seed crystal. He didn’t even know if he\ncould do that.\nHe did have it on him, though, barely tucked out of sight in the neckline\nof his tunic, and if Cruxer saw it, he was going to think Ironfist was lying\nabout everything else, too.\nBut as sweat trickled down between Ironfist’s pectorals, he saw Cruxer’s\ntemperature drop, just a little.\n“We can save him together,” Ironfist said. “We wait until the very\nmoment of the execution, and we bring him up there with us. He might be\nin rough shape, but you and I can keep him safe. Against the Order, you\nunderstand? We can’t let anyone else get close. I didn’t tell anyone, because\nwe can’t trust anyone.”\n“What are the names of the other Blackguards loyal to the Order?”\nCruxer demanded."

I didn’t tell anyone, because\nwe can’t trust anyone.”\n“What are the names of the other Blackguards loyal to the Order?”\nCruxer demanded.\n“Goddam, son. You think they tell us?”\n“Yes,” Cruxer said. And the way he said it suggested a door closing, a\nlast chance was passing. Of course he believed that, though. Ironfist had\nbeen the commander. He had to know.\n“Grinwoody,” Ironfist blurted out. “Grinwoody’s the Old Man of the\nDesert. The head of the Broken Eye. Hiding in plain sight. As close to\npower as you can possibly get, but invisible. And if we give him even five\nminutes’ warning, he’ll spring some backup plan. He’ll escape. He’s\nsmarter than you know. But if I can—”\nCruxer scoffed. “I ask for Blackguards and you offer up one old slave?”\nThere was no time to tell Cruxer the plan. He wouldn’t believe it\nanyway. “Son. Everything I’ve done—declaring myself king, everything!\nIt’s all been for this. Only I can save Gavin Guile. Only I can stop the\nOrder. Only I can pay for what I’ve done.”\nBut while Ironfist kept his voice contrite, level, there was rage rising in\nhim, too.\nI can’t let you stop me. This is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me. This\nis redemption for all my betrayals and failures. This is the future of the\nSeven Satrapies.\nThrough the orange crystal, he could feel the war raging in his young\nprotégé, scared, angry, guilty, wanting to believe, and not daring to.\nIronfist was turned the wrong way to see if the Blackguards had already\nappeared at the gate behind them, but every time Cruxer raised his voice,\nIronfist thought, What if one of the reinforcements is Grinwoody’s man?\nEven if they weren’t, any of the Blackguards would seize him and take\nhim inside. And if they did that, he would lose everything.\nCruxer said, “You’re listening behind you. You waiting for some of your\ntraitor friends to join you?”\n“Cruxer, let me show you. I’m gonna pull the white luxin from this\nbag.”\nBut his hand was closed around the pistol’s butt. His thumb pulled the\ncockjaw back almost to the place where it would click. But he couldn’t cock\nit. If Cruxer heard that sound, he’d attack.\nIf he twisted his wrist, he could drop the cockjaw without drawing the\npistol from the bag. It would have a very good chance of firing half-cocked.\nIt would be faster even than Cruxer’s sword thrust.\n“Don’t you do it!” Cruxer said.\nAnd in the strain on Cruxer’s face, Ironfist saw not the boy before him\nbut Cruxer’s father, Holdfast. Holdfast had been too much older than\nIronfist for them to really be friends, but the older man had looked out for\nhim. And when he’d died, there’d been that same expression on his face.\n“I’m stopping,” Ironfist said gently."

Maybe\nhe was beyond backing down now. “You taught me to protect my ward no\nmatter what. You taught me it was better to yell a Nine Kill wrongly than to\nremain silent and let my ward die. I want to believe you. But you lied\nbefore. I can’t give you another chance. I can’t let you kill Kip. He’s the\nLightbringer. I’m sorry. I loved you. Now, draw. Please. I can’t kill you in\ncold blood. Draw!”\nBut against every instinct screaming in him, Ironfist slowly uncurled his\ntight fingers from the grip of his pistol. He took a deep breath.\nCruxer’s eyes flicked down, and Ironfist realized that something about\nhis motion had popped the orange seed crystal out of his neckline and into\nview, where it burned with inner light.\nHe saw the look in the young man’s eyes even as the orange sent him the\nfeeling: Cruxer felt stricken, betrayed.\nCruxer said, “I believed you. You almost—” And then he lunged with\nperfect form and incredible speed.\nHe was even faster than Ironfist remembered.\nIn the tales, a duel between grandmasters is a wondrous thing. Each\narrives in the prime of his powers. Neither is given some unfair\ndisadvantage of injury or being weaponless. In the tales, a duel between\ngrandmasters is a match of intellect and strategy as much as one of pure\nphysique.\nThis lunge stabbed through Ironfist’s left arm and side even as he\ntwisted. The blade had passed through the center of a link in his great chain\nas he was bringing it up to block. Then, caught in that chain, the blade\nflexed hard—and snapped.\nCruxer tried to retreat, but he was off balance from the unexpected\nforces of the sword catching and then snapping. Ironfist’s shoulder collided\nwith the younger man’s stomach. They went down together.\nIronfist drew a knife even as he was landing on the younger man’s legs.\nSlashing for Cruxer’s hamstring, Ironfist cut into his calf instead. He\nrolled away.\nThere was no time to gauge wounds. Ironfist scrambled away on hands\nand knees toward his bag, which had fallen to one side, while Cruxer\nlunged away to create distance. Blue luxin flashed from Cruxer and hit him,\nknocking Ironfist over and on top of his bag.\nIronfist rolled and saw Cruxer rising up to one knee to draw a pistol\nfrom some kind of holster at his hip.\nLying on the ground, Ironfist pulled his own pistol from his bag, but he\nwas too slow.\nThe holster gave Cruxer the advantage. He finished his draw and pulled\nhis trigger as Ironfist’s gun was still coming on target.\nAnd nothing happened. Wet from the rain in its open holster, the frizzen\ndidn’t spark. Cruxer was cocking the jaw again when Ironfist fired. Powder\nroared in a burning-white flash that blossomed into a black cloud between\nthem."

Battle was like that. Sometimes you\ncould be dead ten seconds before you realized it.\nIronfist stood, blood gushing from his arm and side. He felt suddenly\nfaint.\nHe collapsed at Cruxer’s feet.\nTossing his pistol aside, he fumbled toward his bag. He wanted his\nprotégé to know the white luxin was real. He wanted Cruxer to know it was\nall real. Maybe, maybe Cruxer could save Gavin. Maybe Ironfist’s lies\nhadn’t doomed them all.\nBut with one foot, Cruxer flipped Ironfist over onto his back. He\nmust’ve thought Ironfist was going for another weapon.\nIronfist looked up into the judgment that stood over him.\nThen Cruxer tottered. His face twisted with irritation.\nThen he collapsed beside Ironfist.\nThe young warrior gasped bloody foam a few times, a bullet hole in his\nchest sucking air as his lungs filled with blood.\nIronfist hadn’t missed.\nCruxer made no gestures. Said no final words. And Ironfist couldn’t read\nthe expression in his eyes.\n“I tried… Oh God,” Ironfist said. “I tried.”\nBut there was no absolution here.\nHe pushed himself up to his knees, fumbling to show Cruxer the white\nluxin—to show his dying eyes that it was true, it was all true. But Ironfist\nstumbled, couldn’t stand. Suddenly weak, he fell facedown again.\nThere was a lot of blood. His blood.\nIt was all going dark. He wasn’t going to make it.\nI’m dying, he thought.\nHe was frightened.\nChapter 91\nKarris lay on her face, her body surrendered to the ministrations of Rhoda’s\nmagical hands. It was good to be reminded that the body could be a temple\nof joy. That there was dancing, and hugging, and pleasing touches, and that\nlife was not only war and death and unconscionable choices.\nShe wished she could lie abed with Gavin one last time, holding each\nother and speaking softly, or making love, either would be her choice of\nhow she would spend this evening that would end in a night of blood, a\nfailure that would echo into history. But the world is a broken place. As far\nas second bests went, a massage from Rhoda was better than most got.\nA knock intruded on the pleasure of Rhoda scraping the warm oil from\nKarris’s limbs with a strigil. “Lord Kip Guile, at your pleasure, High Lady,”\nthe Blackguard Stump said.\nRhoda packed hot towels all around Karris’s limbs and torso. It was a\nnatural break in the massage, as the heat worked in to Karris’s body. Karris\nsighed, and dismissed Rhoda. “Send him in,” she said."

He’d obviously never been here, because he seemed\nsurprised to see the massage table, and more surprised to see Karris on it,\nundressed—though she was covered.\nThen there was a tiny expression of anger. If she hadn’t been looking for\nit, Karris would have missed it. It said, ‘You’re getting a massage, now?\nWhat a bitch.’\nGood. Karris wanted him angry. Time and distance and high office tends\nto put blocks up between you and other people. She didn’t have time for\nhorseshit. And she deserved his rage.\n“I treated you terribly before you left,” she said.\nIt was as if she’d written out the painful memory on a parchment, rolled\nit up, and swatted him across the nose with it like an unsuspecting dog. But\nhe covered it quickly.\n“Ah, you mean when my little joke failed so spectacularly?” Kip said.\n“My apologies again. I didn’t understand the gravity of that subject, and\ndealt with my awkwardness… well, awkwardly.”\nShe didn’t cut him off. “Kip, when a person in his midteens acts\nimmaturely, that’s entirely forgivable and even appropriate. When a person\nin her fourth decade does, it’s neither.\n“Kip, a long time ago, I abandoned my son, and the guilt of that has\nnever left me. So when you showed up and were so… you… I felt Orea\nPullawr had manipulated me; that she thought the loss of one son could be\nmade up by substituting another—as if I’d misplaced a pair of boots and she\nbought me a better pair. I was angry at myself and at others I’d trusted and\nat the world. I wasn’t angry at you. Actually, it was the opposite. I was\nangry because Orea’s plan was working so well, and I couldn’t imagine\nhow unnatural I must be to allow a child who was not my own to fill the\nache I had for the one I gave up.”\nKip said nothing, but she saw she had his total attention.\n“I’ve realized a few things since then. First, that last part was horseshit.\nA parent’s love isn’t a barrel of water to be rationed among those dying of\nthirst, where more for one means less for another. A parent’s love is a new\nchannel cut through the self to the divine essence, a river that cannot be\nexhausted or even fathomed, only experienced. You know how Garriston\nused to have irrigation canals everywhere?”\n“I saw where they used to be,” Kip said. “All filled with sand and scrub\nnow.”\n“That wasteland was what my life was when I first got to know you,\nKip. Opening a new irrigation canal threatened what was working for me.\nNot working well, granted. But I knew the rules there. I’d adjusted to desert\nlife. I treated you terribly because I was scared. If you’d been here since\nthen, I could have apologized sooner, and… well, that’s past now. The\nsecond revelation was… I don’t like your brother.”\n“Half brother,” Kip interjected."

He has few of your talents and fewer\nstill of your virtues. I don’t even know if I can love him even in the abstract,\nand I’ve been trying.” Her throat closed off. She swallowed, but she\ncouldn’t go on.\n“And yet you summoned me, not him,” Kip said flatly. “I heard about\nIronfist’s ultimatum. Everyone has. He wants a dead Guile. And here I am. I\ncan’t believe he’s really doing this.”\n“He’s not taking visitors. The Tafok Amagez wouldn’t even knock on\nhis door.”\n“Thanks for trying. I guess,” Kip said.\n“Ironfist said he wouldn’t consider Zymun, Kip.”\n“He did?” Kip asked. “Oh. The rumor left that part out. Well. That’s too\nbad.”\nKarris snorted. That was putting it mildly. “Andross’s first choice,\nnaturally, was to eliminate the threat at its source. Kill Ironfist, or detain\nhim and forge orders—something. But before we could make plans, we\nwere told that if Ironfist is harmed or doesn’t give the order in person, his\nmen will sail away immediately. His ships have orders to fire on anyone\nwho tries to approach. Ironfist knows how convincing Andross can be, so\nhe’s simply not letting there be communication at all.”\n“And what about my people?” Kip asked.\n“They’re already here. Which, ordinarily, would mean their fate is tied\nto ours. But with your skimmers, we know they could leave. But they\nwon’t. You won’t allow it.”\n“Even if I’m dead?” Kip demanded.\n“Goodness sometimes makes one predictable.”\n“Thank you? I guess?” Kip said. “Funny how quickly things change,\nhuh?”\n“How so?”\n“This morning, Andross wanted me to wager my marriage to save the\nJaspers. I thought I was deciding everything with that game. I even thought\nI won. And now it’s not my happiness you’ll take, it’s my life, and my game\ndidn’t matter at all. Even Andross Guile’s best-laid plans go awry. In\ndifferent circumstances, it’d be almost enough to make one hopeful, you\nknow? That he didn’t foresee everything. If a peon like Ironfist might\ndisrupt his schemes, maybe I could, too. Not that this is the disruption I\nwould have chosen.”\nShe lay there, silent, facing away, hardly able to breathe. She didn’t want\nhim to see her weep.\n“Hard to believe Ironfist turned into such an asshole. It just doesn’t seem\nlike him.”\n“We assassinated his sister,” Karris said. The time for lies and hiding\nwas finished. “Although I never heard a good word about her, he loved her.\nHe always thought the stories that trickled out about her were planted by\nher enemies.

I took away the last\nthing holding him up.”\nShe couldn’t see Kip’s reaction, but this was the grandson of Andross\nGuile, the son of Gavin. “Ah,” Kip said, “I get it: our family took\neverything from him. Andross cost him his life’s work as commander. I cost\nhim Tremblefist. You cost him Haruru. I guess I can understand that rage.\nEveryone’s got a limit.”\nThey waited in silence. Karris’s towels had gotten cold, and her stomach\nfelt tight and uncomfortable. Rhoda would be poking her head in at any\nmoment, if she hadn’t already done so discreetly.\nKip cleared his throat.\n“Fine,” Kip said. “My people will fight under High General Danavis’s\ncommand, as you asked. I would like time to write one last letter to my\npeople expressing my wishes. And one to my wife. Naturally, I’m sure\nyou’ll read both before you pass them along. You’ll likely…” He cleared\nhis throat, having difficulty. Karis was still facing away. Tears poured down\nher face. She held her body tight so the sobs wouldn’t betray her. “You’ll\nlikely need to imprison Tisis until all this is over, or she’ll do something\neveryone regrets. I’ll make two copies of the letter—she may burn the\nfirst.” He laughed, but it was a short, forced sound closer to a cough.\n“Passionate woman. You would’ve liked her.”\n“High Lady?” Rhoda’s voice came in as she did. The physicker began\npulling away the towels, heedless of Kip’s presence.\n“When is the execution?” Kip asked.\n“Within the hour,” Karris said. She winced as Rhoda put icy-cold hands\non each side of her neck. “We need to make sure that High General Danavis\nhas time to integrate and deploy the forces. Even waiting this long is cutting\nit close.”\n“Not enough time to take care of everything,” Kip grumbled under his\nbreath.\n“Who among us gets that?” Karris asked. Her stomach twisted.\nShe heard him take one step toward the door. Then he stopped.\n“Fuuuck,” Kip said suddenly under his breath. “You’re not getting a\nmassage. You’re being anointed for burial. You didn’t choose me. You\nchose you.”\nShe didn’t answer. Couldn’t. She hadn’t been able to muster the resolve\nto tell him yet, and even now her will failed her. She rolled over and sat up.\nRhoda covered her, expertly using first her own bulk and then a robe to\nmaintain her patient’s dignity—such as it was.\n“You?!” Kip demanded. “But you’re needed!”\nNeeded?! What did he know about unmet needs? The very word pushed\nher enough that she could finally speak. “Kip. Do you want to know one of\nthe deepest horrors of life? None of us is needed, not truly.

My son Zymun is a soulless manipulator, rapist,\nand murderer incapable of human feeling. I have only my work, my\nBlackguards’ love, and my hopes for you and your life. All those things\ndemand I do this.\n“How could I live with myself if I asked you to die in my place? How\nmonstrous would history think I was? Would they call me Karris Ironheart\nperhaps if—after you offered me a piece of motherhood—I not only\nspurned you and drove you away but then, when you finally came back to\nsave us all, I rewarded you by demanding your death? No. No. This way\nhistory at least will be fooled. I’ll become another heroic Karris sacrificing\nherself for the Chromeria. It’s a lie, but one that might inspire others to do\nbetter than I have. I’ve known I was going to die in this battle for some\ntime. This is—this is just like having my Freeing a bit early, is all.”\n“No,” Kip said plaintively.\n“You won your game. Go enjoy your victory and your life. Both are\nmore fleeting than you know.”\n“You cannot—”\nBut another cramp hit Karris’s stomach, this one insistent. “Now, if\nyou’ll pardon me,” she said. “I decided that defecating as one dies isn’t\ncommensurate with the dignity expected of the White, so I took a laxative\nearlier. Shitting uncontrollably now seemed better than doing so later, but\nI’d rather you not watch.”\nChapter 92\nGet up, whinger. One more lap.\nIronfist woke. He was cold. Freezing cold. His cheek was in a pool of\nsomething sticky.\nSo, not dead. Not yet. He tried to move.\nEverything hurt. Two places were utter fire, but his whole body hurt like\nhe had a terrible fever. Everything ached. Lying still hurt marginally less.\nI know I’m the fool who chose a team race, but you’re the fool who\nagreed. Get up.\nIt was how he’d encouraged his little brother, when they were mere\nteens in that awful mountains-to-desert race that capped the novennial\nPhilocteian Games. They’d always loved running, but they’d never\nexpected to be among the best. But somehow, the better runners had fallen\nout through injury, and the young princes had suddenly become the bearers\nof their clan’s pride.\nClamping his arm tight to his side, Ironfist sat up.

A lot of blood.\nBut the spiritual pain was blunted by the physical.\nIronfist blinked until the black spots retreated from his vision.\nThe Blackguards who should have come to the back gate had never\ncome. Even with the musket shots, no one had come.\nUp. Up!\nIronfist must surely be running out of time before the execution. He\nlooked at the stars, but he’d never paid enough attention to know at what\nhour certain stars rose and set at this time of year. He couldn’t tell how long\nhe’d been unconscious. Besides, it didn’t matter. All that mattered was\nsaving Gavin Guile.\n“One more lap,” he said.\nThe great race ended with two laps in the hippodrome before cheering\ncrowds. Hanishu and Harrdun had no idea that they’d nearly caught up with\nthe Tiru-clan bastards they’d been following across the desert until they\narrived in the hippodrome itself. The men were walking, beaten, exhausted.\nOne was limping. They looked at Hanishu and Harrdun’s entrance with\nfrank terror.\nLike young antelope, Hanishu and Harrdun had found sudden energy.\nThey’d closed the gap. They’d passed the men, laughing as they headed into\nthe final lap.\nThey were going to win. Win!\nForty thousand people were on their feet, shouting, cheering. And then\nthe young men passed the Tiru section. Their tribal rivals had been aghast,\nin denial on the first lap.\nThis time, they were furious. They began pelting the boys with stones,\ncrockery, coins, anything they could throw.\nIronfist had given Hanishu the inside, intending to make the last lap a\nfriendly rivalry, to see if he could pass him in the final stretch. But that put\nHanishu closest to them, so he caught the brunt of the Tirus’ fury. A cup hit\nhim in the knee, midstride, and then a gruel bowl smashed over his ear.\nHanishu had gone down, nearly unconscious.\n“Come on, brother,” Ironfist said aloud now, his worlds blurring\ntogether. “Everything we’ve done up to now has been for this. No\nsurrender, or it’s all for nothing.”\nUsing his good hand while keeping his other arm clamped tight to his\nside to try to slow the blood loss, Ironfist pushed off the ground. He\nswayed, faint, and reached out. He braced himself on the boathouse to keep\nfrom falling, a sudden wave of vertigo cresting over him.\nAfter he steadied himself and the dizziness passed, he opened his eyes.\nHe was a good ten paces from the boathouse. There was nothing to\nsteady himself on.\nHanishu had stood, staggered, and fell again as the Tiru runners came\nback into view around the corner behind them, catching up.\nHarrdun pulled him to his feet and braced him with an arm, and tried to\npull him to a jog."

He fell again,\npulling Harrdun down with him.\nHanishu had started weeping. ‘I can’t. I can’t. I want to, but I can’t.’\n“Don’t you make me carry you,” Ironfist said aloud now.\nTwo more teams had just entered the stadium. There was a near riot in\nthe stands where other fans were attacking the Tiru for their stone-throwing.\nWith trembling arms and trembling legs, he’d picked up his little\nbrother. Hanishu clung to him fiercely, trying to distribute his weight, trying\nto help, even as he’d doomed them.\nIronfist had jogged a few steps, but he couldn’t keep it up, not after all\nthe leagues they’d run. He slowed to a walk, and then it was all he could do\nto stagger forward one slow step at a time.\nAnd then the hippodrome erupted in cheers and also shouts of outrage as\nthe Tiru team crossed the finish line to win, and the brothers were both\nweeping.\nAnd then another team passed them. And another. And Hanishu broke\ndown as his big brother carried him. ‘I failed you. I failed you.’\nGod damn this whole world to fire. Those were the very words Hanishu\nsaid again last year as he’d lain dying in Ironfist’s arms. As if the failure\nwere his.\nThe last hundred paces were agony. Someone offered to help, but\nIronfist hadn’t even been able to see them. There was only the finish line,\nand his brokenness and his rage and a tenacious love for his brother that\nsaid, I will not quit.\n“We don’t quit, brother. We don’t quit,” he’d said then and said now.\nThe last forty paces were a blur of unvariegated pain. The acid in his\nmuscles, the roar of the crowd—helpful or hostile, he couldn’t tell—\nbuilding to a crescendo, and the burning of the sun. He wept—ashamed as a\nboy is foolishly ashamed of tears—and none judged him. He wept, and\nthose walking behind him, a throng swollen to hundreds, perhaps\nthousands, wept with him.\nThey finished fourth, collapsing across the line, and that placement only\nbecause the fifth- and sixth-place clan teams had seen what happened and\nslowed to a walk behind them, and refused to let anyone else pass them.\nThey fell—and were instantly lifted on shoulders and paraded through\nanother lap, the actual victors forgotten.\nTheir defeat had garnered more acclaim and support for their clan than\nany victory would have. Their grit and courage in adversity had not only\nmade them famous, but had guaranteed their Tlanu-clan ascendancy.\nMother had been assassinated soon thereafter. And once a rival to his big\nbrother, bitter at his constant defeats, Hanishu had changed utterly. He’d\nsuddenly worshipped Harrdun, taking his few victories over his big brother\nwith quiet joy and his own defeats with equanimity.\nThe two had become best friends.\nAnd it had all been for evil."

It was\nright where his last Order contact had said.\nEven the Old Man needed people to do the actual digging, and even the\nOld Man had recruitment problems—if you simply kill your workers every\ntime they dig a tunnel for you, you run out of workers.\nHe ducked his head to enter yet another tight, loathsome place. He was\nfully in the darkness before he realized that this time, he didn’t need to\nworry about anyone seeing a light. His thinking was coagulating like the\nblood matting his tunic.\nCracking open a mag torch, he was blinded by the glow—too stupid in\nhis present state to look away.\nThe path forked and he took the higher way. Soon he caught sight of a\nblue arc off to one side of the path. Like a tangent line, this path had been\ncut through the rock to intersect with a blue sphere at only one point. The\npath was above the luminous sphere, looking diagonally down on its\ncontents.\nIronfist braced himself on the rock and looked down. Gavin Guile\nwasn’t inside.\nBut something was. A vaguely man-shaped mass of glittering blue motes\nswirled in the cell. The cell itself was broken, a hole gaping in one side, and\nshards of blue luxin littering the area beyond. But jagged hellstone\nglimmered in that tunnel, trapping the glimmering creature.\nThe pieces tumbled around Ironfist’s besieged brain like the individual\ncolored tiles of a mosaic refusing to coalesce into an image: Gavin, in the\nfirst year after the False Prism’s War, once asking, ‘Ironfist, your family\nwere priests long ago, right? Do you know what happens when the djinn\ndie?’\nIt had been an odd question, but Gavin had been an odd young man.\nGavin wasn’t in there, and Ironfist was dying. He had to move on before\nhis time ran out.\nHe pushed off the wall and kept walking, leaning heavily on the wall.\nIronfist had known nothing special to tell the Prism, no family secrets.\nBut he’d delved into the subject for some months before finally abandoning\nit as nothing more than the Prism’s whim.\nThat piece, and Gavin’s fierce insistence that he hunt wights alone—\nthough not always alone. Sometimes he’d fought the Blackguard most to\nfight alone when the wight was the most powerful, and let others come to\nhelp him when one seemed least dangerous.\nIronfist reached the portal to the green cell. Gavin wasn’t there, either.\nSome skeletal tree-thing, like climbing ivy twisted around itself, dragged\nbranch claws against its circular walls, fists knotting.\nNot here either, go on."

        "text": "Some skeletal tree-thing, like climbing ivy twisted around itself, dragged\nbranch claws against its circular walls, fists knotting.\nNot here either, go on.\nThe djinn were the old gods. To the pagans, they were immortal gods,\nspirits who sometimes partnered with favored humans—high priests or\nheroes—and might extend a human’s life indefinitely. The Old Parians had\nbelieved the djinn were malignant, that they waited until the hour of death\nso they could take possession of a body, a host that was always a drafter, in\nwhose body they might then walk the earth. Sometimes they waited for old\nage; other times they prompted young heroes and heroines to an early death\nthrough heroism or suicide. Thus, with their stolen bodies, these spirits\nmight experience physical life—sex and food and time and human\nrelationships, parenthood, even the feel of the wind across one’s face—\ntreasured novelties for the otherwise incorporeal.\nThe yellow god in the yellow cell was like a taste of sickly sunlight. It\nwas liquid gold coruscating and crashing like ocean waves as it alternately\nthrew itself against the walls and then meditated quietly, lights sloshing\nabout its incorporeal figure, eyes like unquiet stars.\nNo Gavin.\nWeakening further still, Ironfist moved on. Hallucinations. These must\nbe the hallucinations of trauma and fear of impending death.\nAfter all the study Ironfist had done, Gavin had never inquired about the\ndjinn again. Ironfist had dismissed it as the young Prism’s capricious,\ncapacious intellect shining its light every which way, even into dead\nhistories.\nAs for Gavin’s question, everyone supposed that the djinn simply\nslipped back into a spirit form when their host finally died, for even their\nmagic couldn’t keep a human body alive forever.\nAnd that was the final piece of the mosaic.\nThat was why Gavin had hunted alone on those times. He was hunting\nthe contemporary equivalent of high priests, the men and women who\nmight be hosting immortals. He hadn’t been hunting men; he’d been\nhunting gods. With each successful hunt, Gavin had brought a host and\ndjinn here. Somehow he’d figured out how to bind the spirit of the\nimmortals within this prison. Maybe he’d even made the prison itself.\nBut now Gavin wasn’t in the orange, and there was no obvious escape\nroute from this one. The orange thing sat, quiet, just a little orange man, not\nscary, not fascinating, just pathetic. Just longing to be free.\nAn altogether understandable wish, and why shouldn’t he be free?\nIronfist wondered if there wasn’t some way he could help the poor—\nIt’s a hex. Many, many hexes together, Ironfist saw now, swimming\nunder the surface of the thing’s orange skin.\nHe blinked and looked away. He didn’t dare look again.\nBut he buckled at the next step, and he wouldn’t have been able to stand\nif he hadn’t been helped.\nHe took up the mag torch again. “Tore open my wound pretty good,” he\nsaid to—\nTo whom? He looked around him.\nWho’d helped him up just now?\nAnd what had kept him from falling outside, when he’d been ten paces\nfrom the boathouse?"

You only can because you’re so close to\ndeath, where the veil thins between your world and reality. This next part is\ngoing to be hard for you.\nThe voice seemed so familiar, but Ironfist couldn’t place it.\nIronfist pushed along the corridor. Past the red immortal—Dagnu, he\nrealized now—who was in the form of a man yet looked like a thousand\ntiny embers catching flame, descending as ash, and catching flame and\nclimbing again. It turned and glared fire at him as he staggered past.\nGavin wasn’t in there.\nGavin wasn’t in the superviolet cell that hurt the eyes.\nGavin wasn’t in the sub-red inferno, where a face of flame floated.\nGavin wasn’t in the black cell, where Ironfist couldn’t see any creature,\nbut could feel a malignant presence watching him back.\n“I can save you,” a quiet, calm, reasonable voice from that cell said. “He\ncannot. I can heal you. What use are you in this condition? Do not believe\nwhat the liars have told you. You know they’re liars, do you not? They\nweaken the strong, and you, you could be very, very strong indeed. With my\nhelp.”\nBut Ironfist had been around men and women more persuasive than\nhimself for his entire life. Simplicity was the cloak that fit him.\nEvery time he tried subtlety and lies, it turned to blood.\nLike today.\nOh, Cruxer. Orholam forgive me.\nHe stepped away.\nTouch this.\nUnder his fingers he found hellstone, and he pressed it hard, making sure\nhe was drafting nothing, making sure the magic of the old gods didn’t cling\nto him.\nHow did he know to do that?\nBut then, within sight of the exit, he suddenly grew faint as the\nrealization finally crested over him like a tsunami wave. He was leaving.\nHe’d searched all the prisons.\nGavin Guile had been here. He had—unbelievably, horribly, unthinkably\n—been imprisoned with these things.\nBut Gavin was here no longer. Which meant…\nIt meant Ironfist had murdered Cruxer for nothing.\nHe fell to the cold stones of the tunnel. His mag torch finally sputtered\nout, leaving him in darkness.\nIt was all for nothing. He’d come too late. He’d faltered on the last lap.\nIf Gavin wasn’t here, and no one had heard of him since he’d left, that\nmeant he was dead.\nIronfist had failed. He had tried to compete in subtlety with the Orea\nPullawrs and the Andross Guiles and the Amalu Anazâr Tlanus of the\nworld, and he’d failed.\nHe sank down, down. He could go on no longer.\nGod, he cried out, damn me! Give me what I deserve! Let me die. I’m\nfinished. No more. No more.\nYou’re not dying today, brother. I won’t let you. We’re not going to quit.\nNot today."

Ironfist thought.\nSomething was glowing in the darkness.\n“Don’t you make me carry you,” Tremblefist said.\nIt wasn’t real. Couldn’t be. Ironfist knew that. He was dying, and his\nmind was playing tricks. Torturing him or comforting him. It wasn’t\nreliable, that was all that mattered.\nHe lay down.\n“You are the most loyal man I know,” Tremblefist said. “I know you,\nbrother.”\nA hallucination. A bitter memory. Ironfist settled his head against the\nstones to die.\n“You think they cheered only because you carried me?” this phantasm of\nTremblefist said. “Do you not remember your own wounds?”\nNo. He hadn’t been harmed, had he? Hanishu had taken all the brunt of\nthe Tiru fans’ rage.\nAnd then he remembered the blood. He’d taken blows in the face, a\nbroken nose, a sliced forehead. Two or three broken ribs. He’d forgotten\nthose.\nBy the time he’d crossed the finish line, he and Hanishu had been a gory\nmess together.\n“I begged you to quit. I knew my wounds were temporary, but I was\nafraid you would die. You said, ‘I don’t know quit.’”\n“I’ve learned,” Ironfist said bitterly.\nHanishu flashed an exasperated smile, exactly as he had done in life,\nexcept that Ironfist could see the wall through his form. “This doesn’t\nhappen, you know,” Tremblefist said. “We peaceful departed, we don’t\nreturn. And I am at peace, brother. But he told me that uncommon loyalty\ndeserves uncommon rewards. You took a wrong turn, associating with the\nOrder to avenge mother and protect Haruru. But you’re no traitor, brother.”\nAfter Teia had killed Haruru, making himself king of Paria had been the\nonly way Ironfist could get back to Little Jasper safely, and become too\nimportant to be killed or simply sent away by the Order’s people or Andross\nGuile’s. Becoming king had been the only way to muster an army and bring\nit here.\nIt had been the only way he could hope to get vengeance on his uncle.\nThe plan had been to relent at the last moment before the execution and\nsay, ‘I’ve changed my mind. Instead of a Guile, I’ll let myself be contented\nwith the blood of one of those most useful to them. That slave, Grinwoody.\nHe’s your right hand. I’ll take him. Now.’\nAndross Guile would take the deal in a moment, and the Old Man of the\nDesert would never see it coming. Even if he had Blackguards in his\nemploy, even if they were in the room, they didn’t know Grinwoody was\nthe Old Man, so they wouldn’t know to try to save him.\nThat was the trouble with keeping your identity secret from your own\npeople.\nIt had been a good plan. Devious. Very orange. It might have even\nworked, if not for Cruxer.\nBut it was all too late now. All for nothing."

Would there be more blood on his tally?\n“I failed, brother,” he said, and the tears were hot and bitter.\nWe all fail.

A figure approached. Voices spoke, Tremblefist’s\nrumbling through his chest, as Ironfist drifted between consciousness and\nnot.\nAnd then he was handed off. His brother Hanishu took Harrdun’s face in\nhis big hands one last time, and kissed his forehead in blessing, and then\nwas gone.\nIronfist must have been delirious, because he felt like the man now\nholding him was not nearly large enough to hold him, but the little round\nParian managed not only Ironfist but also his own bags and jugs, and was\nalso carrying him very quickly. They passed people, and everyone they\npassed seemed to be turning their backs or suddenly inattentive, yawning or\nrubbing their eyes.\nAnd then the man set him down on his feet inside the lift that could take\nhim to the level of the audience chamber, where there would be many\nBlackguards. Ironfist tottered, eyes bleary. His side had been bandaged; he\ncouldn’t remember when.\n“Do I know you?” Ironfist asked. The man smelled of… kopi?\nThe man smiled, and his face shone. “Come now, she’s almost here.”\n“Who?”\n“The one who’s gonna save your life.” The round little man squinted.\n“Probably.” Then he seemed to flit out of and then back into the space he\nwas standing, his jugs and cups clinking. Ironfist must have blinked or\nsomething. “Hmm. Well, if anyone can save you, she’s the one.”\nChapter 93\nDon’t hit him in the face, Kip. That is not how adults solve problems.\n“We need to go ahead with this,” Zymun said. “I mean, I don’t want to\nany more than any of us. But I don’t think we can afford to wait.”\nBut if he were going to hit him in the face, Kip had a coin stick in his\nleft pocket that fit in his burn-scarred left fist perfectly. No sense breaking\nyour hand on the eve of battle.\nThe most important people in the Seven Satrapies had gathered in the\naudience chamber tonight: the High Magisterium, the Colors, nobles, the\nPrism-elect, the promachos, the White, Kip, at least twenty Blackguards, a\nveritable army of scribes who served them all, and one chubby little Parian"

It may not cover you, for instance.”\n“Midnight’s in four minutes,” Zymun said, as if he were just a clock,\nuncaring of the outcome, merely reminding everyone.\nUppercut, right in the jaw. Maybe I’d break some teeth that way. I could\nbe spared the sound of his insufferable voice for a while.\n“I’m ready,” Karris said, coming back from the side, where she’d been\ntalking one more time with the luxiats; praying, Kip guessed. She’d already\nsaid her goodbyes to all the Blackguards earlier. “I don’t feel the need to\nscrounge about desperately for a few more minutes.”\nShe was radiant, not just with her normal beauty and resolve, but there\nwas an inner light, a deeper strength to her.

And\nKip was needed for the islands’ defense.\nSo it had to be Karris.\nShe made a sign of benediction to the crowd. “My faithful ones,” she\nsaid, “I’ve run my race.

Take no vengeance for me, but stitch Paria back into these\nSeven Satrapies with grace and mercy, as Orholam would will it.”\nThere were quiet sobs in the room. The Blackguards were all stony-\nfaced sorrow. Karris took a few moments to make eye contact with them\none last time. Many in the crowd looked on with abject horror, while others\nsimply seemed titillated.\nThis is not happening.\nKarris looked at Kip, and her mouth pursed with regret.

He saw\nit, too. This was defense of life, not an attack. I know what I saw, and I\nswear this to be true.”\nTwenty Blackguards gave silent affirmation. Kip hadn’t even thought of\nthe Blackguard, but he realized why he was the first to react: they were\ntrapped between their next Prism, a White who’d abdicated her protection\nby them, and a not-quite order from the promachos. Their loyalties and their\noaths of obedience had tangled, slowing them.\n“You dare? You dare lay your hands on me?” Zymun hissed at Kip from\nthe floor, blinking his eyes.\n“Grandfather,” Kip said loudly but without turning from the snake.\n“May I remind you of your earlier promise?”\nIrritated, Andross announced, “Blackguards, Kip is under my full\nprotection. Act accordingly.”\nZymun lunged at him, scrambling to draw a pistol, but the Blackguard—\nhappily absolved of contradicting loyalties—restrained him quickly and\nwith more force than strictly necessary.\n“Take Zymun to his apartments.

We wait!”\n“My lord has the luxury of disobeying orders,” Commander Fisk said. “I\nwish I had the same.” He took a knife from another Blackguard. “Karris,\nArcher, sister, High Lady Guile, forever our Iron White,” he said, “it has\nbeen my honor to serve with you, and to serve you. May Orholam reunite\nus in gentler lands.”\n“And may He bless you with light and warmth, Commander. Now, stop\ndelaying, old trainer of mine. It’s taking everything in me not to try my\nhand at fighting you one last time, to see if I could win now, as I couldn’t so\nvery long ago.”\nTaking a deep breath as he came to stand over her where she knelt, she\npulled the neckline of her blouse open, looking up toward heaven and\npulling the skin tight so that the gaps between the ribs were visible.\nThen there was a cry outside the audience chamber in the hall. Kip\ncouldn’t make out the words, but an instant later he saw Trainer Gill\nGreyling go sprinting past the open door—not into the audience chamber\nbut past it toward the lifts—shouting, “Stop, stop, stop!” with the urgency\nof man who knew he was too late.\nChapter 94\nTeia’d had terrible premonitions all the way here, but the last thing she was\nexpecting when she finally made it invisibly to the Chromeria’s lifts was to\nbe greeted by the lift gate opening to reveal a bloody, badly wounded\nCommander Ironfist.\n“Get in, quickly. Timing is everything,” a dark, plain-dressed Parian\nman with him said to her. The lift was otherwise empty.\nFor a moment, Teia wondered if she was hallucinating the whole thing.\nFirst, she was invisible. Second, Ironfist was the utter opposite of invisible\n—and yet, no one else seemed to have seen him.\nShe stepped in, and the lift shot upward.\nThe Parian heaved a sigh of relief. “Haven’t cut it that close since\nCwellar—or is that next? Oh, no, that’s next. Actually—that’s right now!”\nHe pulled the brake and turned to Teia. They were only a few floors up.\n“Give it a hundred and four count from right… now. Then go as fast as\npossible. Blackguard immediately on the left is an Order agent. Has orders\nnot to let Harrdun make it alive to the audience chamber. Or he’ll be on the\nright if you run late.”"

Or he’ll be on the\nright if you run late.”\nHe turned to Ironfist, who was slumped against the wall. “You. You’ll\nhave to choose between vengeance and life.”\n“For whom?” Ironfist growled.\n“No time.”\n“Wait,” Teia said. “Who are you?”\n“No time!”\nThe little man ducked out of the lift, cups and canteens clanking.\nTeia threw her hands up. How was he—\nShe poked her head out into the hall, but he was gone. Not around the\ncorner, the corners were too far away. He was just gone.\nShe stepped back into the lift. With Ironfist. Not Commander Ironfist,\nshe remembered now. How had she forgotten? King Ironfist. Who’d last\nseen her when she was assassinating his sister, as he begged her to stop.\nShhhhiiitt.\n“You’re not gonna ask?” he said, his voice deep and cloudy with pain.\nHe waved to the blood drenching his once-white-and-either-green-or-red\ngarb—it was certainly red by now.\n“The Order?” she asked hopefully.\n“No.”\n“Orholam have mercy.” Cruxer.\n“Not much, He doesn’t. But I… I can’t blame this on Him.”\nTeia’s heart froze. “Did he…?”\n“He’s dead.”\nNo. She wasn’t going to believe it. She wasn’t going to think about it.\n“The Order,” she said, suddenly finding some fire. “You know things about\nthe Order.”\n“Enough to know they’ll ask your soul and then stab you in the back.”\nHe looked at her with lidded eyes, exhausted from pain and blood loss and\nwhatever ordeal he’d been through, but also hard and bitter. “But then, you\nknow that.”\n“I’m infiltrating the Order for Karris. She’s trying to stop them once and\nfor all.”\n“You can’t stop them.” He tried to laugh. Coughed instead. “Look at\nme.”\n“What? What do you mean?”\n“I’m convinced they’ve half the immortals of hell protecting them. How\nelse does Cruxer find me just then?”\n“Don’t talk about him—don’t! Don’t! We’re running out of time. I have\nto stop them, or it’s all for nothing!”\n“Ha. That’s what I said, too. The execution. Can’t be more than a few\nminutes from now. Hope they don’t go ahead without me. Don’t you see? It\nwas all to get him.” He blinked his eyes, swayed.\nHuh? “No, you are not dying now. Who? Him who?”\n“My uncle. He’s the Old Man of the Desert. Kept himself secret all these\nyears, but a secret’s a weakness, see? Only way to get him was… this. He\nsent you to kill my sister. After everything I did for him. His own niece.”\nIronfist sagged, and Teia braced him, feeling tiny against his big form.\n“No, no, no. You stay with me! I can’t do this without you.”\n“You killed her. My sister. I begged you not to. I begged.”"

But I’m sorry. I’m\nsorry you lost someone you loved so much, but she needed to die. She was\nalready gone by the time you were in that room with her. She was gonna get\neveryone killed.”\nIronfist blew out a little breath, and his eyes softened. “I know,” he\nwhispered. “Oh God. Cruxer. Teia, I—”\n“Don’t. I can’t talk about—Who is he? What’s the Old Man’s name?”\nTeia pressed.\nOrholam’s balls, how many seconds had passed? They had to go!\n“I gave everything for this. Only I can do it. Can’t trust anyone. That’s\nnot the plan.”\nTeia threw back her hood. “Trust me! Commander, please. Let me be the\nplan!”\nHe looked at her and she felt those eyes that she’d looked up to for so\nlong weighing her, seeing her now, not only as an adult but as someone he\napproved of.\n“Amalu Anazâr Tlanu,” Ironfist said. “Amalu Anazâr is the Old Man of\nthe Desert.” He breathed a deep sigh as if stepping out from under a weight\nthat had been crushing him for years.\n“Wait, wait, there’s no one named that who’s got access to upper levels\nof the Prism’s Tower. He’s got some disguise, some other name?”\nBut Ironfist’s eyes had drifted shut. He leaned more heavily on Teia.\n“No! Don’t you die on me!”\nEyes still closed, he said, “Easy, nunk. Just resting my eyes a bit before\nthis last part. You lose the count already?”\n“What?”\n“Almost time,” he said. He opened his eyes and there was something of\nthe old Ironfist mettle in there. “I gotta get to that audience chamber and\nmake sure nothing else goes to shit.”\n“Are you—”\n“Grinwoody,” he said.\nIt crashed around her ears like a pagan temple collapsing. Grinwoody?\nGrinwoody, Andross Guile’s right hand. All the secrets of the world passed\nthrough that man’s fingers. Another Order master assassin, this one dressed\nin the invisibility cloak of slavery.\nTeia, a former slave herself, hadn’t seen it. Hadn’t thought to look there\nfirst.\nShe drew herself up. “I’ll get you past the assassin or assassins at the\ndoor, but then I gotta hand you off. I’ve got work to do. What’s that count\nat?” Teia asked.\n“One hundred one.”\n“I knew you’d know,” she said, making sure she was filled with paryl\nand clouds of it hissing from her fingers. She threw the brake, and they shot\nupward.\nShe glanced over at her old commander. “You look terrible.”\n“I’ve felt better, too,” he said as the floors blurred past.

Teia scrambled to pull her hood back into place, a process\nmade awkward by the long knives in her hands. “Who was that guy?” Teia\nasked as if she weren’t flustered.\n“Karris’s kopi seller, maybe? She loves that damned stuff.”\n“Hey, watch it,” Teia said. “A Blackguard guards his tongue.”\nThey both chuckled at that, though Ironfist broke off immediately in\npain.\n“Six in the foyer at an event like this?” Teia asked. She was standing to\nhis left to put herself between him and the threat.\nHe grunted. “I’d have more, but there’s a war on. Could mean more.” As\nif it took supreme effort, Ironfist levered himself off the wall to stand with\nhis feet wide. “By the way,” he said, unhooking the heavy chain that ran\nfrom the wrist manacle to a hook on his left bicep, “you’re still just the\nbackup plan.”\nThen the doors opened.\nThrough their training, the half-dozen Blackguards in the foyer were all\nglancing at the opening lift door, and they gawked at the sight of King\nIronfist sodden with blood, even his face sticky with the stuff, his many-\ncolored finery soaked with gore. Teia wasn’t looking at the faces, though—\nshe was staring at their hands.\nThey all moved forward. It was what they were trained to do, to move\ntoward danger, to confront whatever shocked or threatened them in order to\ngive aid or to defend the defenseless behind them. For Teia to find the threat\nwith that much sudden motion all coming toward her, all of them armed to\nthe teeth, was nearly impossible. Left side, left side—\nRight side!\nA young Blackguard she didn’t know stepped forward, wide-eyed with\nfear, too fast for a paryl pinch to his nerves. Ironfist was moving to meet the\nthreat himself, but he was way too slow. As the young man lunged, Teia\ndove beneath Ironfist’s rising arm and slashed up with both knives.\nHer first missed the blade she was trying to intercept, but passed cleanly\nthrough the young man’s wrist. Hand and blade went spinning. Her other\nblade sank deep into the young man’s groin.\nThen Ironfist’s open hand slapped into the young man’s face, and\nstopped. The chain wrapped full around the would-be assassin’s head. Then\nIronfist tore back in the other direction, snapping the young man’s neck and\nflinging his body away.\nBehind the first ranks of Blackguards, Teia saw Gill Greyling coming\nrunning, shouting at his men to stop, stop!\nBut the problem of training people to react with instant lethality to\nthreats is that they do. One of the veteran Blackguards was reaching for the\nsleeve of a young man next to her, but four Blackguards were already\nattacking.\nA wall of paryl heat blasted out of Teia as it had once at Ruic Head.\nEveryone nearby fell back, feeling as if their skin were on fire.\n“Naught Naught One! Naught Naught One!” Gill Greyling shouted,"

But she saw one person\nmoving in the opposite direction.\nNot a Blackguard.\nAny civilian would rush toward the excitement to see what was\nhappening. This one disappeared against the flow of the crowd.\nA lookout, Teia guessed. To warn the Old Man.\nBut two dozen Blackguards and innumerable civilians who hadn’t been\nallowed into the audience chamber were crowding into the foyer.\nTeia pushed through them, ducking and dodging, not caring if anyone\nsaw her. She saw Grinwoody, not twenty paces away, pop out of the door of\nthe audience chamber and then run toward the lift on the opposite side of\nthe tower.\nIt took her far too long to win her way clear of the crowd and go after\nhim. The Blackguards who were stationed here had abandoned their posts.\nIn the lifts, she felt the lines for vibration. Up. He’d gone up to the Prism’s\nand White’s level.\nShe didn’t know of any escapes above her—was he gathering his\npapers?—no, wait, she didn’t know of any escapes from higher in the tower\nexcept from the roof!\nBut two minutes later, she was on the roof. Alone. He hadn’t triggered\nthe escape lines. He had some other escape.\nShe’d missed him. The Old Man of the Desert was gone.\nChapter 95\nTeia was shaking badly. It was irritating as hell.\nBut when the battle-juice rush disappears, the body reacts, and she’d\nnever had quite as much of its rush as she had in saving Ironfist (she hoped\nshe’d saved him, anyway) and nearly killing the Old Man of the Desert.\nGrinwoody. That devious, slippery little bastard. That toad, sitting at\nAndross Guile’s elbow for all those years.\nIn all her hunting, she’d looked past him a hundred times. She hated that\neveryone overlooked slaves, that everyone considered them beneath notice\n—and she’d done it herself. She’d been a slave. She was a slave. And she’d\nlooked right past him.\nShe was so mad at herself, she wanted to kill something. Scratch that.\nSomeone.\nIn fact, that was just the thing for it. But she had to find him first.\nWith the commotion she and Ironfist had made downstairs, there were\nonly two Blackguards on the entire floor. But she’d been drafting paryl for\nhours, and she was tapped out.\nNot to mention trembling.\nBlackguards were going to be coming back to their stations soon, and\nshe was in no state to fight or evade them with any dexterity.

Nightmare.\nAbaddon.\nHe was looking for her.\nShe wasn’t going to sleep there again.\nBelatedly, too late maybe, she took up a position outside the Old Man’s\nsecret room in the lift shaft. He’d gone up when he fled, not down, so she\nknew that he hadn’t come here first. Would he come this way at all?\nIf he were going to flee permanently, she assumed that he would come to\nhis office first. She assumed this was his office. She assumed that he would\nhave riches and supplies in a go-bag in here, and that he would at least stop\nfor that.\nIt was a lot of assumptions, but she had to get lucky sometime, right?\nEvery time a lift went past her, she tensed, and tonight, the lifts were\nnever still. Panicky people at first, then guards and Blackguards and Tafok\nAmagez, then messengers, then nobles, then more messengers all through\nthe night.\nAfter a few hours, she told herself she had to be patient, that the Old\nMan was being patient. He needed to get his stuff, but he couldn’t afford to\narouse suspicion with the lifts as busy as they were.\nTeia assumed that at some point, Ben-hadad and Magister Kadah would\nfinish their work on the code, so they would meet her here. It had been\nmuch longer than six hours now, but surely the woman would eventually\nget it, right?\nBut the night passed. Teia dozed standing, jerking awake every time a\nlift passed. None ever paused, even for a moment, and the darkness was a\nwarm embrace.\nNo one ever came. She’d gambled her hours and lost.\nSo sometime after dawn, she made her way to Magister Kadah’s room.\nMaybe the woman had worked out how to open that door. If not, at least she\ncould give Teia a place to sleep.\nShe knocked on the door with their agreed-upon series of taps.\nShit, Teia thought, she didn’t think she could have missed them. Maybe\nthey’d decided to sleep a few hours to tackle the code afresh.\nAnyway, she definitely needed to tell someone else that the Old Man was\nGrinwoody. She didn’t know if Ironfist had had the clarity to realize how\nimportant it was to get that out. To Karris only, if possible. Grinwoody\nwould have other people who were in the audience chamber—they would\ntell him immediately if Ironfist had blurted out his name.\nIf that happened, Grinwoody might flee forever. Might have already,\nactually. Dammit.\nBut first, she had to tell Ben the Old Man’s identity.\nShe tested the door. It wasn’t locked.\nThat didn’t seem wise.\n“Hey, you two,” Teia said, “please tell me you’re not—”\nThe room was lit an eerie orange-red from testing lanterns the magisters\nused to teach discipulae.\nBut she barely noticed the wave of feeling that hit her with the light"

She threw her hood back up and snapped the\ncowl shut over her face, going fully invisible again. Pulling a long dagger\nunder the cloak, she drew in as much paryl as she could hold and sucked in\na breath, then froze.\nNothing.\nWas that a moan from behind the heavy desk? Ben-hadad?\nShe shot a puff of paryl smoke around the corner of the door into the\nroom. The paryl itself would be an attack—and visible to Sharp, if he were\nhere, if he were looking. But there was no sudden violence. Her clouds of\nparyl didn’t billow around any shape.\nIf he were in the room, her first move would be vital, and she couldn’t\nstand at the open door forever. So Teia shot little darts of paryl into every\ncorner of the room, even at the ceiling above the big desk, into the curtains\nat the window—anywhere large enough to conceal a man.\nNothing.\nOnly then did Teia turn to look at the woman lying on the ground.\nMagister Kadah. Teia’s paryl had gone into her chest, where Teia could feel\nthat the woman’s heart was still.\nAnother moan from behind the desk. Ben!\nThe orange desire for connection and the red compassion overwhelmed\nher. Ben-hadad! No, please tell me I didn’t get you killed! I can save you!\nTeia rushed over to her friend.\nAt her steps, a scintillant shimmering something concealed in the\nshadow of the desk itself uncurled. Something smashed across her face.\nHer nose fountained blood as she staggered backward.\nShe saw Ben-hadad first. He lay on the ground, eyes wide, gagged,\nlimbs bound but seemingly unharmed. Crouching over him was Murder\nSharp, somehow out of control of his shimmercloak, contiguous patches of\nit invisible and then flaring colors intermittently.\nShe was already slashing blindly with her dagger before the first gush of\nher blood hit the floor. But she felt pinches in both her knees.\nNerveless, her legs buckled under her and she tumbled across the floor.\nHer elbow went numb.\nBefore she could think, she felt a hand grabbing her hair. She saw\nMurder Sharp raising a sap in his other hand. “Ah, Teia,” he said. “I’ve\nmissed you so much.”\nHis voice was all warm honey, but in his eyes she saw something that\nmade her blood run cold: paryl crystals like purply shrapnel had exploded\nthrough the whites of his eyes. Murder Sharp had broken the halo.\nHe hugged her briefly. “You’re the only one who understands,” he said.\n“But I should really kill you.”\nThen, as he sat back up to sit on her stomach, he slapped her face. Not\nsoftly, but it wasn’t hard enough to wound her."

Stood, and turned out the lights to plunge the room into total\ndarkness.\nHis voice took on a tone as black as the room. “I wish I could let you\nlive, too.”\nHis weird, uncontrolled shimmering pulsed in the darkness, and she saw\nhim illuminated for an instant, raising the sap high his hand, and then he\nswung it sharply into her temple.\nChapter 96\nIt had been a long night, and Karris’s initial elation at being alive to greet\nthe dawn had long since faded to fear.\nKing Ironfist had stayed on his feet for only a few moments after he’d\nbeen brought into the audience chamber, clearly conscious through heroic\neffort of will alone. He’d ordered a stop to Karris’s execution and ordered\nthe deployment of all his troops under High General Danavis’s leadership.\nThen he’d searched the crowd as if looking for some face, while begging\nKarris to come aside to hear something private. She went to him instantly,\nbut he’d finally succumbed to his wounds.\nHe hadn’t stirred since.\nNaturally, the Chromeria’s best physickers were with him, and his own\nTafok Amagez, and Blackguards.

High General Danavis was in his element, orchestrating a million\ndetails with ease and efficiency. There were a thousand logjams and\nbottlenecks that could happen with deploying so many troops and supplies,\nand with Danavis in charge, people simply were given orders and went, and\nwhen they arrived, they found the supplies they needed arriving at the same\ntime, or already there, or arriving immediately after them.\nIt was a level of technical virtuosity that people didn’t even see: of\ncourse black powder, wadding, flints or match cord, bullets, and ramrods\nwill arrive in the same place as a thousand muskets, they thought. Of course\nthat place would be centrally located to where the men who were trained in\ntheir use and needed them could get them in an orderly and timely fashion.\nBut with what Karris and her luxiats had been doing in the last month to\nprepare the islands’ defenses, she knew now how hard all of this was, and\nshe simply stood back in awe.\nBut not in rest. She had her own details to oversee.\nNot least of which was the fleet visible with the morning sun. At first\neveryone had assumed they were seeing the vanguard of the White King’s\nfleet, coming in from the west.\nBut this fleet was alone, and small, not followed by an armada—and\nflying the flags of Ruthgar and the Malargos clan.\nKarris took a skimmer out to them to divine their intentions: Eirene\nMalargos hadn’t come herself (smart, in case we all die, Karris thought),\nbut Karris learned that her luxiats had prevailed upon Eirene to send\neveryone they could spare.\nAnd by ‘her luxiats’ they meant Karris’s luxiats, Karris soon realized,\nfor three of the young men who’d been so convincing to Eirene Malargos\nhad been part of Karris’s little group of faithful scholars.\n‘Everyone they could send’ seemed an exaggeration, because Malargos\nhad only sent five thousand men. But the five thousand were Ruthgar’s best,\nand they were outfitted better than any of the other contingents. In addition,\nEirene had sent desperately needed supplies. Not only black powder (most\nprecious since Atash had fallen), but also good muskets and, most valuable\nof all, ten thousand sets of mirror armor.\nTen thousand!\nKarris had thought all her entreaties to Eirene Malargos had fallen on\ndeaf ears, but all the while the woman had been stockpiling and\ncommissioning gear whose cost must have bankrupted even her. And Eirene\nhad done it all silently, so that it might be kept secret from the White King.\nThe rest of Sun Day Eve passed in a blur of preparation: Kip was frantic\nwith his Mirror preparations, too distracted to even talk to her; Andross was\nentirely absent except for when he popped in and demanded some of her\nsmartest luxiats; Zymun had constant demands (not in person, as she\nrefused to see him, but his messengers sought her out everywhere).

The last\ncouldn’t be ignored entirely: there were forty drafters who needed to be\nFreed tonight, before dawn of Sun Day. Normally, she’d postpone the\nceremony entirely, but these drafters were unable to fight and were fearful\nof what the arrival of the bane would do to them.\nTruth to tell, she was, too. No one wanted them to go rogue at such a\ntime.\nThat meant Zymun would get to kill them. The sick little piece of trash.\nShe arranged to have him flanked by the most intimidating Blackguards she\ncould in order to hem in his most disgusting tendencies, armed with strict\norders on how to handle him if he got out of line with his somber duties.\nShe also had to make sure he wasn’t armed or accompanied by his\nLightguard cronies.\nIf Karris hadn’t had so much else to do, maybe she could have done\nbetter, but she—and the poor broken drafters who would be Freed—were\nsimply going to have to make do.\nIn the afternoon, Koios’s armada was spotted. It was, indeed, as large as\nKip had claimed. The Parian fleet that Karris had hoped might save the\nChromeria went out to fight them. By attacking with half of his skimmers,\nthe Parian admiral attempted to goad the armada into raising the bane once\nmore. Once those were raised, the armada would lose all mobility.\nBut Koios didn’t take the bait, and the admiral wasn’t willing to commit\n(and thereby lose) all of the skimmers in order to make the prize too\ntempting to ignore, so the battle devolved into a largely conventional one.\nWorse, not only did Koios have more ships, but the Parian admiral had\nemptied his fleet of drafters, lest they be immobilized by the bane as well.\nThe Parians’ superior cannons were matched and finally overmatched by the\nBlood Robes’ superior magic.\nThe sea battle lasted the entire afternoon, but the White King’s fleet was\ntoo large, his wights too numerous, and though his barges behind the front\nranks were ungainly, the Parian fleet wasn’t able to reach them.\nThe Parians broke off after taking heavy losses. They’d inflicted too few\nin return.\nBy evening, in a wide ring on the horizon, the White King’s fleet had\nencircled the entirety of the Jaspers. They were besieged.\nOrholam, she thought as she watched the sun descend, this is Your fight.\nWithout You in this, we die.\nAs the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, she watched for the green\nflash.\nBut there was none.\nChapter 97\nTeia woke to the sound of a man weeping in the darkness.\n“That fucking bitch! Why’d she have to call me that? This is all her\nfault. This is some witchery. This is… goddam.”\nSharp.\nA weight of dread settled on Teia’s chest. She was trapped in black-as-\nhell darkness with a paryl wight. Her arms were bound in front, hugging\nherself, elaborate knots under her fingers, and she was wearing… a dress?\nShe did not want to think about how she came to be wearing a dress."

She didn’t know why she didn’t\nspend minutes faking sleep while she checked the knots and tried to escape.\nMaybe because Sharp had always been so masterful with knots. Maybe she\nhad some compassion for the sick, broken wretch.\nOr maybe she was just giving up.\n“Huh?” Sharp barked. “What are you on about?” He sounded angry,\nembarrassed.\nPerfect.\n“We’re sensitive to darkness, just like we’re sensitive to light. A black\nmood is literal for us.” No one had told Teia about that part, though she\nshould’ve figured it out long ago. Sharp hadn’t told her, and just as\nobviously, the effect was exaggerated even further for a paryl drafter who\nwent wight.\nSomething flared, shielded by Sharp’s body, and then a flame took—in a\nspecial, single-spectrum lantern. The room was illuminated in a\nmonochrome, either red or green.\nIf that was green, Teia was not going to do well. Sharp, turned wild\nwhen he was already feeling like this?\nBut no. She was certain it wasn’t green. She could feel it now.\nFinally, at the end of her life, finally she could tell the difference\nbetween green and red. She couldn’t see the difference, but she could feel\nit: finally she could do consciously what she’d done in that terrible Order\nceremony so long ago.\nNot that it did her any good. It was red light. Big deal. She couldn’t draft\nit, couldn’t use it against Sharp in any way.\n“No, no,” he said at the light. “That’s almost worse. Elijah ben-Zoheth.\nDamn that Seer.” He strode toward Teia and snatched up a black bag from a\ntable, but he didn’t pull it over her head. “I shouldn’t have brought you\nhere. But ever since she called me that… The Separated One. The Cutoff.”\nHe scrubbed his fingers through his hair angrily. “I wanted you to be the\none, Teia. You’re the only one who could understand me, you know? You\nknow, you’d be my disciple, and you’d look up to me, and you’d ask me\nthings. You’d rely on me. And, and as you got more and more experienced,\nour relationship would change. We’d become partners, with a profound\nrespect between us, and have a thousand adventures, and then one day\nyou’d look at me, and you would still see all this”—he gestured awkwardly\ntoward his face—his teeth, Teia realized—“but you wouldn’t care. You\nwouldn’t care that I’m older, and I’d say, ‘No, no, no you have to find\nsomeone your own age,’ but you’d set yourself to winning me over and…”\nRed light. It was definitely, definitely red light.\nWait. What was he talking about?\n“Ridiculous, huh?” He looked up at her face just as her first shock had\nworn away to be replaced with revulsion.\nHe saw her expression, and his own darkened instantly."

A little pretending would’ve gone a long way right there.\n“Yeah, I know,” he said hoarsely. “Stupid. Instead we gotta do it this\nway.”\n“How’d you find me?” Teia said quickly.\n“You really gonna try to stall me?”\n“You did kidnap me a second time. If that wasn’t to talk over our little\ncontest, why would you do that?”\n“No, it wasn’t that. More the loneliness. So maybe sort of? But more\nfor… another reason. A darker one.” He scowled at the candle. Reds were\nnot known for their deviousness. He threw the bag over her head, and then\nshe heard the flare of a candle again. A normal one, apparently, because he\nsighed. “Oh, that’s much better. Don’t know why it’s affecting me so bad\nthese days.”\n“You know, I ran across you at the corner of Farbod and Low,” she said.\nWhat time was it? How long had she been unconscious? Were they\nunderground?\n“Really? Why didn’t you kill me there?” Sharp asked.\n“Thought I had a chance at the Old Man. I followed him instead,” she\nsaid.\n“You always did have guts,” he said. “But now, tell me, why didn’t you\ncome after your father? I sat on him for weeks waiting for you to make your\nmove.”\n“You did?” she said. “I had no idea where he was.” Still don’t.\n“What?! I left hints everywhere! I mean, I went to all your old haunts\nand left things that’d point you to him. Blackguard taverns. Parks you liked.\nThat place where you bought fruit.”\n“Well, I was avoiding those places because I thought you’d be stalking\nme at them.” He’d known where she bought fruit?\n“Huh. Good thought,” Murder said. “Great discipline. You always had\ngreat discipline. Just tended to try things that were a little much for your\nskills. It’s too bad.”\n“So how did you find me?” Teia asked. She did not like him using the\npast tense about her.\n“When your friends came. The Mighty. I knew you’d go to them right\naway. Trouble was, there’s a bunch of them. But Kip and Ben-hadad split\noff from the others. Really thought you’d go for your old bed buddy first,\nsee if he wanted a quick roll while his wife’s head was turned. But then I\ncamped out on Ben-hadad. Scared the hell out of me once I realized they\nwere working on cracking open the Old Man’s office! I was like, Do I go\nreport this right away, or wait? So I split the difference and waited until\nthey had the solution—or thought they did. Anyway, I knew you’d come.\nHow could you help it? Patience is so key in our work, isn’t it?” He sighed.\n“Forget about earlier. Don’t know what got into me. Never been the\nsensitive type before.”\nDid he not know he’d gone wight? How could he not know?"

How could he not know?\nBecause he had no one to tell him. He’d been alone so long, he’d\nbecome a monster and he didn’t even know it.\nCould she use that?\nMurder Sharp said, “You’re not getting out of here, Teia. You’re too\nresourceful for me to leave in this room until after the walls come down.\nYou have to die. Just one more soul on my tally when you could have been\nso much more.”\n“‘After the walls come down’?” she asked.\n“The Order’s made a treaty with the White King. Our people mob the\ngates, a few Shadows take down the cannon crews, and they reward us\nbeyond our wildest dreams.”\n“But that’s—that’s, you haven’t even explained—”\n“It doesn’t matter,” he said sadly. He seemed back in control now.\nHimself again.\n“Well, sure it matters—” Teia said.\n“It doesn’t matter for you. Your part ends here. I’m sorry.”\n“Please,” Teia said, fear gripping her throat. She’d been testing her\nbonds. There was nothing she could do. She couldn’t even move her\nextremities.\nShe’d missed her chance. Drafting now was impossible.\nShe tried it anyway, her eyes flaring wide.\n“Uh-uh-uh,” Murder Sharp scolded. He tore the bag off her head,\ngripped her hair in a fist, and pulled her face up, almost gently. But she had\nno illusions he would stay gentle if she resisted.\nHe looked at her, eye to eye, and then he kissed her forehead gently, like\na father. “I want to ask you a favor,” he said.\n“I want to ask you one back,” Teia said quickly.\nHe laughed. “Not really in the position, are you?”\n“I’ll do anything you want if you hear me out.”\n“That’s not how this works,” Murder Sharp said.\n“My father. They’ll kill him if they learn I betrayed them,” Teia said.\n“He doesn’t know anything about this. You know that. He’s just a merchant.\nCan you have them let him go?”\nShe was actually surprised at how level and calm her voice came out.\nSharp seemed to be surprised, too.\n“I’ve got no reason to help you,” Sharp said.\n“No… no, you don’t. But maybe, maybe a little redemption is better\nthan none. Maybe that’s how you close a little bit of separation, Elijah ben-\nZoheth.”\nHe snorted. “You got balls,” Sharp said with a little smile that showed\nhis everyday dentures: plain, white, but not so perfect as to draw attention.\n“I wish we didn’t have to do this.”\n“Me, too,” Teia said lightly.\nHe laughed. Then he looked down at her body and shook his head. “I\ncan’t believe I put you in my mother’s dress. What the hell was I thinking?\nAnyway… about my request.”\nHe cleared his throat, suddenly awkward.\n“Anything,” Teia said.\nHe cleared his throat. “You’ve got a beautiful lower left dogtooth."

Gorgeously, flawlessly formed, from all I can tell. Its only\ndefect, I think, is that it’s a bit large for your mouth—but that makes it\nperfect for mine. I would like your permission to… um, add it to my best\npair of diplomatic dentures. You know the ones. I find a beautiful smile cuts\nright through people’s defenses. Melts them inside. It’s magical, really. But\nI shouldn’t like for my best smile to be tarnished by some shadow of guilt\nthat I’d… violated you. You’d be part of something perfect, long after your\ndeath. It’s immortality. Of a sort.”\n“Orholam have mercy,” Teia whispered.\n“Well, clearly not,” Murder Sharp said, laughing suddenly. “But I will.\nI’ve had poor luck with teeth when I’ve killed the donor in advance—the\nrot sets into the tooth so, so fast it seems. That’s why you’re still alive,\nactually. I can’t risk losing your perfection in such a way, so I intend to\nsedate you before relieving you of it. You’ll feel very little. But you will be\nalive.” He pulled forward two vials on the table. He cleared his throat again.\n“Two lovely tinctures here: first, I give you a heavy dose of poppy dissolved\nin brandy. Tastes wretched, but it’ll give you a total euphoria, and some say\nvisions akin to entering the afterlife, if there is such a thing. This second\none is… a marvel. A wonder. Very odd. The Braxians were trying to find an\nopposite to nightshade—you know it?”\nTeia did, of course. In drops applied to the eyes, nightshade or\nbelladonna caused the pupils to flare wide, allowing drafters to soak in more\nlight—or women to look more comely. It also made you blind if you used it\ntoo often, so the Chromeria frowned on its use, preferring drafters to learn\nthe skill of widening or tightening their pupils at will.\n“What would the opposite of belladonna do?” Teia asked. “Constrict\npupils? Oh… to starve drafters of source light.”\n“Yes, yes, I’m always forgetting how sharp you are. Aha. Sharp.\nAnyway, the different narcotics they tried at first were too obvious when\nused at the doses necessary. I actually don’t know if they ever found what\nthey were looking for, but they stumbled across this: lacrimae sanguinis.\nEaten or drunk, this poison takes a few hours to make its way to the eyes—\nI’ve not had enough occasion to practice to find out how long exactly. But\nin a few hours, it sets somehow. It crystallizes within the eyes. Then, upon\nthe pupil contracting or dilating strongly, the poison’s released into the\nbody.\n“One drop is supposed to be able to kill a dozen men. I’ll give you two.\nThen I’ll leave my drapes open. You’ll have pleasant poppy dreams all\nnight, and when light flashes over the horizon with the dawn of Sun Day,\nyou’ll die instantly.” He cleared his throat again. “It is as kind as I can be"

She’d failed. This was the end for her.\nHer heart pushed through the thickets of panic and found, suddenly, the\nbarren plains of resignation. Her breath slid from her mouth like a bit\nfalling from her teeth.\nShe felt strangely better. Death wasn’t the freedom she’d choose, but it\nwas one kind of freedom.\nUnless there was a hell.\nShe’d find out soon enough.\n“Just the one tooth?” she asked, her voice level and scoured clean of\nfear.\nWith a slurping sound, he took out his dentures and set them aside. He\nbegan washing his hands in a basin, with soap. But even still, he never took\nhis eyes off her for more than an instant. There would be no surprising him\nwith paryl.\n“Oh, I pride myself on my tidiness. I won’t deface you unnecessarily.”\nHe dried his hands on a pretty, nicely folded cloth, unhurried. There was\nsome element of ritual, of nearly erotic fixation, barely contained, in his\nvoice. “I want you to know, Teia, I’ll think of you always when I wear\nthem.”\n“You’ll help my father?” she asked.\nHe put a blindfold over her head, but didn’t lower it over her eyes yet.\nHe stared at her in the half dark of the hidden chamber for a long\nmoment. A last, guttering goodness flickered in his eyes. She hoped it was\nan assent.\n“Open your mouth,” he commanded, filling a tiny silver spoon full of\ndark liquid. Behind him on his table sat shining tools: a jaw stretcher, pliers,\nmore awful things. She’d not be able to see or speak once he got to work on\nher.\n“Murder?” she said.\n“Yes, Adrasteia?”\n“Fuck you.”\nHe flashed a sudden grin, showing broken stubs of teeth beneath his\ngleaming, violet-shrapnel eyes. “They all say that.”\nShe opened her mouth and accepted the bitter drops.\nChapter 98\nOne day wasn’t nearly enough time to get ready, but through the triple\nmiracles of preparation, competence, and the total focus of every human on\nthe Jaspers, things were actually coming together. Kip had meetings with\nTisis and the generals. Tisis would be managing Corvan Danavis’s scouts\nand intel, and the generals simply needed to hear Kip say to their faces that\nhe really did want them to follow every order Corvan Danavis gave them. It\nwas worth the half hour Kip spent recounting all of Danavis’s exploits and\nbrilliance and showing Kip’s own absolute faith in the man. These generals\nwould be repeating the stories to their own men and women. Plus, they\nneeded to see that what Kip was doing was intimately tied to their success.\nHe spent all of two minutes with his wife that weren’t practical and\ntactical.\n“Have you seen Ben-hadad?” Kip asked. “I could really, really use his\nbig brain on this.”\n“No,” Tisis said. “I haven’t seen Cruxer, either.”"

They knew the Order\nwas here. “What?” he said. “I assumed he was with you, making sure the\nnew members of the Mighty were squared away.”\n“I know, and I thought he’d be here. But none of the others have seen\nthem, either. Ben I could imagine disappearing to work on something he\nthought was important and forgetting to tell anyone. But Cruxer? Kip, he\nwas really upset about Ironfist’s betrayal… and then Ironfist shows up half\ndead…”\nIronfist hadn’t woken. It wasn’t certain that he would.\n“Orholam have mercy,” Kip said. He swallowed.\n“I’ll let you know the instant I hear anything,” Tisis said. He saw the\nagony in her eyes, but there was also a steel practicality there. They both\nhad things to do, at opposite ends of the Jaspers. No matter what. Even if\nCruxer was dead.\nAnd she was right.\n“Likewise,” Kip said.\nThey held each other then, forehead to forehead, all too aware that it\nmight be the last time. Their parting kiss was both too much and too little\nby far. And then they went to their work again: he to the Chromeria, and she\nto set up scouts and signal-mirror communications lines.\nKip had to bust a few heads—one nearly literally, he’d bruised his\nknuckles—but he’d gotten control of all the Thousand Stars right around\nthe time the White King’s fleet had arrived on the horizon.\nProbably not coincidental that the last stubborn jackasses were\nconvinced by that.\nThen he got the missive.\n“Downstairs. Now. Not a suggestion.—Promachos G.”\n“Downstairs?” Kip asked the messenger. At least Andross hadn’t sent\nthe message through that smug jackass, Grinwoody.\nFerkudi and Winsen accompanied him as he followed Andross Guile’s\nservant down the lifts, then through the small door that headed to the back\ndocks. Hard-faced Blackguards stood at either side of the door, lips tight.\nThey wouldn’t meet Kip’s eyes.\nOh no.\nKip’s neck went tight. He couldn’t draw a full breath.\nHis feet seemed to move independently of his will. He was being carried\nalong by pure momentum and social expectation.\nIf he didn’t find out, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.\nBut he couldn’t stop himself. The world was closing in, vision\nnarrowing even as the tunnel widened out.\nMore Blackguards. More stony faces. No, no, no.\nHe walked down the path toward the docks toward Andross, who stood\nimpassive over… something.\nA body, of course, Kip knew. Covered.\nHe saw Gill Greyling there, opposite Andross, on the other side of the\nbody. Gill stood ramrod straight, face still, but his eyes streamed tears, and\nhe swallowed as Kip came close.

It was a sign of the\ntremendous respect they wouldn’t have given to one who wasn’t one of\ntheir own.\n“Aside from laying their cloaks on him,” Andross said, “nothing’s been\ntouched, in case you wanted to examine things for yourself. When you’re\nready, I’ll tell you what we know.”\nIt had to be Andross here, didn’t it?\nKip squatted down beside the body and pulled back the cloak. He felt\nthe same shock he’d felt before at seeing the dead, somehow never quite\ndulled, and this time sharper than ever: this face looked like a poor\nfacsimile of Cruxer’s face. Cruxer was so much more handsome. Vibrant.\nFunny. Kind. His spirit had always suffused his flesh, made it continually\nmore beautiful than… this cold visage.\nAnd yet the cold visage was all that was left. He was lying on his side,\nand that side of his face had purpled from pooled blood.\n“Sometime before midnight, I’d guess, from the bodies I’ve seen after\nbattles,” a voice intruded. Winsen.\nKip nodded.\n“I went after him,” Winsen said. “Like you told me to. Ran all over these\ndamn islands. He didn’t take the news of Ironfist betraying the Chromeria\nwell. He thought Ironfist was going to kill you.”\n“Your young commander’s broken sword is here,” Andross said. “The\nblade matches Ironfist’s wound and there are grooves cut into Ironfist’s\nchain that match it, too. Both of their pistols had been fired.”\nBut Kip didn’t need the explanation. He’d known what was going to\nhappen long before it did.\n“Why a sword rather than his spear?” Kip asked. Cruxer was better with\na spear.\n“Easier to hide?” Winsen guessed. “Blackguards on duty last night never\nsaw either of them. At least that’s what they say. You want to talk to them?”\n“If they lied to you…” Kip began. They’ll lie to me, too, he meant to\nsay, but the words were too much effort. It was the most he could do to\nshake his head.\nWould a spear have made the difference?\nOh, Cruxer.\n“This?” Winsen said. He didn’t sound moved at all. “Dying like this?\nFor your lord? It’s what we do. It’s what we signed up for. And Cruxer\nloved it. He fought the best warrior in the world to a standstill. Stopped\nhim. Saved your life. This isn’t a bad death.”\n“Every death’s a bad death,” Andross said.\nKip didn’t know what to do with it, but he loved his grandfather a little\nbit for that. Sure, sure, dying to save someone is noble—but you’re still\nfucking dead. But this wasn’t Winsen’s fault, not really. He’d been born\nwith very little feeling himself.

Maybe he was just biding his time, though.\nBut he couldn’t keep his attention away from the thing that had been his\nfriend. He took a tremulous breath. He squatted down beside the man\nwho’d put his life and honor on Kip more than once. He brushed some dirt\noff Cruxer’s cheek.\nThe softness of the gesture was a mistake. The corralled horses of his\npassions burst through the fences, he fell from his squat to his knees, and a\nsingle sob racked him before he could silence himself.\nHe flashed to anger. I need you now! You can’t abandon me here! You\nhave not been relieved of duty, goddammit!\nThen he breathed, just thought about his breath. In. Hold. Out slow.\nHold.\n“Breaker. Lord Guile. Lord Guile,” Winsen said. “There are messengers.\nIt’s urgent, they say. Everything’s urgent today.”\nKip caught sight of his forearm. The Turtle-Bear. What could it do?\nWhat could Kip do? Suffer. Keep going. That was all that made him special.\nYou and me, buddy, Kip thought, looking at the tattoo. This is what\nwe’re here to do: fight and die.\nI just hoped that I’d be the first of us to go.\nHe stood. Cleared the tears from his eyes with calm fingers. Brushed off\nthe wet knees of his trousers from his kneeling.\n“Who do I make commander of the Mighty?” he asked Winsen, his\nvoice level, professional.\nWinsen’s mouth twisted. “They all love Ferk, but he’s too big of a goof.\nA commander’s gotta work with people all the time, and Ferk gets people\nwrong near as often as I do. Guess that cuts me out, too. Ben-hadad’s too\nsmart, too distracted, too arrogant. Tisis could do it, but it’s an all-the-time\nkind of a job, and she’s got too much else to do. Can’t be any of the scrubs.\nThat leaves Big Leo, I guess.”\n“You make a good case,” Kip said. “Tell him you chose him.”\nWinsen frowned. It was going to make it impossible for him to carp and\ncomplain about Big Leo’s orders all the time when the Mighty knew he was\nthe one who’d picked him. Which was why Kip had done it. Winsen’s\ninsubordination would be the biggest threat to a new commander… well,\nother than the encircling, overwhelming army.\nSo maybe it was all moot anyway.\nKip straightened his back. He looked over at Gill Greyling. “Thank you,\nfor this. And convey my thanks to your people. Please take care of him?”\nGill nodded.

Teia was giggling.\n“Mmm, yith hehl funneh,” she said around the jaw cage holding her face\nimmobile, mouth open for Sharp to work. She laughed at her garbled words.\n“Harf?” Sharp. “Remimd meh to hell you humfing.”\n‘Hell you,’ not ‘tell you.’ That was hilarious. She laughed again.\nAnd then the pliers were in her mouth, and she couldn’t talk at all.\nAnd then, as the blood gushed in her mouth, she didn’t want to. She\ntwisted her jaw just as the tooth released and wailed into the rag he\nhurriedly stuffed over her face. Even laudanum couldn’t make someone\ntearing out your tooth enjoyable.\nHe loosed the bolts securing the cage to her jaws. She turned her head\nand spat blood.\n“Sharp,” she said.\nSome blood dribbled a wet line down her cheek, down her neck.\n“Yes?” he asked, turning away from studying her bloody, perfect tooth.\n“I find last words really do only tend to be worth as much as any other\nwords, but if it’ll really make you feel better…”\nHer head lolled. Opium really was a tell of a thing. “I just, mm, wanted\nto let you know, I’m going to have to kill you for that. But! Good news!\nYou won’t have to save my dad. I’ll do that myself. But thanks. For\noffering. Quite decent of you. Really feel like… mm… like we could have\nbeen friends…”\n“Me too,” Murder Sharp said. He popped her tooth in his mouth and\nsucked at it to get the blood off.\n“If you weren’t a sick fuck, I mean.”\n“Now, that’s no way to speak to—” His face scrunched. “Why’s your\ntooth taste like almonds?” He spat the tooth into his hand, suddenly\nhorrified.\nThere was a nice, well-defined crack in the tooth, as if it had been\nengineered to break that way. Teia’s one little twist as it pulled away from\nher jaw. A last bit of white gel leaked out into his palm from that crack.\nHe’d sucked down the rest.\n“You were always looking at that tooth like a horny teen boy stealing\nglances of cleavage.” Teia laughed. Not that she had cleavage.\n“You—what did you do?”\n“I’m actually glad you finally took it. It’s been killing me for six\nmonths,” Teia said. There was something really important she was supposed\nto remember. What was it again? “Six months, worrying that damn poison\ntooth was going to crack and leak death into my mouth.”\nMurder Sharp staggered and sagged against the door. “I can’t… You\ndidn’t.”\n“Oh! That was it!” Teia said. “How long’s that other poison last? The\nlight one, lacrimae sanguinis? Does it wear off?”"

Cyanide was the only\npoison potent enough for such a job that Karris had had access to, and it\ngave an ugly death.\n“When’s it wear off?” she asked.\n“You shamed me,” he said. “I shared with you. I trusted you. And this?\nThis is… oohhh.” He fell over and puked noisily.\n“How long’s it last?” Teia asked. “Please.”\n“Stupid, stupid bitch.” He puked again.\n“I’m stupid?” Teia asked. “Who’s the one who had his enemy tied up\nand didn’t finish the job? Who kidnapped me twice?”\nA silly smile painted his puke-strewn face. “Stupid because… I never\ndosed you with the lacrimae sanguinis. Just the poppy. I couldn’t kill you,\nTeia. I couldn’t—”\nAnd then the convulsions began. His feet drummed against the stone\nfloor.\nIt took forever, and he was incapable of speech from then on. His eyes\nraging at her, then rolling back in his head. His dentures had flown from his\nmouth and lay in a pool of vomit. He gnawed at the floor with his broken\nteeth, dug his fingers into it.\nIt was awful, and it was long, too long in her drugged stupor, before she\nrealized she could draft paryl if she wanted to.\nUnless he was lying about that. Tricking her.\nHe was a cunning one.\nWell, she had shit to do in the next day, and she’d need paryl to do it.\nMight as well find out now.\nShe took one breath, let her fears gather in the wind in her lungs, and\nthen blew it all out into the world. Then she flared her eyes before she took\nthe next breath.\nAnd didn’t die.\nThat was nice.\nShe looked at the tiniest cutting tool on Sharp’s tray and with ridiculous\namounts of paryl was just barely able to lift the little thing and float it to her\nhand. She cut herself free of her bonds.\nThen she walked over to Sharp’s desk and took out his favorite\ndiplomatic dentures, the blindingly bright white ones.\nTaking a glass of water, she gently rinsed out his mouth. He coughed\nweakly as some went down the wrong way. But then, in between\nconvulsions, she put his dentures in his mouth, giving him some dignity\nback. As much dignity as a man dying spasming in pools of vomit can get,\nanyway.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “For speaking cruelly. Good night, Elijah ben-\nZoheth.”\nHe couldn’t speak now. The light was already dimming from his eyes.\nShe didn’t know if he heard her at all.

Then realized she was still\nwearing the dress Sharp had put her in. His mother’s dress? Yuck. And he’d\nundressed her to put it on her? Double yuck.\nEventually, she found her own clothes, feeling a little better when she\nrealized that she was still wearing her own underthings. Sharp had been a\nsick man, but at least he wasn’t that kind of sick. It took her a while to get\ndressed. She might have dozed off for a few minutes. Or hours. She’d never\nused opiates before, so she wasn’t sure how long it was going to take for\nthem to wear off.\nBut there was no time to wait until she was at her full strength.\nShe gathered up her things, and everything of Murder Sharp’s that\nseemed like it might be useful. Before she went, she closed his dead eyes.\nThere was nothing tentative or overly gentle in her motions. He was just\nmeat now.\nGiving him this last kindness wasn’t for him, it was for her. He’d\nbecome a monster, but she had the seeds of the same monster in her. And\nthere had been something in him that hadn’t been all monster; his goodness\nwas always poking through at the oddest moments.\nBut she’d killed better.\nNext stop, the Order of the Broken Eye’s holiday, the Feast of the\nNight’s Coming Triumph. Or whatever the hell it was called.\nMaybe she’d be sober by then.\nChapter 100\n“Thank you for coming,” Andross said. “I know it’s been a terrible day.”\nHis note had politely mentioned he would withdraw all support from\nKip’s martial positions tomorrow if they didn’t come, so here, late at night,\nthe Mighty had gathered in Andross’s stateroom. Their moods ranged from\nsullen to stoic to jagged. The demands of duty could only block out so\nmuch grief.\nSuspecting a trap, Tisis hadn’t come.\n“Koios will attack at dawn, if he’s able,” Andross said.\n“Most of the tacticians think he’ll wait. He’s only just setting up his\nsiege,” Kip said.\n“The tacticians have the tactics right, but the strategy wrong,” Andross\nsaid.\n“It’d be a terrible move,” Kip said.\n“No, not terrible. Simply not his strongest. If the White King can shut\ndown our drafters—which he believes he can—then he is already vastly\nmore powerful than we are. He doesn’t need to play it safe, surround us, lay\nsiege, and summon his troops to exactly the right area to focus an attack. He\ncan just attack.”"

He\ncan just attack.”\n“He’s been patient elsewhere,” Kip said. “Why on this, the most\nimportant battle, would he rush headlong?” And why are you having this\nconversation with us, rather than with High General Danavis?\n“Because he has to attack on Sun Day,” Andross said. “His sea battle\nwith you slowed him. I’m sure he would have preferred to get here earlier\nand set up at his leisure. Now he has to rush in. There’s no other choice.”\n“Wouldn’t he want to not attack on Sun Day?” Kip asked. “He’s a\npagan.”\n“Maybe usually. Not this time. Thumbing his nose at Orholam is worth a\nfew thousand more dead to him,” Andross said.\n“Ah,” Kip said. That made sense. Not only could Koios satisfy his\npersonal animosity against Orholam—probably the most important reason\n—but he would also show the Seven Satrapies that Orholam was powerless\non His holiest day, in the very center of His power.\nAll remaining resistance would fold after that. The old gods would have\nshown they were more powerful than Orholam at His greatest. Although it\nwould make this battle more difficult, it would make reigning afterward\nmuch easier.\nKoios was still playing the long game.\n“So let’s win, shall we?” Andross said. “To that end, I have gifts for\nyou.”\nKip and the others looked at one another. Gifts? Andross Guile?\n“Commander Leonidas,” Andross said. A slave brought forward a huge\nrosewood box that he seemed to have difficulty carrying.\n“Leonidas?” Kip asked. “Big Leo?”\n“I know, I know, it sounds like a girl’s name,” Big Leo said sheepishly.\nHe opened the box.\n“Oh, you shouldn’t have.” On the top was a thick black leather coat with\na high collar. Across the chest was the Mighty’s sigil in white leather. He\npicked it up; it was obviously very heavy, with chain and plate woven in\nbeneath the leather.\n“Oh, you really shouldn’t have,” he said, looking into the rosewood box.\nLifting the coat had revealed, on velvet, a hammered, heavy copper chain\nwith links the size of fists. There were two gloves inside as well. Big Leo\nlooked at Andross, who nodded.\nLeo put on the gloves and lifted the heavy chain. Each link had a black\nstripe around its burnished circumference. Then he looked at the tips of the\nthumbs of his gloves. “Oh, hell, yes!” he said, and flicked his thumb against\nthe chain.\nNothing happened.\n“Chain’s copper so you don’t throw a spark accidentally when it’s\nwrapped around your own body,” Andross said. “Forefinger and thumb.”\nKip didn’t know what he was talking about. But Big Leo looked down at\nhis gloves. He held the chain out and flicked his thumb against his\nforefinger, throwing a spark.\nThe entire chain caught fire as the atasifusta wood in each link\nwhooshed into flame.\n“Holy shit,” Ferkudi said."

Atasifusta, the ever-\nburning.\nAh, thus the leather. Still…\nAndross said, “When you’re done, do this.” He laid a hand on Big Leo’s\narm. Red luxin poured from his hand, coating the burning chain. First it\nflared up into fire, red luxin being flammable, but then the luxin crusted\nover, blackened in every place, extinguishing itself and the chain.\nWhen Big Leo moved his arm again, the red luxin broke to dust with the\nsmell of tea leaves and tobacco, his arm and the chain unharmed. He was\nalso given a helm: naturally, it was a lion with a mane like fire.\nAndross motioned for the young man to step back. “Don’t say thanks.\nExpress your thanks by keeping Kip alive.”\n“Yes, my lord,” Big Leo said.\n“Ferkudi del’Angelos,” Andross said. Ferkudi stepped forward. “I hear\nyou’re a grappler.” His armor was the same, albeit without the covering of\nleather, and thus much lighter. But his, too, was black and adorned with the\nMighty’s sigil: the man with head bowed, arms out, radiating power. His\nweapons were twin double-bladed hand axes, each with one blade of steel\nand the other blade of a single wavering obsidian edge. Each obsidian stone\nitself could have purchased a castle. Nothing could cut through luxin like\nthose. He, too, was given gloves, with hellstone points at the knuckles.\nAndross said, “Wights will either flee in terror or seek you out\nespecially. I order you to kill at least one of their petty gods, understood?”\n“With pleasure, High Lord,” Ferkudi said.\nThe hand axes were completed with sword-breaking hafts and an\ningenious back sheath. Ferkudi took a bear helm.\nFor Winsen, there was the lightest armor, befitting the archer’s small\nsize. His helm was a snake. And there was a short bow inside. It was\nbeautifully wrought with horses in some ancient art style, but at first Winsen\nsneered at it. He did admire the arrows, two quivers full, half of them tipped\nwith obsidian. He looked at them in the light. “Flawless, best fletching I’ve\nseen, too. But as for the bow, it’s beautiful, but… a short bow? And it’s got\na sight? I think I’ll keep my—”\n“It’ll pierce armor at three hundred paces. Test it if you don’t believe\nme. My man will instruct you on its care.”"

He lifted the bow and drew the string, his\nbroad back knotting with the effort. It was clearly harder than he’d been\nexpecting. Then he walked away with it, muttering obscenities in\nappreciation.\n“Ben-hadad,” Andross said.\nBen was, surprisingly, little the worse for wear. A servant had found him\naround noon, tied up, and since then he’d been more fixated on Cruxer’s\ndeath than on his own narrow escape from it. He’d quietly told Kip of\nTeia’s kidnapping and the work he’d been doing but that his door code was\nwrong, and when they’d cut through a wall to get in, it was to the wrong\nroom. Sharp would be holding Teia somewhere else. Maybe nearby, which\nmeant Ben-hadad had to revisit his earlier work searching for hidden rooms:\nhe’d missed something.\nBut that work would take him hours if not days. Teia would be dead by\nthen, if she wasn’t already. Ben had told Kip he instead needed to\nconcentrate his efforts on checking the siege defenses and all the various\nmachinae that were going to be used in the Jaspers’ defense.\nWith anguish, Kip had agreed. The battle hadn’t even begun, and two of\nhis Mighty were already dead.\nHe wanted to make the Order pay dearly for that, but he knew he wasn’t\ngoing to. He was going to die before he could do anything about them.\nAndross gave Ben-hadad a coat that was similar to Ferkudi’s.\nBen felt it and said, “What’s layered underneath this?”\n“Mirrored steel scale, like all of them,” Andross said. “It’s not as strong\nas plate, but not nearly as heavy, either. Try not to test its effectiveness too\nmuch.”\nBeneath the coat there wasn’t a weapon. Instead, there was a pair knee\nbraces.\n“I, uh, am actually almost finished with my backup brace,” Ben-hadad\nsaid, gesturing to his current, solid brace. Kip had broken the other when\nhe’d raised the Great Mirror. “Parallel discovery, I guess? But thank you?\nDefinitely will save me some hours tonight.”\n“These are Commander Finer’s own knee braces,” Andross said.\n“Before he went wight and tried to kill his Prism, he developed these.\nInstead of using open luxin, he reinforced the joints with sea-demon bone. I\nthink you’ll also find that wearing two of them, you can do much, much\nmore than you did with one.”\n“Two? And sea-demon…?” Ben-hadad’s eyes widened. “Of course!\nWhy didn’t I think of that? This is—thank you! Thank you very, very\nmuch!”\n“While you’re at it, you may also take the sharana ru I’d intended for\nCruxer,” Andross said.\n“No, I can’t,” Ben said, though the curiosity in his eyes was plain. A\ntygre striper?\n“It’s not going to do him any good,” Andross said.\nAn uneasy silence descended on them."

A\ntygre striper?\n“It’s not going to do him any good,” Andross said.\nAn uneasy silence descended on them.\n“I can’t,” Ben-hadad said finally.\n“Don’t be a damned fool. Cruxer died because he couldn’t adjust to\nrealities shifting under his feet. Don’t follow his example in this.” Andross\ndrew a tygre striper shaped like a white spear from Cruxer’s box and\nveritably threw it at Ben-hadad. “Kill a god for me.”\nLooking to the rest of the Mighty, who nodded their approval, Ben-\nhadad kept the thing. The spear was long and thin, with a steel spike at the\nfoot and a graceful steel blade at the top, below which were embedded\njagged obsidian teeth in the haft.\nTurning to Kip, Andross said, “We’ll have the appropriate funerals, if we\nlive so long. Now, where is your stubborn bride?”\nKip said, “I guess she’s not that eager to see you again. Strangely\nenough.”\n“Strangely enough, I’m tempted not to give her her gift, then. But\nwhatever. Take it.”\nKip stepped forward and opened Tisis’s chest. Inside was a red dress,\nhigh-necked and long-sleeved and heavy and adorned with the Mighty’s\nsigil as well. “Armored?” Kip asked.\n“As much as possible without being obvious. I figured that her duties\nwouldn’t be martial, but that she may well not stay away from harm, either.\nThe Guile women seem to hold in common a lack of an aversion to danger.”\n“This is Felia’s dress, isn’t it?” Kip asked. Andross had merely had a\ntailor add the Mighty’s sigil to it.\nAndross pursed his lips. “I hate how you do that.”\n“So, do I get anything?” Kip said flippantly.\n“Oh yes,” Andross said, his eyes twinkling. “I spent a long time\npondering if I should give you armor so fine you couldn’t turn it down but\nthat would make you look like a raging asshole.”\n“Nice,” Kip said. Though I kind of do that on my own.\n“But I figured you already do that on your own.”\nI hate how he does that.\nAndross gestured and a slave brought out another box. In it was armor to\nmatch the Mighty, albeit with the colors reversed, the armor entirely white,\nwith the figure of the man in black, head bowed, silhouette suspiciously like\nKip’s own these days. “White, huh? That’s a little raging-assholey,” Kip\nsaid.\n“I couldn’t give up the idea altogether.”\n“By which I mean, thank you, grandfather.”\n“Stop. I’m getting weepy.”\n“Is there a weapon for me?”\n“I thought you’d enjoy going into battle armed with your wit,” Andross\nsaid.\n“But you’d not want me to go into battle defenseless.”\nAndross didn’t smile.

Now this, a third card for\nAndross Guile, called simply The Guile. In Janus Borig’s exquisite style, it\nshowed an old man seated in darkness, eyes glowing red-gold. The faintest\nglow outlined his head against the darkness. His fingers were colored claws,\nin each color.\nOne of each color, because Andross was a full-spectrum polychrome.\nWell, that would have been nice to remember before now. Or maybe Kip\nwould have guessed it was merely symbolic of having the other Colors on\nthe Spectrum under his fingers.\n“Cute,” Kip said.\n“Not quite turtle-bear cute, but I like it.”\n“You’re a motherfucker.”\n“In more ways than one.”\n“That’s all you’ve got for me? Scorn and a card?” Kip asked. “You give\nthem weapons; you give me knowledge. Ordinarily, I’d see deep meaning in\nthat. Today it’s just a distraction. It’s always games and bullshit with you,\nisn’t it?”\nViewing the cards only took an instant, but it might louse Kip up for\nhours or days. Another Andross Guile card? How bad might it be to View\nthat? Forget it. Kip would either want to murder the man standing here in\nfront of him, or worse, he might understand him. Either way, Kip might be\nshaken for hours. Hours he didn’t have.\nAndross said, “Also, I’m ready to tell you your family history. Your\nmother’s history. Your father’s. Your uncle’s. Mine. It’ll be deeply\nunpleasant for both of us, but perhaps it’s time.”\n“Forget it. This is my family,” Kip said, gesturing to the Mighty.\n“Your choice,” Andross said, with that air that implied, as ever, that Kip\nwas a fool.\nKip tucked the card away carelessly, like it was trash. “Funny thing is,\ngrandfather, after all the time I’ve spent with you, I’ve come to a belated\nbut very important realization: you just aren’t worth getting to know better.\nThanks for the armor. Goodbye.”\nHe picked up his helm from the slave on the way out. It was a dragon’s\nhead. With fur on it. Sonuvabitch.\nChapter 101\nTeia was only half-unlucky. All things considered, that felt pretty good.\nBetween her capture and falling asleep for ‘just a moment,’ she’d lost\nmuch of the day, though she finally wasn’t high anymore. She’d first gone\nto see if Ben-hadad was still tied up, but he was gone. Rescued, she\nassumed. Or at least she hoped so.\nShe wanted to find her friends, to tell them everything.

I promised the children we’d\nattend the predawn pyrotechnics. They’re still having a few, I hear…\ndespite everything.”\nIf Teia had her way, those would be the last words the woman ever said\nto her husband. Atevia made his promises and headed out, climbing up into\na wagon that his slaves had brought around.\nTeia timed her own climbing up into the back of the wagon with Atevia\nclimbing up into the front seat so that no one noticed the weight\ndisplacement, and then she carefully tucked herself in with the great wine\nbarrels, spreading the master cloak out over herself.\nThey stopped half an hour later, and men unloaded the barrels and\nbrought them into a dingy little workshop. Teia had gotten very good at\ntaking little glimpses and moving when the timing was right. She dropped\noff the far side of the wagon so that when the cloak flared from the fall, no\none would have a chance to see her momentarily visible legs.\nAtevia Zelorn put on a new cowl before he climbed down. This one was\nlined with fine mail.\nThe man or woman who received the shipment had one very similar. He\nor she didn’t speak, and moved carefully, so it wasn’t until Teia risked a\nblast of paryl through the new person’s clothing that she was able to tell the\nother figure was a woman.\nThe woman held up a gloved hand to Atevia, fingers extending, twice.\n“Ten minutes. Fine, fine,” Atevia said, putting a growl into his voice. It\nwasn’t the greatest disguise, but there were more men than women in the\nOrder, so perhaps he figured it was good enough. Or maybe he just didn’t\ncare.\nHe stepped outside, and the servants opened the barrels. The woman\ndismissed them and then moved from barrel to barrel. She held a small vial\nin one hand. It stank. Teia recognized it as a common emetic.\nThe hell?\nBut then she understood. The woman sniffed and then tasted each wine\nin turn, stirring them first with a big ladle.\nSatisfied they weren’t poisoned, she put aside the emetic. Then she went\nto her workbench and pulled out bundles of wrapped vegetation. She\nworked with the speed and efficiency of a physicker or an apothecary,\ninspecting the leaves of several plants Teia didn’t know and numerous\npoppy bulbs. Then she began counting out the leaves into piles, rejecting\nthose too old or dry, and cracking the poppy bulbs and collecting the brown\nseeds into cups. Leaves of three different kinds of plant went directly into\nthe wine, each counted out, and then the poppy was ground with a mortar\nand pestle, added to the barrels, and stirred.\nThe woman tasted a tiny amount of the resulting drug cocktail. She\ncocked her head as if it tasted wretched but that that couldn’t be helped. She\nrinsed her mouth with water and then spat it out.\nShe looked like she was finished.\nNow."

He meant poison tester, the one who had to drink the wine\npublicly first to certify it was safe.\n“Makes no damn sense,” Teia muttered, but her stomach was knotting\nwith fear. “Why would I taint the wine?”\nZelorn said, “What makes no sense is that the Old Man demanded I use\nmy best Ambrosia Valley Barbera for the bloodwine. After you put all that\nshit in it, I might as well have used Bilgewater Red.”\n“If I were going to poison the wine, wouldn’t I just prepare an antidote\nfor myself beforehand?” Teia said. An antidote. Yeah, that would’ve been a\ngood idea, wouldn’t it?\n“It’s tradition. It doesn’t have to make sense. Now, get up here.”\nTeia grumbled her assent and climbed up. Her heart was thudding.\nHow many poisons did Murder Sharp have in his lair? Why’d I have to\npick the one with no antidote?\nChapter 102\nThere had to be a way out.\nTheir little cart clattered over cobbles as darkness fell on Big Jasper.\nTeia’d always had quick hands. Maybe she could… What? How do you\ntaste test poison and not die?\nEvery dodge she thought of was stupider than the last: Maybe she could\nswap glasses? Yeah, except you didn’t poison some of the wine, T; you\npoisoned it all. Are you really going to pin your hopes on someone showing\nup with another random glass of wine that you can swap at the last\nmoment?\nMaybe she could try to keep her veil on and pour the wine down her\nneck? But her robes were white; the wine was red. Maybe it could work,\nthough! Her robes were actually the master cloak. Maybe she could keep\nwilling it to stay white. Maybe it would!\nBut she didn’t have any way to test it.\nAnd if they noticed anything suspicious, they’d kill her. Worse, they\nwould throw out the obviously poisoned wine. Everything she’d done to get\nhere would be for nothing.\nNo matter how she turned it, there seemed to be only three possible\noutcomes here: she successfully faked drinking the poisoned wine, she got\ncaught faking drinking it, or she actually did drink it.\nTwo of those ended with her very dead.\nShe’d not come this far to end up dead.\nThey reached the Crossroads, and it was packed with people.

There were people already\npartying, and all the food and wine vendors to cater to them. Some yellow\npyroturges were doing tricks in the evening air, elaborate creations bursting\napart with sparks and flashes.\nThree carts met them, and three horsemen, nondescript, faces hidden as\nif cold. One pointed to a barrel, and without a word, Atevia levered off the\nlid. He handed a ladle to Teia, and she clambered into the back of the\nwagon.\nSuddenly, all eyes were on her. Three barrels of wine, three carts. The\npoisoned wine wasn’t going to one of the Braxian congregations. Each was\ngetting a barrel. If Teia did this, she would wipe out the entire Order with\none stroke.\nThere were no other ladles. No big ceremony with her confronting two\nglasses and trying to figure out how to drink from the right one. It was just a\ndozen eyes on her. One ladle, and the choice of life or death.\nTeia dipped the ladle deep into the barrel, drew it forth, and then held it\nout toward each of the men, so they could see that it was brimming full.\nHere’s to you, my dead slave brothers. I accept your judgment. I accept\nmy punishment.\nShe lifted her veil and drank it all. She presented the empty ladle to\nthem, and whispered, “Good enough?” to show she didn’t still have the\nwine in her mouth.\n“Thank you, Mariel,” one of them said, his voice obviously modulated\nwith one of those collars. But she knew.\nThe Old Man himself. Grinwoody.\nTeia stiffened. Atevia had called her Muriel. Teia threw her hands out,\nlike ‘What the hell?’\n“So it is you,” the man said. “Just checking. Never seen you drink so\ndeeply before. Guess it’s not a normal night, is it? Men, load the barrels.”\nHe turned to one. “Oh, and search her.”\nThe man did, roughly but quickly. Inexpertly, too, in Teia’s opinion.\nShe could only wish that actually mattered. A vial of an antidote hidden\nin a body cavity sounded like a really great idea right about now.\n“She’s clean,” the man said.\nThe Old Man pulled out a coin purse.\nTeia waited. She had no idea if Muriel usually declined payment, so she\ndidn’t push the act.\nBut she widened her eyes briefly, only to see paryl leaking from a shell\naround the nondescript man who’d just searched her. A Shadow.\nA lousy one, obviously, from the spectral bleed she could see, and by the\nfact he hadn’t noticed she was a paryl drafter herself—though if she’d been\nholding paryl when he touched her, that would have gone very differently.\nThis moron Shadow had just been yanking her around while he ‘searched’\nher by shooting paryl through her clothing.

Large, silver\ntarnished, dark except for the relief of a broken eye. The obverse showed\nnine crowns.\n“Barricade your shop tonight, Muriel. The fun begins half an hour after\ndawn. If anyone attacks you or yours, you show them this.” Half an hour\nafter dawn? That would be once the Sun Day parade was in full swing.\nWhich was insane. A battle was probably going to happen, and they\nwere going ahead with the parade? She’d heard a dozen speculations for\nwhy on the streets—some with a more cynical take than Quentin’s—that it\nwas to keep the pilgrims from panicking, and that by honoring Orholam,\nthey hoped to twist His arm into helping them. Others guessed that this way\nthe Chromeria’s defenders knew exactly which streets would be free and\nwhich blocked by the crowds, or said that even though it was going to be\nmuch smaller than usual, the new Prism had demanded it.\nSome kind of Order attack during that? Perfect. Just perfect.\nBut Teia nodded. She was already feeling fuzzy. Her stomach was\nseveral degrees past the warmth of a swig of brandy. That would be the\nalcohol and various drugs, she guessed, probably not the lacrimae\nsanguinis. Not yet.\nWatching the wagons rattle away in various directions down the streets,\nleaving her in a crowd simultaneously tense and joyous, scared and jubilant,\nfacing a holy day and an army intent on their annihilation, Teia couldn’t\nhelp but feel empty. In their hopes and fears, they were tonight connected\nwith one another, with the whole city and the whole religion. They were\nabout to face the greatest fight of their lives, but they were doing it together.\nTeia’s fight was over. She was abandoned, alone, and not for the first\ntime in the last year, unspeakably lonely.\nJust as she’d vowed, she was going to finish her big mission. She was\ngoing to make a difference, forever. She was going to succeed; it was just\nthat she’d be dead by the time it happened.\nSo you win after all, Murder Sharp. Or let’s call it a tie.

Kip\nmight have yelped, too, but she was louder.\nThank you, honey.\n“What’s going on?” Kip asked.\n“My lord,” Big Leo said. “It’s Teia.”\n“What?!”\n“But she’s… not herself.”\n“Get her in—” Kip started to say.\n“I’m already here!” Teia said. She held her hands up in the air as if\npresenting herself for applause. Her face was flushed; her skin was glowing.\nHer lips were dry and her eyes were dilated.\n“I couldn’t leave her out there,” Ferkudi said, poking his head in,\napologetic. “She was hollering.”\n“Wow,” Teia said as Kip got out of bed. Tottering on her feet, she stared\nat him appreciatively—even brazenly, considering his wife was right there\n—shoulders to abs to underclothes and back up. “You are looking good.”\nShe rubbed her forehead. “Orholam’s balls, I am so high right now. This\nwas not how I wanted to do this.”\nHe hurriedly pulled on his tunic and trousers.\n“Teia, it’s so good to see you again,” Tisis said, coming around to Kip’s\nside of the bed. “How can we help you?”\n“I am really sorry for glancing at your husband’s bulge,” Teia said. She\nwinced. “I can’t believe I just said that. You have been so kind to me,\nand…”\nFor his part, Kip was looking at Tisis, who seemed utterly unperturbed.\n“Can we get you some breakfast?” Tisis asked, as if Teia were an\nexpected visitor in the morning. Tisis was wearing Kip’s favorite green silk\nnegligee, the one whose straps had been torn off and mended several times.\nShe calmly pulled a wrap around herself, and Kip felt a jolt of admiration\nfor his bride’s cool calm. “Do you need medical attention?”\nHe knew how Tisis had felt about Teia in months past, but now she was\nchoosing to see Teia as a young woman who was not in a good way, but\nalso maybe not quite responsible for it. She saw Teia’s suffering, not her\nbehavior.\nIt made him love her even more.\nTeia covered her face with her hands, contorting with such shame and\nself-loathing it made Kip ache for her. She gestured toward Tisis. “Guess I\ndon’t need to ask what you see in her, huh? All this and kind, too? Her hair\neven looks good. She’s been sleeping and her hair looks good. How does\nshe do that? I bet she’s not even a murderer!”\n“Teia?” Kip asked. This was not like her. He’d expected that she would\nchange in the time they’d been apart, but even given that, this wasn’t her.\n“The poppy’s wearing off,” Teia said. “I wanted it to, but…” Teia\nrepeated curses under her breath for a few moments, then she looked up"

I’m sorry to be like this. I\ncan’t even remember all I wanted to say to you, but I just really wanted to\nsee you one last time.”\nOne last time? “Teia? What’s going on?”\nShe looked up at him, and her eyes filled with regret. “Kip, I’m dying.”\nChapter 104\nQuentin had only two types of clothing now: the disgustingly rich and the\nobscenely wealthy. Either one would have nauseated the old him. Over the\nlast year, he’d warred with himself every day as he’d slowly grown\naccustomed to the weight and wear of this garb.\nAs part of his punishment—being the example of a luxiat led astray by\nthe world’s riches—he was forbidden to wear anything less expensive than\nhis second-best set in public. In his rooms, he’d worn literal sackcloth for\nseveral months. Then, realizing that he was taking pride in mortifying his\nown flesh—O Pride, thou insidious beast!—he’d taken to wearing a fine but\nsimple robe in private.\nBut today, long before the sun rose, after Kip had awakened him and\ntold him what was required, Quentin put on his finest robes with something\nakin to a healthy pride: today these robes would help him do what needed to\nbe done. He actually had to ask a servant to help him dress: there were\nlayers to these things! Pearls in their hundreds, real gold twisted in the\nbrocade, a mink collar dyed murex purple. Fawn-skin boots, silk laces, and\njeweled rings for every finger.\nHe looked like everything he had always hated, but today it would all be\nfor Orholam’s glory. That which had been a scourge unto his back was now\nthe armor for his battle. A great and glorious gamble. He would be tested to\nhis limits.\nHe might not survive it.\nFrom his apartments in the blue tower, he made his way across the Lily’s\nStem, greeting a few luxiats on their way to matins prayers. One offered\nhim a coin, and he took it humbly. If the Order came to suspect what\nQuentin was doing, he’d not get a chance to put it into the hands of the poor\nwho needed it, but this, too, was his personal spiritual discipline: trusting\nthat Orholam would cover his flaws and failures and still get His work done\non this world, even if Quentin weren’t here to do it, even if Quentin\nmisused some moiety of the bounty with which Orholam had trusted him.\nHe arrived at the west docks an hour before sunrise. The docks were\ncrowded with the faithful, still hoping for a parade. But not only the faithful\nthronged here. Last-minute reinforcements to the fortifications above the\ndocks and to the surrounding walls were being shored up by dozens of\nworkmen. Nearby buildings had been cannibalized for lumber and bricks,\nbeams torn from centuries-old homes while their owners wept.\nOn the opposite side of that wall, crouched in the bay like a panther\noutside the door, the Wight King’s navy waited."

Several soldiers were looking askance at him.\nThe bored crowd, some huddled with their sleeping children, others simply\nlooking for some entertainment to fill the next hour until sunrise—all stared\nat him and openly speculated as to why he was here rather than in richer\nquarters.\nMen and women will die today in droves. Orholam hasn’t asked me to\npick up a sword for that battle.\nHe asks not what we are unable to do.\nHe has asked me to fulfill this duty.\nErgo, this duty is a duty that I am able to fulfill.\nOf course, Orholam never promised we shan’t soil ourselves in the\nfulfillment of said duties.\nFor some reason, that lightened Quentin’s heart.\n‘Just pretend to be Gavin Guile, but… you know, holy,’ Kip had told\nhim.\nIt wasn’t quite a ringing endorsement of Kip’s father, but it was good\nadvice.\nThis’ll be my first sermon, Quentin thought. Most likely my last, too, the\nnot-so-encouraging part of him added.\nAs far as prophetic sermons go, this really is cheating, isn’t it?\nBut then, if the prophecy doesn’t come true, I’m going to look like a fool\nimmediately. And fatally.\nOooh boy. His heart hadn’t felt like this since he’d walked out before the\ncrowd to face Orholam’s Glare.\nGavin Guile.

Blinking, he shaded his own eye\nagainst Orholam’s with a hand. His pace slowed.\nWhat the hell is going on? But Gavin wet his lips and kept moving.\nThe sun in the sky split into twin orbs, as if they were Orholam’s own\norisons glaring judgment across the horizon. As if, most times, He gave the\nworld only half His attention, and now Gavin had all of it.\nBoth of God’s eyes, open, burning white.\nJust as Gavin had given up on finding Him, He was here—and He was\nangry.\nFear threw shackles at Gavin’s heavy limbs, but he staggered forward.\nHe would not be a man who cowered—not even before God Himself.\nAnd those few extra steps back toward his sword were all it took.

Arm yourself, then investigate mysteries.\nGavin circled the promontory once more, quickly now, keeping his\ndistance.\nOrholam’s single eye split again, and again both eyes glowered down at\nGavin in judgment.\nGavin gritted his teeth and took a step—up the hill. And then another,\nclimbing the hill at an angle with the sun.\nThere was something off about those burning eyes.\nThen all the pressure on his heart released at once, and he blew out a\nhuge breath.\nThere weren’t two eyes up there at all. It was a mirror!\nGod damn.\nA mirror, set atop this hill at just the right angle so that pilgrims coming\nhere at dawn on Sun Day and following the path Gavin had would see\nexactly what Gavin had seen. It was just a bloody mirror! Up on the hilltop,\ncasting that illusion with every sunrise, the angle worked out precisely: the\npath, it seemed, even had markings that had to be a calendar, so that the\npriests could have pilgrims stand at exactly the right spot each day.\nIt was all religious flimflam, a swindle, chicanery. A con for the\ndesperate and credulous.\nBut still… an impossibly thin, huge, perfectly clean mirror? Clean, after\ncenturies and doubtless thousands of storms? That in itself was well-nigh\nmiraculous.\nGranted, it was still a lot more credible than that God Himself was\nstaring at him.\nGavin approached the mirror, the time and angle of the hill making the\n‘eyes’ hold steady. He squinted against the brightness to study the fraud.\nBut as soon as he did, they moved. Not the way they should have, given\nhis own motion.\nHis steps faltered.\nNo, surely not. They must’ve only seemed to move wrongly.\nBut Gavin was frozen, his muscles going taut as a bowstring fully\ndrawn.\nHeart thudding, mind screaming that he should have grabbed the sword\nfirst, Gavin circled farther.\nThe eyes seemed to move, but now fully independent of Gavin’s steps.\nNo. No! He’d just puzzled it all out. This was all a Sun Day deception\nlike those Gavin had taken part in so many times himself.\nBut now as he took another step, it was undeniable. The reflected eye\nshould eclipse from the other side as Gavin circled, leaving the sun alone in\nthe sky.\nInstead, the sun tore away to hang in the sky alone in its rightful place.\nBut twin orbs glided down within the mirror, side by side, like eyes.\nGavin stepped back on his heel toward the sword down the hill behind\nhim, but he couldn’t tear his gaze away.\nThe orbs settled at the top of the promontory at the height of a man’s"

Gavin held up a hand to block the\nsearing light. Through his spread fingers, Gavin saw a silvery foot slide\nforth. Then a gleaming arm with muscles etched of marble, then a perfect\nbody with mirror-skin.\nThe godling took three steps out before he seemed to recall that here he\nneeded to breathe. Gavin could hear the breath, this far away. If this was all\nan illusion, it was more sophisticated than any Gavin had ever heard of.\nThe mirror-skin of the being resolved, melting into or morphing into\nhumanlike skin. Humanlike except for its utter perfection. As if in\ndeliberate mockery of Gavin, it, too, wore only a loincloth. Its eyes, now\nnot quite so brilliantly hot as the sun itself, were still unbearably bright,\nblotting out the man’s features. Gavin couldn’t scan that alien face for\nwhatever deception or malice might lie there.\nGavin’s disbelief managed one more gasp. This was all a magical deceit\n—sure, maybe an ancient and fiendishly complicated one—but Gavin was\nno simpleton desperate to buy clever drafting.\nThe eyes. The eyes were the key!\nHe looked down to see if his own shadow moved as that bright being\nmoved; no hex-casting, no illusion could cast such light that it actually\nthrew shadows. The lack of shadows would reveal that this was mere will-\ncasting.\nThe phantasm started circling down the hill, as if giving Gavin room, as\nif Gavin were a skittish wild beast. But Gavin welcomed each step the thing\ntook away from the mirror—if this were will-casting or hex, the magic\nwould be placed where everyone must look, the mirror itself.\nBut then he saw that his shadow was splitting, trembling, synchronized\nwith those lantern eyes as they bobbed with the creature’s every step.\nFear shot down Gavin’s spine. It was real.\nWorse—what if the godling were circling, not to alleviate Gavin’s fear\nbut… it was heading toward the Blinding Knife!\nGavin shot away like an arrow loosed. Up the hill, the godling shot\nforward, too, rushing in at an angle toward the same prize as if he and\nGavin were twinned eyes in a mirror, the light of heaven and the light of\nearth being called together here at the center of all things.\nBut the god was better positioned. Gavin didn’t dare look toward him\nfor fear of it slowing him even half a step. He could feel the deity closing.\nThen It cut in, not going for the prize but leaping at Gavin instead, as if\nhe himself were the prize."

If he’d learned\nnothing else from his life, it was that he who strikes first often strikes last.\nBut with their legs entangled, his kick glanced off solid muscle.\nGavin lashed out with knees and elbows, kicking to create some\ndistance.\nWhatever else this being was, Its flesh wasn’t marble or luxin or pure\nwill; it felt like that of a man.\nAnd It fought like a man, too, grabbing Gavin’s ankle as he tried to pull\naway to run the last steps to the sword. The godling twisted Gavin’s ankle\nso hard that he had to flip sideways, or risk his leg being broken.\nGavin rolled, tearing his ankle free, but losing all forward momentum.\nHe tried to stand, losing where his opponent was as he tried to claim a\nposition between the being and the blade.\nThe godling crashed into Gavin again, blasting him off his feet and\nlanding on top of him, two steps from the blade.\nThis time Gavin was on the receiving end of the knees and elbow\nstrikes. He blocked, blocked, thrashed ineffectually. He’d never been a great\ngrappler. The Blackguards he’d trained with never much wanted to slam\ntheir elbows into the Prism’s head, and in Gavin’s real-world fights, he’d\nonly rarely come within range of a sword, much less fists. Drafting and\nshooting had always been enough. If anyone had come within grappling\nrange, Gavin had been able to count on a Blackguard dealing with the threat\ninstantly.\nIt had become one part of his training Gavin let rust into disuse; not\neven Blackguards could excel at every martial art, and Gavin had needed to\nbe so much more than only a warrior.\nThe man went for a chokehold, and Gavin barely had the presence of\nmind to shoot an arm up through the grip before his opponent could choke\nhim from consciousness.\nEven as he strove to break free toward that damned blade—it was a\nhand’s breadth from his straining fingertips!—a chill cut through the heat of\nflight and fear and the raw vibrancy of battle juice: Gavin couldn’t fight this\nOpponent with some easy and obvious short-term goal animating his every\nmove.\nTrying only and immediately to grab the sword would make him too\npredictable. Back when he’d had his powers, fighting a monochrome drafter\nwhile standing between the man and his spectacles had always been easy.\nDrafters in those positions always thought they only had options after they\nhad their spectacles and thus their power, so they always moved to grab\ntheir spectacles first, even if it put them in the jaws of an obvious trap.\nGavin would need to use every resource instead; this fight wouldn’t end\nin seconds; it might stretch minutes.

In case.”\nIn case the Order was right and Orholam really did see and maybe even\nhear everything done in the light.\n“Thought darkness could hide your blasphemy?” the godling asked.\n“Blasphemy? Ha! One can only blaspheme against a god!”\nGavin lost his grip on a sweat-slick arm, then he lunged for a better hold\nand missed.\nThey broke apart from each other, both rolling, both standing, chests\nheaving, throwing glances at the sword but neither of them making a move\nfor it that might leave him vulnerable.\n“But then,” Gavin said, “that’s what you wanted everyone to think, isn’t\nit? That you’re God.”\n“Deception is your forte, not mine.” There was something familiar in his\nvoice. A bad copy of Gavin’s own. Another mockery.\n“No, no,” Gavin said. “You dazzle and distract rather than hide, but it’s\nstill deceit. I’m a liar and I know a liar when I see one. So I’ve suspected\nyour game all along.” They circled each other, each keeping their weight\nlow, hands up.\n“You came to lay your suspicions to rest?”\n“I already have. I was right. I’ve suspected it ever since I became\nPrism,” Gavin said. “Assassin. Traitor. Genius. Warlord. Liar. We have a lot\nin common. But only you founded a religion that conveniently made\nexceptions for your worst behavior. The man who lives alone is either a god\nor a monster, and I know which you are, and I’ll admit you’re more than a\nman now, but you’re not Orholam, the creator God, the Almighty Lord of\nLights. You? You steal our lives and our magic to fuel your own. You’re\nnothing more than a leech. You’re not the creator God, Orholam. I—”\n“No—”\n“I know who you are, and I’m not here to beg a boon of you, Emperor"

I—”\n“No—”\n“I know who you are, and I’m not here to beg a boon of you, Emperor\nLucidonius,” Gavin said. “You ascended to godhood, and I will, too. I’m\nnot here to praise you. I’m here to replace you.”\nChapter 106\n“Listen, O ye beloved of Orholam!” A voice rose above the crowds thick in\nthe streets, mere minutes before dawn. In a normal year, the call would have\nbeen inaudible over the sharp snaps and explosions from the pyroturges and\nthe oohs of the crowd and the din of food sellers and the chatter of\nconversation. This year, there was an air of quiet dread.\nPeople had come great distances to join the Sun Day festivities on Big\nJasper. When they’d heard of the invasion, a few had left, but most hadn’t\nbelieved it would really happen, or perhaps their homes had been lost\nalready to the Wight King’s armies and they had nowhere else to run, or\nperhaps they believed Orholam would surely protect them here.\nKip had taken a position at the seawall by East Bay with the majority of\nhis raiders. He was halfway glad to be here: he was happiest being with his\npeople in this fight, but he thought that he really ought to be atop the\nPrism’s Tower with the mirrors. Andross had let him practice on them to his\nheart’s content yesterday, but had claimed that today there were prophecies\nto be fulfilled. One, he claimed, said that the Lightbringer ‘will ascend the\nheights only at the last, where others have tried and failed.’\nIt was one thing to follow a prophecy because it had good advice\nanyway; it was another to follow one that seemed to be forthrightly bad\nadvice.\nBut it actually didn’t matter whether Kip trusted him or if Andross was\ndeliberately sabotaging Kip’s chance to be the Lightbringer. Andross was\nthe promachos. His word was law. Within the Chromeria itself, Kip had to\nobey him. And Andross had said Kip wasn’t to come back to the Chromeria\nuntil the bane rose.\nKip wasn’t sure why that hadn’t happened yet. Perhaps the Blood Robes\nplanned to wait until the Chromeria committed its drafters to the fight.\nPerhaps, with the bane spread around the islands rather than grouped as\nthey had been when Kip had encountered them at sea, there were simply\ntechnical difficulties. Deploying as quickly as the White King’s army was\ndoing was certain to cause all sorts of problems. After all, an amphibious\nassault was an incredibly difficult undertaking, and it wasn’t something the\nBlood Robes had ever practiced; nor had they ever deployed on this scale or\nat this speed.\nPlease let them be running into unforeseen problems.\nPlease let us be able to take advantage of those.\nOnce the bane did rise, Kip would have to leave the front lines quickly.\nIn theory, it would take a while, so he should have plenty of time to get\nback to the Chromeria.\nRegardless, he needed to be here for a while, at least. At least until they\nfound out if Teia had been right.\nThey believed this was the area most likely to be attacked first. West"

West\nBay was covered by the batteries of Cannon Island. Little Jasper itself was\nso rocky and tall, with sheer walls above the sheer rocks, that it was well-\nnigh unassailable. One or two ships might land at the back docks, but the\nonly passage into the island from there could be guarded by half a dozen\nmen and held for days. Naturally, they’d put an entire platoon there.\nThe only important thing to be done still was to get every drafter to\nbleed themselves a bit with some hellstone. The orders had already been\ngiven, and stressed, and repeated, but telling a war drafter not to draft\nbefore going into battle was like telling a swimmer not to hold his breath\nbefore diving.\n“I come to you with a word from Orholam Himself!” Quentin shouted.\nHe’d bribed his way to getting atop the gatehouse, and everyone could see\nhim.\nKip’s men had quietly accompanied Quentin everywhere he’d asked this\nmorning. He’d made four or five stops. This was to be the last before dawn.\nTeia, please tell me you weren’t merely drunk last night. If nothing\nhappens here, you—and I—will have ruined Quentin.\nFrom where Kip and his men stood, Quentin’s voice wasn’t loud. There\nwas still time left now, in the last few minutes before dawn, where Kip\nshould be making his own big speech.\nIn Kip’s experience, men usually fought because they didn’t want to let\nthe man next to them down, then because their commanders would kill\nthem if they didn’t, and finally because they might get loot or revenge.\nWhat was he supposed to tell his people that wasn’t already obvious?\nWe’re on an island. We’re surrounded. There’s nowhere we can go,\nnowhere to run away to. We win or we die.\n“My friends!” Quentin said, and he was resplendent in his luxiat-lord’s\nattire. “Be strong and take courage. You have trembled through the long\nnight, but dawn is coming. We, the Magisterium, have long used our words\nto sway your hearts. Today Orholam shall reveal whose heart inclines to the\nlight and who wishes to hide in darkness. Let me speak to you one last time,\nfor three minutes only. I take as my text a commentary on the end of mercy\nby Doni’el Machos.”\nQuentin read the words without drama, without inflection, merely a loud\nand clear statement of fact: “‘The wrath of Orholam burns against them.\nTheir damnation doesn’t slumber, the pit is prepared, the fire is made ready,\nthe furnace is now hot, ready to receive them, the flames do now rage and\nglow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them, and the pit hath\nopened her mouth under them.’”\nHe closed the scroll, although Kip was certain that the action was mostly\nto signify that he was finished quoting. Quentin had quoted longer\nselections from memory many times. The young luxiat continued, with no\npassion in his voice other than pity. “My dear wayward sheep, today is the"

The young luxiat continued, with no\npassion in his voice other than pity. “My dear wayward sheep, today is the\nday of judgment. Orholam’s luxiats have become corrupt. His magisters\nclad themselves in golden rags, as if rags might save.” He held up the front\nof his own fine tunic as if it were loathsome to him. “Orholam’s own\ndrafters have grown proud in their strength, so this day, Orholam will deny\nour drafters His luxin that we may learn to lean upon His strength instead.\n“Among us, men and women of all stations have worshipped other gods,\nhave conspired with Orholam’s enemies, and have betrayed Him and us\nboth. Traitors stand among us, but Orholam knows what is done in\ndarkness, and Orholam will drag their shame into the light. These are words\nyou’ve heard before, words you’ve discounted as mere metaphor. But I tell\nyou that when the dawn comes—literally: this dawn, this day, today,\nminutes from now—when Orholam’s Eye rises over these walls, some of\nthose standing with us will die. They will be unable to bear the full light of\nOrholam’s gaze. And they will perish.”\nOh, shit. Quentin had gone way past what Kip had told him to say.\nQuentin had been supposed to go out and say, ‘Hey, don’t be afraid if some\npeople get ill. Orholam’s in charge. Those loyal to Him are going to be\nfine.’ But no, Quentin had thrown it all in, like a first-time gambler with no\nsense of responsibility.\nIf Kip and Teia had led him astray, Quentin wasn’t merely going to be\nruined; he was going to get lynched.\n“But when it does happen,” Quentin said, “be not afraid. Orholam sees.\nOrholam hears. Orholam cares. Orholam saves. He will slay these traitors\nwho are intent on betraying us to the King of Wights. Orholam will slay\nthem, not to cause your hearts to fear but to save your very lives and your\nsouls.\n“This day is not a battle of brother on brother. Nor even between men\nand those wights who once were men themselves. Today, Orholam Himself\nfights beside us against the legions of the damned. When you grow faint,\nHis immortals shall uphold you. When you grow weary, they shall bear you\nup. Though ye fall, O beloved of Orholam, ye shall rise again. And if any\npart of this doesn’t happen, slay me as a false prophet!”\nQuentin paused. The crowd had fallen utterly silent. They seemed\ncaught between hope and despair, with disbelief overall. When did any\nluxiat speak so plainly?\nSome knew him or knew of him, and those who did whispered about\nQuentin to their neighbors, and the sound of the whispers ebbed and flowed.\nThe sun, still below the horizon for those here at the waterline, was\ncasting its light on the tallest towers of the Chromeria now, its light\ndescending slowly and surely.\nThe people turned and looked.

Was that the lacrimae\nsanguinis affecting them, or just people scared to death?\nQuentin said, “I close now with a few final words from Doni’el Machos:\n“‘Orholam stands ready to pity you; this is a day not only of judgment\nbut also of mercy; you may cry now with some encouragement of obtaining\nmercy: but once the time of mercy is past, your most dolorous cries and\nshrieks will be in vain; weep now in repentance, or weep in the very throes\nof your damnation.’”\nAtop the gate, limned in the rising light, Quentin fell to his knees and\nlifted his arms in supplication, or perhaps greeting.\nKip felt sudden, intense anxiety for his friend.\nWhat if the poison took too long to take effect?\nThe sunlight filled the square, its hand touching all the people who’d\nbeen listening so intently to Quentin—and, as far as Kip could tell, word of\nQuentin’s sermon must have spread like wildfire, because it seemed like the\nwhole island held its breath.\nAnd now we find out if Karris’s luxiat corps is any good.\nKip nodded to a standard-bearer, who waved a signal flag.\nIn obedience to Karris’s luxiats, mirror slaves and the star-tower slaves\naround the Jaspers reacted instantly, spinning the towers’ mirrors, sending\ngreat beams of sunlight across the crowd. Not only here but also working\nlight over every wall, every gate, every sector of the city: if the lacrimae\nsanguinis was released by a sharp constriction of the pupils, Kip wanted to\nmake certain that no one had a chance for their eyes to gradually get\naccustomed to the light of the day.\nBut what if even that didn’t make things go fast enough?\nPeople were blinking against the sudden rays that had just bathed them,\nwondering if that was Quentin’s miracle. Then many seemed angry.\nWhat was this? Flashing light over the crowd? Was that supposed to\nimpress them?\n“Lieutenant Commander,” Kip said. The man was General Antonius’s\nright-hand man, and he stood at Kip’s elbow, ready to take orders, hand\nnervously on his dagger, no doubt because of the restive crowds. “I think\nwe have about two minutes to rescue Quentin before this crowd turns. Lead\nyour men quietly into place right now, then grab him before they do.”\n“I’ll stay with you, my lord. I’ll send a detachment.”\nKip turned, irritated. The crowd was starting to buzz. Someone cried out\nangrily. “False prophet! Kill him!”\nKip snarled, “Lieutenant, was there something unclear about my\norders?”\nThe lieutenant commander had drawn his dagger, but Kip barely noticed\nit. He’d fought alongside this man many times. All Kip could see now was\nthat the whites of the lieutenant commander’s eyes were suddenly flooded\nwith bright crimson, as if the irises had cracked on every side and a dam\nhad broken.\nThis man wasn’t a red drafter. That red filling the whites of his eyes\nwasn’t luxin; it was blood."

The\ncommander had been poisoned. That meant—\n“Light cannot be chained!” the commander screamed, lunging.\nA heavy chain spun out of nowhere and slapped the attacker down to the\nground as easily as a man smacks a mosquito on his arm. One instant the\nman was leaping at Kip with lethal intent, and the next all his momentum\nhad been redirected into the ground at Kip’s feet.\nKip cursed as the man convulsed once, fingers and limbs stiffening as if\nin instant rigor mortis. He looked up at Big Leo. “It somehow actually\nslipped my mind that the Order might try to assassinate me again.”\nBig Leo wrapped the heavy chain back around his chest. “Didn’t slip\nours.”\nIn the few seconds Kip had been distracted by the assassin,\npandemonium had broken out. In his own ranks, a dozen men and women\nhad dropped dead, and thousands were reacting to the assassination attempt\non Kip and to the dead nearby.\nThings were far worse in the square. Nearly a hundred people were\ndying or lay dead already, hidden weapons spilling from hands that had\nbeen tucked away under coats and cloaks, men and women with blood\nhemorrhaging from their eyes, lurching into the innocent, convulsing to die\nwith limbs crooked tight like spiders’.\nMost of the traitors were congregated directly around the gate—and, as\nif this death were contagious, the people around them were surging back\naway from them.\nKip heard screams reverberate throughout the island as others were\ndying in droves in the far corners of Big Jasper, just as suddenly.\nQuentin jumped to his feet as the people roared. “Be not afraid!” he\nshouted. “Orholam fights with us. Orholam fights with us!”\nOnly Kip knew the truth. My God, he thought, and he wasn’t sure if it\nwas a curse or a holy invocation of the divine mystery: Teia’s just wiped out\nthe Order of the Broken Eye.\nAll of it.\nToday a great warrior like Big Leo might kill twenty of the enemy.\nMaybe, maybe forty. He would be accounted a hero for such valor.\nIf her estimates were right, in one day, of the empire’s most dedicated,\nmost cunning, most dangerous, and most implacable enemies, Teia had just\nkilled four hundred.\nAnd no one would ever know. Despite all Quentin’s talk of Orholam’s\nmercy, like a mighty man levering apart the pillars of a pagan temple, Teia\nhad killed the enemies in their hundreds only at the cost of killing herself.\nKip climbed up on the wall.\nThe masses of people were cheering now with new hope, but Kip’s eyes\nwere drawn to the horizon, because among the cacophony of alarms and\nscreams of horror and disgust and shouts of praise and relief, he’d heard the\nwhistle of the lookouts, and he saw the horizon darken with the long\nshadows of the White King’s approaching armada.\nIt seemed much, much bigger than Kip remembered.\nThen his eyes were drawn to the waves—and, illuminated in the angled"

His\nmoves were no longer at all sudden.\nTruthfully, they were hardly even moves now.\nAnd it was getting worse. He’d noticed it immediately, how the\nascended man’s eyes mirrored the sun, slowly shrinking in apparent size as\nthe sun rose, but growing in intensity.\nLucidonius obviously wasn’t as tired as Gavin was, nor as bloodied. He\nhad only a split lip while Gavin’s nose had bled and clotted, bled and\nclotted. His cheek swollen from a collision with the marble, elbows\nthrobbing, knees abraded.\nGavin had noticed that Lucidonius’s body, too, seemed to grow stronger\nas the sun did. Somehow the godling’s magic was tied to the rising of the\nlight. On realizing that, Gavin had made desperate attempts to end the fight\nquickly.\nThose times had been the times he’d come within a hair’s breadth of\nlosing. Now there was only endurance, not the thought of victory.\nThey’d reached the sword not once, but several times. It now lay not far\nfrom the Great Mirror itself. Gavin counted that as his only victory. If\nLucidonius were smarter, he would attempt to throw the Blinding Knife off\nthe tower. As long as it was so close to the Great Mirror, Gavin had a\nchance.\n“Shouldn’t you be… you know, on your way elsewhere?” Gavin asked.\n“Where’s that?”\n“It’s Sun Day. Don’t you go visit the poor assholes giving their lives for\nyou over at the Chromeria?”\n“I wish I could go help them in their hour of need. I’m needed here.”\n“Hour of need?” Gavin asked. He wouldn’t call the Freeing that.\n“The Jaspers are under siege. The White King has floated seven bane\nand tens of thousands of soldiers and drafters for the attack. And there are\ntraitors within the walls.”\n“And yet you’re here. While they worship you.”\n“They don’t worship me.”\n“You know what I mean. Whatever you want to call yourself,\nLucidonius, it doesn’t change that they’re dying because they believe your\nwords.”\nLucidonius stood and dusted himself off. “You seem to have recovered\nyour strength, if not your sense of irony. Ready?”\n“How’d you do it?” Gavin said, not least because he most certainly was\nnot ready.\n“Are you hoping I’ll get distracted now, or that I’ll give you\ninstructions?” Lucidonius asked.\n“You give me too much credit. I’m just buying time to rest. But\nseriously, you ascended to godhood. How?” Not that Gavin wouldn’t take\nany opening if the creature offered it, but he didn’t expect that. Lucidonius\nwas too sharp for simpler ploys to work."

Lucidonius\nwas too sharp for simpler ploys to work.\n“Oh, you’re hoping I’ll wear myself out a little bit, just by me using my\nbreath to talk while you rest?”\nGavin didn’t deny that had been his thought, but he pressed in. “You’re\nnot nearly as tired as I am. What’s the harm? I’m the only one in the world\nwho could possibly understand you. Even if only partially.”\n“And people think Andross got all the cleverness in the Guile family.”\n“People think wrong. My mother was more clever by half,” Gavin shot\nback. He was defensive of Felia now, and he wasn’t sure why. Maybe\nbecause he’d only recognized her particular genius after she was already\ngone. Maybe because she’d always championed him, even against his\nfather.\n“Brilliant people, Andross and Felia, each in their own way.\nComplementary in their gifts, but twins in their arrogance.”\n“Fuck you,” Gavin said.\n“People think Andross got all the temper, too,” Lucidonius said wryly.\nGavin leapt for him, swinging a fist for the godling’s throat. Most men\nwill duck their head at an incoming blow, so a low shot could catch the chin\nor the nose, and no one fights well either unconscious or blinded by\ninvoluntary tears.\nBut he missed. Of course.\nHe was too slow, and so they began slugging it out again, absorbing\nblows but too exhausted to do much damage.\nFrom the first moment Gavin had noticed Lucidonius’s strength was tied\nto the sun, he’d thought of a terrible strategy. It was still a terrible strategy,\nbut it was slowly becoming the only one left to him.\nIf Lucidonius got stronger as the sun rose, then would he not also\nweaken as it sank?\nGavin would have to last through the entire day to find out.\nIt was still two hours until noon. Of Sun Day. Gavin had chosen to fight\na creature whose strength was tied to the intensity of the sunlight… on the\nlongest fucking day of the year.\nChapter 108\nThe Blood Robes came down like wolves on the fold, their\nforerunners bedecked in the white and the gold. For the sons of\nOrholam they bore the scourge and the flail, and to hell they would\nride before they would fail.\n—Gorgias Gordi\nIt had a certain beauty to a battlefield commander, seeing an attack so\nexquisitely timed, a surprise played at the perfect moment. Sea chariots\npulled at great speed by sharks or dolphins, impossible to see at this\ndistance, came roaring forward by the score. With battle standards whipping\nin the wind, showing the golden broken chains of the pagans and the colors\nof the new nine kingdoms, and scoops in the hulls designed purely to throw\nwater into the sky to make great rooster tails as they pulled, everything\nabout the sea chariots was designed to be a scintillating spectacle.

The cannons would only catch a few of them.\nBut the forerunners made far too small a strike force to have any hope of\nsuccess, which is why they had to be a distraction.\nKip looked beneath the waves, and there he saw them, already\npenetrating the bay, rounding in behind the seawall, simply swimming\nunder the great chains meant to keep ships out. He’d heard the rumors of\nthem in Blood Forest: even as Gavin had turned his gifts to making a craft\nthat could move faster over water than any others ever had, some of Koios’s\nwights had turned their own gifts to remaking their bodies so that they\ncould move swiftly and silently under the water.\n“Wights!” Kip shouted. “Beneath the waves! Coming in fast!”\nThey called themselves the Daughters of Caoránach, who would snatch\noff his boat anyone who dared go out on a moonlit night too close to the\nwaters, and they wailed whenever they took blood. Their cries echoed in the\ndark over foggy lakes and rivers, chilling men and women to the bone.\nOthers called them river demons or lake demons.\nThey would still just be men, wights encumbered on land by bodies\ndesigned for water.\n“Caoránaigh!” someone shouted. “It’s the caoránaigh!”\nKip cursed. “No! They’re only men! River wights! Arms, to arms!” The\nlast thing his people needed was the psychic shock of seeing their childhood\nnightmares come alive.\nHe hated this part of a battle, when you suddenly see the whole of the\nenemy’s strategy and you need everyone to hear you at once. There were\ntoo many orders to give, too many people shouting for everyone to hear\nthem.\n“Protect the gates and cannons! Look to the bases of the towers and\nwalls,” someone shouted beside him. “Get me my signal banners, now!\nAleph Company, in reserve! After we repulse the first attack, you’re going\nto reinforce the secondary attack on the seawall!”\nCorvan Danavis had just arrived, with his booming voice stomping\nthrough everyone else’s shouts.\nKip looked down into the courtyard and saw a massive influx of the high\ngeneral’s soldiers, come to reinforce the gates.\n“You!” Corvan shouted at Kip. “I’m here now. That means you can’t\nbe.”\nThey’d discussed this. Corvan wouldn’t allow for the possibility of one\nlucky shell taking out so much of the Chromeria’s command and control.\n(Incidentally, it also put him in charge without having anyone else around to\nsecond-guess him—‘slow him down,’ as he put it.)\n“I got this,” Kip said. “Until the bane rise, I can—”\n“This could be a—” The boom of cannon took out Corvan’s last word,\nbut he didn’t even flinch. He repeated, “Trap. You get to Tower Twelve—”\n“I know it’s a trap. The river wights—”\n“No, I mean all of it! They could be using the entire attack to raise the\nbane.

And Kip was doing exactly what he shouldn’t do\n—arguing with the man he’d put in control. “Yessir!” Kip said. “My\napologies. Right away.”\n“Marksmen to the fore!” Corvan shouted back at his men. Signal flags\nwere hoisted, orders were repeated in shouts to warriors back in the lines.\n“Aim especially for any of these river dogs who look like they’re trying to\nthrow up a flare or any sort of signal.”\nHe was in his element, juggling the big picture and the small with ease.\nThe caoránaigh had burst from the waters and were scaling the towers.\nOthers were attacking the gates directly, throwing great streams of fire and\nmissiles in every hue, leaping over spiked fortifications with baffling ease.\nThey were not at all encumbered by their amphibious form.\nThe rattle of musket fire deafened Kip. He wanted nothing more than to\nwatch the battle unfold, to see the spectacle of gouts of water leaping into\nthe sky as the cannons’ explosive shells hit ships or waves, throwing death\ninto the chariots’ ranks. He wanted to marvel at the sinuous forms of these\nriver demons, that made even his heart twist with fear.\nHe wanted to fight.\nBut he had orders.\n“I know the fastest way to get us to that tower,” Big Leo said, his copper\nchain held in his big hands over his shoulders. He wanted to fight, too.\n“Son,” Corvan said.\nKip glanced into the courtyard. Corvan’s men had somehow already\nmoved all the Order of the Broken Eye’s dead aside to make room for their\nown ranks.\nIf those Order traitors had been alive to mount even a halfway-decent\nassault on even this one gate from within, the caoránaigh would have made\nit to the walls unnoticed, and breached the gates if they’d not been opened\nfrom within. Then they’d have gone for the cannons, but even if they hadn’t\ngotten that far, the White King would have rushed in and immediately had a\nfoothold on the island itself.\nIf the White King took the wall at any point, that would be the beginning\nof the end for the Chromeria.\nAnd he would have had that already this morning, if not for Teia.\nIf not for Teia’s sacrifice.\nKip wondered if she was still alive, cocooned as she was in a pitch-black\nroom, her eyes bandaged, everyone hoping that maybe, maybe her eyes\ncould be kept from dilating or contracting and that that might save her. That\nmaybe her body would process the poison slowly, and she might live.\nBut she was out of the battle. She would help no one. Just like that,\nbefore Kip had even fired a musket, Teia’s battle was done.\nBeside Kip, Winsen’s bowstring thrummed, but Winsen didn’t even\nwatch his arrow arc through the morning air.

Two hundred fifty paces away, a\ncaoránach jumped up to clear a spiked palisade, and was met—in the air!—\nwith the glittering arrow. Its limbs jerked every direction as the arrow hit its\nchest with a small flash. It dropped flat on its back to the ground.\n“Not bad,” Winsen admitted.\nHe didn’t mean the shot. He meant the Andross-gifted bow and arrows.\n“Remind me never to piss you off,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Hey, Ben,” Winsen said.\n“Not right now, asshole,” Ben said. He was rubbing his knees as if\nuncomfortable with the new fit and with wearing a brace on both legs.\nKip cursed. He’d gotten frozen with the spectacle and the anticipation\nand the battle juice pumping in his veins.\n“Son!” Corvan said again, louder.\nKip looked.\nCorvan said, “This battle’s gonna have surprises for all of us—but that\nmeans them, too. You’re doing fine. We’re going to win here. Your friend\nprobably bought us a few hours and a whole lot of confidence.” He gave a\nwolfish smile. “Now, get the hell out of here. I have a feeling the bane\nattack is coming soon.”\nChapter 109\nThe superviolet bane was not much to Aliviana’s liking. It had been largely\nfinished before she arrived at Azuria Bay, of course. The unskilled drafter\nshe’d replaced as the Ferrilux had no imagination, nor sense of aesthetics,\nnor even the realization that the bane could be shaped as it grew.\nSo it had grown as it would, many-faceted crystals growing up many-\nfaceted crystals. A floating island of large crystals, growing in spirals upon\nspirals, the greater echoing the smaller.\nA cannon shell exploded fifty-two paces from her bane. Some small\namount of shrapnel tore through her left port bow.\nAliviana Ferrilux fixed it, found a drafter who’d been injured, and\ndumped her out into the water.\nChanging the bane, she’d decided, would be too massive an expenditure\nof her time and effort, so she was stuck with it. Her hatred of it was\nillogical. She could have made the bane invisible. Even with the vast\namount of water the structure displaced, she could have crafted illusions\nsuch that the water here looked like the water elsewhere. Instead, this mess\nof crystals with every possible polarity made the floating island actually\nsomewhat visible, even if one missed the giant bowl of missing water in the\nwaves.\nShe hated a lot about things that she couldn’t quite figure out these days.\nFor the two hours before dawn, she’d been picking the superviolet\ncrystals off her face and hands, elbows, knees, neck, groin.

You’d think this\nwould be a simple thing: superviolet luxin was so fragile that a vigorous\nshake ought to do it.\nBut she’d learned in the last year that what the Chromeria’s drafters did\nwith superviolet exploited only a fraction of its potential. With what\nAliviana now did? The body had to learn how to deal with so much magic,\nand it simply didn’t handle all of it well. Her mortal body failed her\nimmortal will. She would figure out fixes later. Work-arounds. Eternity\nwould be a long time.\nFor now these crystals grew on her skin like barnacles on the hull of a\nboat, slowing her down. If she tore them off, they too often tore her delicate\nhuman skin—which seemed to be thinning all the time. This was especially\nbad on her face. The tears left her with scars to which the crystals accreted\neven more quickly. It was slowly immobilizing her face from showing even\nthe few emotions she now betrayed. But she didn’t want to lose function,\nnot in anything, not because of magic she didn’t control. That reeked of\nfailure.\nAnother cannon shell exploded, closer. She fixed the damage with an\nirritated thought. Soon it would be time to rise.\nAll this power, yet I’m losing control over my own body.\nPerhaps this was what it was like for humans to grow old? She would\nhave to think on that.\nBeliol had offered to help her with this, of course, groveling as he did,\nthe little spirit. She rejected him this time, as she usually did. And as usual\nwhen rejected, Beliol quickly went on his way. He treated his time on this\nworld as if it were precious. Any chance he might have of worming his way\nfurther into Liv’s thoughts, he took, but when rejected, he acted as if he had\nother places to be.\nHe grew more powerful the more Aliviana depended on him. She’d\nfigured that out almost immediately, though she hadn’t let on, she hoped.\nTheirs would be a game played over centuries, she thought. He was, likely,\nmalevolent. But he had limitations, too. She would be careful not to put\nherself under his power. The groveling might stop at the most inconvenient\ntime.\nShe saw the signal from her partner, her god of gods, Koios. She\ncouldn’t help but roll her eyes as she thought of him and his overly intricate\nbattle plans.\nBattles. It was so hard to concentrate on them.\nJust tell me who wins and who’s left alive at the end, please. I have\nthings I need to do once we get to that point.\nWhen everyone lets down their guard in victory, that’s when things get\nreally interesting. Aliviana was looking forward to that.\nOh, right. The signal.\nThe Chromeria was funny like this: for all that their powers came from\nsunlight, for all that they worshipped a god they believed to exist literally\nabove them, the cretins so rarely looked up.\nAliviana gathered her powers and lifted the bane up, out of the waves\nand into the sky.\nChapter 110\n“Put on the wraparound blue spectacles,” Kip told the messenger. “Ride as"

Tell High General Danavis the orange bane rises. Go now!”\nBlue was the best color to use to sharpen the mind against orange. He\ndidn’t know how well it would work, though. The Chromeria’s damnable\nfear of teaching hex-casting left them ignorant of how best to defend\nagainst it. After all, ‘Don’t look at the hex’ isn’t very useful advice during a\nbattle, when the hex might be painted on your enemies’ very shields and\nhelms. How are you supposed to fight without looking at your enemy?\nFor more than an hour now, Kip had been carefully scanning the horizon\nwith chi, as instructed. He’d toyed with melting open the silvery globe of\ngallium he wore on his neck to access the chi bane, but he had no idea what\nhe’d do with it. He’d drafted chi only a handful of times in his entire life,\nand none of them had been pleasant. He hadn’t jumped on any opportunity\nsince then to practice with it.\nIt was just another mistake he’d made. He should’ve practiced to find\nout what he could do with chi instead of vaguely thinking that it could be\nused for signaling, and that it was better in his own hands than in someone\nelse’s. No, he should have brought the Keeper with him. She should be\ndoing this.\nBut bringing the Keeper with him would have been a death sentence for\nher and her sect, and maybe for Kip, too. Consorting with heretics?\nBringing a bane to the Jaspers, at the very time the White King was? With\nher masks and gaudy armor and tumors, the Keeper wasn’t exactly\nconcealable, either.\n“Breaker, sir? Should we go?” Big Leo asked.\n“Not yet,” Kip said. “I’ve got my orders.” He wasn’t supposed to come\nback until he saw a signal, Andross had said.\nWhat signal?\n‘You’ll know it when you see it,’ Andross had said.\nWhich drove Kip crazy.\nQuit that. Too much thinking. And the wrong kind.\nKip had thought he understood the old soldier’s maxim that the waiting\nis the worst part of war. He’d waited before. He’d waited to spring traps.\nHe’d waited to order men to fire. He’d waited for the rush of the battle’s\nbeginning.\nBut once it began, he’d always been right there, in the thick of it. Now\nthe battle was about to begin—but not for him.\nHe was going to watch. Once the bane rose, he’d make his way up to the\ntop of the Prism’s Tower to do what he could from up there. Which might\nnot be much of anything at all.\nHe might be stuck watching all day, depending on what the Wight King\ndid. Watching, while others died.\nWith the bane still submerged, and with the great number of the Blood\nRobes’ ships and sea chariots, all of them in constant motion, the bane were\ninitially hard to find, but Kip had finally discerned their locations with chi"

The high general had rearranged his defenses\nappropriately—and without any help asked or needed from Kip on where to\nput them.\nAt regular intervals, Kip had shielded his eyes and gazed in chi toward\neach arc encircling the island, then in paryl, then he put on each of the\ncolored spectacles he carried at his hip in turn, hoping to see something. He\nkept it up now so that he didn’t get caught unawares by the others rising. It\nwas easy to get war-blind and focus all your attention on only the one threat\nin front of you.\nBut he’d spent his time debating with himself about what he should do:\nUse the chi bane? Don’t use it? View Andross’s card? Don’t View it?\nThat was what he wanted: a magical salvation, a solution from out of\nnowhere to solve all his problems for him, because he was so goddam\nspecial.\nA lifetime ago—and only three years ago—Gaspar Elos had asked him,\njust before Koios White Oak (and Zymun, that asshole) had burned down\nRekton, ‘Do you know why you think you’re special?’ And had laughed as\nKip’s young heart had welled with hope that he was the prophesied one, the\none chosen to do great things—‘Because you’re an arrogant little shit.’\nKip shook his head. Wrong thoughts. Not the time.\nCorvan’s books had taught him years ago that a commander should use\nhis quiet hours to obsess over two questions only: what does the enemy\nknow, and what are the enemy’s problems? If you knew those two things,\nyou might guess what he would do. If you knew the enemy himself, you\nwould know.\nHe felt it more than saw it. A trembling under the waves. Movement.\nKip squinted against the reflection of the rising sun in its many-colored\nglory.\n“Why has the orange waited so long?” Tisis asked. “Worse leadership?\nFewer drafters?” Her spies had said that the orange ‘god’ was considered\ndistinctly inferior to the others, and the orange corps of drafters and wights\nsmaller and poorly trained compared to the others. This last, at least, was\none benefit of the Chromeria’s tight strictures on orange—it had made\norange drafters less useful. Thus, fewer lords and satraps went to the\nexpense of sponsoring orange drafters, which meant fewer were around to\ndefect to the Wight King.\n“This is the first time they’ve done this,” Kip said. “With the bane all\nseparated from each other, not able to share drafters and crews, it’s a lot\nharder than when they were on the open sea.”\nKip thought about their problems. The sheer complexity of separating\nyour navy—not even just your army!—with many of them out of sight\nbehind the mass of Big Jasper, trying to coordinate any attack, with no way\nto fix the little problems, meant that little problems could get big. Fearful\nsubordinates waiting to make decisions, commanders unreachable who\nwould have been easily found if they’d been on land—an amphibious"

And, you know, stuff goes wrong. I think we can take a glimmer\nof hope at seeing that though the Blood Robes are monstrous, they aren’t\ndiabolically perfect. If they were…”\n“If they were…?” Tisis asked.\nIf they were, they’d have hit us right after dawn with a first attack on the\nbay as the Order attacked. They’d have hit us with a fear hex.\nIt was still a good plan, but now the main problem for the Blood Robes\nwas all the Chromeria’s gun emplacements, especially on the towers, which\ndue to their height could lob shells and cannonballs farther than any of the\nBlood Robes’ ships could return them.\nHe cursed. “Orange isn’t going to join the attack; it’s going to lead it. A\nfear hex. Something like that. They’re gonna try to sneak it up on us\nsomehow.” He squinted against the blinding orange light of the sun rising in\nthe east.\n“The rising sun,” he said. “They’re using…”\nAnd then it was nearly upon them.\nThin, mysterious fingerling clouds had been streaking along the tops of\nthe waves, hidden by the dazzling sun and to-and-fro of the sea chariots\nthrowing water high into the air, burning torches that hissed smoke out in a\ndozen colors to confuse the eye.\nA great flock of birds rose suddenly from the Blood Robes’ every ship,\nblack against the rising sun. Another distraction, mostly.\n“Blue spectacles, now!” Kip shouted. “Those’ll be razor wings.” He\nthrew a signal flare into the sky to tell the gun crews on every tower to\nready the nets they’d prepared to string up on poles above them to catch the\ndeadly bombardment coming.\nBut Kip’s eyes were again down: those misty fingers hit East Bay’s\nseawall, and sidled over it, slipping past the ships sheltering in the bay.\nKip turned his back to address his people. He didn’t want to see\nwhatever hex was coming. “Remember,” he called out to them, “you cannot\ntrust what you feel; trust what you know to be real. The bane will lie to you,\nso hold to what you know is true. Your brothers and sisters will fight and\nthey’ll die for you. Be not afraid. Be not afraid! Though hell itself march\nagainst us, be not afraid in what you do!”\nWhat the hell? Speaking in rhyme?\nShit! Liv.

But the physical force of the attack was purely\nancillary—the attack itself was the wave of fear blasted over Kip with the\nforce of a tsunami, leaving him breathless and panicked, frozen.\nHis heart was lodged in his throat. They were doomed. This was like\nnothing they’d prepared for.\nThey were all going to die. It was all his fault. He didn’t know the first\nthing about anything. He was just a child, a child in the face of gods. Literal\ngods.\nEverything he’d mocked, everything he’d sneered at was suddenly here\nand more real than he could have imagined.\n“Hey,” a distant voice said.\nKip could hear the war dogs whining.\nHe was going to get them all killed. Everyone. It was too late already.\nThey were already dead. Kip’s heart was seizing in his chest with grief and\ndread as he was enveloped in the soft orangey cloud.\nHe was losing everyone he loved, and there was nothing he could do\nabout it.\nHe heard the clatter of a sword falling from someone’s hand.\n“Hey! The hell is wrong is with you all?” Winsen said.\nSuddenly a hand was rubbing Kip’s face, scrubbing it as if to brush\naway water—or luxin. Winsen’s face appeared in Kip’s sight.\nWinsen, the broken man who’d never really understood danger or\navoiding it. Winsen, the literally fearless, was standing in front of Kip\nlooking puzzled. He had a hand drawn back, preparing to slap Kip.\n“I’m good,” Kip said, coming back to himself. “Get the rest of us. Cwn\ny Wawr!”\nHe turned to them, some on the tower, more below. The handlers were\nalmost as bad off as everyone else on the towers and walls, catatonic. Some\nhad wet themselves. Their war dog partners were whining, alarmed, not\nunderstanding. Some of the dogs licked their humans, and a few of those\nhad been roused by the fearless love of their canine friends.\n“Eyes!” Kip shouted to them. “Their eyes!”\nThe dogs, preternaturally intelligent, understood immediately. Through\ngrowling or tugging or even bracing on their partners’ shoulders and licking\ntheir faces, the dogs dragged their masters’ attention to themselves and\ncleared away the hex. Most people snapped out of the hex immediately, but\nsome seemed broken by the terrors they’d just suffered.\n“Here they come. Everyone!” Kip shouted. “You know what to do!”\nThe White King’s armada was rapidly resolving from a black mass of\nships into individual ranks as the sun rose and as they sailed closer.\nBut all the Chromeria’s ships sheltered by the seawall sat as if dead,\ncrews paralyzed.\nThe gun emplacements were the target, not anyone inland.

Where to have them take shelter—”\n“We agreed not twelve hours ago to cancel this parade—and now I hear\nZymun pulled drafters off the wall and soldiers from their posts in order to\nhave it anyway. And with the Spectrum’s blessing! What the hell were you\nthinking?”\nKlytos wouldn’t meet her eyes, still watching the dawn and the\napproaching armada and the eerily silent cannons below. Woodenly, he said,\n“He came to us directly from the Freeing. He hadn’t washed. He—he was\ncovered in their blood. There was a manic gleam in his eyes. He called it his\ndue. He’s not wrong.”\n“You know he was never to be declared Prism. Andross is going to be\nfurious—”\n“It was his second Sun Day as Prism-elect! And—and if Kip is right and\nthe tower array can be used as a weapon, only a Prism can keep using it for\nany length of time! How long can anyone else live drafting that much\npower?” Klytos asked. The little weasel.\nKarris grabbed his shoulder and hauled him around, forcing him to face\nher. “But the Spectrum doesn’t make a Prism just by saying a few words!”\nA little smile suddenly played over Klytos Blue’s lips, though the mad,\nhopeless gleam never left his eyes. “Oh, I know that,” he said. “Andross\nmanaged to root out most of the Spectrum who know how Prisms are made,\nbut some of us figured it out. We can’t make a Prism anymore, which means\nwe’re all going to die in this battle. But you Guiles always survive the\ncalamities they bring on the rest of us. Not this time.”"

But why take only one when we can get two?”\nKarris slapped him.\nHe crumpled against the wall and cowered.\nShe rubbed her temples, thinking what to do next.\nWild-eyed, Klytos was looking around at the Blackguards. “You all saw\nthat! I’m the Blue. She’s assaulted me! Take her into custody immediately!”\nFrom where he stood at Karris’s left hand, Gill Greyling drawled,\n“Apologies, High Lord, I must’ve been distracted.

Heads shook.\n“I heard something,” one of the new kids volunteered. “Sounded like a\nshit plopping on the floor.”\nTwenty-year-olds, Karris thought.\nKlytos snarled from where he was on the floor, but he was too much of a\ncoward to physically attack a Blackguard. “You should be thanking me!\nYou know what Zymun is!”\nKarris shook her head. She knew what she had to do now. She was\ngonna have to go find Zymun and try to make him do what had to be done.\nThere was no way it was going to end well. She had no authority over him\nnow, and nothing to bribe him with. “Klytos, you fool, you’ve given Zymun\nalmost unlimited power. What’s he ever done to make you believe he’ll use\nit for good?”\nChapter 112\nThe sounds of cannons roaring to life from various towers around the great\nwalls announced the progress of the Cwn y Wawr to Kip’s ears. Those gun\ncrews began their bombardment immediately, their elevation giving them\nsignificantly greater range than the armada.\nThe first shots splashed harmlessly wide or short, but soon the gun crews\nfell back into their training. They’d zeroed their shots on buoys at set\ndistances, and now, even though the Blood Robes had sunk those, the gun\ncrews’ captains had them memorized.\nOdd, Kip thought, how when you were far enough away, the sights of\ndistant timbers exploding and fires billowing from a ship were satisfying.\nBut when up close, one felt only awe at the destructive power of humanity,\nand horror at the bloody carnage and shrieks of the limbless dying that\nattended every successful shell, the innocent crews being dragged to their\nwatery rest.\nThe men pulling those oars were surely prisoners of war. Allies. Friends.\nMen whose names had once been posted on Big Jasper’s lists as lost.\nYet Kip couldn’t hate the gun crews when they shouted with joy after a\nsuccessful shot.

Netting hung above every gun\ncrew, and archers and musketeers armed with blunderbusses were posted\nwith them.\nSome of the will-cast birds were shot out of the sky. Others made it to\nthe nets, tangling in them before exploding or bursting into flame.\nA musketeer drawing a bead skyward on an incoming razor wing\nstepped backward into a cannon’s line of fire just as the gun crew, looking\nout to their own distant target, touched the linstock to the breech. Kip cried\nout, but they were too far away, there was too much noise.\nThe woman simply disappeared in the black-powder cloud that bellowed\nfrom the cannon’s muzzle.

Or Kip hoped it was luck, as\na tower top exploded a hundred paces away.\nThe Chromeria’s army—here mostly Kip’s people, selected because they\nwere battle-hardened—immediately jumped to the labor of trying to salvage\nguns from the emplacement that had been blown to pieces, working in the\ngore and slime of a crew exploded by shell. The teams were all arranged for\nthis, ready to determine what large guns could be salvaged, ready to wheel\nin and set up smaller cannons or use teams of oxen to lift cannons that had\nmerely fallen when shell demolished tower foundations and the like.\nBackup gun crews waited a safe distance from the front lines, jittery,\nwanting a chance to fight, but knowing that when their chance came, it\nwould be because that spot they were to step into was a target whose range\nand position had already been found.\nThis was to be a marathon with no end until victory or nightfall or death.\nFalling behind meant that the armada would make landfall, and the\nBlood Robes making landfall would be the beginning of the end.\nBut now, despite all the defenders’ work, it looked like it was about to\nbegin anyway.\nThe withering fire had grown sporadic as supply lines were stretched,\npowder stores exhausted.

As the armada approached, caoránaigh swarmed out of the\nwater where they’d been swimming unseen, cast luxin ladders up the great\nlinks, and climbed up like monkeys.\nKip had thought they’d be clumsy out of the water. Great.\nA few of Kip’s best marksmen—joined in this by many of the\nBlackguards’ Archers—picked off dozens, but there were always more of\nthem, and with their swimming abilities, even the charges dropping off into\nthe sea was little more than a setback. Eventually, the wights packed\ncharges against the links of the chain, swinging and swaying dangerously,\nand set fuses.\nA few wights jumped back into the water too late and were killed by the\nexplosions, but the great chain fell, having slowed the Blood Robes for only\nminutes.\nNow there were only big guns to demolish the ships.\nKip sent a message that they should deploy sharpshooters and Archers\non the other side of Big Jasper in case the wights did the same there, and\nthen he gathered his army.\nThe orders and reports didn’t stop simply because the battle had been\njoined in earnest.\nThrough the fires and flames, the armada limped into the bay, the first\nships smoking, half their oars broken, decks awash with blood.

The people,\nmilitary and civilian volunteers both, had been briefed on exactly what to\ndo. No orders from the rear were even going to make it to them now.\nLike all battle plans, it didn’t go as planned.\n“Turns out High Luxiat Amazzal went down there himself, with a cane.\nHe was beating men left and right as he reprimanded them. Quite\nimpressive, I’m told.”\n“Good, good,” Kip said.\nBrave fools up and down the length of the seawall stayed at their gun\nemplacements rather than retreating, as if to erase their early paralysis by\nstaying and firing until the bitter end.\nThere was no way to save them. Once the armada touched the seawall\nitself, wights and drafters tore through the stakes and spikes and fire traps\nand other passive defenses and mounted the top of the wall with frightening\nspeed.\nThey poured down the length of the seawall like oil wicking up a\nlantern, dyeing it with their own colors and the red of blood as they\nmassacred the gun crews one after another. One crew set off an explosion\nwith the last of the black powder.\nThe smoke lasted longer than the obstacles did. The drafters lay great\nplanks of luxin down on the flames and debris, and their men charged right\nover it.\nKip saw combined forces of drafters and nondrafting soldiers used in\nways that he swore the White King must have learned from him.\nBut even as the Blood Robes were wicking toward the killing field\nwaiting for them at that end of the docks, the rest of the armada had pushed\ndeep into the bay itself. Some of the sailors made the same kind of last\nstand, but mostly their cannons had been arrayed in such a way that they\ndidn’t have the angle to shoot in toward the city, and the men retreated as\nthey were supposed to, if not quite in the good order one might hope. Some\nwere trampled by their panicked fellows, or torn off the plentiful ladders at\nthe walls so that some vicious ally could reach the top a heartbeat earlier.\nThey weren’t Kip’s men, and he hadn’t been here long enough to even\nstart instilling discipline in these civilians, but it was still a helluva thing,\nwatching men be killed by their friends.\nAnd there was nothing to be done about it.\nThe big guns on the walls kept pounding the armada, which was all\nrafted together now. Ships that should have sunk were instead buoyed up by\ntheir fellows. It was probably a waste of powder, although it did help bait\nthe trap.\nAs more of the armada pressed against land and the docks and the\ntethered ships that had been the Chromeria’s artillery, more and more men\ncharged out, making a beachhead."

        "text": "the trap.\nAs more of the armada pressed against land and the docks and the\ntethered ships that had been the Chromeria’s artillery, more and more men\ncharged out, making a beachhead.\nWhat struck Kip was that it was almost all men. Not drafters. Not\nwights.\nThe pagans had achieved an almost perfect inversion of the Chromeria’s\nvalues: in battle the Chromeria would save its people by spending those\nwho had gone wight and the drafters closest to breaking the halo first,\nbecause those were closest to death or insanity. The Blood Robes were\nsaving their wights and drafters by spending their people, because their\npeople were farthest from magic and godhood.\nAll the White King’s promises of freedom and of a new order, a utopia\nwhere all would be made right, were belied.\nFor the Chromeria, the privileges of power were paired with prices.\nDrafters were expected to stand in the first line of defense, as the\npromachos did. Human nature being what it is, they didn’t always do so, but\nthat was the deal, the expectation. By contrast, the nine kings would happily\nrule a wasteland, if they could rule.\nOrholam damn them.\nHow many of these invaders about to die just wanted a better life, or\nhadn’t dared to stand against the White King when his armies had marched\nthrough their lands and had pressed them into his armies? They weren’t\nquite innocent, but they were men, not monsters. They deserved a second\nchance, and Kip couldn’t afford to offer them one. Not right now.\n“Still not time to go?” Ben-hadad asked. He’d come back, as had others\nof the Mighty.\nKip looked around again, though he still didn’t know what he was\nlooking for. “No.”\nThey’d pushed in far enough. Thousands of men were clambering over\nthe moored ships and onto the docks, between the boathouses and\nwarehouses.\n“Raise the red,” Kip commanded.\nThe men had been waiting for it. They raised a red flag, and\nimmediately, the cannons atop the walls began firing incendiary shot at the\nChromeria’s abandoned ships and docks still moored within the bay.\nPyrejelly had been drafted into barrels and hidden away yesterday. The last\norder for all the sailors abandoning their ships was to open those barrels and\nsplatter it about.\nThe Blood Robes had surely suspected fire, but they expected nothing as\nferocious as the holocaust that swept in upon them.\nThe men and women of Big Jasper stood agape, watching a spectacle\nsuch as they would never see again if they lived a hundred years. The\nintensity of the flames was matched only by the intensity of the screams as\nevery dock, every ship, and the whole length of the seawall went up in\nsudden flames. In a few places, the incendiary luxin hadn’t been set or had\nfailed, but it didn’t matter. The flames jumped gaps and burned everything.\n“Fire crews ready?” Kip asked.\n“Yes, sir. Watching the wind carefully and spread out appropriately.\nLooks like it’s in our favor.”\nOne of the worst things about commanding was that sometimes you see\nwhat’s going to happen some minutes hence, and you know how to stop it,"

        "text": "Looks like it’s in our favor.”\nOne of the worst things about commanding was that sometimes you see\nwhat’s going to happen some minutes hence, and you know how to stop it,\nand there’s time to stop it, but your people won’t listen to you.\nSuch was the commander of the armada’s plight.\nKip could see him waving his arms and screaming. The drafters had\nmade his situation much worse by connecting the ships. With no\nincendiaries aboard, the floating-island armada caught fire far more slowly\nthan the docks had, but they were lashed together. They couldn’t push apart\nfrom one another to make gaps too large for the fire to pass. The ones at the\nback were having great difficulty breaking free to retreat.\nAfter a few minutes, though, he rallied enough drafters and officers, and\ncut deep, setting a fire line where he gave up fully a quarter of his fleet. At\nthis line, they would break away from the island and abandon all those on\nthe side nearer to Big Jasper.\nIt was what Kip had been waiting for.\n“Catapults, go,” Kip said. The crews knew where to aim.\nCatapults. Who used catapults in the age of gunpowder? It was one of\nCorvan’s discoveries when he did a personal inventory of the Jaspers’\ndefenses. They’d been kept for decades beyond their obsolescence by\nCarver Black, who couldn’t bear to sell them off for a pittance for lumber,\nyet hadn’t been able to replace them all on the meager budget he had to buy\ncannon.\nThe catapults now hurled barrels of red luxin and sub-red charges\nskyward and onto the armada—behind the lines where all the drafters and\nofficers were working. They exploded in the air, or even in the water,\nflinging pyrejelly everywhere on the ships and even floating on the waves.\nSuddenly, those people, the only ones on the armada under control and\nnot panicking, had fire before them and fire behind. They were cut off.\nKip and Corvan had expected to get a quarter to a third of all the\nattackers—though only half of the armada had attacked this side of Big\nJasper. They’d expected a retreat, and then after the fires died down, a\nsecond attack later in the day. They’d arranged killing grounds and lines of\nretreat, choke points and ambushes.\nThey weren’t going to be using any of those. Not on this side of the\nisland. With the fires still roaring and men still screaming their despair and\npain, Kip sent half his army to the other side of the island, and a messenger\nto High General Danavis asking for orders.\nMost of the observers didn’t realize it yet, but there would be no fighting\non this side of Big Jasper for at least a few hours. They’d already won the\nfirst round here. This part of the armada was dead. The poor bastards just\nhad to decide if they went by fire or water.\nThe rest of the armada wasn’t going to attack here again, not until the\nfires had gone out, not until they could reorganize.\nIt was a great victory.\nBut Kip’s heart was as light as a millstone.\n“What’s he doing?” Ben-hadad asked. He meant Koios."

Karris had told them that\nKoios wanted to burn the whole world down and start over, that he didn’t\ncare how big his losses were, but Kip hadn’t known if he should believe\nthat—calling your enemy’s every failure somehow part of a brilliant larger\nplan was more likely to be paranoia than anything; after all, Koios’s first\nattack could well have succeeded.\nBut maybe paranoia was the right response. Why hadn’t Koios raised all\nthe bane?\n“If he wins with his first assault, he seems invincible in the field,” Kip\nsaid. “But if he loses, and then ultimately wins when he attacks with the\nbane, he shows his future subjects that nothing can stand against his\nmagic.”\nBen-hadad wrinkled his nose. “Or he just loused up the incredibly\ndifficult task of a combined amphibious and magical assault because he met\na strong defense.”\nKip shrugged, admitting that was possible, too. All he knew was that his\nfight wasn’t over; his fight had barely begun. Everything all the Chromeria’s\npeople had accomplished here could be wiped out in a moment if Kip\nfailed.\nBehind Kip, someone cleared his throat.\n“High Lord, I come from Promachos Andross Guile,” a young man\nreported. “He requires your presence at the Chromeria. You are to join him\nat the back dock. He said it has to do with the Lightbringer.”\n“Now?” Kip said. “The plan was that I go to the mirrors next.”\n“There have also been… developments with the Prism-elect.”\nKip swore under his breath. Was Andross actually trying to make good\non his bet? Or was it a trap?\nIt was surely past time for Kip to take over the mirrors. But the\npromachos was the ultimate authority in a war. If Kip was going to start\ndisobeying him now, he’d have to do it for some better reason than simple\ngut instinct.\n“Sir, my apologies,” a young woman interrupted, coming in. “A message\nfrom High General Danavis. He says to send half your men to West Bay.”\n“Already done,” Kip said.\n“Also, he says under absolutely no circumstances should you go to the\nChromeria. There have been developments with the Prism-elect.”\n“What the hell?” Kip asked.\n“Danavis said no more, sir,” the woman said, but her face was pained.\n“But you know more than that. Tell me,” Kip demanded.\n“The Prism-elect had himself declared Prism, and we’ve heard there was\nsome kind of scuffle or, um, skirmish? between Lightguards loyal to Zymun\nand Blackguards loyal to the White.”\nKip surveyed his Mighty: goofy Ferkudi, now grim; Winsen,\nlanguorous; Ben-hadad, intense; Big Leo, sinisterly smirking. They would\nfollow him to hell and back. Only Kip couldn’t promise the ‘back’ part, not\ntoday.\n“Well, obviously, High General Danavis has the right of it,” Kip said.\n“It’s madness to go to the Chromeria and charge into some situation we"

Lucidonius grunted, tried to butt his head against\nGavin’s cheekbone, but with their closeness, he couldn’t get any force into\nit.\n“You think I don’t know?” Gavin demanded.\nLucidonius only drove him in a circle with little steps.\nThe sun had swollen fat with the day’s many injuries. It limped now\nalong the last of its lonely path home, hemorrhaging gouts of light,\nspattering streaky cirrus clouds with arterial glory, seeking some safety, but\nits horizon-home held only its warm, waiting deathbed.\nLucidonius said nothing. His eyes were dimming with the dimming of\nthe sun, and though they still burned, Gavin’s gamble was paying off:\nLucidonius was weakening.\nHe fought with merely a man’s strength now, while Gavin swelled\nstronger. From beneath the smooth skin of his practiced social proprieties,\nthe day’s battle had made his long-sunken veins of rage jut forth,\ndeclaiming his righteous fury at the god who lied.\n“The mirror!” Gavin snarled. They were within a few steps of it.\nLucidonius had ever angled them back toward it, over the course of the\nyear’s longest day. “I know what it is.”\nHe was a black drafter. Born that way. Born special. To have that ability\nwasn’t a curse. Nor a blessing, either, for to call it a blessing assumed there\nis one who gives the blessing. This simply was, an accident of birth or\npropitious parentage or both. It was simply another way Gavin was\ndifferent, better than others, yes, he’d not be afraid to say it now. Better, but\nalso isolated from them thereby. He was also unhappier than those blind,\nthose deceived.\nHis way was harder. He could see what others couldn’t—that wasn’t\nfair. But now, through the black gem—which was nothing less than a\nphysical manifestation of all that made Gavin Gavin—he saw that the\nmirror itself was an elaborate trap for him. The godling had come from the\nmirror. It was a portal to his home. It was where he had power.\nGavin said, “It’s not just mockery, is it? It’s much—”\nLucidonius must have thought Gavin would push into his home. Gavin\nwould invade, to try to find what had given Lucidonius the power of a god\nand take it. But the god would have all his defenses in there.\nThe mirror would be where Gavin could be trapped, slain.\nGavin took some breaths as Lucidonius shifted his grip on a sweaty\nshoulder, trying to get some advantage. “It’s even more insidious than that,\nisn’t it?”\n“You see punishment where there is mercy,” Lucidonius said, as if"

You’ve arranged this! It’s all perfectly designed for me. Even\nyou. Your appearance itself! I’m the Prism! You think I don’t know what an\nelaborate deception looks like?!”\n“On the contrary.” Lucidonius breathed raggedly into his ear. “You are\nthe very son of deception. And it’s time for that to end.”\nAnd then he collapsed.\nGavin staggered into him, and then over him, tripping and tumbling over\nthe man. But Lucidonius grabbed his leg as Gavin fell, and wrenched on it,\ntwisting to slam him into the ground.\nThere was a strain and shooting pain as Gavin’s hip almost popped out\nof its socket, but Lucidonius’s hands slipped. Gavin’s back hit the ground,\nand Lucidonius was pulled off balance. His grip had now slid down to\nGavin’s foot. But he didn’t let go. He was pulled down, losing his balance,\naiming a knee—\nGavin caught him with both feet.\nThen he launched the man off him toward the mirror, kicking both legs\nas hard as he could.\nLucidonius slammed into the Great Mirror, and the entire surface\nwobbled and deformed. His whole body seemed to sink into it a little.\nInstead of leaping for the sword, Gavin leapt forward, trying to press his\nadvantage. He punched Lucidonius in the stomach, but the muscles there\nwere taut, tensed for the impact. Gavin’s left-handed uppercut missed its\nhuge swing at Lucidonius’s chin, and he stumbled forward.\nTo avoid even touching the mirror, Gavin slammed his forearm into\nLucidonius’s chest in order to regain his balance. But as the mirror rippled\nonce from the force of Lucidonius’s back smacking into it again, rather than\ntrying to break free, the man hugged Gavin’s forearm to his chest.\nHe rolled sideways, trying to throw Gavin into the mirror.\nGavin threw up his right hand to stop himself—\nOnce, on a bitterly cold morning in the mountains of Paria when he was\nfirst Prism, Gavin had followed the blue wight he was hunting out onto a\nfrozen pond. Ever since a blue had murdered his brother Sevastian, he’d\nalways held a special hatred for them. It had made him foolish that day. The\npond was a trap. The wight’s magic had strengthened the ice—for himself.\nGavin would never forget the feeling of the ice holding his hesitant first\nsteps easily, but then flexing under his weight, and suddenly buckling.\nHis magic had saved him that day.\nHe had none now. Slapping his hand against the mirror felt exactly the\nsame as the ice had felt that day. Where for Lucidonius the mirror seemed\ngelatinous, forgiving, for Gavin it was frozen, momentarily stable. His hand\nstopped, held his weight from an icy plunge as his palm tingled, bits of\nlightning shooting up his forearm, enervating it.\nThe mirror cracked under his hand like the sound of a musket shot.\nGavin snatched his hand away. The mirror was a death trap. Lucidonius\nwanted to obliterate him."

He’d been distracted mere seconds, but it had\nbeen seconds too long.\nBut then he saw something worse than seeing his foe armed: Lucidonius\nturned. His eyes were coals now, still-hot mirrors of the descending sun, but\nno longer so blindingly bright that they obscured what his face looked like.\n“Fuck you!” Gavin roared at the sight of that face. “You want me to\nthink I’m losing my mind!”\n“Again,” the man said quietly.\n“Yes, again! You drove me to madness once, Orholam. Your lies. You\ncost me everything! And now, now you come back?!” Somehow, Gavin\nslipped from addressing the godling as Lucidonius to Orholam once more.\nIt wasn’t a perfect facsimile, but the god wore a face that could have\nbeen Gavin’s own.\n“I’m not your shadow, Dazen,” the god said. “You’re mine. You are a\ndim reflection of what you could have been.”\n“Lies. From you, Orholam. I took such joy in you when I was a child.\nWhen I was a boy, I thought I was going to be a luxiat, do you know that?\nThe incense. The ceremony. The hymns. I loved it all. Do you remember?\nOr did you even notice me then? And then, after I became Prism, when I\ncelebrated the highest and holiest days, they were bitter gall to me. Because\nI knew! And now you stand, wearing that face like mine, stepping from a\nmirror? As if I fight myself here? As if I’m mad already? But I see clearly\nnow. I am the Black Prism. I am the dark center of creation. And now the\nworld’s light and life will feed me as it has fed you for four hundred years,\nLucidonius. I will be immortal as you are.”\n“I’m not Lucidonius.”\n“It doesn’t matter who you say you are. You have to die. You have to die\nor Karris dies.”\n“You have it exactly backward… brother.”\nThe final word struck Gavin in the stomach, driving the breath from\nhim, and if the figure had moved then, he could’ve slain Gavin easily.\nNo, this was a nightmare, the way the giant fist coming down to crush\nhim had been from that earlier dream. Gavin must be feverish. He must be\nmad.\nNo! No. He was here. This was real.\nSo this was all calculated. It was a trap.\n“You’re not Orholam,” Gavin said. “And you’re nothing like my brother.\nDon’t make me laugh.”\n“Usually, we mortals don’t get to serve as messengers,” the man said as\nif Gavin hadn’t spoken. “But He was making an exception for one brother.\nAnd we Guiles can be very persuasive.”"

Gavin would have one\nsmall opportunity here. Grinwoody had proven himself patient above all\nthings, so he wouldn’t be impatient with all his plans on the line. He\nwouldn’t kill Karris before sunset. He wouldn’t even kill her at the very\nmoment of it, surely, as if he were a timepiece. Surely he would wait, if\nonly a few long moments, to see if all his plans might still work out. To see\nif Gavin might yet come through.\nOr so Gavin had to hope.\nThere would be a few moments soon, just after sunset, where\nLucidonius would be at his very weakest. Gavin would wrest the blade\naway then, and kill him, whether or not he’d told Gavin how to ascend to\ngodhood.\nKarris was worth Gavin delaying godhood.\nShe was worth Gavin losing it.\n“You have the sword. I’m at your mercy,” Gavin said. “Surely now you\ncan tell me how you ascended.”\n“Are you waiting only for sunset, or do you hope to delay me until full\ndark?” the god asked. He seemed amused at Gavin’s attempts. “That is\nquite a long time from now, on the longest day of the year. What’s your\nplan?”\nNot stupid, Lucidonius.\n“I don’t think I need full dark,” Gavin said. “A little more and I’m going\nto take that blade from you and ram it through your heart.”\n“It wouldn’t be the first time,” the god said, looking mournfully at the\nblade.\n“Nice try,” Gavin scoffed. “I mean, as guesses go. I suppose all that\nblack luxin at Sundered Rock messed up even your vision, huh? I didn’t use\nthe Knife to kill Gavin.”\nLucidonius shook his head. “It must be exhausting, seeing lies and\nschemes everywhere. But I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.

Father’s not remotely superstitious.”\n“Where you turned your shame in, he has turned it out on the world. But\nyou, brother, do you think that when Orholam’s Eye sets, that He can no\nlonger see?

Peace. I never said I was Gavin.”\n“You just—” Gavin suddenly couldn’t breathe as the implication of\nLucidonius’s words slipped through his defenses like a knife between a\nchild’s ribs.\nThe godling said, “This is how I would’ve looked now, had I lived. You\nneeded to exhaust your rage, fighting all through the day, so I begged for\nthe duty. I didn’t expect to get it. But then I worried that the young face of\nhim you loved so well might push you to madness.”\n“No.” Gavin wouldn’t allow this. “Not him.

Take off that face! And you stop\ntalking right fucking now,” Gavin said.\n“There’s work yet to do, big brother. And only just time enough for it.\nThe sun sinks, and your son is dying.”\n“Don’t you—see?! This is exactly what I was talking about! You throw\nmore and more at me, hoping to confound me. Hoping to get me tangled up,\nhoping to distract me from—”\n“It’s not your fault.

He retreated, stunned back\ninto recognition of their fight and the blade and the peril he was in.\nBut ‘Sevastian’ made no move to attack, nor even to close the gap\nbetween them.\nGavin came down with the blade in his right hand, without his adversary\nso much as attacking. He was so stunned that his adversary had given up\nevery advantage that they’d fought for throughout the entire, long day that\nhe nearly forgot his rage, Guile though he was.\n“Before any of us were born, father came to believe he was the\nLightbringer,” Sevastian said.\n“Stop it now,” Gavin said. “I have the monopoly on the madness here.”\n“He thought only he could save the world. That he was the most\nimportant person in history.”\n“Well, that much does sound like father,” Gavin admitted.\n“He thought that if he didn’t save the world, no one would. He laid out a\npath, and as he always did, he pushed through every obstacle. But one time,\nhe got outmaneuvered, outplayed at the great game. High Lord Ulbear\nRathcore saw the size of father’s ambition. Before father was even on the\nSpectrum, Rathcore pushed an obscure rule change about the Prism\nsacrifice through the Spectrum that he thought would stop father’s\nambitions.”\nUlbear Rathcore? Gavin had barely known the older man, only that he\nresigned from the Spectrum and left the Chromeria around the time when\nhis wife, Orea Pullawr, had become the White. That was decades ago. Orea\nhad only spoken of him with fondness, which had seemed odd, given that\nthey’d lived apart for as long as Gavin could remember. Rathcore had never\neven visited the Chromeria again, and as the White, Orea couldn’t leave it.\n“Wait. What? What? The Prism what?”\n“Centuries ago now, Vician was the last true Prism. Born, not made. But\nwhen it came time to step down and surrender his powers, he murdered his\nsuccessor instead. And then he murdered all those he could find with the\ngift, renewing his own powers—for a time—with theirs. He cowed and\nbought off the Magisterium and the Spectrum, and they helped him, rather\nthan fighting him. But true Prisms stopped being born, even after Vician\nwas gone. Some say those with the gift were still being born, but that a\nfaithful luxiat had used black luxin to destroy the knowledge of how to find\nthem. Others said it was Orholam’s own punishment for the Magisterium’s\nfaithlessness.\n“But by repeating Vician’s murders, the Magisterium found they could\nmake a Prism, and instead of an outsider upending their power every\ngeneration, they could choose one of their own to be the new Prism, which\nthey liked very much indeed. Unfortunately, unlike a true Prism’s powers,\nthis made-Prism’s powers would fade over the course of at most seven"

Unfortunately, unlike a true Prism’s powers,\nthis made-Prism’s powers would fade over the course of at most seven\nyears. They knew what they made was a fraud, but some thought if\nOrholam wouldn’t save the world from the luxin storms and warring gods,\nthey would do it themselves. So they renamed their murders sacrifices.\nThey found when they sacrificed adults, it might take dozens to fill a single\njewel of the Blinding Knife with a color. It was as if days of life and power\nwere being transferred. Then one had the diabolical idea to sacrifice a child,\none whose gift for drafting had just awakened. And to the world’s sorrow, it\nworked. Perhaps it was yet another test for the High Magisters: would they\nstoop so low?\n“Of course they did. With a child, they’d get a full color from one\nmurder, sometimes two. And it was so much easier to hide the death of one\nchild, separated from her parents for tutelage at the Chromeria. A sudden\nillness, the High Luxiats would claim. With all the influx of pilgrims around\nSun Day—often bringing the ill, hoping to be cured—who would notice the\ndeaths of seven or ten children every seven years? The High Magisters\nnever chose their victims from important families. Like predators, they\nhunted the weak and outcast children, the friendless ones. As if Orholam,\nwho commands the exalted to bring succor to the lowly, would have them\nbring death instead.”\nThe pieces were snapping together for Gavin. He remembered some of\nhis mother’s last words now. She had told him, with a peculiar intensity,\n‘You are a true Prism.’ He’d thought she meant he was a good Prism, that\nhe served well, despite the fraud of replacing his brother.\nShe would’ve known he thought that; she would’ve intended it. She’d\ngiven him a piece, knowing he would remember it, believing that he would\nput it in place when the time came.\nAnd it fit. Perfectly.\nHis chest felt banded with iron. He couldn’t get enough air.\nHe remembered bafflement among the older High Luxiats and the High\nMagisters as his seven-year anniversary of being Prism had approached. He\ncould tell they expected something from him, and fearing to give them the\nwrong response, he’d given them none. Was he supposed to have been\nbuying their allegiance, so that he could renew his reign? Was he supposed\nto react with dread?\nGavin’s ignorance must have seemed feigned to them.\nMeanwhile, Andross Guile had been removing or buying the silence of\neveryone who knew. And if the High Magisters and High Luxiats figured it\nout, what were they to do? Move against the first True Prism in centuries?\nOrholam’s own blessed? His coming saved them from another round of\nmurders—and to open the secret would be to reveal their own guilt.\nAnd doubtless Felia had been working her own magic, too, to protect\nher last living son. She’d had men killed for him, she’d confessed to him.\nFelia, who was never fierce, except for when she was defending Gavin.\nTheir power was built on the murder of children, every seven years? No"

        "text": "Felia, who was never fierce, except for when she was defending Gavin.\nTheir power was built on the murder of children, every seven years? No\nwonder so many Prisms had only lasted through one term, or been driven\nby shame into drunkenness and self-destruction.\nIt had been a cancer in the very heart of the Chromeria.\nChildren?\n“But the Freeing,” Gavin said. “Surely a sip of power a hundred times\nover would equal the full gulp? Surely they could have used all those…”\n“Sometimes. For certain colors, as long as they had the Blinding Knife.\nBut those drafters who come to be Freed have almost nothing left of their\npower. They have none to give. The children selected for the sacrifice—one\nlightsplitter, and one or two for each color—were always confined in a\nspecial ward in the infirmary just before Sun Day. They were drugged so\nthat they would feel ill. When a particular child’s color wasn’t required, she\nwould simply recover from her ‘illness,’ and never know how close she had\ncome to death.”\nSo that was why father needed the Blinding Knife. It was what\ntransferred the power. And this was why they’d always tried to select\nPrisms who were already polychromes—fewer colors needing transfer\nmeant fewer murdered children. But the Chromeria cared about installing\nmen or women from the right families more. They’d told themselves they\nkilled the innocent to save the innocent of all the Seven Satrapies… but\nthey’d killed the innocent to serve their ambitions, too.\n“Who knew all this?” Gavin asked.\n“Those at the very top. The circle was kept very tight. Any luxiat who\ndidn’t show enough moral flexibility to ignore matters of doctrine for\nmatters of political necessity was derailed long before he could rise high\nenough to endanger them all. And the Spectrum has always been made up\nof political creatures. Most of them didn’t even see it as an existential\nhypocrisy: to keep themselves and everyone else safe, they were happy to\ntrade the lives of a few poor slaves, or commoners’ children; whom they\nsaw as hardly better. Most of them kept the secret simply because they\nthought its discovery would at worst make them look a bit heartless.”\nGavin had thought himself the worst man in leadership at the\nChromeria, an unparalleled deceiver. But they were all liars, black hearts in\ncolored robes.\nPerhaps that revelation should have been a relief. It was quite the\nopposite.\n“You said… you said father got outflanked. What was the rule? What\nwas the change?”\nBehind the creature that called itself Sevastian, the spiderweb of cracks\nfrom Gavin’s fist had spread up the mirror like sin. Cracks now reached\nnearly to the top of the Great Mirror and to every edge.\n“The new rule was that no one could serve on the Spectrum while an\nimmediate family member also served, in any capacity, whether as Color or\nPrism or promachos or the White or the Black. Everyone liked that, because\nOrea’s name had been put forth several times to become the White, and\npeople feared what she and Ulbear might do together. By tradition, such\nrule changes are required to have contingencies, in case an unforeseen\nemergency requires it, so Ulbear proposed a contingency that simply"

By tradition, such\nrule changes are required to have contingencies, in case an unforeseen\nemergency requires it, so Ulbear proposed a contingency that simply\nseemed outrageous. If two family members wished to sit in such high\noffices simultaneously—which at the time only applied to Ulbear and Orea\n—they had to supply one of their own children for the Prism sacrifice.”\nAnd then Gavin saw it coming, like the windup to a gut punch, when his\narms were bound and there was no defending himself.\nThe man went on. “Father didn’t even learn who’d pushed that rule\nthrough for years. No one thought it would apply to anyone but Ulbear\nRathcore ever again. He resigned to let Orea join the Spectrum, thereby\ncementing the precedent, binding it into law and tradition both.\n“But for father’s plans, Gavin had to be made Prism, and father could\nonly protect him if he himself were on the Spectrum, too. Father believed\nthat the prophecies indicated he could only become the Lightbringer if he\nwere the promachos first. So the price for father’s ambition—and, he\nthought, the price to save the whole world—was that he sacrifice his sons.\nOne to die after his term as Prism, and one…”\nAnd then Gavin remembered it again, vividly. That wound on his little\nbrother’s chest. A single thrust, at an angle that had always seemed wrong.\nIt wasn’t the perpendicular angle of an intruder stabbing a child lying flat in\nhis bed. It was an angle downward, through the ribs to the heart. As if the\nchild had knelt before an adult, submissive to the blade.\n“Father could only fully save one of his sons,” Sevastian said, gently, as\nthe dying sun finally touched the horizon. “He chose you.”\nChapter 114\nKarris watched the pagan armada approaching her beloved isles from her\nbalcony. Her young luxiats, many of them now trained in rudimentary\nbattlefield medicine, were awaiting her orders for where to deploy. She\nwould be joining them as soon as the battle began in earnest with a large\ncontingent of Blackguards. They would be medics and helpers to any\ncivilians caught up in the fighting, doing the unseen work of making war\nslightly less hellish.\nThen, if they saw a place where they were needed, she and the\nBlackguards could at least give one hammer blow of reinforcement.\nShe had a slim hope that that wouldn’t be necessary today.\n“High Lady,” one of Karris’s room slaves said, a young woman, round\nand shy. “The new Prism has taken the roof and installed himself on the\nbalancing array. He’s, he’s using the mirrors to kill people.”\nThat answered the question of where the hell Zymun was, though it\nwasn’t the answer she wanted. “Well, that’s a relief.”\nThe girl looked ill. “Yes?… But… he seems not very careful in who he’s\nburning? He’s laughing, Mistress. He cut through our lines, must have\nkilled a dozen men. Just said oops, and laughed and laughed. He’s talking to\nsomeone who isn’t there. He’s bragging that even the immortals serve him\nnow.”\n“Have the Blackguards seen this?” Karris asked. Though no current"

Though no current\nBlackguard had ever done it, they were sworn to kill Prisms if they became\na danger. Not that any Blackguard would expect to have to do it on a\nPrism’s first day.\n“No, Mistress. They’re all stationed farther out, as if he doesn’t trust\nthem. Only the Lightguards are near him.”\nSo they might not know.\nKarris cursed under her breath, but it was loud enough to further scare\nthe young girl, who had some idea of the gravity of the situation she’d\nfound herself in.\nAs she tucked pistols into her waistband behind her back, Karris said,\n“Why don’t you go to your quarters for a while? Go see your friends or\nfamily. It may not be safe for you here.”\nThe Blackguards were sworn to the Prism first of all. Technically, they\nhad an equal duty to the White, but if Karris initiated violence and they\ndidn’t believe Zymun was mad… they would put down the threat. Many of\nthe old hands hated Zymun and would want to side with Karris, but what\nwould they think their duty was? And what would the new kids do?\nKarris rolled her neck and checked her ataghan and the old scorpion\nheld tight against her forearm. She was resplendent in her white-and-gold\nsilk directly over her mirror-armor breastplate. It was the only practical part\nof her armor. She had no helm at all; instead her hair had been dyed in\nmany colors and woven together in braids to show the unity of the\nChromeria, and the white-enameled mail was so light that it probably\nwouldn’t survive more than a single blow—nor would she.\nShe was meant to be seen as ready to fight today, not to actually fight.\nOne last glance toward the shores. Despite the constant cannon fire, the\nbane were getting close.\nKarris had intended to go to the roof and take the White’s escape lines\ndown to get to the battle lines wherever she was most needed, as quickly as\npossible.\nShe wasn’t going to be getting that far.\nZymun was murdering friendly soldiers, for fun. If that was the case,\nwho would definitely be foremost in his sights?\nKip. And Karris. And Andross. And anyone who vexed him in the least,\nbut these first of all, because only they had the power to stop him.\nSo. There it was. She had been so certain that she would die in this fight.\nPerhaps she’d been right. Perhaps she’d only been wrong about the day.\nShe was a warrior. That was why Orholam had selected her. Because she\nwas ready to die.\nMaybe, in order to do what she must, she’d even had to be ready to die\nin dishonor—because what was worse than a mother who killed her own\nchild?\nZymun, son of my shame.\nMaybe all that was preparation for this.\nShe had no more feeling than that. She’d grieved already. She had no\nwish to die, but she wished even less that others would die because she did\nnothing.\nFive paces at most, she thought. Three would be better. Two pistols, just\nin case."

He wouldn’t have forgotten. She’d have to\nhope he wasn’t up there with Zymun.\nShe double-checked her powder and shot, checked that the flints and the\nfrizzen were clean and dry, then practiced her draw of the two pistols from\nher belt. She pulled a crease out of her tunic at the back, cocked the pistols,\nand tucked them back into her belt.\nGavin, you would’ve done this smiling.

But if I hesitate, Zymun may\nmove against me first.\nMy love, I only hope that when you hear of this, you’re proud of me. I\nhope you understand. I hope it matters.\nShe took one last deep breath, and put on a neutrally pleasant face. She\nwas going to need it to get close to Zymun.\nShe opened the door.\nCommander Fisk stood there, his hand raised to knock. His expression\nwas pained. “High Lady,” he said.\nThere were twenty Blackguards with him. At least. Oh, no.\nHe cleared his throat. “High Lady, we’ve come to arrest you. For\ntreason.”\nThere were Lightguards beyond the Blackguards, too.\n“Treason?” she asked.\n“Please don’t make this any worse than it has to be,” he said.\nChapter 115\n“There was a storm that night,” Dazen said, his own voice sounding far\naway. “Mother was away. Father and Gavin were off on one of their\ntrainings, leaving me behind. Again. You know I loved you, but I… I felt so\nleft out. Like I got put at the kids’ table at dinner. But I was supposed to\ntake care of you.”\n“We had a great day,” Sevastian said, “scouting out the ruins of the old\nVarigari manor, where father was building the new house, remember? We\nforgot lunch, and somehow you convinced that tavern owner to give us the\nfull spread? She thought you were so cute.”\n“I forgot about that,” Dazen said. Those events had been overshadowed\nby the night’s.\n“A great day together,” Sevastian said with a smile. “But all day is a\nlong time to be stuck caring for a brother so much younger than you. You’d\nhad no breaks.”\n“You’re trying to let me off easy.”\n“You were mature for your age, but you were still young,” Sevastian\nsaid. “Would you judge any ten-year-old so harshly if it weren’t you?”\nBut Dazen couldn’t even hear him. “The storm was shaking the entire\nhouse.

Like you respected me. Like my word was law, and I’d just\nused my power to crush you. That’s who I am, Sevastian: I’m the one who\nfinds himself in power by accident and then uses it to crush what’s good.”\nThe sun was almost all the way down now, and Sevastian’s eyes were\nmerely warm embers, filled with such compassion that Dazen couldn’t bear\nto look at them.\n“I knew I should go to you,” Dazen said. “But I hardened my heart, and\nI slept. I slept, peaceful as a man without a conscience.”\n“Exhausted, yes. Petty, yes. Even cruel at times, as a child,” Sevastian\nsaid. “But a lack of conscience was never your problem, big brother.”\n“If I hadn’t turned you away… If I hadn’t pushed you out…” Dazen\nsaid.\n“I’d be alive.” Sevastian shrugged.\nDazen flared hot. “What? Like, ‘Oh well’? ‘Shit happens’? Like, ‘Water\nunder the bridge’?!” He could feel the blackness growing inside him, like\nthe black seed crystal in his eye was growing like a twining ivy, climbing\ndown his throat, interlocking with the darkness that had so long lived in his\nheart.\nHe wanted to strike down his brother now with the sword. How dare he\ntrivialize all Gavin had endured? This wasn’t Sevastian. This was madness\nindeed. He—\n“If…” Sevastian said.\n“What?”\n“I’d be alive, if… C’mon, brother. I already gave you this. Show that\nmental flexibility that’s made you the wonder of the Seven Satrapies.”\nBut he hesitated only a moment, and Gavin couldn’t regain his bearings\nso quickly. He could barely disentangle his thoughts from his rage.\nSevastian said, “I’d be alive… if I’d been killed by a blue wight with\nsome grudge against our family. If I were killed by a blue wight, as you’ve\nthought all these years, then your rejection that night cost me my life. Or\nmaybe it would have come and killed both of us. A blue wight would’ve\nbeen able to handle two children, don’t you think?”\nGavin frowned, off balance.\n“Father didn’t take any chances,” Sevastian said. “He could have framed\na groom or a governess for my killing, easily. Instead, he emptied the house\nof nearly everyone through a dozen different errands and excuses. Why else\nwould two young scions of the Guile house be alone? We were never alone."

He told Gavin that if he\nwanted to be great, he mustn’t shrink from his duty.

Hadn’t\nwanted to look longer, maybe.\nNow Gavin sneered at his second self. The figure seemed to flicker,\nseemed to split his head, as if his eyes were sending him opposing visions.\nHe rubbed his right eye, wondering what was wrong with him.\nThrough his dead eye, through the black seed crystal embedded there, he\ncould see himself truly. Only his memory could be so perfect. Or maybe\nthis was how madness felt—normal. He examined himself.\nHere behold Gavin Guile, in all his glory. Ha!\nAs he barked a laugh, aloud, he saw the empty tooth socket where his\ndogtooth had been. He’d broken it out of his own head in his bid to escape\nprison beneath the Chromeria. It had been a longed-for freedom that was as\nmuch a lie as all his years of service. His dogtooth was gone.\nNor was that the last of his deformities. He held up his left hand, as if\nwaving to that loathsome figure: Hey! Looking good! The hand had only\ntwo fingers and a thumb.\nIt—he—was gaunt, one-eyed, hardly more than one-handed, gap-\ntoothed. He, who had been beauty itself. He was revealed, finally, as the\nwretch he had always been. A cripple outside where he’d been a cripple for\nyears within.\nHe’d told himself he was a victim of circumstance, who’d only chosen\nto survive.\nHis heart plummeted.\nThat was all lies, wasn’t it? He’d chosen to pursue his young love Karris\nafter he’d barely met her, knowing his father would be outraged, knowing\nhis elder brother would be furious. He’d chosen to strike the White Oaks\nwhen he was afraid. He’d chosen to keep that gate locked when he thought\nKarris’s lady-in-waiting had betrayed him. He’d not intended for anyone\nelse to die, maybe, but he’d left her to the fire, to die a horrible death.\nGavin hadn’t merely chosen to live; he’d chosen to kill so that he could\nlive.\n‘You know this is wrong! I see it in your eyes!’ a drafter had said to him\non the night of a Freeing, furious, eyes straining his halos.\nHow many times had Gavin heard some variation of those words? At\nevery single Freeing. And often in between.\nGavin staggered. Shying away from looking at his brother, he braced\nhimself on the Great Mirror.\nLike spring ice, the cracked mirror gave way. His hand plunged through\nit.\nA chill shot through his entire body as if his blood were icing over, and\nwhen he ripped his arm back from the mirror’s cold grip, his hand was\ngone.\nHe backed away from the mirror in horror, stumbled—fell.\nCracks spidered from the hole in the mirror toward every edge.\nPushing off the ground, Gavin leapt to his feet, certain some monstrous\nthreat was about to pounce through it at him."

He\ncouldn’t help but glance at his hand. It hadn’t been lopped off; he hadn’t\nlost it… but his flesh and bones had turned invisible; only weird, thick, dark\nveins remained, still opaque. As he turned his wrist, to his color-blind sight\nhis veins were like black thorns waving in the wind, pulsing with a gentle\ndarkness.\nHe flexed the fingers of his glassine right hand. His hand was still there,\nwhatever this illusion was, merely invisible except for the thorns within it.\nUp the mirror’s pure gleaming surface, the cracks shot toward heaven.\nAs they finally touched the top of the mirror and every edge simultaneously,\na boom like thunder shook him and the tower, then modulated with the\nwom-wom-wom of a great temple bell.\nIt was so low it shook his belly and palpated the air in his lungs. The\nGreat Mirror trembled.\nHigh above, over the top of the Great Mirror, blood began pulsing. Not\nspilling down the mirror’s surface as if poured out from a glass, but\npumping, as if each of the myriad hearts Gavin had stilled was waking from\ndeath to condemn him. Rivulets streamed and stuck and raced together\ntoward the ground, widened. The blood doubled and redoubled until not\neven a finger’s width of shining glass remained clean. Like a curtain\ndropping, the blood draped the mirror entire.\nIt draped it red.\nAll the world was black and white… and now red, as if Orholam, who\ngives and takes away, had now given him the cursed gift of seeing his own\ncrimson guilt in vibrant color. In his world of gray and the leeched\nnothingness of white and the triumph of gathering midnight-black, the\nvermilion hues sank into his skull like daggers into his eye sockets.\nRed, everywhere red.\nAnd in the blood mirror, Gavin saw himself again.\nAs every Freeing came around, Gavin had braced himself, and he’d felt\nbad… and he’d done the murdering expected of him. And he’d wept and\nhe’d repented privately and he’d gotten drunk and he’d tried to forget. And\nthe next year, he did it again. Over and over.\nWhat would the Spectrum have done if instead he’d stood up on Sun\nDay and used his platform to declare, ‘This ends now! I will not kill in your\nname. This is evil. It is finished!’\nWhat if he’d spent his life trying to find some other way? Things had\nbeen different before Vician’s Sin; they all knew that. What if Dazen, who\nroutinely did the impossible, had turned himself to the impossible task of\nfixing the Chromeria and the Seven Satrapies?\nInstead, Gavin had spent all his charisma on himself. He’d hidden when\nhe could have fought.\nThe blood reached the bottom of the mirror. It poured out onto the\nobsidian of the tower’s top, rushed past his feet, sticky.\nHe could smell it.\nHe’d been made for more than this. With his natural gifts, Dazen could\nhave been more. Should have been more."

Should have been more.\nHe’d secretly dared to be a god? He’d not even been a man! Alone,\nisolated by his own secrets and shame, he’d become a monster.\nI have nothing to give you, Dulcina Dulceana had said at the Freeing, but\nmy time. Take my five minutes, and rest. She’d been so quiet, so still yet\nwelcoming, her presence had been an enveloping peace, like the warmth of\nhot springs on a chill night.\nHe’d taken her five minutes. Her action: her offer, her sacrifice, and her\nlove, had been beautiful, pure. Where time was the measure of wealth, he,\nthe rich man with many flocks, had taken a poor woman’s last beloved lamb\n—and devoured it before her eyes.\nAnd then he’d slaughtered her. He’d cast from this world that young\nwoman whose very presence was healing. He’d cost the whole world all she\ncould have done.\nHe regarded the broken thing in the Great Mirror. Here was ‘Gavin’\nGuile. Any accusation he could level against his father, any sin of which he\ncould accuse the Spectrum, any cupidity and vice he hated in others, all that\nhe despised, lay living and breathing and strong in him.\nThe climb up the tower was supposed to purge his sins? It had only\nrevealed them. He’d held on to a core of himself, an ambition, a pride. He’d\nheld on to the sword, thinking: Judge me, O God? You dare? I am broken,\nbut I will rise in bitter triumph. I submit to the truth of Your every\naccusation, but soon… I will be God!\nHe looked at the mighty blade in his maimed left hand and transferred it\nto his thorny, strong right. He felt a gathering darkness in the blade that\nechoed the gathering darkness of the night and within him. Gavin was not a\nholy man; he was a man wholly dark. The black sheathing the blade was the\nsame black that had become his left eye, that had burrowed deep. Perhaps it\nwasn’t hiding, as he had thought. Perhaps it was incubating.\nWoe to the world when it hatched.\nIt had spread from his heart throughout his body, reaching even to his\nhands, to the black blade.\nOr perhaps, seed crystal that it was, the black eye had simply titrated all\nthe darkness that was already within him, latent. It wasn’t foreign, alien,\nother. The black was his true self.\nWhat if it is yourself that you fear? Your power?\nHis vision shivered once more, and in the blood mirror through his truth-\nseeing black eye Gavin saw great wings sprouting from his back, unfurling\nwith a crack. He saw his form swelling with power, growing invincible. He\nwould take, and punish, and live. Live forever. What could he not do, given\ntime? He would make all things right. Fix all he’d broken. Even himself.\nBut visible from his mortal eye, the self remained, aghast, ashamed at\nhim.\nTake the blade, and strike—or they will take everything from you! Strike!"

You’ve suffered enough. You deserve this! All can\nbe healed! Rise from ashes, glorious!\nClosing his left eye, he looked once more upon the man in the mirror.\nLips cracked, skin burnt, hair lank, eye patch leering, his whole aspect a\nshadow of a shadow of the glory of his former self. There were only\nskeletal remains of Dazen Guile. He’d killed him. He’d killed everything\ngood. And why? In order to extend an existence he hated?\nWhy would you kill an innocent to give another day to a person you\ndespise? He had failed in every good thing he’d tried to do. He was\nloathsome. Everyone he loved would be better off if he were dead.\nLet this be the end.\nHe braced the hilt of the gun-sword on the ground and set the point of\nthe cruel sword between his fifth and sixth rib. Then he shifted his weight,\nadjusting to get it right.\nOf all the things not to fuck up, falling on your sword had to rate pretty\nhigh.\n“Dazen!” Sevastian said. “Elrahee. Elishama. Eliada. Eliphalet. He\nsees. He hears. He cares. He saves.”\nGavin snorted. “And yet here I am, on His front porch. Knocked on the\ndoor. Hell, I even punched a hole in it! He isn’t here, brother. Never was.\nThis tower’s a monument to nothing. And you’re nothing but my madness.”\n“Dazen, if Orholam came to speak to you in the flesh, you still wouldn’t\nlisten. Didn’t, for your whole climb and for your whole life. But you\nlistened to me. So who’s the right messenger to send to you?”\n“You’re not a messenger. You’re a hallucination.” But tears were\nflowing. He was so ashamed and he could hide none of it now.\n“A hallucination who tells you things you don’t know and kicks your\nass?”\n“Hey, you didn’t kick my ass!”\n“You just don’t want to admit you lost a fight to an eight-year-old boy.”\nFrom its brief levity, Gavin’s heart dropped again.\n“It was supposed to be you, wasn’t it?” Gavin said. “You were the best\nof us. You were supposed to be the Lightbringer.”\nSevastian took a deep breath and pursed his lips.\n“So we’re lost. Father killed the Lightbringer.”\n“Sometimes the wicked win a battle. Sometimes those who hear the call\nsay no to it. Men have power. Our actions matter, even unto eternity. But\nthe ultimate victory is still assured.”\n“We killed the fucking Lightbringer, Sevastian.”\n“A Lightbringer,” Sevastian said. “Perhaps. Or perhaps I, too, would\nhave been turned aside, corrupted, or killed. Who’s to say? What I know is\nthis. If God needed perfect mirrors to bring His light to the world, it would\nbe a world forever dark. Imperfect mirrors also—”\nGavin scoffed, pointing at himself. “Imperfect?! What, you see this as"

What I am.”\n“I see. I see and I’m not turning away.”\n“How can you not?”\nSevastian pierced him with a gaze that combined the best of Felia and\nAndross Guile and yet was somehow fully his own. “Because I love you,\nbrother. I see the you that’s you, under all this. Yes, it’s ugly, it’s disgusting,\nbut you can be more. I know what you can become, even still. There’s still\nwork for you to do.”\nGavin sneered. “Not for me. I’m finished. It’s sunset. I’ve failed my\nmission. Karris is dead by now. I’ve betrayed half the people in my life, and\nfailed all the rest. My time’s up.”\nHe remembered then his dream. In the dream, his hand had looked like\nthis—this thorny, skeletal abomination. He’d been on a tower like this, and\na giant had come striding up to smash him in judgment. Orholam Himself.\nAnd Gavin had known he deserved his fate, but still begged for more time.\nIt had been more than a dream. It had been prophecy.\nAnd had done him just as much good as prophecy usually does.\nHe braced the hilt of the sword on the stones once more. The blood\nwould make it slick.\nHe was so very tired of his lies, and his false bravery, and his false\nfronts, and his falsity on every human axis of virtue. His lies had gutted\nevery word of praise uttered for him, denuded every moment of triumph,\nhamstrung every victory. Now it was time to let every lie die, no matter\nhow precious.\n“You know, for all the awful shit you did,” Sevastian said, “you had\nsome good things about you. Even as Gavin, you were amazingly brave.\nYou would risk your life to do amazing things at the drop of a hat. Not sure\nwhy you’d give that up, right at the end, when you could do the most\namazing thing of all. If you had the guts, that is.”\n“What?”\n“If you’re gonna kill yourself, why don’t you go out like a man?”\n“Huh?”\n“Like you said, the front door’s right there.” He motioned to the Great\nMirror, still streaming blood. “The Mirror of Waking is open. Why don’t\nyou go inside?”\n“It’s a trap,” Gavin said.\n“So what do you care if it is? You climbed all this way to confront God\nHimself, and at His doorstep you’re just going to kill yourself? Really?\nYou’re just going to lie down in the bog and wait for the muck to close over\nyour face? No fighting, huh?” He faked a yawn. “Out of all the things\nyou’ve been called, brother, I never thought at the end you’d opt for\n‘boring.’”\nGavin narrowed his eyes. “Why are you egging me on?”\n“I’m a little brother. It’s what we do.” Sevastian grinned, and if his\nversion of the Guile grin was more innocent than Gavin’s knowing grin, it"

It’s what we do.” Sevastian grinned, and if his\nversion of the Guile grin was more innocent than Gavin’s knowing grin, it\nwas equally mischievous, and more winning. Gavin’s grin had always said,\n‘Look at me, aren’t I wonderful?’ Sevastian’s said, ‘Look at us, aren’t we\nwonderful?’\nEven here, even now, Gavin couldn’t hold on to all of his anger.\n“You’re kind of a dick,” Gavin murmured.\n“I’m a Guile.”\n“That’s what I said.”\n“That’s what I meant.”\nAh. Acknowledging the truth, but drawing the parallel so as to shoot the\ninsult back to include Dazen, who was a Guile as well.\nSevastian was joyfully quick.\nIt made the ache of losing him deepen. Had he lived, Sevastian would\nhave been a peerless friend. A man keen and sharp and strong. The best of\nthe Guiles, surely. If he’d lived, might not his goodness have moored Dazen\nto some integrity?\nThey all would’ve been so different: Gavin, father, mother, and Dazen,\ntoo.\nBut Gavin was staring at the mirror now with something like purpose.\nSevastian was right: he had climbed all this way. He had to know.\nAnd if it cost his life to find out, so much the better. Right?\nBut first…“I’ll lose you if I do this, won’t I?” he asked.\n“For a time,” Sevastian said, his voice low.\n“A long time?”\n“I hope not, for my sake. I miss you. And I hope so for your sake and the\nworld’s.”\nGavin looked at him, as if one last look would tell him if this were all\nreal or madness, but his vision still bifurcated with his two eyes. “All right,\nthen. Delusion… Brother. Whichever. Thank you.” He took a deep breath,\nbut there wasn’t air enough in all the world for him to be ready for what he\nwas going to do next, so he simply said, “Now, enough fuckin’ around.”\nWithout another word, he charged the cage that held the monster he’d\nbeen fleeing for his whole life: he ran at the Great Mirror. His reflected self\n—bloody, crimson, deformed, raw, haggard, and hard—ran at him. They\nscreamed their defiance of each other and their acceptance of death, and\ncrashed into each other.\nChapter 116\n“Would you look at that?” Kip said as the Mighty crested the last hill before\nheading over the bridge to the Chromeria. All around the Jaspers, the bane\nwere now visible, just under the surface, slowly rising, and coming in closer\ntoward the shore every moment, propelled by magic and the will of their\ndark gods.\nBy now all the drafters on the Jaspers had pressed their fingers on\nhellstone to empty themselves of all the luxin in their bodies, and Kip\nshould have been up on the mirror array, even though the bane weren’t\ndoing anything yet.\n“You still with me?” Kip asked. “Even if…?” He didn’t make eye\ncontact with the Mighty.

There were lots of reasons for that. He didn’t want to\ntell them what he’d wagered against it, for one. Tisis wasn’t going to take\nthat well, once he told her—and he would, just not hours before a battle.\nAndross could well refuse to honor his debt, might find some loophole.\nTruth was, he didn’t feel like the most important person in history.\nWinsen said, “We’ve placed our bets. We’re yours, asshole.”\nThat it was Winsen who said it warmed Kip’s heart unexpectedly. He\nnodded to the enigmatic man, his friend.\n“Just wish we coulda done right by Crux before the end,” Big Leo said.\n“Bollocks,” Ben-hadad said. “Fighting for what’s good and right?\nFighting for what we believe in and for each other? We are doing right by\nCruxer and by every other friend we’ve buried in this war. Enough. Let’s\n—”\nThey all stopped talking as above them a sudden beam of light shot from\nthe Great Mirrors atop the Prism’s Tower.\n“What the—” Big Leo said.\n“Zymun,” Kip said. “Bastard. That’s my signal. The one I can’t miss.”\nThey rode across the Lily’s Stem and saw several Lightguards go\nrunning, doubtless to tell their master. Kip and his Mighty and fifty of the\nbest of the Cwn y Wawr and numerous units fortified by Daragh the\nCoward’s men made their way to the grand atrium. Forty Lightguards stood\nin ranks before the lifts, and another twenty before the slaves’ stair entrance.\nThe Lightguards were sweating and pale. Not the best of that august\ncompany. Kip’s men couldn’t help but sneer at them, but one of Andross\nGuile’s secretaries at the mouth of the passage that led out to the back docks\nspoke up, “My lord! High Lord Guile! The promachos awaits you out\nback!”\nKip couldn’t attack those Lightguards, even though he’d heard they’d\nhad some kind of skirmish with the Blackguards. The Lightguards were at\nleast nominally Andross Guile’s men. Attacking them would start a civil\nwar.\nNow was not the time.\nSo Kip simply walked past them. He reached the Blackguards at the gate\nto the passage to the back docks. “The old man back there?” Kip asked.\nThey nodded jerkily.\nKip left the majority of his men there—he didn’t want to get stuck on\nthe wrong side of a choke point. Then he walked through, only Ferkudi and\nBig Leo and a dozen of his best following him.\nThere were Blackguards at the back gate, of course. New people Kip\ndidn’t know. Another two stood on the dock, scanning the water for sea\nwights who might be swimming below. But Andross Guile wasn’t with\nthem.

It’s a stubborn thing, the faith of\none’s youth.”\n“Oh,” Kip said. “I was actually wondering what the word ‘bathetic’\nmeans.”\n“Haven’t Viewed my card yet, have you?” Andross asked.\n“There’s a war on,” Kip said. “Did you not notice?”\n“We have so many things in common, you and I,” Andross said.\n“Some,” Kip admitted. Not many.\n“Both outsiders, both drawn inexorably to the center of all things, both\noverlooked, both with a tenacity to outlast stones and shatter cities. We\napproach life with hearts broken but heads unbowed. We both are\nsurrounded by the mighty. We were both great from our youth: I recognized\nas a young man with a destiny, you… well, that other meaning of ‘great.’\nDepending on how you parse such things, one might say one or the other of\nus has brought down gods. Only you have killed a king, but if today goes\nwell, I’ll add kings to my list, too.”\n“Both wasting our time on a beach?” Kip offered.\n“Odd. Flippancy is a trait of the fearful, not of those who inspire fear.”\n“Do I look fearful to you?”\nAfter a moment, Andross said, “No.”\n“Then can we move this along? I saw the sign you told me to look for. I\nhave places to be.”\n“No, you have one place to be. This place.”\n“Sir?” a young Blackguard interrupted. “Pardon me, High Lord\nPromachos. It’s the Prism, sir. Er, Prism-elect?”\n“Yes?” Andross said, irritated.\n“Commander Fisk wanted me to tell you… He’s, um, the Prism-elect\nthat is—He’s sort of gone crazy, sir? Not like battle exhausted or catatonic,\nsir. He’s using the mirrors to burn people, apparently on purpose. He’s\nlaughing. Our people, sir. The bane are almost to the shore, but he’s mostly\nignoring them. Said it’s like ants under a glass.”\nAndross sighed heavily. “Well, that’s inconvenient, if not a total\nsurprise. Kip, remind me the next time you louse something up that you\naren’t half as bad as your brother.”\n“He’s only my half brother, so there you have it,” Kip said. “What were\nyou hoping he’d do?”\n“Oh, exactly what he’s doing, but half competently.

Young man,” Andross said to the\nBlackguard, “tell Commander Fisk this falls under the Fourth Oath. You’ll\nfind him stationed with our young Prism.”\n“The Fourth Oath, sir, yes, my lord.” But the young man had a panicked\nlook on his face, like he was failing a sudden quiz.\nAndross sighed again. “In the last extremity, your duty to protect the\nPrism is replaced by your duty to protect the Seven Satrapies from the\nPrism. This, you damned fool, is the last extremity.”\n“Oh! Yessir!” the Blackguard said.\nThen he ran.\nKip turned to follow him.\n“Hold,” Andross said. “The bane will come ashore in mere minutes. I’ve\nlookouts posted to let me know the moment it happens.” He pointed up to\nthe orange tower where a man with a hand mirror stood waiting on a side\nbalcony of a tower above them, ready to relay the signal.\n“I don’t understand,” Kip said. “What does it matter?”\n“For one reason—that you can look at two different ways. There was a\nlost prophecy hidden in a forbidden scroll at the Great Library in Azûlay. I\nrecovered it at… great cost to our family, not least yourself. It said the\nSeven Satrapies would be plunged into a thousand years of night if the\nLightbringer didn’t stand on the shores of the Jaspers when the bane made\nlandfall—as in literally where the water touches land. So one way of\nlooking at that is this: if you’re not standing on the shore when the bane\nland, you can’t be the Lightbringer. The other way is that if you are the\nLightbringer, you’d damned well better be standing on the shore, or it’ll\nmean a thousand years of night for all of us.\n“Either way, Kip… when history calls your name, you raise your damn\nhand.”\n“Are you telling me that’s why you’ve been standing down here holding\nyour dick while you could have been stopping Zymun?” Kip demanded.\n“Because of some idiotic prophecy?”\n“He’ll be stopped soon, regardless,” Andross said. “A bet thirty-eight\nyears in the making is about to be decided. The last card flipped. I’m not\nabout to walk away from the table now. Zymun’s nothing. He’s got no\nmoney, no connections, certainly no friends. And very little time left.”\nKip said, “No money? It doesn’t matter who has the money; it only\nmatters who has the guns!”\n“You’re missing the forest for the trees.”\n“One of those trees is on fire!”\n“Kip. This is your last chance. Two minutes.

To have the respect he’d won from a\nfew people be in everyone’s eyes.\nAt the cost of a few extra dead defenders, people who would never\nknow that Kip could have saved them but didn’t. Here’s all you could ever\nwant, and the price for it will be paid by someone else.\n“I do want it. But I want to save my friends more. To hell with your\nprophecies. The Lightbringer can’t be the one who stands around waiting\nfor the light. He’s the one who brings it.”\n“Kip! Grandson,” Andross said to his back, and his voiced seemed\nalmost kind. “If you want to survive up there on the array, don’t draft.\nYou’re no Prism. The power will break your halos in moments. It’ll burn\nyou out. You break our enemies with your will. Earn your name, Breaker.”\nKip glanced back at him over his shoulder, eyebrows drawn down. “As\nmuch as you don’t know me, grandfather… maybe I don’t know you, either.\nFarewell, sir.”\n* * *\nAndross watched as Kip ran back inside.\nVery little of the fat boy he’d once been clung to the man Kip had\nbecome, except his compassion, his loyalty. Andross liked that about him.\nToo bad. His leaving early surely meant that he, too, would ascend the\nheights and fail.\nLight flashed across Andross’s face and he looked up to the signalman\nwith the hand mirror high on the side of the orange towers: The bane have\nmade landfall. That signalman was merely passing along a message from\nanother spotter. It would have taken several moments at each station to\nconfirm the message and then pass it along. Kip might have still been\nstanding on the shoreline at the moment the bane landed.\nInconclusive. How annoying.\nBut, after all, Kip was still only the backup plan. Andross sent a man on\nahead to order his supper sent to his stateroom. It was going to be a long\nday, and he’d need his strength. He’d take a bite to eat and await Kip’s\nfailure before heading up to the mirrors himself."

He tumbled and rolled\nacross bright marble, coming to rest with his head in his arms, bruised and\nbattered and dazed, eyes stinging from the force of the blast.\nBut he wasn’t wet.\nAnd as far as he could tell, he wasn’t dead, either.\nHe moved to push himself up off the ground and saw his arms. Both had\ngone fully invisible, except for those black thorns within them. He sat up to\nhis knees and saw his dream made flesh: the black thorns were everywhere\ntwined through his transparent flesh, everywhere weakening him, wrapped\naround his heart, infiltrating it in such fine threads it turned the sadly\npalpitating, pitiful pink organ gray.\nHe didn’t dare look at the mirror. His whole body was a playground of\njagged dark thorns, and he didn’t want to see it, didn’t know if he could\nhandle loathing himself more.\nOkay, he thought. Maybe I’m dead after all. This could be hell. A very\ntricky introduction to it, what with the bloodfall and the bright colors, but—\nThe colors. They struck him all at once. God damn.\nDazen stood and took in the world. The stone at his feet was white\nmarble, here. So too was everything changed, better. This was like a bright\nreflection of the real world.\nNo, that was exactly backward, he thought; this was the real world, and\nhe’d lived in the dim reflection of it for his entire life.\nThe mirror stood just as tall here as it did atop the tower in his world,\nbut the cataract here poured pure water. It flowed clear and bright and\neverywhere it brought life. Instead of howling, the wind soughed sweetly.\nThe tower itself was shaped somewhat differently, but Dazen lost all\ntrack of his thoughts as he saw the sunset.\nHis heart swelled within its black-barbed cage as he beheld the\npolychromatic miracle of a sunset once again. Here, with the sun just down,\nevery hue wielded the weight of glory.\nA long moment passed before he remembered to breathe.\nFor the first time he could remember since he was a boy, his mind went\nquiet. He turned from wonder to wonder, to see the winking stars brighten\nin their realms, to see the million gradations of color from the blackness of\nthe night yielding to ruddy vitality on the horizon. The cosmos stretched\nluxuriant above him, around him, embracing him.\nHe could stay here forever, watching wonders unfold like the petals of a\nflower opening and opening anew. But then he felt his skin tingling.\nReluctantly, he looked at himself again. Frowned.\nA droplet of the bright water standing suspended on his invisible arm\nsuddenly soaked into the skin, like rain into thirsty soil—and his skin\nblossomed from invisibility into visibility. Everywhere he’d been immersed\n—so, everywhere—Dazen saw his skin not so much reappear as seem to"

Everywhere he’d been immersed\n—so, everywhere—Dazen saw his skin not so much reappear as seem to\ngrow anew at the touch of the water. He held up his left hand, which was\ntingling sharply, and saw his pinky and ring fingers grow afresh from the\nhacked-off stubs the Nuqaba had left him with. He tapped the whole,\nperfect digits with his thumb, bewildered. There was feeling in them.\nHe dropped his hand to his side, though, and felt a flash of rage.\nThis wasn’t real. This could only be some new kind of torture. It was a\ntrap, right?\nAnd now he looked around intently, as he should have from the very\nfirst moment, for his Enemy.\nBut he could see no one else. He circled the tower peak slowly, to see if\nanyone hid behind the mirror.\nThe tower itself looked slightly odd, so once Dazen had assured himself\nthat he was alone, he went to one edge. The tower itself wasn’t black as it\nwas on his side of the mirror. Here it was lambent white, all the way up.\nOn a whim, Gavin went to the side where he’d left the old prophet\nbelow him.\nOf course he wasn’t there.\n“Orholam isn’t here, either,” Gavin said.\nHe suddenly barked a sad laugh. Orholam isn’t here.\nThere’s nothing here.\nIt’s beautiful… and there’s nothing for me here.\nI came all this way, and now I’ve lost everything, and there’s nothing\nhere.\nEvery effort had been wasted. Deluded.\nThen he felt something tingling deep within him. He knew instantly\nwhat it was. It was as if a flame had touched an old black wick. He looked\nup to where the sky was still blue—and drafted blue luxin into his palm.\nThen he did the same with red. And with every color in turn.\nHis gift had been restored.\nBut only to torture him.\nHe sighed out all his hope. He released the colors from limp hands and\ngroaned.\nMaybe he should climb down the tower. Maybe he should try to live\nhere, in this better world, where he was whole. Maybe there were versions\nhere of all the people he had known… though that didn’t make sense.\nSevastian and the old prophet were gone.\nNo. There was nothing for him here. It was perfect, and he was not. No\nmatter that his skin had regrown, he could still feel those black thorns inside\nhis body, sapping his strength, rending his flesh anew with every\nmovement, no matter that here he healed immediately.\nHe’d made it here. Alive. He’d invaded Orholam’s own realm. But he\ndidn’t belong here.\nHe looked at the great waterfall. He knew that when he went through it\nagain, back to his world, he’d lose his fingers and his powers and even his\ncolor vision. Again.\nHe’d thought he might die, invading this realm, and instead he’d found\nlife.

It could be all he had just seen, and\nwas relentlessly not.\nBeauty is possible, but we choose ugliness.\nHe scraped the streaming, steaming, sticky blood from his face, and\neyes, using his hand as a strigil to scrape away all the accusatory gore. His\ntwo fingers were gone again, as he knew they would be. Dogtooth gone. His\nsight once again black, white, and red.\nOf course the red remained.\nHis gift was gone. Of course it was.\nAnd his brother was gone. Sevastian, the one last good thing in this\nworld was gone.\nAnd yet Gavin lived, still. As ever.\nThen he saw a familiar figure. The old prophet was sitting over at the\nedge of the tower, watching the sunset, heedless of the slow cascade of\nblood, sitting in it, apparently unperturbed by the mess. Apparently, the\nbloodfall from above had alarmed the old man and spurred him to make the\nlast bit of the climb to find out what the hell was going on.\nGavin wondered how big the gap had been when Orholam had jumped\nit. Probably small. Old bastard.\nGavin walked over toward him. The sword was on the way. He picked it\nup, bloody as it was from the endless stream pouring past it. Gavin was\nexhausted. What was he gonna do? Hack apart the mirror, hoping it\naccomplished something?\nHe’d carried this damn blade halfway across the world. What had it\ndone for him? It was as useless as he was.\nHe was sick of it. Sick of his own shit.\nWithout thinking too much—hell, he’d thought too much for his whole\nlife—he simply threw the blade.\nThe throw was as pathetic and weak as he was, in body and in will; he\ncouldn’t even commit to throwing it hard. He threw it sort of to Orholam,\nsort of at him, and sort of toward the edge, that it might fall into oblivion.\nHe didn’t even choose, merely tossed it away. But then, it was trash, like\nhis plans; he didn’t care about it anymore.\nThe blade clattered and slid and stopped short of the edge and Orholam\nboth.\nThe old prophet turned and looked at it, then at Gavin, then turned back\nto looking at the horizon without taking any more interest.\nGavin strode over to the old man.\nThe old man didn’t respond, so Gavin sat. He dangled his feet off the\nedge of the bloody tower."

He dangled his feet off the\nedge of the bloody tower.\nOrholam didn’t say a word. Gavin was reminded of their days rowing\ntogether. After a long hard day of rowing, sometimes, a rest would come,\nand they would simply sit. In such times, there would be no chatter. Bone-\nweary, there was nothing to say, but there was a silent communion in the\nrest from their mutual labor.\nAs they had then, now in the cool of the evening, they sat together.\nWhat did anything matter now? There was no rush. It was too late.\nSomeone else was steering the ship. Someone else calling the cadence. A\nbroken-down slave wasn’t going to change history.\nGavin was about to be cut free from his oar and tossed overboard; he\nwas human jetsam.\nIn his dream of this tower top, Gavin had begged the approaching giant\nfor more time; he’d wanted to fix things. Fix himself, he supposed, as he’d\nheld his black-marbled heart in his hands, as if he could disentangle the\nliving and the dead flesh knotted together using instruments as blunt and\nclumsy as his fingers.\nThe truth was, he was hopelessly broken, and time wasn’t going to fix\nhim. Now he was out of time. But maybe he’d been out of time for years. If\nhe’d had another century, he would still be himself.\nBut a stillness descended on him as he sat there with the old man. He\nbeheld the horizon, and though he saw only in a bichromatic palette made\npainful by his recent vision of the sunset in full color on the other side of\nthe glass, he was filled to overflowing with wonder. What was absent to his\nblinded eyes was yet there.\nHe could remember beauty, could remember how this gray-scale tone\nwould correspond to a lemon yellow blushing to sweet tangerine. Velvet\nviolet was stitched with subtle seams into the soft samite blanket of night,\nembroidered with silver points of light.\nIt was there, and he knew it was there, knew it was more real than what\nhis eyes could presently see.\n“What do you miss most?” Orholam asked quietly, not turning.\nThey’d failed together, Gavin supposed. Orholam had climbed up here,\nafter he’d been ‘told’ not to come, and perhaps he believed now he was\nbeing punished for his disobedience by finding nothing here. His world had\nto be shit right now, too.\nWhat came to mind wasn’t what Gavin expected, though.\n“When I called down that… holocaust at Sundered Rock, I didn’t know\nwhat it was going to do. Not exactly. I mean, I knew it was going be bad,\nbut… I came to, standing there, naked. The black just devoured everything.\nAnd that hot day turned cold. Bitter cold. Frigid. Even my brother’s body\nwas cold. I couldn’t tell how long it had been—if I’d been unconscious on\nmy feet for hours, or if the hellstone magic sucked in even heat and it had\nonly been moments.\n“You know, I was the one person on that battlefield who should have"

My skin was hairless\nin spots, but unharmed otherwise, but my clothes had disintegrated? I felt I\nhad broken the world, like I’d cracked open an egg and something terrible\nhad been released. But in that moment, there, among the dead… even the\ndying didn’t seem to moan. Or maybe I was deaf. I don’t know, but it was\nso still, as if a ripple of what I’d done was traveling out to infinity. Amid all\nthat, I experienced this moment out of time, as if passing realms had locked\nhere and the pressure had built until the earth heaved and everything\nfractured. Suddenly the landscape was changed, and you could only pray\nthat the tensions had been relieved and that the aftershocks wouldn’t\ndestroy you.\n“Something had happened that was bigger than I could even\nunderstand… but it had passed, and these stupid, normal, boring-ass\nconcerns came rushing back. Like: I was naked. And I couldn’t find my\nfriends. And first it, it, it wasn’t even that I was afraid they were all dead or\nthat I’d killed them. I couldn’t even think that far ahead. I only knew I was\nlonely. After all that? After this conflagration of magic the likes of which no\none had ever seen or even heard of? No one cared if some guy on the\nbattlefield was naked and his hair didn’t look right or some shit. But I was\ncold, and I saw Gavin had clothes and there—at the end of the fucking\nworld!—it made me remember this one time when we were kids.\n“We’d stopped on one of the little islands my father owned on our way\nbetween Rath and Big Jasper and we snuck out late one night and hiked up\nthe mountain to look for this old ruin—which we’d been forbidden to do, of\ncourse. And we’d been going for hours and there was a sudden storm, and\nI’d left my cloak back at my room, and I thought Gavin was going to tell\nme what an idiot I was. He’d even reminded me to bring it. But instead of\nmocking me or hitting me—” Gavin’s voice cracked suddenly. He had to\nclear his throat hard. “Instead Gavin… Gavin hugged me under one arm\nand gave me his cloak. He said he was too hot. The damn liar. Asked me if\nI’d wear it home for him.”\nGavin cleared his throat, irritated. “He didn’t deserve—I mean, at\nSundered Rock I was naked and stupidly embarrassed about it and he had\nclothes and was dead, and I, I just took them. It seemed really practical, you\nknow? He didn’t need ’em, right? But I looked back at it, and I stripped the\ndead like a looter. I stripped my brother’s corpse like a grave robber. It was\nlike I’d planned, you know, with Corvan. I mean, it was one possible\noutcome of like six: set a bunch of smoky red luxin on fire, come out as\nGavin, take charge of his armies and pretend to be him… I’ve never had a\nplan go so flawlessly and so poorly."

I thought he was the\nperfect Prism, that I could never measure up to him. I tried to be what I\nthought he’d been. And in the last couple years… I’ve seen and started to\nremember all the terrible shit my brother did. His cruelty. His meanness and\nfear. Some of it excusable because he was a child and scared and… and\nsome of it not, not at all, regardless. And you know, learning about who he\nreally was—seeing the truth about him? It’s been like losing him all over\nagain. My family was shit, and I was shit, but I had a hero, and then I lost\nhim for a second time. He wasn’t ever who I’d thought he was. He did some\nawful, awful shit I can never forgive him for. But at the same time… he\nwasn’t all bad. He was still the big brother who gave me his cloak.”\nGavin had to swallow again.\n“So I guess, you know, I guess I miss my big brother. And I miss\nSevastian. And I miss my mother, who never let me in all the way, even\nthough she loved me. I trusted her and she had my back, but she didn’t trust\nme. Not with the truth. She was ashamed, I guess. And I miss my father, or\nthe man he was before all this… I miss the man he should’ve become. The\ngrandfather he should’ve been to Kip. I miss Kip, and the father I should’ve\nbecome for him. I miss all the things I cost me. I miss Karris, and the great\nyears I should’ve had with her. I miss Corvan, who was my best friend, and\nwho I abandoned. I… shit. I miss things that never were and mourn things\nthat ought to have been. Ridiculous, huh? It doesn’t matter now. It’s too\nlate.”\nGavin tried to shake it off, finally turning to look at the old prophet with\na lopsided half grin. “So, should I complain some more about my unhappy\ndecades as the richest, most powerful and admired man in the world? It’s all\npretty much the same, though: ‘Ugh, all this rich food doesn’t taste good\nwhile I’m feeling so guilty.’ ‘Poor me! All these women want me, but I’m in\nlove with one who I’ve given good reason to hate me.’ The story’s a real\ntearjerker! But what about you? What were you doing then, Orholam? Oh,\nyou were enslaved and chained to the oar all those years? Beaten daily,\nnearly drowned a dozen times? Yeah… that does sound almost as bad as I\nhad it. So, you know, maybe I can be done.” He turned up the corners of his\nmouth and gestured over to the old man. “But really.

Maybe a cryptic parable will do me good.”\nGavin doubted it, but he owed the old man this much, and he was\nembarrassed at how he’d gone on.\nOrholam said, “After Dazen Guile killed his brother at Sundered Rock,\nhe built a prison. Not one cell or two, but an eightfold prison.”\n“Uh. Look, I know this story. How ’bout that cryptic parable instead? A\nprophecy? You can even make it rhyme. I can’t even tell you how ready I\nam for some awkward rhyming couplets that don’t quite fit a meter.”\nOrholam said nothing, and Gavin felt like an asshole. “I just said I’d\nlisten, and I interrupted first thing, didn’t I?”\nOrholam said nothing.\nGavin sighed. “I built it because I went mad. I wasted—”\n“No.”\n“What do you mean, no?”\n“In your climb through the seven circles to reach this, the roof of the\nworld, you’ve seen that you were worse than you knew. It’s time for you to\nsee that you were also better.”\n“Better?”\n“Dazen built those prisons because he knew what men had wrought. In\nseeking immortality and power, man had released the infernals into this\nworld. The gods of old, the immortals, could walk here. The Chromeria had\nobscured the knowledge as well as it could, but such could not be hidden\nforever. And so Dazen dedicated himself, alone, to fighting those whom the\nChromeria denies even exist. He discovered that to wield the greatest\npower, the infernals have to partner with a human host, a drafter who will\nshare her or his body with them. And so to expiate his sins, Dazen became a\nhunter. Not a hunter of wights, but rather of the powers who prey upon\nthose dying drafters called wights, all over the world.”\n“This… isn’t…”\n“He couldn’t kill these gods. That took something beyond him,\nsomething he didn’t have, the Blinding Knife, which his brother and father\nhad lost. But he, who so often did what others called impossible, did the\nimpossible once more. With the greatest secrecy and cunning, one at a time,\nhe imprisoned eight of the immortals. One for each of the seven Chromeria-\nrecognized colors, and one of the greater elohim in the black prison. Chi\nand paryl were too rare or too careful for him to find, and white, he was\ncertain, was a myth.”\n“What are you—” But Gavin’s throat was tight. It was hard to breathe.\nWhy was it hard to breathe?\nOrholam said, “So it was that after he had imprisoned these immortals,\nhe came to believe that the only person who might undo his labors was he\nhimself, for he knew himself corruptible and corrupted already.

He could barely form words over the encroaching\ntears, could barely breathe. It was impossible. It was lies. “No. That’s all\nvery flattering, but you don’t know. You don’t know me.”\nBut then he remembered the voices from his prisons. They hadn’t known\nhim. They hadn’t spoken quite right. If he’d cast bits of himself into those\nwalls, they’d have spoken to him differently. The infernals cast into those\nwalls hadn’t known what lies the others had told him, so each had tried its\nown tack against him, bluffing.\nThe last one had cursed him, called him That was a\ntongue Gavin had never known, nor Dazen, either.

He’d wanted to eliminate\nall the blue wights in the world. That much made sense, after Sevastian, but\nhe’d not hunted only blues; he’d hunted every color. Why?\nHad it been simple equanimity? A feeling of duty to all of the Seven\nSatrapies? But after a while, he’d stopped going so often after certain\ncolors, hadn’t he? He’d let local drafters or the Blackguards handle such\nthings, sometimes, unless it was on his way somewhere else. But then he’d\nstill insisted on going alone to others. Totally alone. Sometimes.\nThey’d always been furious. Orea Pullawr had been furious. Why would\nhe endanger himself like that? Why go alone? Why go alone sometimes but\nnot other times?\nBecause he had to be alone when he tried to trap an infernal. Because he\ncould protect himself from their malign will, but he couldn’t protect anyone\nwho went with him.

She\nclaims she was taken into slavery illegally, and maybe it’s true. You have to\nbe smart, dextrous, and lucky to get assigned to the big mirrors in the\nChromeria’s towers. Ysabel isn’t smart or dextrous, so we’ve all decided\nshe must be very, very lucky. Some say she was really pretty when she first\narrived. I can’t see it. Maybe she’s just a good bluffer: Ysabel pretends to be\nfrom the lower nobility. She claims her name’s Ysabel Elos, and her big\nbrother Gaspar is going to come save her from this life. Any day now.\nAny day. Right.\nShe’s been saying that since before my parents sold me into this life\nafter their brewery burned down and they lost everything. It was arson, but\ngood luck convincing a magistrate of that on Big Jasper. Tyreans don’t win\nlawsuits against their Ruthgari competitors. Not here.

        "text": "lawsuits against their Ruthgari competitors. Not here. So my parents signed\nthe forged documents saying I’d been taken in war, and took the meager\nsum. They figured slavery for one of us was better than starvation for all of\nus.\nI was the smartest and quickest of my siblings, already able to read and\ngood with an abacus. They could get twice as much for me as for any of the\nothers, and I’m the big brother. It’s my job to protect the others. I\nvolunteered.\nWe’re all slaves here. Everyone’s got a tale of woe. But even slaves look\ndown on liars like Ysabel ‘Elos.’ She’s a petty tyrant. Our work is good and\nnecessary. We bring light into darkness. But Ysabel is a bloody stain on her\noffice, besmirching what should be pure.\nShe sees it on my face: how I despise her.\nShe picks up her small cat-o’-nine-tails.\nAll the other overseers use only unbraided, uncured leather in their cats.\nIt has been decreed by the master of the Chromeria’s lands and properties\nHigh Lord Carver Black himself, that we not be whipped like common\nslaves. We’re slaves, but we’re precious ones. Privileged. We work\nalongside our manumitted older brothers and sisters who’ve bought their\npapers, and came back to work, now paid triple. We’ve all been educated in\noptics and angles and even enough magic to understand our drafters’ needs\nand operations. We’re highly trained so as to keep all the mechanisms in\nperfect repair, from clearing lightwells to greasing the gears, and ordering\nnew ones fit to exacting specifications, inspecting, and then replacing them.\nMost of all, we’re the keepers of the precious Great Mirrors themselves,\nwhich we polish with vinegar and water and special heavy silk cloths up to\neight times every day.\nOther lesser slaves are given certain holy days off. They pity us because\nwe take none. They don’t understand. Our duty is holy, and it is most\nimportant at the holiest times. With the heat and light these mirrors endure,\na dirty mirror could shatter on any day, but the risk is doubled on hot, sunny\ndays, and doubled again during executions, such as today, where all the\nminor mirrors add their full intensity to the sun’s own.\nLowly as we are, we direct Orholam’s Eye.\nSlaves we are, but we’re star-keepers. We’re not to be beaten like\ncommon field hands.\nA smack with nine loose, soft cords is allowed to rouse anyone whose\nattention is wandering. But Carver Black gets furious when anyone\ndamages valuable property, and we are surely some of the Chromeria’s\nmost valuable property of all.\nBut Overseer Ysabel doesn’t care. She’s boiled her cat-o’-nine-tails\nhard, and to one of those tails, she’s tied an old piece of broken mirror. You\nmight get hit half a dozen times and never get caught with that shard. Or it\nmight get you every time, slashing or even sticking into your flesh before\nbeing torn free.\n“Execution’s starting, Mistress,” one of the older men says quickly.\nAmadis pretends not to even be aware of me, but I know it’s an attempted\nrescue."

Amadis glances at me and\nshakes his head.\nHe’s right. I’m no Guile, to get away with such things. They’d put me up\non Orholam’s Glare myself if I murdered an overseer.\nIn fact, I might not be the only one to die. Slave rebellions always meet\nbrutal ends.\nThe overseer comes back. “They’re jabbering, like they do. We’ll have\nto be quick. Tunic.”\nThe others go silent. Overseer Ysabel whips a slave’s buttocks when she\nintends to draw blood and doesn’t want Carver Black to see it on our bodies\nafterward. The humiliation is merely a bonus for her.\nI do her one better, though. I hitch up my tunic and pull down not just\nmy trousers but also my underclothes. I stick my rear end out at her to let\nher know my opinion of her.\nGasps go up.\nI’m a damned fool.\nI know she’s going to beat me terribly. Some brighter part of me is\nshrieking about the stupidity of presenting one’s naked underside to a\nsavage woman intent on humiliating me. I will my stones to pull up into my\nbody. Orholam have mercy on the stupid and insane.\n“No disrespect, Overseer,” I say. It’s much too late, though. “You said\nwe were in a hurry. Just wanted to make it easier for you to give me the\nbeating I deserve quickly. And I want to keep my underthings from getting\nshredded. They’re my only pair, and I’m a clumsy hand with stitchery.”\nEven as I lie, I know it’s not very convincing. I can’t put my heart into\nit.\nMy attitude’ll get me killed someday. They’ve all told me that.\nPlease not today.\nI don’t dare turn around to see her face, but my heart is straining with\nhope that she’ll run out of time and that the execution will call her to deal\nwith me later—Maybe I can run away!—when the cat-o’-nine-tails falls.\nIt’s never good… but this is not bad. And just the once.\n“Do you know why you think you’re special?” she asks quietly, and I\nknow we’re not even close to finished.\nI should stall, but the words escape before I think of it. “Why,\nMistress?”\n“Because you’re an arrogant little shit,” she says. She laughs like hell’s\nown gatekeeper.\nShe whips me harder than I’ve ever been whipped in my life. My breath\nleaps from my throat, tears to my eyes. Then again. Forehand and backhand\nshe strikes, as hard as she can.\nThe mirror slaves are dead silent. Under the fires, I feel my skin slice\nopen. Feel hot liquid pouring down my legs.\n“Ow, fuck!” she says. The lashes stop.\nI fall to my knees.\nWhen I dare to turn, I see her holding her forearm. She’s been hitting me"

She’s been hitting me\nso hard, she hurt herself.\nI can’t even find thoughts, though. Not even to mock her.\n“Mistress, please,” Amadis says. “It’s enough. There’s so much blood.\nHe won’t be able to hide it from High Lord Black if you do any more. He’ll\nmiss shifts as it is!”\n“No, he won’t!” Overseer Ysabel shouts. She slaps my face and I crash\nto the ground.\nI hear her cursing when I regain my senses. She’s still holding her\nforearm.\nThe stupid cow just hit me with the same arm she’s injured.\nI stay down, weeping. There’s no pride left in me to hold back tears.\n“Get up! Now! Or it’ll be forty more,” she barks at me. “Amadis, you\ntake the ‘cat’! You get to give the rest of the lashes for your attitude.”\nHe moves slowly, but she knows that game. Every slave knows that\ngame. She kicks him.\nI stand as quickly as I can. I hate her. I hate living this life. I’ve only\nmade it all worse for myself. She’ll beat me to death and push me down one\nof the lightwells. It’s happened before.\n“Ten more, now, as hard as you can, or I’ll double it and you’ll get them,\ntoo,” the overseer says.\nAmadis hits me. Hard. I almost fall down. Though he’s hit me with the\nside with no glass so he won’t maim me, he’s much stronger than the\noverseer.\nI shouldn’t hate him for it, but I do.\nIt’s his fault. He stopped me with his warning look. I should’ve pushed\nher out of the tower when I had a chance. Better to die than to hold out\nhope.\nHe hits me again and I fall.\n“Mistress!” one of the older women says. “There’s the signal!”\nShe curses aloud. “Places, everyone, places. On six! And you, Alvaro,\nget out of here!” she yells at me.\n“Five!”\nEveryone scatters back to their mirrors, pulling heavy dark spectacles\nover their eyes. There hasn’t been an execution on Orholam’s Glare in\nyears. Everyone expects perfection, exact synchrony from the mirrors with\nsteady and precise movements. Anything sloppy not only reflects poorly on\nall the star-keepers, but could actually end up with innocents down below\nbeing killed by the intensity and heat of the sunbeams we focus.\n“Four.”\nI stand, blearily. My underclothes and trousers are still at my ankles. I\npull them up. It’s agony. I can’t help but put a hand on my buttocks. My\nhand comes away bloody.\n“Three!” Then she shouts at me, “Out of the way! Get out of my tower\nor I’ll throw you off!” I’m not really in the way, but I’m near her and her\nown mirror, which is in pride of place at the east side, and I know I need to\nget out fast. There’s murder in her voice."

She turns\nher back, cradling her arm, cursing. Everyone stops, wondering if they\nshould continue without the count.\nFor an instant, I’m between her and her Great Mirror. The great disk is\nbeautiful. Flawlessly gleaming. It’s our holy duty to care for the mirrors.

Are you\nkidding? Every moment we stay here arguing—fine! Just do it!”\nFive of the twenty Blackguards got off the lift, muttering, and six\nLightguards pushed their way on.\n“It was crazy,” Fisk said as they finally set the weights. “I was watching\nhis eyes. He went from nothing to pressing the halos in every color. He\ndoesn’t have much time left.”\n“That’s nice,” Karris said as the lift came to stop on a residential level.\n“Except that it doesn’t seem I do, either.”\nThere were a dozen Lightguards waiting here. Obviously killers. “We\nneed to get on,” one of them said. “Prism’s orders. You all get off.”\nKarris wasn’t being taken to a cell.\nFisk pushed against the Lightguards in front of him. “Sure.

Several stepped off before others hesitated.\nFisk clicked his tongue twice, and suddenly Lightguards were flying out\nof the lift into their murderous compatriots, kicked or thrown out by the\nBlackguards. Someone threw the counterweights, and the lift dropped like a\nstone.\nOnly one of the Lightguards held on to the Blackguard who’d pushed\nhim. He tottered at the edge of the rapidly growing height above the\ndescending lift.\nBut someone grabbed his arm, and he didn’t fall on them.\nThey slowed the lift, and Karris looked at Fisk.\n“You didn’t think I was going to side with that little shit, did you?” he\nasked, unlocking her manacles.\n“I…”\n“We’re with you, Iron White. Blood and bone.”\n“I know you all loved Gavin, but you don’t have to transfer any oath of\n—”\n“We loved Promachos,” Fisk said, using Gavin’s Blackguard Name.\n“Still do. But this has got nothing to do with him. We’re yours, blood and\nbone.”\n“Blood and bone,” the others swore.\nShe compressed her lips tightly and nodded, looking quickly at each, eye\nto eye. “Thank you. Thank you. All right. We’ve gotta get off Little Jasper\ncompletely,” Karris said. “We’re not safe as long as—” She cut off as they\nreached the ground-level grand atrium, and the lift stopped, revealing a\nsemicircle of at least forty Lightguards, all of whom were pointing muskets\nat the lift.\nOne of the Blackguards muttered, “That’s unfortunate.”\nSay this about Blackguards: facing death, they still guarded their\ntongues.\nSeveral hundred people who were sheltering in the grand atrium or who\nhad business with the Chromeria on this fraught day stood watching,\nconfused and then aghast that people they’d thought were on the same side\nwere pointing muskets at one another.\nGill Greyling murmured, “We can take ’em.”\nSay this about Blackguards, too: facing death, they still never said die.\nIt made them excellent people not to listen to in certain situations.\nA young Lightguard with a brace holding his leg straight and a crutch\nwith a blade along the front edge announced loudly enough for the whole\ncrowd to hear him, “Commander Fisk! I have to say I warned our High\nLord Zymun that you would betray him. He wanted to give you a chance.\nSo hard to find loyal commanders for the Blackguard these days. But we do\nhave an admirable replacement. Gentlemen, it’s my honor to introduce you\nto your new Blackguard commander: me. You may call me Commander\nAram. Brothers, sisters, all of you, surrender your muskets. Now.”\nNo one moved. The crowd murmured.\n“That’s an order,” Aram growled.\nFisk was tense as a drawn bowstring, but he growled, “Do it.” He drew\nhis own pistols, careful not to point them toward the jittery Lightguards.\nBut instead of sliding the pistols to the any of the Lightguards, he slid them\nhard down one of the gaps between their lines.\nYou never arm your enemy.\nThe rest of the Blackguards followed in quick succession, doing the\nsame."

He wasn’t addressing Aram,\nthough. He was speaking to the other Lightguards, and the whole room.\n“High Lady Karris Guile, treason? Our Iron White is heading out to do\nbattle for us all. She goes to join the Lightbringer himself. Are you telling\nme you’re gonna murder her? For that spoiled boy up there? What is he\noffering you Lightguards? Money? She goes to fulfill prophecy. She goes to\nsave our island, our empire, and our very lives. If she doesn’t go, we all die!\nHard to spend your bribe money when you’re dead. And after you discharge\nthose muskets, consider this: what happens to you?”\n“What do you mean what happens to—? Look,” Aram said, “we have\nour orders, and we obey them, unlike—”\n“Here’s the thing,” Commander Fisk said. “We Blackguards are better\ntrained than you are. But the damnable thing about muskets is that they\nwipe out most of the advantage of training. At least for the first volley,\nespecially close up. That works against us today. But it works against you,\ntoo.”\n“Huh?” Aram asked.\nA young man in the crowd beyond the Lightguards had picked up one of\nthe Blackguards’ discarded pistols. Now, swallowing, he pointed it at Aram.\n“I think you should let the Iron White go,” he said, his eyes wide, his\nvoice squeaky. He looked like he could hardly believe he’d found such\ncourage in himself. He blinked, then, embarrassed, he cocked the pistol.\nIn an instant, others were picking up the muskets and pistols near them,\nas well, and pointing them at the Lightguards.\nAnd then dozens of other people around the atrium produced muskets—\nwith the threat of an invading army, everyone who owned a weapon was\ncarrying it today.\nIn moments, the semicircle of Lightguards found themselves goggling as\nthey were encircled by civilians and diplomats, bristling with dozens and\ndozens of muskets.\nChapter 120\nGavin gasped, jerking his hand away from the old man. “What was that? A\nvision? You’re a will-caster?” he demanded. “You might have told me! That\ncould’ve come in handy a few times in the last few years, you know. And\nwhat the hell was that? Some slave kid? Mirrors? Why show me—”\nThe old prophet said nothing.\n“Wait, that will-casting has come in handy, hasn’t it? You’ve been\ntwisting me to your will for this whole climb, haven’t you?

        "text": "deception, then? Have I actually seen any of this?”\nOrholam sighed. “We know ourselves by how we see ourselves mirrored\nin others’ eyes. So when a man lies habitually, he distorts the mirror he\nholds up to the world. In fooling others, he loses himself. Those who praise\nhim? Those who love him? He knows they must simply be fools. He hates\nhimself because there’s a gap between what he is and what he believes\nhimself to be. If the gap grows too large, it becomes a tear, a schism. A man\ntorn asunder lives in madness. So, my friend, do you know who you are?”\n“I’m a guy trapped on a tower in the middle of nowhere with a lunatic.”\n“You’ve tried to be the Trickster. It doesn’t fit you. So you failed at\ntrickery, and it made you fail at what you are made to do, too. Some try to\nblot themselves out with drug or drink, but you needed stronger stuff. You\nsought to unmake that which God Himself hath wrought. You used black\nluxin. You were afraid to be who you are. Ever in front of thousands, you\nthought you could stand alone, all while you secretly tried to buy\nredemption on the cheap. It’s why you took the pilgrimage seriously, but\nutterly wrongly.”\n“Is this about the blade?” Gavin asked.\n“There are many reasons to make a pilgrimage, but the most common is\nbelieving a pilgrimage is a shortcut to redemption. It’s also the worst reason\nto make one. As if one might carry a rock for a while and be finished with\npride. Carrying a burden so heavy it hobbles you is a good metaphor for sin,\nbut it’s only a metaphor. Confusing the image of a thing with the thing itself\nis the root of all sorts of trouble.”\n“Let me guess: life itself is the pilgrimage?” Gavin asked.\nBut the old prophet hardly slowed. “You Guiles are eagles watching a\nsunset in a still mountain lake. You dive into it instead of soaring as you\nwere made to do, and flap your wings in the water and curse the world\nbecause you can’t fly and you find it hard to breathe—and with your\nsplashing you destroy the image of the sky, too.”\n“Thanks,” Gavin said. Asshole. “So if I’m not who I think I am, then\nwho am I?” He was trying to be flippant, but he was too exhausted. The\nday’s long fight had taken it out of him.\n“You like to figure things out. Figure it out. Besides, I’ve already told\nyou.”\nNo, you didn’t. “What does this have to do with that slave Alvaro?”\n“Who’s asking?”\nUgh! God! Gavin hated prophets!\nDazen. Dazen hated prophets. Dammit! He still thought of himself as\nGavin. Half the time. It was excruciating, holding himself together. “I’m\nDazen Guile,” he said. His voice came out firmly. A strong, steady\nstatement of fact. Mostly.\n“No, you’re not.”\n“Well, shit. A one-in-two chance, and I still blow it. What, then? I’m\nGavin indeed?”\n“You’re asking me?” the old man said. “And you’re going to listen?”"

I’m\nGavin indeed?”\n“You’re asking me?” the old man said. “And you’re going to listen?”\n“Yes!” Gavin said, exasperated. This was surreal, infuriating. He’d\nstepped into a circus world, a hall of mirrors. Up was down, left was right,\nand though he could finally remember everything he’d lost to black luxin,\nhe couldn’t even firmly pin down his own name?\nOrholam said quietly, “You’re not a trickster. You’re a protector. You’re\nthe one who goes out before his people into battle. Is that enough, or do you\nneed more hints?”\n“Promachos?” Gavin asked, but something in him cracked. “That’s what\nIronfist called me. I come all the way up here just to get my Blackguard\nname a second time?”\nBut he was being defensive, holding the prophet off mentally. Stalling. It\nhad felt good when Ironfist called him that. It had felt real, and strong, and\ntrue. And that had been a treasure. He’d held off the name then, too, even as\nhe’d craved it. ‘I’m not the man you think I am,’ he’d told Ironfist. Ironfist\nhad replied, ‘Are you not the man I’ve served these past ten years?’ ‘I am.’\n‘Then perhaps, my lord, you’re not the man you think you are.’\nOrholam went on. “Harrdun saw what you did, for decades, and at\nGarriston you gave him undeniable evidence, no matter his other feelings\nabout you.”\nDazen cocked his head. “At Garriston? What, making Brightwater\nWall?”\n“No!” Orholam laughed. “That part infuriated him, how seemingly\neffortlessly you could create such a wonder, and how you so easily turned\npeople’s hearts to you. I mean at the gate.”\n“I got his people killed at the gate,” Gavin said. “I should’ve finished it\nfaster.”\n“You laid down your life for your friends at that gate, and in so doing,\nyou drafted white luxin. He found a piece of it. He wears it still.”\n“White luxin? Me? That’s not—”\n“Dazen or Gavin, you have been what you thought you needed to be in\norder to be Promachos. It’s who you are. And you are at your most powerful\nwhen you stand for those who have no one to stand for them.”\nThe words smote him like a giant’s fist crashing down around him.\nBut instead of crushing him, he felt his dead heart stir once more,\npounding for at least one moment again within its dark and thorny cage—\nlife in him pulsing against the death garrisoned in his body. It was truth,\nsmashing him as painfully as a man pounds a drowned swimmer’s chest,\nbreaking ribs to save his life, making him gasp in pain in order to help him\nbreathe at all.\nBut he knew this was nothing more than one last skirmish in an old,\nlosing war. It was too late. He’d not drowned in water that might be spat\nout, leaving his lungs clear. He’d drowned in blood. Rivers and seas of it.\nAnd yet…"

And the worst times\nof his life had been the times he’d failed to protect those he’d loved: He’d\nfailed to protect Sevastian. Failed to protect Marissia. Failed to protect Kip.\nFailed to protect Karris—because he couldn’t do it alone. And he’d always\nbeen alone.\n“I stand for them,” Gavin said. “Well… stood.”\nAnd then his voice lowered to a low, piteous tone utterly unbefitting the\nPrism he’d once been. It was the voice of that helpless boy, in an empty,\nbeautiful mansion in a storm, holding the lifeless body of his little brother.\nWith a voice shot through with tears and weakness, he said, “I stood for\nthem. Who stands for me?”\nGavin looked away. He didn’t dare see what might be in the old man’s\neyes now. He couldn’t handle pity, and one I-told-you-so and Gavin was\ngoing to throw himself off this goddam tower.\nHe didn’t need an answer. When had he given anyone the chance to\nstand for him? Or even beside him? When had he asked? No, Gavin had\nwanted to be the big hero, partly from vanity so he’d be seen as a hero, and\npartly from pride that only he could do whatever was required, but also\npartly from fear at losing whomever he might have asked.\nGavin said, “I failed everyone I love, and I’ve not loved those who\ndeserve it and needed it. What do I… what do I do with that?”\nWhen Orholam didn’t answer, Gavin began to lift his gaze to the old\nprophet, when he saw a tear splash in the blood between them, a momentary\npinprick bleaching the red stream. “Love as you are, Dazen. Sometimes a\nbroken mirror serves best.”\n“Ha! Oh yeah? When?! When bits of it are tied into a cat-o’-nine so it\ncan tear flesh, like with that little shit Alvaro?” Gavin turned away. He\ncouldn’t look at Orholam’s face. “Besides, I wasn’t looking for an answer.”\nIt was a lie, though. Of course he was.\n“Your dark night was lived every day in the sun. And was darkest on the\nbrightest day of the year. In the full view of unseeing thousands, you felt\nalone.”\nGavin grunted an assent.\n“If only there were someone you could have talked to.”\n“I had no one.”\n“I was suggesting you might have talked to Me.”\nHa. “I feared if I looked too closely, the whole thing would fall apart.”\n“It would’ve,” Orholam said.\nGavin blinked. “What do you mean, like maybe afterward I could have\nput it back together better or something?”"

But there would’ve been many willing hands, ready to\nhelp.”\n“If they had a leader maybe. Sevastian.”\n“No. You. There was always a key role for you to play.”\n“Right. Whatever.”\n“I sent others, over the centuries. Some denied the call. Others were\nkilled. Others were seduced, corrupted before they could fulfill their\npurpose. The sea demons, for example.”\n“The—wait, what?”\n“Lucidonius was to be the Lightbringer. He turned aside. Chose\nconquest. Sought godhood. And then, in terror of my judgment, he sought\nimmortality. He soul-cast himself into the gentle creature that had been his\nservant and friend. Lucidonius became the first sea demon. He swims still.\nAll the later ones took their inspiration from him.”\nHe swims still? Gavin’s jaw went slack. He’d fought Lucidonius\nhimself: the greatest of the sea demons had smashed the Golden Mean onto\nthe reef.\n“Wait, wait, wait, how come no one at the Chromeria told me this?” he\nasked. “I was the Prism. The emperor! I was even promachos for a while!”\n“Would you tell Gavin Guile how to find immortality, knowing what it\nwould cost everyone else?” the old prophet asked.\nMy God. That was the real reason Karris Atiriel had created the\nBlackguard: they guarded the black secret. What had seemed the\ncontradictory goals of guarding his life and ensuring his death weren’t\nopposed at all: they guarded the Prism and his honor—by forcibly marching\nhim to an honorable death, if necessary. As brothers in arms would kill a\ncompatriot drafter out of mercy if she broke the halo, so the Blackguard\nwould kill the Prism before they’d let him become a monster forever.\n“You’re telling me the sea demons are all former Prisms?”\nA gentle head shake. “Most were, and all those who remain are, but the\nmagic is possible for others.”\nIt was all suddenly too much.\nToo much explanation. A prophet might know many hidden things, sure,\nbut all of this? So clearly? Plain answers and not a goddamned rhyme in the\nwhole thing?\nGavin took a step back. His throat suddenly felt like a fist had clamped\naround it.\nAs if retreating from a snarling dog, pretending his heart wasn’t\nlaboring, he staggered to his feet, and stepped back and back.\nThe old prophet watched him, amused. He didn’t pursue him.\nThat didn’t make Gavin feel any better.\nThere was something sinister in that amusement, wasn’t there? Gavin’s\nheart clenched with the old feeling like he was going to die.\nHe reached the spot he wanted at the edge and craned his neck to look\nover to the level below him.\nGavin was standing directly above that gap he’d had to leap across\nbefore he could climb the final stairs to the tower’s top—the gap where he’d\nleft Orholam.\nAn old man was still down there, directly below Dazen, on his knees,\nscowling at all the blood.

Hey, is there someone up there with you? I thought I saw someone’s\nback a few—hey, Gavin!”\nBut Dazen had whipped his head around, startled back from the edge.\nThe doppelgänger was still up here, now standing mere feet away from him,\nthough Dazen hadn’t heard him move. It was holding the gun-sword.\nA chill shot down Dazen’s spine. His breath caught. He took a step\nbackward and felt his heel shift on the empty air beyond the tower’s edge.\nThe doppelgänger poked the gun-sword into the bloody ground and\nfolded his hands atop it as if it were a walking stick and he simply a kindly\nold man.\nLooking between the two copies of the same man, one before him and\none below him, Dazen addressed the deceiver on the tower’s top with him.\n“You tricked me! You’re not Orholam!”\nThe old man leaned on the gun-sword. He smiled. “Oh, but I Am.”\nChapter 121\n“Where the hell’d they go?” Kip said.\nHe and his men had been bracing for battle with the forty or fifty\nLightguards that had been guarding the lift. He’d even come up with a plan\nto get the jump on them, but it hadn’t been a good one. He’d expected to\nspill blood.\nBut the thugs were simply gone.\n“We, uh, detained them,” a soft-looking young nobleman said. He\nappeared to be the last person who could have done such a thing.\nKip and his men looked at each other. Someone triggered the lift to\nsummon it. They weren’t going to slow too much to investigate a mystery\nright now; they needed to get to the roof.\n“The Iron White came. She showed us how,” a woman volunteered.\n“And Commander Fisk,” the first man said. “The stones on that guy! I’m\nsurprised he doesn’t have to travel with a wheelbarrow.”\nKip lifted an eyebrow and the man fell silent. “They left? Just now?”\nHe got nods all around.\n“They were going to kill her! They were taking her to execute her!”\nsomeone said.\n“We’ve got those bastards disarmed and locked in a storage room. Do\nyou want to—”\nKip shook his head as the lift arrived. He didn’t want to look a gift horse\nin the mouth: not having to have a battle with the Lightguards here was a\nhuge boon, but Andross had assumed Commander Fisk would stay at his\npost upstairs with Zymun. Fisk was supposed to be using those giant stones\nof his to lead the Blackguard in killing Zymun after he went wight.\nI can’t exactly be mad that Fisk is saving Karris instead… but as a\ngeneral, I’m furious.\nOf course, Andross surely hadn’t told Fisk his plan. Andross never told\nanyone his plans for fear they’d screw them up. So it was Andross’s fault.\nIn a battle, there were too many moving parts to manage every detail, too\nmany players acting in extreme ways for even an Andross Guile to predict\neverything."

The dull thrum of the bane could be felt in all of their\nbones, but that was the next fight. This one was enough for now.\nThe Mighty were checking their weapons, never mind they’d checked\nthem minutes before.\nThe lift opened to the Prism’s and White’s level of the tower. The\nMighty and the best of their compatriots presented a hedgehog of muskets,\ndrawn arrows, spears, and crossbow bolts—to an empty foyer.\nNo one stood at the checkpoint here, or farther down the hallway. It\nmade things infinitely easier for Kip and his people—this hall could be held\nat the checkpoints by a dozen men with muskets for hours.\nGood luck? Kip was so unfamiliar with the creature he didn’t dare trust\nit.\n“Superviolets, sub-reds, out!” Big Leo said, suddenly every bit the\ncommander.\nKip, with nothing to do until others finished their work, thought idly,\n‘Commander Big Leo’?\nHuh. That did sound a bit awkward. ‘Commander Leonidas’?\nHmm. Maybe so.\nIf we live.\nThe superviolets and sub-reds streamed out of the lift, checking for\ntraps. Kip thought again of Teia. Orholam, but it would have been nice to\nhave Teia here. She was so fast, so sharp.\nAnd so absent. Curled up in her darkened room, shivering against the\nlacrimae sanguinis in her very eyes, hoping it might wear off before it killed\nher.\nThey all wanted to be with her, to give her all the comfort and\ncompanionship she deserved. Kip had a million things to say, a thousand\napologies—but war silenced all.\nThey motioned an all clear, and Big Leo motioned everyone forward.\nKip wasn’t allowed to lead, not into what could be an ambush.\nThey made it all the way to the doors to the roof. What was wrong with\nthe Lightguards? Not even a lookout out here? It was odd to be reminded\nthat the enemy could be poorly led, too. Even at the top, it wasn’t always\ngeniuses and masterminds. Sometimes it was just thugs willing to work\nwith the worst kinds of masters. Sometimes it was the amoral, selected\nprimarily for their skills at bootlicking.\nStill, no soldiers here didn’t mean Kip wasn’t going to barge into the\nmiddle of a hundred on the other side of these doors.\nSo the Mighty stacked up at the doors to the roof, forty men. Ferkudi—\nwith no sign of the silly, dopey, spacey Ferkudi he so often lapsed into—\nwas giving rapid hand signals to the warriors in the stack.\nFor the space of a few heartbeats, Kip saw the young man blurred with"

Big, soft, dopey Ferkudi, the butt of all the jokes, the\noblivious knucklehead who could oddly do long calculations in his head\nhad turned into this lethal warrior, this leader of men.\nAnd yet he was Ferkudi still. He wasn’t one or the other; he was one or\nthe other as the situation demanded.\nKip loved them both.\nAnd he was terrified that he was going to get his friend killed.\nBut not terrified to inaction.\nKip checked his pistols’ load and action and flint and frizzen. No luxin,\nnot now.\nBig Leo looked to him. Kip nodded.\nThe commander gave the tempo with one hand. Took a breath.\nThree. Two. Boom!\nThey charged up the stairs onto the roof, fanning out.\nIn mere seconds, the forty were on the roof, guns pointed every\ndirection.\nThere were a mere dozen people on the roof: six Lightguards, who\nraised their muskets to the sky instantly; two trembling courtiers; two\nmessengers; and two scantily clad young slave women.\nNo Zymun.\n“Where is he?” Kip bellowed into the face of one of the courtiers.\n“Sir, I—”\n“Where?!”\n“He had to… he had to answer the call of nature, sir.”\n“He broke the halo,” one of the women said with a hollow tone. She had\nthe look of one who’d been traumatized by Zymun and was courageously\nfighting to reclaim herself. “His eyes bled. Sub-red. They took him\ndownstairs.”\nThe courtier looked at her with rage. Advancing on her and lifting a\nhand, he said, “We were ordered not to—”\nBig Leo pummeled the man across the jaw.\nThe courtier skidded across the ground, unconscious, maybe dead.\nKip turned to Ben-hadad. “Take twenty men. Arrest him or kill him.”\n“And if they look to fight back? It’ll threaten civil war,” Ben said.\n“That war would end as soon as he’s dead,” Kip said.\n“Got it,” Ben said. And left.\nKip realized that his friend was not even going to try to arrest Zymun.\nBut it just wasn’t a priority now.\n“Quickly, my lord,” someone said.\nKip turned to the enormous crystal that hung suspended between great\niron arms, half of its circumference enshrouded in mirrors. Kip grabbed the\nstraps and golden hand grips and beautifully carven sigils of Prisms past\nand levered himself into place. Others strapped him in.\nJust in time.\nFor roaring over the horizon, already nearing the Jaspers, the first of the\nlux storms was coming.\nChapter 122\nDazen couldn’t claim that he dropped to his knees out of piety, but he\ncertainly dropped to his knees.\nThere was no denial. The pieces snapped together all too tightly. There\nwas even a certain whimsy to it: Dazen had deceived the world to hide his\nidentity; Orholam had deceived Dazen by hiding His own—and He’d\nhidden behind His own real name."

Good handiwork. Shoot an apple\nclean out of a fool’s mouth at forty paces. Farther if you’re not on a heaving\nship. Or if you’re God, I suppose.”\nHe didn’t know why he was doing this. Maybe no form of address\nseemed right, coming from him. Certainly not all the high-priestly\nbenedictions he’d parroted, those rote noises from a liar, who’d believed\nthey were lies every time he’d said them before in his life.\n“You call this a tribute?” Orholam asked, patting the blade.\n“A certain prophet told me bringing an offering was customary.”\n“Oh, you’re following what’s customary now?” Orholam asked.\n“Worth a shot…?” Gavin asked. He wanted to stand, but he hadn’t the\nstrength for it. Blood swirled around his knees and over the edge. “No pun\nintended. Gun-sword. Shot. You—” He stopped at Orholam’s look. “Right,\nyou probably know what I intend, huh?”\nOrholam didn’t look amused. “You wouldn’t give your garbage to a\nbeggar and expect his gratitude. You threw this away. Should I be grateful\nfor you giving Me your garbage?”\nHe had him there. “Uh. I dunno. Thought maybe you could use it?”\n“You think that to accomplish My will I need an old sword that’s lost its\nedge?”\nDazen said, “Probably not? Wait, are you calling me an old sword?”\n“Haven’t lost your edge, after all.”\n“Or at least not all my edge,” Dazen said.\n“Lot of edge up here, if you lose it.”\nDazen couldn’t help but crack a smile.\nYep. This was it.\nCertain proof.\nHe’d gone mad.\nThis wasn’t how this would go, if it were real. If it were real, there\nwould be ‘thee’s and ‘thou’s. There would be ponderous grammar straight\nout of Doni’el Machos.\nOrholam merely studied him in the fading light.\n“You know,” Gavin said, “I hadn’t thought of you having… well,\npersonality. No offense. You know what I mean, right? I kinda like you.\nDespite myself. You oughta come down every once in a while. Mix with the\nlocals.”\n“That’s a great idea. I’ll have to consider it.” There was a certain flatness\nto the tone. A little jab at Gavin’s honestly giving suggestions. To God. As if\nGod had never thought of them.\nGavin scowled. “You… you already do? Walk around incognito and\nall?”\nOrholam merely lifted his eyebrows.\n“Damn! Er, sorry. Well then, you really should come visit the\nChromeria. Sit in on a Spectrum meeting. You’d straighten a few things out\nreal quick, I think.”\n“Quick? In a committee meeting?”"

        "text": "Chromeria. Sit in on a Spectrum meeting. You’d straighten a few things out\nreal quick, I think.”\n“Quick? In a committee meeting?”\nDazen laughed aloud. “No, you’re right. I can just imagine you floating\nin, all glowy, trumpets blaring, ready to orate, and Klytos Blue suddenly\ninterjecting, ‘Point of order! Has the gentleman in the clouds of glory been\ngranted the floor?’”\nThey laughed together.\nMadness was more fun than it had any right to be.\nThen Gavin said, “Comedy must really suck for you, huh? I mean,\nyou’ve gotta always see the punchline coming, right?”\n“It’s all in the delivery,” Orholam said. He gave a sly grin. “Speaking of\nwhich…”\nDazen swallowed. “I’m not gonna like what you say next, am I?”\n“No.” The joviality was abruptly gone. “You’re supposed to deliver a\ntribute.”\n“So you were really serious about the garbage thing? Like, the gun-\nsword doesn’t count?” Gavin said. “I mean…”\n“Oh, I’m not above using others’ garbage. I’ll use a stone the builders\nreject as a cornerstone, but you can’t give Me as tribute what’s garbage to\nyou. That’s no sacrifice. I’m a healer to healers and a servant to servants,\nbut to kings I’m a king—not a slave.”\nThe last layer of denial fell away as Dazen saw finally the sense of it.\nHe wasn’t mad.\nOrholam wasn’t one simplistic personality. He was vast. One person\ncould only behold so much of Him. Encountering Him was like trying to\nsee a gem the size of the earth itself, made of every color inside and outside\nthe visible spectrum: the human eye and a mortal’s mind’s eye could only\nbehold so much and so truly. Gavin himself was a wit, funny and kind, but\nat the end of the day, he was definitely the emperor, and he wouldn’t allow\nanyone to forget it. So Orholam appeared to him thus, a divine mirror, so\nthat Gavin might have some hope of understanding a part of the truth, a\ncorporeal synecdoche: a part standing in for the whole.\n“I’ve got nothing that’s a fitting tribute for You,” Dazen said. “I’m\nbroken-down trash myself.”\n“I accept.”\n“What?”\n“You! I accept! With delight! An excellent tribute. None finer.”\n“Me?! You don’t need me. You just said—”\n“Does a king need friends?” Orholam asked.\n“What? What?” Dazen knew how Gavin would’ve answered, but he also\nknew it would be wrong.\n“Does a father need his children?” Orholam asked. “Does a mother need\nthe babe in her arms?”\n“Of course not. But… yes? Not need need, but that’s totally different.\nWhat are You saying?”\nDazen thought of his own father and what it had done to Andross to\nthink he didn’t need his children. He thought of his mother, who’d been so\nbroken by her own loss. And he thought of Kip, and what he himself must\nhave done to Kip, thinking the boy didn’t need need Dazen to stand in as his\nfather."

Will you come be My son?”\nWhat?! Dazen couldn’t wrap his head around that. It didn’t make sense.\nBut what was perfectly clear was the ruin he’d left everywhere in his\nwake. He could see in color sharper and more jagged than all his memories.\nHe could remember sliding the dagger home into ribs, over and over, until\nhe was numbed to the deed.\nAnd he’d done it thousands of times. Thousands.\nHe’d known the Freeing was wrong, and he’d done it anyway.\nGavin knew what he was. Orholam had to know it, too, or he wasn’t\nOrholam.\nA wave of self-loathing crested over him, a tide of blood guilt as\nunending as the blood river coursing past his knees. Gavin didn’t deserve\nacceptance, forgiveness, or anything soft and good, certainly not love,\ncertainly not from Orholam Himself.\nHe sucked in a breath, and it was heavy with the stench of fresh blood. It\nwas time to end this. “You gave me a chance, before. Not one—hundreds.\nEvery voice that cried out and told me what my conscience had already\nshouted at me was another. You even put me in chains, but I saw myself as\nan emperor in chains, but never a slave. I could never see myself as a\nwretch, wretched as I was. ‘I wouldn’t give trash even to a beggar,’ You\nsaid. And You’re right. You want me? Fine. I’m yours. But not as a son. I\ndon’t deserve that. That’s not a punishment. Let me pay for all those deaths\nwith all my remaining life. Let me be Your slave.”\n“No,” Orholam said. “If I wished to rob humans of their will, would the\nworld be so full of trouble? No. Slavery is what happens when men act on\ntheir desire to be gods, and slavery shows what kind of gods you’d be. How\nabout a son who strives to be the best son he can be?”\n“Then I swear to honor and obey You with all my strength.”\n“Really?”\n“I’m Yours. To spend as You will.”\nDazen looked up and saw eyes harder than a hurricane sky. And he was\nreminded that all the temporal power of even the greatest emperor was but\nan intimation and premonition of the power and passion he beheld here.\n“Accomplish something with me, would You?” Dazen asked.\n“Conditions? Already?” Orholam asked, and His voice was soft as stone.\n“None except Your nature.” Dazen could only pray it was true, that he\nwasn’t as wrong about that as he had been about so much else. With a\ntrembling hand, he touched Orholam’s foot.\n“First, then,” Orholam said, “you’ve brought something detestable into\nMy presence. You cast away nine boon stones to make the leap here, but\nyou kept one.”\n“What?!”\n“Give Me the black boon stone.”"

At his eye.\nMother Dark herself. The black seed crystal that had become his eye.\nOrholam wanted that for tribute?\n“I’m… uh, You don’t want that,” Gavin said. He swallowed.\n“I want you to give it to Me.”\n“Give me some time and I’ll… I’ll devise a more fitting gift.” He was a\ncoward.\n“No, you won’t.”\n“Do You think I’m lying, or that I won’t be able to make a fitting gift?\nOn second thought, don’t answer that,” Gavin said with a weak grin.\nBut Orholam didn’t smile this time. “Is this what your obedience looks\nlike?”\n“I’ll die. Don’t You know what You’re asking?! I have nothing left—and\nYou’d demand…” But Gavin had fought enough. He was tired.\nHis hands slumped down into the blood.\nMaybe he’d see Sevastian now. Maybe he’d see Karris.\nHe’d sent Orholam rivers of blood—unasked for, he knew now, as his\nheart had always known. It was only right that Orholam should demand his\nown blood in return.\nHe sighed, and with his breath went out all defensiveness, all hope that\nhe could deceive his way out of this one.\nThe old Gavin finally, finally breathed his last, and died.\nDazen sank into the stones and bent back his head to stare into eyes that\nblazed with judgment hotter than the noonday sun.\nOrholam was nothing if not fast. He braced Dazen’s forehead with a\nhand, knotting his hair between His fingers to keep his head in place. Dazen\ncould feel the evil eye twist and buck in his skull of its own accord, as if it\nwere a living thing and it knew what was coming—\nThen Orholam’s hand stabbed into his face, and it felt like his hand went\ninto Dazen’s flesh whole, through and into his head.\nIt clamped down on the eye and wrenched.\nDazen gagged at the pain. Agony shot from eye to brain, down his neck\nand down his spine, everywhere through his chest and radiating through\nevery limb. As Orholam twisted His clenched fist, as if drawing out a\nparasitic worm, Dazen’s body bucked of its own accord. Every muscle\nclenched. He gagged, and his hands flew up to fight off his persecutor—\nBut he willed them be still. He flung his hands out and willed them stay\nspread as wide as if he were nailed in place.\nSomething gave within him, tore.\nOrholam’s fist turned over and over, like He was coiling rope around His\nhand. At the same time, like a wet cloth to a fevered man, Orholam’s other\nhand was cool on Dazen’s forehead. It was the only comfort in a world of\nsuffering.\nAnd then Orholam ripped the thing out of Dazen’s left eye socket and\nthrew it on the ground."

And it\nlived.\nShocked from being torn free and flung down to the ground, it twisted\nits form together now, at once like a lion crouching to pounce and a snake\ncoiling to strike. Baleful eyes, unblinking, blacker than the gathering night,\nstared primordial nyxian hatred at Dazen. It had been created to kill him if\nhe removed it, and from his knees, gasping still, breathless, frozen with\nhorror, there was no way Dazen could defend himself before it attacked.\nThe Thing lunged at his face—\nAnd things happened so fast Dazen could scarcely comprehend them.\nOrholam flashed suddenly colossal. He was the giant from Dazen’s dream,\nimmense beyond belief. And Dazen saw the fury in His sun-bright eyes, and\na fist the size of the tower itself came crashing down in judgment.\nOn his knees, Dazen barely fit between the fingers of the clenched fist as\nit smote the entire top of the tower.\nThe tower shook from the concussion. Thunder crashed, but it was\nthunder beyond mere sound. Every hair stood on end. The air itself shouted\nwith a triumphant yell. Lights fired in every color Dazen remembered and a\nmyriad he didn’t know—for one instant, even his color-blinded eye could\nsee. And a shock wave spread out, as great waves rippling in the ocean give\nan angle to see momentarily into the ocean’s depths, for an instant, Dazen\ncould see into the Thousand Worlds as if here his realm and the heavenly\nrealms overlapped. He could see figures, bloodied warriors joining a victory\nshout.\nAnd then… all was normal once more. That shock wave disappeared\ninto the distance in every direction, ripples in the pond of time, but Dazen\nstill knelt here. Orholam, masked as the old prophet once more, stood again\nbefore him, now looking oddly and entirely mundane.\nThe black Thing, broken now in a hundred places, writhed yet.\nAnd it twisted, relentlessly, toward Dazen.\nOrholam stepped forward and crushed its head under His foot.\nIt squirmed and snapped in its death throes, snapping at His heel, and\ndied.\nBut Orholam nonchalantly tore away the dead Thing and tossed it off the\ntower.\nHe turned and quirked a grin at Dazen, and though every crease\nremained on old Orholam’s face, and His teeth were just as crooked and\nstained as before—though nothing was changed—every seam of the old\nman’s visage leaked out glory.\nDazen dropped to his face.\nThe midnight, hungry stone beneath him seemed now merely bright\nblack.

You’ve had such a terrible\nattitude about prophets, so I made you one.” He lifted his eyebrows, and\nDazen, remembering he’d been told to get up, stood quickly.\n“Obedience,” Dazen said. “Yeah, not my strong suit.”\nOrholam looked at him levelly. Right, Orholam knew that.\n“What would You have me do, sir?” Dazen asked.\n“There’s one matter we must attend to first.”\n“Huh?”\n“Traditionally, pilgrims who deliver a boon stone may ask Me a boon.”\nI get to ask a… what? After all that? After what I just saw?\nBut his mouth was already running away, unmoored from sense. “Seems\nlike a stupid tradition, though, doesn’t it? I mean, ‘Here’s my pride rock,\nnow gimme stuff’?”\nOrholam laughed aloud, and Dazen was struck by the sound. He was\nactually enjoying Himself, as if talking with Dazen was something that\ncould bring Orholam joy. Absurd! And yet, here it was. “Traditions,”\nOrholam said, “like people, tend to fall short. I work with what I’m given.”\nHe was serious, and suddenly Dazen was baffled.\nWhat could he ask for? How could he dare ask more? He’d seen his\nbrother again. He’d been condemned to death and been given back life.\nIt wasn’t that there was nothing he wanted. He thought of them all now:\nHis fingers back. His eye to see again. His powers. His position. More than\nany of those, he wanted his wife and his son.\nHe thought of asking for them to survive. He thought of framing some\nrequest so broad and precisely legalistic that he might get back everything\ngood and nothing bad from his old life.\nHe would have done that, too. Old Gavin would have, that man of guile,\nthe master of land ways and sea ways, breaking the rules to win the game.\nBut here, after what he’d seen, it not only seemed witless to try to gull\nGod Himself, but it seemed breathtakingly ungrateful.\nDazen still wanted it all. He wanted everything good for those he loved\neven more. His mouth opened to ask for Karris and Kip to live, to thrive, to\nhave all that was good in the world.\nBut then he stopped as he gazed out toward the great seas and the reef\nthat circled this island. “They suffer?”\nHe didn’t have to clarify. Orholam knew how his mind skipped around"

Orholam knew how his mind skipped around\nand how it focused intently on things others ignored. The One who knew\nthe punchline to every joke knew Dazen spoke of the sea demons, the\nmonsters he could so easily have become, his predecessors in power and in\npride and in loss and in striving for what they could not have and what they\ncould not be.\n“They’ve chosen to be separated from Me forever,” Orholam said.\n“That’s one of the better descriptions of hell.”\nGavin had been a son of separation himself, where delicacies turned to\nash in your mouth. It was the land of madness and murder and a life drained\nof color. It was a life that was worse than death. “Then for my boon, I ask\nthat You cut their punishment short. Or their penance. Or whatever it is. I\nask that You release them from this suffering,” Dazen said, and he knew\nthat his words were a foolishness beyond understanding. What was wrong\nwith him?\n“You think they didn’t have a fair chance? That they didn’t know what it\nmeant when they made their choices?”\nDazen knew he was being audacious, presumptuous, but this, too, was\nhow he’d been made. “I know that people make choices about eternity\nbefore they understand what eternity means. I know I threw away a\nthousand second chances before I took the last one. I know they probably\nwon’t take it, but… what if they do? So for my boon, my lord, I beg that\nYou offer these undeserving one more chance.”\nOrholam studied him. “You stand broken and powerless, stripped of all\nyou loved, with all your world in the balance, your son and your wife\nfighting for their very lives, and for your boon you ask clemency for\nstrangers?”\n“My wife and son are Yours. If You don’t care for them even more than I\ndo, You’re not who You say You are. If You’re not who You say You are,\nwhat use is a boon? But I think You are. My wife and son are loved, by me\nand by You and by thousands of others. The sea demons…” He thought of\nthem: feeding on light itself but living in darkness, alone, outliving\neveryone who’d ever loved them, twisted into something hideous by their\nown choices.\nDazen’s heart emptied all at once, like a dam bursting and all his hopes\nrushing out, like he was doing something disastrous—but right. “The sea\ndemons aren’t strangers. They’re me.”\n“O Dazen,” Orholam said, and his voice was soft and his eyes were\nproud. “Here at your end, you are indeed a man after my own heart. So let it\nbe. Come. Your penance awaits.”\nChapter 123\nKip flexed his burn-scarred left hand, working the stiffness out of it before\ntaking the intricately engraved golden bar in his grip. It fit like they’d been\nmade for each other.\n“Breaker, I don’t mean to minimize the challenge you’re taking on\nthere,” Ferkudi said from the edge of the roof where he was looking out"

Superviolet’s gone,” Kip said.\nLiv had found her old loyalties were stronger than she’d expected after\nall. She’d withdrawn from the fight. Thank you, Liv.\nHe drafted superviolet and put his right hand on the other grip—and\nsuddenly felt his awareness cast out of his body as if he’d been catapulted\nfrom himself, far out into the ocean.\n“Whoa, whoa! What was that?!” He yanked his hands away from the\ngrips. It had not done that before. It was as if the presence of the bane had\nsomehow charged it up.\nEveryone was staring at him, unnerved.\n“Not that I’m surprised or anything,” he said with a weak smile.\n“Boss?” Ferkudi asked.\n“No worries,” Kip said. “I got this.” He checked himself. This wasn’t\nwhat had happened yesterday, but yesterday he’d practiced using only the\nbarest amount of superviolet and no other colors—knowing that the bane\nwould deny him the use of them. He’d already had so much to learn. The\nsuperviolet let him focus the mirrors. Today—dammit, when had he drafted\na little bit of blue? Probably just spectral bleed from the superviolet, and\nthis bluer-than-blue beautiful day.\nHe emptied himself of blue on the nub of hellstone he kept at his belt,\nthen tried again with only superviolet. Now he was simply directing the\nmirrors as he had yesterday.\nAndross had told Kip not to draft on the array, told him drafting with so\nmuch power at hand would burn him out in seconds or minutes. He was—\nirritatingly—surely right. But if Kip drafted not through the array but before\nhe touched it, and then it still worked without frying him, then maybe that\nwas worth exploring.\nSo he lifted his hand, drafted a bit of blue—and now he could cast his\nvision wherever he wanted.\nHe blew out an exasperated breath. Why did he always have to figure\nthings out the hard way? Could no one leave a short instruction book\nchained to these magical devices?\nThere was no time to waste, though.\nHe launched himself back to where Zymun had last focused the array,\nfar out in the sea, but saw nothing there.\nWhy that bit of the sea? No reason?\nZymun must have kicked the mirror array when they’d hauled him off it\nafter he’d blown his halos.\nKip drew his attention back to Big Jasper.\nThe array snapped into focus instantly, the entire thing lifting him bodily\non an articulated arm to point him wherever he willed.

This damn thing was\none of the wonders of the world. Of course it was: it had been made for the\nPrisms themselves. Probably it had been made so they could look out for\nbane.\nIf he were a Prism, if he could split light and draft as much as he\nwanted, this battle would be finished in ten minutes.\nDid Koios know that? Had the White King attacked now because he\nknew the Chromeria had no Prism to defend the Jaspers, or was he just that\nlucky?\nIt didn’t matter.\nKip’s vision had passed over the armada as he’d brought his will back to\nthe Jaspers, but now he went back. They were bombarding Big Jasper’s\ncannon towers. A gunner stood on deck, linstock in his hand.\nA spotlight the size of the gunner’s whole body suddenly lit him up as\nhundreds of mirrors turned toward him. He turned, shocked at the heat,\nthrowing his arm up in front his eyes at the glare.\nKip sharpened the focus convulsively.\nA beam of light no thicker than a thumb shot through the man’s upraised\narm and then out the back of his head.\nHe dropped, and every part of his head that passed through the beam as\nhe fell was burnt through. His open skull smoked on the deck, and a hissing\nfurrow was carved deep into the sea beyond him.\nKip’s self was pulled with it, as tightly focused as the beam itself,\nplunging into deep waters sizzling and hissing to steam. He pulled back.\nSomeone was yelling at him, but he realized he’d done the wrong thing.\nHe didn’t have time to kill men one by one. He widened his focus.\nIn a broad spotlight that encompassed the entire ship, where men were\nstanding agog, a hundred hands put up in front of eyes in the same way the\ngunner had, Kip found an open barrel of black powder on the deck behind\nthe cannons.\nHe tightened the beam once more.\nThe powder keg exploded in his face.\nHe threw himself back as the explosion overwhelmed him.\nHis hands came away from the grips and he found himself in his own\nbody once more.\n“The storm, Breaker! The lightstorm! Kip!” Ben-hadad was yelling.\n“Come on, brother!”\n“You’re back?” Kip asked, blinking. “When did you get back? Did you\nget Zymun?”\n“No,” Ben-hadad said. He seemed relieved Kip had finally heard him.\n“They’re regrouping. We think they’re going to attack us up here—it\ndoesn’t matter. Kip, you gotta do something about the lightstorm.”\n“Lightstorm? Oh, right!”\nSuperviolet was so alien, so orderly, and so damned curious that Kip had\nbeen working his way from the small-scale applications to the larger ones\nwithout even fully realizing it. He’d momentarily lost regular human\nconcern—like for the crackling, seething sapphire tornado streaming\nupward from the seas around the blue bane.\nHe turned away from the exploded, burning, sinking ship and moved his\nwill to the skies.\nWithin the brewing blue lightstorm were tens of thousands of razor-"

Some smaller, some heavier, different shapes\nfrom square caltrops to edged planes to spikes.\nIt all spoke of a mind that was experimenting. Curious. And new to what\nit was doing, just as Kip was—but also as sharp as the razor rain itself\nwould be, because this storm was almost ready now. It was ready long\nbefore any of the other incipient storms brewing over the other bane.\nKip hadn’t willjacked anyone in a long time. It was counted too\ndangerous to be taught to nunks like he’d been when he’d left the Jaspers.\nBut it had also been one of the first things he’d ever done.\nWill-Breaker, they’d joked about him, long ago. And Andross had\nrepeated it, not joking at all.\nWe’ll see about that.\nKip charged at the blue lightstorm with all the bristling fur and snarls\nand momentum of a turtle-bear. He caught the Mot completely unawares,\nand blasted her off her feet, scattering her powers completely. He knew her\nthen as Samila Sayeh, the instant his will collided into her and snatched\naway the reins.\nShe’d been lifting the entire storm to bring it down on the defenders at\nthe walls. Kip snatched it away and brought it down on the sub-red bane\nfloating next to the blue and on the armada’s ships nearby.\nFist-sized blades fell from the sky, cutting the air with a frightful sound,\nthousands of edged weapons falling unexpectedly from the sky. Bodies\nwere slashed; timbers chipped and exploded under the relentless rain.\nThe sub-red bane blossomed with fire at each strike. Every sub-red\ncrystal in its surface had to be sealed from the air lest it burn openly. The\nrazor rain cut them open.\nMen and drafters and even wights howled at the intensity of the sudden\nflames. It was too much heat and fire for most of them to redirect away\nfrom themselves, so fireworkers though they were, they burned to death.\nTheir leader, the Anat, lost his concentration. The lightstorm he’d been\ngathering spun away from his hands; the sealed sub-red crystals he’d been\ngently wafting upward lest he break them simply escaped.\nKip quickly dropped one hand from the mirror array to suck in a bit of\nsub-red.\nOnly then, disengaged from the array, did he hear the clash of arms\nnearby, the grunts of men fighting, the thud of fists on flesh.\nThe frame whipped him around in an instant, and he saw that the\nLightguards were trying to reclaim the roof. They must have made an\nunexpected push, because a dozen of them had made it onto the roof.\nA Lightguard dove off to one side, where his musket had fallen. All of\nKip’s men were already engaged, either fighting or trying to block the door\nonce again.

The Lightguard scrambled to his feet, right at the edge of the\ntower, and lifted the musket toward Kip.\nBig Leo’s chain crashed upward, knocking the musket toward the sky as\nit discharged, and then wrapping up around the Lightguard’s body and head,\nsmashing his arms against his chest.\n“Ignore us!” Big Leo shouted as he hauled the man effortlessly into his\nown waiting elbow with the sound of cracking bones. “Help them!”\nAnd so Kip did.\nAs fast as his attention shifted, so, too, did Kip’s position. The frame\nsnapped around and pointed him back to the sub-red lightstorm.\nIt hadn’t gotten away yet.\nKip snatched it up and flung the mass of delicate crystals down toward\nthe sea and the armada, not daring to throw it toward the red bane, lest the\ngod there redirect it as easily as Kip had.\nThen he caught sight of the Anat himself, hands skyward, confused. Kip\nhadn’t even crossed wills with him, merely picked up the storm after he’d\nlet it go from his nerveless fingers.\nBut now, seeing Anat so exposed, Kip brought the mirrors to bear.\nConcentrated light stabbed through the god, and he burst into flames.\nHe staggered about in the flames in agony and his mouth opened. He\nmust surely be shrieking, but Kip heard no sound through the array.\nOne down. Five to go, and then the Wight King himself.\nThe next ones were going to be harder. They were going to be aware of\nhim coming now, and of what he could do. The Wight King himself was\ncurrently too far away, out on his dragon-ship, for the tower to make a\nburning beam, or Kip would have gone after him right away. But Kip\nexulted nonetheless.\nFor the first time, he dared to think he might make it through this, after\nall.\nHe could do this. He was made for this.\nNext!\nChapter 124\n“This can’t be happening!” Ben-hadad cried from beside the musket-ball-\nriddled door. “I lost my knee on this stupid roof last time. I am not—”\nHe spun in and leveled his crossbow directly at the face of a roaring\nLightguard charging the door. He was back to the doorframe’s shelter\nbefore Big Leo even heard the twang or the thunk of crossbow bolt hitting\nface.\nThe door shook from the force of the Lightguard’s falling body.\nAt the beginning, they’d tried not to use lethal force. They didn’t want\nwar—not even with the Lightguards. Not today.\nBut protecting Breaker was more important. After several of the\nLightguards had spilled onto the roof and one attempted to shoot Breaker,\nall bets were off.\nThey were doing this damn thing again. But this time, they knew how to\nflee. They just couldn’t.\nMusket balls rattled into the door once more. Twelve muskets, right\nnow. Either eleven or twelve had fired, and with their reload speed—\nHe shouted through the door, “You poor bastards. Fighting us? You’re\njust gonna die! I mean, look at this!

My\ngrandmother can shoot better than this.” Ben poked his head in front of the\nhole he’d just shot through to stare at them spitefully. “You don’t shoot for\nthe door, you morons; you shoot for the holes in the door. You know, so you\ncould maybe hit someone?”\nHe jerked his head away half a heartbeat before the hole splintered once,\ntwice, and again. Other shots thudded into the door.\nFerkudi looked askance at him from the other side of the door-frame. “I\nthink you win it again, Ben.”\n“What’s that?” Ben-hadad asked, drawing his sea-demon-bone crossbow\neasily. With will, he tightened the string until one dial for each string\nshowed the appropriate tension. He fitted bolts into each channel. Toward\nthe door, he yelled, “That’s better! At this rate, you’ll be through this door\nby Sun Day next year. Nicely done!” He poked his head briefly in front of\nthe hole again.\nIt splintered instantly.\n“Someone’s onto me,” Ben-hadad said appreciatively. He rubbed at a\nstreak of blood a flying splinter had left on his forehead. “Wait, what were\nyou saying, Ferk? What do I win?”\n“Stupidest Smart Guy in the Mighty. Are you joking with this? What are\nyou trying to prove, Ben?”\n“C’mon, Ferk. It’s all part of my cunning plan.”\n“Cunning plan? To get your head shot off?”\n“Nah. The hole wasn’t big enough. Didn’t want to risk my life to widen\nit myself. Besides, if they keep shooting at the door, we’re not going to\nhave anything to defend here.”\n“Hole? What?”\n“Cover on three?”\nFerkudi nodded, lifting up his blunderbuss. “Two,” he said.\nBen-hadad pulled a fist-sized grenado from a pouch, all swirling with\nred and yellow luxin. He pulled the string to allow the two ingredients to\nmix.\nOn one, Ferkudi poked the bell-shaped muzzle of the blunderbuss\nagainst one of the holes he’d shot through before. Everyone on the other\nside took cover as his shot rang out, spraying hot metal into the hallway and\ntheir faces.\nA moment later, Ben-hadad’s large grenado sailed through. He instantly\ndropped to the ground, not because he was injured but to look through a\nhole that had been shot low in the door.\nThere was a shattering as of glass, then a whoosh of fire, then screams.\nThe discharge of a musket.\n“Damn, I’m good,” Ben-hadad said. He stood up—easily, due to Finer’s\nbraces, which he wore on each knee now, though not without pain—and\npoked his crossbow up the hole. Each string twanged in turn. He rested his\nback against the doorframe once more and looked over at Ferkudi with a\nwaggle of his eyebrows. “Mmm?” Ben-hadad prompted.\n“Let me guess. Two headshots?” Ferkudi said."

I’ve been calling them—” Ben-\nhadad asked.\n“No reputable witnesses,” Ferkudi said.\n“Are you—”\nBut then they both cut off at a sudden distortion in the air. It passed\nthrough both of them as if an enormous wave had passed, bending all\nreality. For a moment, it was as if they’d been color-blind for all their lives\nand were suddenly seeing—seeing not just the world but into realms\nbeyond the world.\nAnd then the shock wave passed like a ripple in the pond of time,\nheading rapidly west.\n“Anyone know what that was?” Ferkudi asked.\n“No!” Big Leo barked. “Hold the door!”\nChapter 125\nThe red bane was in disarray. The Dagnu had been intending to attack with\nAnat, Red with its brother color Sub-red, but with Anat dead, Dagnu now\nwas scattered and stupid with rage. It would take him several more minutes\nbefore he could attack.\nIn the meantime, the orange was launching a storm of pure horror at the\nisland. Shapes congealed and morphed in the very clouds, dropping from\nthe sky toward Big Jasper like the shot from a trebuchet.\nKip drafted a bit of orange to get ready for the combat, forgetting to take\nhis hand from the mirror array first.\nIn an instant, a burning like brandy gives your throat and gut flashed\nthrough his entire body. He’d tried for just a taste of orange; he’d just\nquaffed a full tankard.\nHe’d surely burned through a third of his halo.\nIt left him gasping, nearly gagging.\nHis hands dropped from the array as he grunted and struggled to breathe.\nThere was musket fire here, the sound of the Mighty, talking, tense but not\npanicked. He could understand no more than that, so dazed was he from the\namount of luxin he’d just burnt himself with. He gasped, huffing. Then,\nshaking himself like a turtle-bear who’d just taken a blow to the snout and\nwas shocked that anyone would dare such a thing, Kip grabbed the array\nagain and launched himself at the orange bane.\nWhere are you, Molokh?\nIt wasn’t hard to find. Though shielded from a mirror strike behind the\nbulk of a castle-like superstructure, Kip could follow the djinn’s hold on its\nlux storm.\nKip hit the Molokh with such righteous fury he could feel the man\nbowled off his feet. The last thing a slippery orange ever wanted was a\ndirect confrontation—and Kip brought it, screaming all his psychic fury at\nwhat the Blood Robes were attempting.

The other half he threw at the yellows.\nThey liked to believe themselves perfectly balanced between emotion\nand reason. Now they found out how many of them were only deluding\nthemselves.\nThis is why the old gods of the nine kingdoms kept to their own lands,\nKip thought. They were always the greatest threat to one another. With the\norange coursing through him, he could feel the connections between the\nbane and all their magic, not just the logical ones but the emotional ones as\nwell. He could also hear through the array now.\nOh, you’ve got to be kidding.\nOf course. His time with the cards had prepared him for this: Blue gave\nsight in the array, just as it did with tapping the cards. Superviolet gave the\nstructure and logic of the array and of the world itself. Orange had given\nhim smell and a sense of the others in the world. So green would give\ntouch, the sense of embodiment. Yellow would let him hear. Red would be\ntaste; and sub-red pure emotion.\nKip sought Corvan Danavis’s command structure at the Great Fountain,\nand found it immediately. He looked for the figure of the general himself\nand found his awareness covered three-quarters of the distance between\nthem, and then all of it. He could see Corvan barking directions rapid-fire to\none man and then another. He could see the lines on the man’s face. But he\ncouldn’t hear him.\nOpening his awareness the smallest quantum to yellow—which\ntranslated to two of the smaller mirrors automatically dropping a yellow\nlens into their light streams—Kip could suddenly hear Danavis shouting,\n“—two hours until dark. You have to hold the walls until then. No\ndrafting!”\nTouching a bit of every other color brought all his senses together, just\nas the cards had taught him. He could cast some semblance of his self to\nany part of the Jaspers almost instantaneously.\nOh, he was going to kick ass now!\nEven as he gathered his next attack, he could see that the Wight King\nmust have sent urgent messages out. The bane were changing tack. The\ngreat, devastating lightstorms were being dissipated or hurled back out into\nthe seas by the very gods who’d generated them.\nThey’d finally figured out that Kip would use their greatest weapon\nagainst themselves.\nHe cursed. Maybe he could get one last bane before the lux storms got\naway.\nBut as his will jumped through the array once more, he noticed\nsomething unexpected. Samila Sayeh was back in the blue bane. She was so\ndamned resilient, she’d returned to the battle immediately, and this time she\nwouldn’t be taken unawares.\nWorse, the Sub-red was moving again. What?!

His will jumped across the gap, and he\ncould still see the body, but hidden from his line of sight—deliberately, no\ndoubt—there was another will here, taking control. Another Anat. A woman\nhad simply stepped forward into the old one’s place, taking up the mantle as\neasily as one would pick up a crown and settle it on one’s head.\nThere was no telling which of its powers she could use, but at least she\ncould make it move. It seemed that as long as there was a sub-red wight\nwith the will for it, there would be no end to the Anats. Kip would have to\nkill every last wight here.\nNo!\nWhat had seemed so easy moments ago suddenly felt impossible. There\nwas no way Kip could kill every single wight attacking Big Jasper. Even\nGavin couldn’t have done that!\nKip stopped altogether, watching with growing tightness in his throat.\nEach bane was an island unto itself, an eighth the size of Big Jasper.\nThey had surrounded Big Jasper and they covered much of its shoreline, the\nblue bane pressing from Cannon Island to the seawall, sealing West Bay. It\nglittered like cut sapphires in the sun and crept forward on a million\ncrystalline teeth, each sprouting off its leading edge, being smashed forward\nby the weight of the bane behind it, and digging in, devouring territory like\na hungry mouth. Around a great central tower, great faceted stalagmites\nsprouted everywhere. At the island’s edge, those shards shattered ships and\ndocks, soon to roll over homes and bodies.\nThe green bane lay in a tentacled mass of vegetation and horror south of\nthe blue, across the wall from the neighborhood of Weasel Rock. The\nyellow, blinding as it flashed from liquid to solid to light, and the orange\nbane, dull as an oil slick but just as iridescent and oddly fascinating under\nthe weight of its hexes, were on the south and southeast sides of the island.\nRed and sub-red together sealed East Bay, making a conflagration that\nsmoked and steamed as it hit the water, bubbling ever forward like lava\nmeeting the sea.\nIf killing the chief wight of each color didn’t stop the bane, what could?\nThe seed crystals. They had to shatter the seed crystals. They were what\nempowered the wights to become nearly gods. They were what spawned\nand controlled the entire magical islands that were the bane.\nKip threw his will toward the green bane now clambering up the very\nwalls with great wet roots like tentacles, shattering rock and burying\ndefenders. He’d barely made it to the surface of the bane when something\nthere knocked him off his feet with incredible force. It seemed to grab at\nhim, sucking him toward it.\nSomeone—some thing—was trying to willjack him.\nKip hit back instantly, but it was like punching a brick wall. He slammed\nagainst it again and again, but he felt it clinging to him, clinging to green,\npulling him in, in. His mind felt bloodied from his strikes, dazed, and the\ngreen’s grip on him only strengthened.\nHe felt probing against his mind, as if yellow were reaching out for him,\ntoo, with glee."

He dropped his hands from the array’s grips as if they\nwere hot coals.\n“What was that?!” Big Leo asked.\n“Did you feel it, too?” Kip asked. “Same thing as at Ru, wasn’t it?”\n“Breaker, there’s blood coming from your ears.”\nKip touched his ears and looked at the wetness on his fingers. “Just\nblood,” he said. “Not spinal fluid.”\nNot that bleeding from your ears is good.\n“Zymun’s here with his drafters!” Ben-hadad called from where he\nstood beside the door to the roof. The door itself was mere splinters now,\nheld together with every color of luxin, put into some honeycombed pattern\nBen-hadad must have made up.\n“Stop all your drafting now,” Kip commanded. “Something’s changed.\nTheir influence is spreading over the islands even now. And move.”\nIn moments, he was going to lose the ability to draft any color at all. So\nhe threw everything he had into doubling and tripling the strength of the\nbarricade Ben-hadad and the others had drafted in front of the door.\nThen he turned his will back to Big Jasper. Samila Sayeh was charging\nup her own tower, halfway to the top, and somehow seemed at war with\nsome unseen figure for control of her own bane-island. She had the blue\nseed crystal in her hand.\nKnowing it might be the last chance he had to draft at all, Kip used the\nmirror to hurl a spear of sub-red and red interlaced into solid flame at her\nand the blue bane’s central tower.\nIt felt like he’d walked past a catapult’s release lever and nudged it;\ninstead of throwing a stone, it threw every bit of red and sub-red luxin Kip\nmight have been able to draft in forty years, all at once.\nBut he felt like he’d been kicked just as he released the burning spear.\nHe was spinning in the array.\nFor a long moment, Kip held still, gasping. His eyes throbbed. He could\ntell he’d gone from the occasional drafter of fire to suddenly now straining\nhis halos in both sub-red and red.\n“Who grabbed the array!” Kip yelled. “Who spun me?! Who the hell\nspun me?!”\nAs his eyes cleared, he looked at the Mighty. They appeared as baffled\nas he was.\nIf he hadn’t physically been spun, and he hadn’t willed himself to spin,\nthen only superviolet hijacking the controls could have done that.\nAt that moment, something like a shock wave passed over them. Like an\nimmense ocean swell, bending vision, Kip suddenly could see realities\noverlaid as they’d overlaid the world when he’d been at death’s door before.\nWithout spectacles, he could see superviolet tentacles reaching down\nfrom above, withdrawing by the moment, as if caught out. He spun within\nthe array and saw her there: in the air, high above him, floating on an\ninvisible bane, was the woman who’d once been Aliviana Danavis.\nLiv."

With her was a creature of immense proportions,\nmasquerading as a small, unctuous thing. It held the superviolet seed\ncrystal.\nAnd now, everywhere Kip looked, he saw them, with every bane.\nImmortals. This was why the colors were locking down. Koios’s most\nimportant wights knew some of the bane’s powers, but the old gods—the\nimmortals behind the old gods—they knew all of their powers.\nNow those immortals had come to join the fight.\nKip saw at least one for each color, all of them exposed, momentarily,\nby the great wave passing over Big Jasper, all of them with alarm etched\nover their once-beautiful faces, looking east to the source of that wave.\nIf the superviolet could take control of the mirrors as it had just tried to\ndo, this battle was finished.\nKip brought his will and all the light collected by several thousand\nmirrors upon the superviolet thing reaching down for him.\nThe superviolet bane was as subtle and fragile as a shameful secret. It\nblasted apart under the sledge of Kip’s attack like fine porcelain.\nBut Kip didn’t withdraw after one attack. His attention focused hard on\nthat entire floating island of beautiful, breakable crystals. It was like letting\nthe Turtle-Bear off its leash in a crockery shop.\nHis will burrowed through the superviolet island, leaving trenches of\nshattered luxin all the way down to the waves, shearing off huge sections\nthat dropped toward the waters. The immortal was recovering from its\nshock, but seemed leashed to stay within some certain distance of Liv. So it\nleapt this way and that like a mad dog on a chain.\nUntil Kip found it, seized it, and with his will like one big paw, he\nseized the sharp, spiny seed crystal and squeezed it as it twisted snakelike in\nhis grasp.\nAll the mirrors of the island focused to that one point the size of Turtle-\nBear’s fist, and the seed crystal blew apart.\nThe reaction was instantaneous. The entire superviolet island fell to dust.\nLiv fell from the sky, and Kip lost her.\nThat’s the goal. That’s how we win.\nWe can do that.\nWith a mere thought, Kip triggered the escape chains out to Big Jasper\nand Cannon Island, then he dropped the handles of the array.\n“Listen to me,” he said to the Mighty as the chains spooled out\nflawlessly. Karris’s repairs were perfect.\nThey all looked at him. With the door to the roof seemingly\nimpregnable, there was for the moment nothing at all for them to do.\n“‘Avoid battle, seek victory,’ remember?” Kip asked. He knew they did.\n“I was doing this all backward. I’m not my father. I’m no Gavin Guile, the\nPromachos who goes ahead of everyone else and fights alone. I’m Kip\nGuile, and the only way we can win is if we fight together. I’ve been raised\nhere for one reason. I don’t know if I’m the Lightbringer, but I know I can"

I don’t know if I’m the Lightbringer, but I know I can\nbring you light.” Kip looked every one of them in the eye in turn. “You’re\ngoing to hate my next orders, but if you don’t follow them, everyone on this\nisland is going to die.”\nChapter 126\n“We don’t defend,” Karris said, taking weapons from Commander Fisk.\n“We attack.”\nNo one looked at her like she was insane. Orholam have mercy, but they\ntrusted her.\nShe thought again about the Lightguards they’d left behind, tied up in a\nstoreroom, guarded by nervous civilians who probably would lose their\ncourage as soon as they lost their Iron White’s presence. Part of her had\nwanted to execute them on the spot, especially their greasy commander,\nAram.\nThe Iron White, murdering a crippled captive?\nForget it, it was done.\nAs she led her people to the Lily’s Stem, she unsealed the adhesive to\nthe eye caps she hadn’t worn in a long time and applied them around her\neyes. She dispatched messengers to Corvan Danavis, which forced her to go\nwith her gut. She couldn’t wait for messages to go back and forth; she had\nto make a choice now, and let Corvan know what she was going to do.\nHer luxiats had dug up everything they could find about the seed crystals\nand the bane. It hadn’t been much, but some ancient writer had taken care to\npreserve a line revealing that shattering the seed crystals could break the\nbane when they were small. He or she had guessed that it would work even\nwhen they were large.\nKarris herself was a red/green bichrome, and she didn’t know how much\nthose bane might mess with her if she attacked them—but the blue bane\nwas right here, floating jammed in the strait between Cannon Island and Big\nJasper, grinding slowly through as if it had will. It looked like it was trying\nto move directly onto Little Jasper.\nShe didn’t have anything else to go on.\n“Blue! Let’s go!” she said.\n“High Lady! Wait one moment!” a voice called out behind her.\nShe spied a man carrying a large satchel, running from the Chromeria\ntoward her. Andross’s slave Grinwoody?\n“High Lady, please, let me accompany you. Please. I made a promise\nthat I wouldn’t leave your side today.”\n“What? No,” Karris said. “What’s the promachos doing?”\n“He’s in the infirmary, High Lady. Deathly ill. I’m afraid he’s been\npoisoned. Before he lost consciousness, he was angry with me for not\nstopping it. Ordered me to get out of his sight. Demanded I go serve you\nand get myself killed if I could. I dare not disobey him. I dare not be there\nwhen he wakes… if he wakes, Mistress.”\nGrinwoody looked utterly miserable.\nThe Order! Karris swore. They were everywhere. Dammit!\nAndross wasn’t easy to work with, but today was a day when the\nChromeria needed all hands to work defending it."

Dammit!\nAndross wasn’t easy to work with, but today was a day when the\nChromeria needed all hands to work defending it.\n“I trained with the Blackguard,” Grinwoody said. “And yes, it was long\nago, but I’m not useless in a fight.” He opened a satchel and handed out a\nfortune’s worth of lux torches in every color to the Blackguards, and the\nfinest Ilytian pistols. “Please. I owe Gavin a debt. He did me a, a great favor\nonce. Let me fight beside you.”\nWell, Karris had just been thinking how she needed every hand possible\nto defend the Chromeria. She nodded sharply, not turning from studying the\nblue bane where it lay in the water. She looked hard at the topography of\nthe thing, its bristling porcupine shards sticking into the air and confusing\nthe eye about the underlying structure, but she could see that it rippled and\nfolded as the structure slowly crawled up and down the hills and valleys of\nthe seabed beneath it.\nBlue drafters were already attacking the walls, being answered with\nsmall arms and small cannon fire, and being mostly repulsed, though the\nenemy drafters were less concentrating on the attack and more simply\nbuilding a series of interlocking ramps for those behind them to follow.\nWhen the main attack came, there would be no scaling ladders—the\nsoldiers, drafters, and wights would attack at speed.\nThe defenders were trying to blow apart that blue luxin as fast as it was\ndrafted, and all the drafters they could hit, too.\nAnd she suddenly had a plan. She was no blue drafter, but she’d always\nhad an affinity for the blue virtues. She knew how blues thought: rational,\nlogical, straight lines.\nSo she’d be circuitous.\nThey ran together through Big Jasper at the speed Blackguards run, but\nshe decided to make a stop before they reached the wall. It took two stops\ninstead, and two baffled shopkeepers who initially thought they were\nlooters. Grinwoody, who’d fallen behind on the run, caught back up in the\nsecond shop. And though winded, he wasn’t exhausted, nor did he\ncomplain. Pretty good for an old man.\nThen they made it to the walls, to the side of where the main attack was\ncoming. The nearest commander looked delighted at getting Blackguards to\nreinforce his line, then baffled.\n“High Lady?” he asked, stunned to see her here herself.\n“I’m not here to help. Not directly,” she said. She was already sliding a\nknife down her tunic, splitting the silk, then tearing it off to expose the\nmirror armor beneath. The Blackguards had it easier, merely shucking off\ntheir tunics and trousers, exposing their own mirror armor beneath.\n“Maybe now’s a good time to tell us the plan?” Commander Fisk asked.\n“We’ve got Blackguards posted on Cannon Island. We go save them.”\n“What are the blue cloaks and dresses for?” he asked.\n“The blue bane will be our bridge to charge over to Cannon Island.”\n“They’ll see us coming as soon as we cross over the wall,” Fisk said.\n“Yep.”\n“They’ll know exactly what we’re doing.”"

But here’s the key: that hill right there makes a\nvalley right behind it where they’ll lose sight of us before we climb back up\nto Cannon Island. When we get into that valley, six of us don the blue\nclothes as camouflage, and we skirt around the back of the blue bane out of\nsight. The rest of you go on and save Cannon Island. We go in the opposite\ndirection and stab them in the back.”\nThey immediately froze up. There was one impossibility to her plan. It\ninvolved them leaving the White. They were Blackguards.\n“No, she’s right,” Gill Greyling said, speaking up for the first time.\n“Sometimes the best way to protect your ward is to leave her.”\nCommander Fisk rapidly picked out six Blackguards—all fast, and\nrather than picking massive, wide-bodied men, he picked only those with\nmore slender body types, who’d be harder to spot among the forest of blue\ncrystal trees. He made himself the seventh choice.\n“Seven?” she asked.\n“Lucky number,” he said.\nAs for that, she herself and Grinwoody would actually make it a pagan\nnine, which might well be the wights’ lucky number—but now wasn’t the\ntime to quibble.\n“Our goal is the seed crystal,” Karris told her people in case she died\nbefore the job was finished. “Killing the Mot is secondary. When we kill the\nseed crystal, the entire bane-island will turn to dust. So when you feel that\nblue crystal go, get ready to swim.”\n‘When,’ she’d said, not ‘if.’\nChapter 127\n“We don’t defend,” Kip said. “We attack.” He was already back in the\nmirror array. “I’ll slave a light to each of you with superviolet. They might\nnot check until too late. You’ll maybe get one chance to draft—just one.\nYou reach up with your will, and you’ll get lit up with your color, as much\nas you can use, and all the wights around you will be drowned in the worst\ncolors for them. The bane will react. They’ll shut you down within seconds,\nso only use this as a last resort, and then empty yourself with black or you\nwill die, got it?”\nThey didn’t ask stupid questions.\nKip looked around at them quickly. Dammit, but Kip could really use\nTeia’s skills now. He really could use Cruxer’s, too—but there was no time\nto think about that. You use what you’ve got.\n“Ferkudi,” Kip said. Ferkudi was a blue/green bichrome and thus\nsusceptible to control from either of those colors. “Go kill the red bane. The\nDagnu wears the seed crystal on a necklace. You kill the god, smash the\ncrystal. The bane will fall apart and everyone’ll be able to draft red again.”\nBig Leo was a sub-red and red. “Big Leo, you go to the blue. There’s a"

There’s a\nsquad there that’s about to need help badly. Smash the blue seed crystal.\n“Winsen, green is yours. Try stealth. The seed crystal’s hidden at the top\nof the highest tree-thing. The Atirat’s important, but it’s a distant second.”\nBen-hadad was a blue/green/yellow polychrome. “Ben, I killed the\nMolokh, but a new one’s stepping up. Destroy the orange seed crystal. Wait\n—on second thought, orange and sub-red both have new masters. It’ll take a\nfew minutes for us to figure out how adept they are with their new powers.\nYou make your own call once you get down to Big Jasper.”\n“Got it,” Ben-hadad said. Of all the Mighty, Kip knew he could trust\nBen to figure out the best strategy while weighing his own and the others’\ncapabilities.\nEinin was an orange/red/sub-red polychrome, which meant Kip couldn’t\nsend his newest Mighty against either of the softer targets. “Einin, you’re on\nyellow. That one might be the most likely to be a one-way trip. You up for\nthat?”\n“With all due respect, milord, fuck off. I pull my weight,” she said. She\ndidn’t raise her voice; she was just done with being the new kid.\nKip said, “Glad to hear it. I’m signaling High General Danavis to give\nall of you a distraction as soon as possible. May help, may not. I’ve already\nsignaled for backup from the Cwn y Wawr. They may come, may not.\nThings are hot down there.”\nHe slaved mirrors to each of them, and a red one to Danavis, too, for\ngood measure.\n“This is what we need to do? You’re sure?” Big Leo asked. He wanted\nto fight Kip, wanted to say he should stay by his side, but he also trusted\nhim to lead.\nCruxer would’ve never left, no matter what. But Cruxer was a pain in\nthe ass.\n“It is,” Kip said. “Mighty… This is it. We aren’t all coming back from\nthis one.” They all looked back, unflinching. “I love you bastards. Now, go\nmake Cruxer proud.”\nThey didn’t linger. They were warriors. They were veterans. They’d\nalready said everything they’d been able to say to each other, and\nunderstood all those things they couldn’t say. So now they nodded to one\nanother one last time. Saluted Big Leo. Saluted Kip.\nFerkudi gave hugs, because—well, Ferkudi.\nThen they loaded up in turn, and whooshed off the tower toward their\ntargets. Winsen went alone, but the rest of them were followed by\nwhichever of the probationary Mighty were of the appropriate colors and\nwere physically able to go.

He was confined now to using the mirrors for a fraction\nof their power, but he could still burn wights one at a time, still signal, and\nstill bathe whole groups of wights coming over the walls in their opposite\ncolors to make things difficult for them.\nIt didn’t always stop them even from drafting, but it did confuse them,\nand it gave Danavis’s defenders a small edge, one neighborhood at a time.\nTwenty green wights were climbing the wall over at Weasel Rock,\nclimbing, dropping down to the ground, and bouncing up ever higher until\nthey reached the very edge. Kip turned fifty mirrors to send bursts of white\nlight straight into their faces as they pulled over the wall. Blinded, they\ngave the defenders atop the wall a chance to cut them down.\nAt East Bay, dozens of red wights with burning hands were hurling\nfireball after fireball. Kip turned mirrors to flood them with blue.\nFists went up and defenders turned toward the sources—blue drafters.\nDanavis had stationed blue drafters opposite the red bane, superviolets\nacross from sub-red, red across from the blue, and so forth to minimize the\nproximity and hopefully the impact of the bane on the drafters.\nAs those blue drafters started drafting—why were they drafting?!\nThey’d been ordered not to touch blue! But maybe they were just that\ndesperate. Maybe there was something in that neighborhood worth their\nlives to save.\nKip felt more than saw something emanate from the blue bane toward\nthem—a thousand tendrils of paryl. Those were the strings through which\nthe blue drafters could be paralyzed.\nHow did the bane do that? What was the mechanism? If Kip could see\nhow the bane reached out to control the drafters of their color. He could stop\nit.\nOrholam’s balls. Paryl, the master color. Of course. The immortals could\nuse paryl, at least when in conjunction with the bane. He didn’t know how it\nworked, but he didn’t have to exactly.\nMaybe there was still hope here.\nKip slapped that wave back, ripped it apart with paryl himself.\nThen he blinked, blinded from having opened his pupils so wide.\nIf paryl was half of the answer…\nWith chi, he could see written in the very bodies of the drafters what\ncolors they used and how much they were holding. He could see through\nwalls.\nHe sank into the fight.\nThe situation was desperate—wights and Blood Robe drafters were\npouring over the walls in half a dozen areas, but now Kip had a tool. The\nblue drafters in East Bay could, for the first time in the battle, actually draft.\nAnd they did.\nThe control began sliding back out of Kip’s grasp immediately, and he\nshot messages in brief flashes of light to the blue drafters—but he knew\nnow that he could do this, at least once, with each of the colors in turn.\nIt might be enough to make it until sundown.\nIt might be enough to give the Mighty a chance to kill those things.\nCorvan had made no distractions thus far, but Kip himself could be one."

Kip slaved mirrors in those colors to\nhim.\nThose red wights were low on their source. Kip flooded them with yet\nmore blue.\nKip put whole neighborhoods under diffuse green.\nHe fried a Blood Robe marksman’s hands as he tried to take a shot at\nCorvan Danavis from a nearby rooftop.\nKip’s eyes felt like he’d not blinked in many minutes. His bones felt hot\nfrom chi. This was ruining him, he knew. Already colors felt dangerous, his\nhalos straining. He checked the position of the sun.

If the battle stretched into a second\nday, they’d lose, because Kip wouldn’t be there to fight regardless.\nThere was no time for reflection or regret. Nothing was static on the\nbattlefields of Big Jasper. Already the wights were reacting, and the gods\nthemselves were, too. One tried to willjack Kip in paryl, and he barely\nslipped away.\nBelow, Corvan Danavis was moving forces and slipping men through\nneighborhoods that were disconnected from the battle zones.

While Kip had been sunken into the\narray, Zymun’s men had taken the tower.\n“Looks like you did some good work here,” Zymun said, looking out\nover the islands. “Looks like we’re winning!”\n“Winning?” Kip asked. “Maybe for the moment, but I have to\nconsolidate our—”\n“Everyone,” Zymun said to the men around him, “when you’re asked, I\ndid all this.

I’m gonna burn you, Kip, as I’ve been\ntrying to burn you since I lit the fires at Rekton.”\nKip almost went blank with fury, but he came back to himself. “I don’t\nmean killing me.

Too\nlate.\nZymun flung the man off the edge and turned immediately, not even\nwatching him fall.\nPointing at Kip, he said, “We do not leave an enemy like this holding the\nbiggest weapon in the goddam world. Do you morons understand?”\nThey understood.\n“I, the Prism, will save us personally,” Zymun said. “Aram, can you\nhandle a small task for me, or are you going to louse it up like you did the\nlast one?”\n“Anything, High Lord Prism. To the death.”\n“Good. Send our people to seize the towers’ Mirror Rooms. Send the\nrest with us. I want no rescue. And find his wife while you’re at it. I’m\ngoing to put my brother up on Orholam’s Glare. We’re gonna watch him\nburn.”\n“Yes, my Lord Prism,” Aram said, and Kip could feel all the cripple’s\nbitterness seething and bubbling with joy. “Gladly, sir.”\nChapter 128\n“Why are they being so slow?” Gill Greyling asked. “They can’t have\nmissed us, can they?”\nStill in the first phase of their plan, they’d crashed into the rear of the\nblue pagan drafters assaulting Cannon Island—and they were demolishing\nthem. A few of these blue drafters had begun to transition their bodies,\nmaking themselves wights by degrees as they incorporated luxin into their\nskin, over their eyes as lenses to give themselves plentiful blue source, and\nalong their arms or elbows to make spears or scythes or whatever other\nweapons they could dream up. But none of them seemed like they’d fought\nagainst any force tougher than terrified civilians before.\nSlow, predictable, and amateurish, they didn’t even realize how much\ndanger they were in until Karris’s Blackguards had cut through half of\nthem.\nKarris wasn’t sure if her small force in mirror armor had been assumed\nto be mere soldiers (not drafters, and thus inconsequentially weak, to the\nBlood Robes’ way of thinking) or if the blues were simply so inflexible. But\nwhat she did know was that the fact that the Blood Robes weren’t quick to\nturn around to fight them meant that the Blackguards holding Cannon Island\nwere still alive and holding it.\n“Feels like there was some kind of war within blue itself, sir,” Tamerah\nsaid. She was a blue drafter herself. “But… it’s over now. I think we can\nexpect an attack from the center of the island any moment.”\n“We got this,” Commander Fisk said to Karris, though they were still\noutnumbered by more than two to one—even without the reinforcements\ncoming. “What are you going to do if the seed crystal is at the top of that?”\nHe nodded toward the vast spire in the center of the blue bane reaching\ntoward the sky, higher by the moment.\n“Signal us when you take the guns,” Karris said. “We might need you to\nknock it down for us.”\n“I’ll make sure we save enough powder,” Commander Fisk said.\n“Orholam go with you.”\nIt killed them to let her go without them, and it killed her to abandon"

Karris produced the jar of boot black she’d grabbed\nfrom the store, and they each dulled their mirror armor in the places where\nit might flash and give them away through the gaps in their clothing, at their\nshins, and elsewhere.\nThen, after everyone reloaded their discharged muskets, they were off\nagain.\nThey circled the back of the bane without even seeing anyone, and then\ncharged the center, flitting from great crystalline outcroppings and sapphire\nforests to empty, gleaming villages of static topaz laid out with straight\nboulevards of arithmetic precision. It was as if the wights both reviled the\nnatural world and longed for it at the same time, mimicking it in these weird\nfacsimiles.\n“Here we go!” Gill said.\nKarris hadn’t even seen anyone up ahead, but moments later, missiles of\nblue glass streaked for her head. They shattered and sheared apart on Gill’s\nmirror shield, though she’d ducked, maybe even enough to evade them.\nMore missiles streaked in, and all life became dodging and deflecting\nand slicing with her own shield edge and, once, stabbing the shield far off to\none side to catch a missile that Gill had turned his back to as he threw a\nwight to the ground for the kill.\nThe shock of the missile was greater than she’d expected, and she left\nher guard open for too long. A blue drafter appeared from nowhere with an\nash lance, coming up for her guts.\nHis head flew half apart as Grinwoody’s blunderbuss discharged, but the\ndead man still completed his step blindly thrusting. But Grinwoody’s old\ntraining of never assuming a dead man knew he was dead had him already\nmoving in toward the threat. He smashed the butt of the blunderbuss against\nthe lance, sending it safely away, and the dead man took no second step.\nThere was no thanks. No time for it. Tamerah had been mortally\nwounded in the clash, blood shooting from her neck, then slowing, slowing,\neven as her breath did, and the nearest Blackguard took her in his arms, that\nher last sight would be of one who loved her.\nThey pressed on. A thousand paces left, and no chance to look to see\nhow many wights and drafters were between them and that great tower.\nIn the next clash, she raked her scorpion across a blue drafter’s belly,\nopening it with all four claws. She dove under a musket blast.\nThe man who’d shot at her was dead before she regained her feet. Gill’s\nspinning spear flung blood in a wide circle.\nGlancing back, she saw Grinwoody parry too slowly and take a blue"

Gill’s\nspinning spear flung blood in a wide circle.\nGlancing back, she saw Grinwoody parry too slowly and take a blue\nspear in his guts—though a formidable warrior, the old man was no longer\nin his prime. But the luxin spear tip shattered on Grinwoody’s mirror armor\nand merely jabbed the old man with its wood shaft. It was still a blow that\ndrove the wind from the old man’s lungs.\nKarris lunged with her ataghan, but the wight attacking Grinwoody was\na hair too far away. The point of her ataghan barely poked the back of its\nhead, knocking it off-step, but not piercing its skull.\nIt was enough. Grinwoody stepped into its arms and drove a blade up\nunder its ribs, wrenching the blade around before twisting it away.\nBehind him, Rivvyn Shmuel dodged into the path of a monstrously huge\nblue wight and ran him through with a slender spear, but the wight threw\ngreat arms around him, and lifted, then threw layer upon layer of luxin\naround his waist and legs. Shmuel drew twin daggers and stabbed in a\nfrenzy, over and over, trying to kill it before it could immobilize his arms.\nThen, as the huge wight fell to its knees, Shmuel calmed and buried one\ndagger in the base of its skull.\nThe dying wight went boneless, but Shmuel was bound to it with blue\nluxin and was dragged to the ground. He disappeared under a half-dozen\nwights.\nGill and Karris killed the wights atop the Blackguard as he fought them\nfrom beneath, but by the time they got them all, Shmuel’s throat had already\nbeen ripped open. With one hand, he was holding his life’s blood in while\nthe other held a dagger drenched in his enemies’ blood. But now his grip\nrelaxed, and blood poured out. His eyes dimmed.\nForward again—ever forward—though now with only five Blackguards.\nThree hundred paces out now, not far! They sprinted up a rise, not\ndaring to slow to reload muskets, and suddenly found themselves facing a\ndouble line of Blood Robe musketeers. More than twenty of them. The front\nrow kneeling, the back row standing, all muskets leveled.\nBut their officer, facing the Chromeria, gave no order to fire. His eyes\nwere on the tower.\nAn instant later, Karris and everyone else saw why.\nWith the speed and dazzling, eye-burning intensity of a falling star,\nsomething streaked in a fiery crimson-and-sapphire line from the top of the\nPrism’s Tower to the great blue tower at the center of the bane.\nIt lasted only one blinding moment, and seemed like it had been jerked\naway from its low, intended target up and to the side.\nKarris found herself tackled, thrown to the side out of the way of the\nfiring line, but the blue officer still gave no orders. The other Blackguards\nwere cutting into the musketeers’ ranks with astonishing speed and\nefficiency.\nBlues were slashed, spun, muskets seized, muskets discharged into\nothers, kneeling men knocked down, stabbed on the ground even as the"

Her heart swelled.\nSomeone was looking out for them. Someone saw, someone cared,\nsomeone was trying to save them.\nThey ran on.\nShe saw that two great lines now stretched from the top of the Prism’s\nTower, one to Ebon’s Hill and the other to Cannon Island. Small figures\nwere zipping down each one.\nSo her repairs had worked. Good.\nBut still, those guys must have balls of steel. Zipping down the escape\nchains into this?\nWith a spear, Grinwoody moved down the line of falling pagans,\nstabbing and twisting, stabbing and twisting. He said, “Sure didn’t think I’d\ngo out like this.”\nThe others had been taking advantage of the lull to reload.\n“What?” Karris asked. Having mounted this rise, they finally had a good\nview of what was around them in every direction. Behind them, the Blood\nRobes had caught on to their incursion, and several hundred were chasing to\ncatch up with them. The sides were open, but led nowhere, and would be\nclosed off in minutes.\nBetween Karris and her goal of the great blue plinth were hundreds and\nhundreds of blues—thousands—with more coming by the moment, called\nback from the front lines to stop her attack. Against Karris and her six.\nHer heart cratered.\nThe blues were already between her little force and the bane. And the\nbane itself was sheer-sided, with no helpful steps for her to charge up like\nthe bane at Ru had had.\nBut… the tower’s perfection was marred, not far from the base.\nA single line left by that falling-star strike from the Prism’s Tower cut\nacross it as if it were a bamboo shoot cut with a sword.\nExcept dropping blue luxin the width of the sword-cut meant dropping\nan entire tower’s mass onto the crystalline blue luxin beneath it. Luxin that\nwas marvelously strong on one plane but otherwise fragile on others.\nA sharp report echoed across the plain of this weird blue island, and\nKarris saw cracks race up the tower’s face, and slower ones run down from\nthe cut as well.\nThey shattered into vast crystals the size of whole buildings and fell in\nmany directions, not least toward Karris.\n“Oh, shit,” Gill said.\nShe found herself thrown into a crack and buried under a pile of\nprotective bodies just as chunks of razor-sharp blue luxin rained from the\nsky. Gill threw the shield above them, only to have it ripped away by some\nblow or from the vast chalky wind of gritty blue dust blasting over them.\nA minute later, they stood, binding cloths over their faces so they\nwouldn’t breathe the sharp blue dust. Miraculously, none of them had died,\nthough everyone other than Karris had at least small cuts from flying\nfrostglass. The same could not be said for many hundreds of the enemy.

A\ngreat portion of the tower had fallen into the bulk of the pagan army. Others\nhad been sliced to ribbons by the sideways-flying shrapnel.\nHundreds more, farther out, couldn’t have actually been injured, but\nthey were stunned to immobility, their wills shaken by the cataclysm that\nhad befallen what they’d thought impervious to attack.\nOthers were slowly recovering, moaning under the blue dust and the\nrubble.\nKarris gave hand signals to advance. The blues might be broken\naltogether—or they might recover at any moment.\nSoon, Gill pointed sharply in one direction and took the lead.\nThat was right, Gill was almost a blue drafter; he’d barely failed his\ntesting in it, and hadn’t tried again, afraid he would be named a polychrome\nand become too valuable for Blackguard service. He must be feeling\nsomething.\nThey climbed over the rubble of blue luxin shards, sharp enough to cut\nthrough a careless boot and the foot inside it. Not a few times, Karris felt\nmore yielding ground beneath her foot, only to find a body, bleeding an all-\ntoo-human red into the dust.\nBut many, many of the wights and drafters were recovering. Far more of\nthem than she would have imagined still seemed to be alive, even here.\nThen, suddenly, they were upon her.\nThe Mot was still alive. Crippled and broken, she’d tried to draft luxin\nwings to glide from the top of her collapsing tower, but she’d been too slow.\nUnder the ice-blue skin, shimmering in a million facets so that it could\nmove, Karris recognized the woman: Samila Sayeh, one of the legends from\nthe Prisms’ War. She’d fought for Gavin at Garriston. She and her longtime\nlover Usef Tep, the Purple Bear, Karris thought. Or had they fought on\nopposite sides?\nThat was right. Opposite sides during the war, then lovers afterward.\nBut Samila had fought for Gavin.\n“Samila?” Karris asked. “You’re with them?”\nThe woman wore a black luxin collar. She tapped it. “Slave,” she said\nwith difficulty. And Karris understood. Somehow, Samila had been given\nthe choice to serve Koios or die.\n“Red light and blue,” Samila said, wincing. Something was wrong with\nthe woman’s spine, for sure. But Karris wasn’t sure what Samila was\ntalking about. The red and blue stroke from the Prism’s Tower that had\ndoomed her?\n“He died, you know. My Purple Bear,” Samila said. “Usef, left me\nalone. Not his fault. Irrational to blame him. Irrational to be so angry. But\nUsef helped me feel passion. Made it acceptable for a lady of my stature\nand intellect.”\nShe grinned, and suddenly there was something young and mischievous\nand fierce in her old, cold eyes.\n“He loved a big show. Going out with a bang. Iron White, listen!” She\nsuddenly clamped her eyes tightly shut. Then she hissed, “The djinn are\nreal. When they find a powerful drafter who pleases them, like me, like the"

Then at\nthe moment of death they take—but she doesn’t want this broken body. She\nwants to flee! But she’s vulnerable now. You can bar them from this realm\nforever, maybe from all the Thousand Realms together. But only if you can\nstrike fast, before she escapes my will. Do you have the Blinding Knife?\nQuickly now, before—”\nHer face contorted as if something had just caused her tremendous pain.\n“Quickly!” Samila grunted. She gritted her teeth. “The Knife!”\nBut Karris didn’t have it.\nAnd then Samila Sayeh died. And Karris had the terrible feeling that\nsomehow she’d focused all her energies the wrong direction.\nJust then a huge young man with a flaming chain in his hands and black\narmor with the sigil of Kip’s Mighty on it came running up. Karris’s\nBlackguards nearly panicked until they recognized him; it was their old\ncompatriot, Big Leo. One of Kip’s men now. Behind him came thirty more\nof Kip’s elite drafters.\nBig Leo’s gear was bloodied, with some of the black lacquer rubbed off\nhis armor from luxin bolts, showing the mirroring beneath it. “Wait,” he\nsaid. He looked down at Samila Sayeh. His war chain went out, and\ndrooped. “You’re all done? You did it without me?”\n“Gimme that,” Gill Greyling said off to one side. “C’mon!” He snatched\na glowing blue stone that Grinwoody was trying to tuck away.\nBig Leo looked bereft. “But—but do you know what we had to do to get\nall the way out here?… And—and I came all this way to…”\n“Thanks,” Gill said, throwing the blue seed crystal on the ground. He\ndrew a musket and shot it. The glowing crystal blasted apart as if it were\njust a globe of glass.\n“I don’t know if you should have done that just—” Grinwoody started to\nsay.\nBut Karris cut him off, her eyes locked on the horizon between Big and\nLittle Jasper. “What the hell is that?”\nThey all looked. Two fans of flame like wings were jetting into the air at\nthe northern tip of Big Jasper.\n“Forget it!” Karris barked. “This island’s coming apart! Run! Unless you\nwanna swim, run!”\nChapter 129\nThis can’t be happening.\nThere was a veil of surreality over the entire walk. Kip thought he was\ntoo smart to get sucked into thinking the same things over and over,\nswirling ’round and ’round like a ship spinning down Charybdis’ maelstrom\nuntil it was devoured whole, helpless. Yet here he spun.\nHe can’t get away with this.\nThis can’t be happening.\nSomeone’s gonna step in to stop this any moment now. They’ve got to.\nHow can he think he’ll get away with this?

His\ncongenital lack of fear was also a lack of sense; it would get him killed.\nMaybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow. With the friends Kip had, and the other\ndesperate actors in this city, Zymun certainly wasn’t long for this world.\nBut he didn’t need to be alive tomorrow in order to kill Kip today.\nZymun had the most willing men with guns in the immediate vicinity. Even\nas one suicidal fanatic with a musket could prevail against the entire\nBlackguard itself, Zymun was rendering moot all the long-term, careful\nplans of those more skilled and better trained than he was.\nThe Chromeria’s drafters were locked down now by the bane. Cowed by\nthe shock of being separated from the power that defined them. None of\nthem were going to step forward against the thugs of the Lightguard, not\nnow.\nAnd thus Kip passed through the gates from the Chromeria.\nFootstep followed footstep, dozens of Lightguards walking beside him,\nbefore him, behind him. One of them had even had the wit to throw a red\ncloak around Kip’s shoulders to hide his bound hands behind his back.\nMany of those they passed now wouldn’t even know Kip was a prisoner.\nEverywhere around the walls of the city, the battle continued, even as\nthe sun sank low in the sky. The attention of everyone sane in this city was\nturned to the walls and to the horrors that lay outside them. Every friend\nKip had was off fighting, doing vital work to save the islands.\nZymun, overconfident in victory, wasn’t even manning the mirror array.\nOrholam’s Glare came into view, perched as it was at the base of the\nLily’s Stem, just on the Big Jasper side of the bridge. There would be no\nrescue. Kip knew how far away all the people who would come to his aid\nwere now: too far.\nI knew this would happen, he thought. I knew I was going to die on this\nisland.\nHe’d had the temerity to think it would be a heroic death, that he might\naccomplish something as he died. Hell, he could’ve died on the mirror array\nten minutes ago and counted it a good death. A noble death.\nThis? A traitor’s death on the Glare?\nHow could anyone find meaning in that?\nWhen the Chromeria used the Glare, they did it at noon. It was a\nhorrible death, burning—but it was done in half a minute. How long would\nit take Kip to die, with the sun low in the horizon? How much torture would\nhe endure?\nAnd then they arrived. The simple walk was finished without any\ntheatrics, without any attempts at rescue, without anyone even crying out\nfor them to stop—a brisk walk across the Lily’s Stem like Kip had made\nhundreds of times before.\nNo one even knew.\nThe Lightguards had found Tisis somewhere, though she was supposed\nto be on the far side of the city.

She was going to see him die, like\nthis. She was going to watch him burn to death, rave, shriek. It was not the\nlast view anyone should have of someone they loved.\n“You can look away,” he said. “When it gets awful.”\n“You did not just say that to me,” she said, her voice jagged as hellstone.\n“I wanted to see that fire in you. You know, since you’re going to see fire\nin me soon.”\nShe didn’t even smile, her face falling. “Goddammit, Kip.”\n“I always prided myself on being able to do hard things,” he said,\nforcing a little smile. “But you know, I’m not coming to this fresh…”\nShe was right on the verge of tears, and he was afraid he was, too. He\nlooked away. He’d seen men die by fire. There was no stoicism equal to it.\nSuch a death was never less than ugliness itself.\nHe said, “Please don’t judge me for… for how I go.”\n“Judge you?” she asked, her voice cracking, and he dared a single\nglimpse, seeing her tears of loss and rage and impotence streaming down\nher face. “Never!”\nHis hands were bound behind his back, so he said, “There’s a, uh, card\nin my pocket. Can you take that out for me?”\nThe Lightguards let her. Indeed, a couple of the young men—kids really\n—among them looked sickened by what they were about to do. If there had\nonly been five or six Lightguards, Kip might’ve been able to turn that to his\nadvantage. But not with forty.\n“Can you press it against my forearm?” he asked. “I owe a favor to\nsomeone.”\nShe looked at the card. “This asshole? You owe Andross Guile nothing!”\n“I owe him our marriage,” Kip said simply. He didn’t look at her, still.\nHe thought maybe he had enough residual luxin in his body to trigger the\ncard.\nShe pressed the card to his skin. It slapped down as of its own volition,\ntap, tap, tap.\nHe grunted at the flood of Andross’s memories. A lifetime passed in a\nfew moments, and then Kip was back. “Hmm. Damn. I was kind of hoping\nthe old man maybe helped construct Orholam’s Glare or something and\nknew a secret way for me to… well, not die. No such luck. No magic way\nout.”\nIt was really the wrong time to try to comprehend what he’d just seen.\nBut he had duties.\n“You tell Andross I Viewed his card. Tell him… tell him my respect for\nand loathing of him have both grown immensely. He should laugh… I love\nyou,” he said. He could see the steps to the platform up ahead. They didn’t\nhave any more time. “You have given me one perfect thing. In a life\nsuddenly overfull with blessings, you were the brightest and best gift of\nall.”"

Zymun. “My little dragon-poo.\nAnd what is she? Your little bunny-kins?” He pushed past her. His halos\nwere shattered, and red raged through the whites of his eyes, but either no\none noticed or no one dared say anything. “I know I should be up on the\narray, but I… I just couldn’t miss this,” Zymun said. “Plus, you do have so\nmany friends. I couldn’t bear to have you so far out of my grasp. Good, let’s\ndo this! Places, everyone!”\nKip was marched straight up the platform. They started strapping him to\nthe frame.\nFacing out, he saw a small crowd gathering. The execution hadn’t been\nannounced, and most of the civilians of Big Jasper had taken to cowering in\ntheir homes, anyway, but this sudden gathering of people at one of the most\nimportant intersections in the city garnered attention.\nKip saw a messenger from Corvan Danavis at the Great Fountain\nheading toward the Chromeria. She pulled up her horse.\nShe saw Kip and recognized him, and immediately turned her horse\naround. She galloped away.\nToo late. Even if she cut past all the other messengers coming and going\naround the high general at the Great Fountain, even if Corvan Danavis\nhimself heard her immediately, even if he had horses waiting and issued the\norders immediately—even if he disregarded the fact that attacking the\nPrism would be treason—Corvan still wouldn’t arrive in time.\nKip appreciated that they were trying, though.\nThe Lightguards cinched the straps tight on his arms and legs.\n“Hurry up,” Zymun said. “The sun’s not far from the horizon. Is it going\nto be hot enough to kill him?”\n“Easily, sir. I mean, it’s not gonna turn him to ash, but he’ll burn,” one\nof the men strapping Kip in said. “He’ll die faster if we remove the colored\nlenses first, but burn or pop, he’ll go all right! Your choice.”\nKip felt a sudden reverberation in blue, and Zymun tensed, too. It\nseemed he and Zymun were the only blue drafters in sight.\nBlue suddenly felt free once more.\nBig Leo had done it! Damn, and he’d done it fast, too! Holy shit, Big\nLeo.\nMaybe Big Leo could… but no. He was several thousand paces away,\nand if the bane evaporated in the next minute or three, he was going to be\nseveral thousand paces away and swimming. And he didn’t know Kip was\nhere.\nBig Leo wouldn’t be coming in time.\nFunny thing. Zymun had said, ‘You do have so many friends.’\nIt was true.

Kip had no doubt that his friends would drop everything and\nrun for him when they heard about his need.\nWhen had that happened?\nGrowing up, he’d always been the outsider, the kid scared of being\nrejected again. And look at this! This life he was leaving? How could the\nson of a drug-addled prostitute hope for even a day of this life? Kip had\ntasted honey that few in the history of the world had tasted: he’d had\nmeaningful work, and friendship with titans; a great marriage to a strong,\ngood, beautiful woman; and a father who’d been willing to die for him. Kip\nhad had a couple years of a life that old chubby Kip of Rekton would have\nhappily died to have for a single day.\nHow could he face his death with anything but gratitude?\nYet he was still afraid.\nHe’d seen immortals coming with the bane when that strange wave had\npassed. Maybe…“Rea?” he whispered. “Are you here?”\n“Of course I’m here!” the immortal, all invisible, said in his ear.\nShe was weeping.\nThat meant she couldn’t stop this.\n“Will you…”—his voice choked—“will you help me be brave? I don’t\nfeel very brave right now.”\nThe frame lifted him suddenly into the air.\nThe mirrors grated on their gears as they began to turn into place.\n“Look, and see,” Rea said.\nKip blinked. It wasn’t like looking in paryl or superviolet, but rather\nmore akin to looking through that immense wave that had passed over the\nJaspers. It felt like his eyes were only slowly bending into focus, his mortal\nlenses unaccustomed to seeing this spectrum: what he was seeing was more\nreal than reality.\nFirst, his eyes fell on the normal people of the crowd gathering around\nthe great intersection. They were weirdly, undeniably themselves but\ndifferent, as if now he could see the whole self. The outward things, such as\ntheir beauty or plainness, their clothing, the shape of this nose or that pallid\ntone of skin all remained, but faded by comparison: This boy shone with\ngoodness. That nursemaid streamed prayers like incense but more real than\ndrafted luxin as she carried her ward toward his home. Others walked in\ndarkness. A butcher hungered for the spectacle of an execution to fill the\ndark, empty gnashing of his pain. A fisherman radiated casual cruelty, his\nhands twisted by violence.\nBut then, in the gaps between the mortal gawkers, he saw others,\nunencumbered by mortal trappings.\nGlassine figures glowed as if lit from above, then slowly resolved into\npeople. People he knew. He saw Luisa Sendina of Rekton, who’d not only\nfed the addict’s boy: serving up compassion in food, but also speaking to\nhim, listening to him despite the chaos of her own five children. He saw\nsweet Isabel—Orholam have mercy, she’d been a child!\nWhat was going on?\nThen he saw Gaspar Elos, the man who’d gone green wight whom Kip\nhad met that night before the burning of Rekton. He was wight no longer."

He was wight no longer.\nHe stood with folded arms and a little smirk on his lips. He moved a finger\nto his head, as if tipping a hat that he wasn’t wearing.\nJanus Borig appeared decades younger, but still chewing on a long-\nstemmed pipe, studying him with a portraitist’s intensity. At his gaze\nmeeting hers, she brightened and winked at him. The radiant woman next to\nher—the Third Eye?—curtsied perfectly in a swirl of golden cloth.\nThe hulking mass of a shaggy red-bearded man could only be Rónán\nArthur, Conn Ruadhán’s twin. He put his hand to his heart in salute.\nFelia Guile stood at the back, his grandmother, her back ramrod straight,\nan apologetic half smile on her lips and her eyes bright.\nGoss stood next to Gavin Greyling, each in their blacks. They nodded to\nhim: You got this. You can do it, brother. And then they snapped to attention,\nsaluting him.\nTremblefist appeared—no, not Tremblefist any longer, Hanishu, not in\nhis blacks but in his Old Parian garb, with the frailties and brokenness of\nlife fallen away from his soul. He nodded with fierce approval.\nNext was the young commander beside them: Cruxer. Kip felt a flaring\nof anger at the same time he felt a surge of love and longing and emptiness.\nDammit, Cruxer, dammit.\nBut the anger melted. Here was Cruxer purified, his earthly rigidity\ngone. Lucia—who’d died for Kip, if accidentally—dear Lucia, whom\nCruxer had so loved, stood next to him, and they were at peace.\nIt had taken Kip until now to understand. These were all the people\nwho’d loved him, who’d already gone on before. They’d gathered, a great\ncloud of witnesses, to stand for him in his final hour. They’d come so that\nhe wouldn’t die alone.\nAnd then his eyes fell on one thin woman standing off to one side.\nMother.\nOnce, long ago—though he carried the words as if it were yesterday—\nshe’d said to him, ‘You’re nothing. You’re not special. And if anyone really\nknew you, they’d hate you as much as I do.’\nMother, how much were you hurting when you said those words? How\nmuch did you hate yourself afterward for saying them?\nFor he knew she had.\nFor he remembered her, on a different night, sober two days and shaking\nin her vomit-stained blankets, not for the first time. But this time she’d\ncome to his side when she thought him asleep; she was weeping. She’d\ntouched his cheek with a trembling hand. ‘I’m so sorry. I am gonna beat\nthis, and I’ll be the mother you deserve. I love you, Kip.’\nShe’d failed that time, though, as she had before.\nBut they’d all failed, hadn’t they?\nKip could stare at most of them and name a fault, even a crime, but\ninstead he saw them with love, and that changed everything."

It was enough.\nHe could do this, because even if he failed to die well, it didn’t matter.\nWho, out of all the people that mattered, would think less of him?\nThe moment passed and the vision passed as Kip was ratcheted into\nplace, but the peace clung to him like the smell of smoke after a bonfire.\nZymun didn’t order Kip turned upward to face the sky, as they did with\ntraitors and wights to keep them from lashing out at the audience. No,\nZymun didn’t want to miss the agony on Kip’s face, and he obviously\nwasn’t worried that Kip would kill innocents.\nThe mirrors were all coming into alignment, covered with their cloths,\nheating up.\n“Oh, Kip. Just in case you get any ideas: you make any move to attack\nme or my men, I kill Tisis. Even if you stop me, my men’ll do it. You stop\nthe man with a gun, another’s got a knife. Probably went without saying,\nright? But—”\nSuddenly, a fruit seller stepped forward. Kip had never seen the man\nbefore in his life. “Lord Guile!” he shouted, interrupting Zymun, who\nstopped, thinking the man was speaking to him. “No, not you,” the man\nsaid. “Kip, I have a word for you. A word from the Lord of Lights Himself!\nI’ve no idea what it means, but I never do. Orholam says, ‘Remember\nblubber.’”\n“What the—? Who is that?” Zymun demanded. “Seize him!”\nBut the fruit seller ran off, and the Lightguards didn’t try very hard to\ncatch him.\nKip started cry-laughing. An inappropriate word from Orholam? Only\nthe inappropriate could be appropriate for Kip. Andross Guile, the smartest\nman Kip had ever met, had been unable to conceive of a god who could be\nboth big enough to create all the Thousand Worlds and small enough to care\nabout each living thing on them.\nBut Andross was wrong. One terrified fruit seller who hadn’t dared to be\na prophet had proven the smartest man in the world wrong. Orholam saw.\nElrahee. Orholam heard. Elishama. Orholam cared.

Fat kids are tougher than anyone knows,\nespecially themselves.\n“Start it now!” Zymun ordered. “Just the colored mirrors. I don’t want to\nwait anymore.

They’re gonna kill me, and that leaves her\nalone with that animal. And with an army coming over the walls. Orholam,\nI can’t do anything for her.\nThat was the real reason he hadn’t dared look at her. He was leaving so\nmuch work undone. He was leaving people who counted on him.\nOrholam, You are Eliphalet. Save her, please.\nFor Kip could not. There was only one thing he could do for her now.\nHe could die well.\nHe could do that. He could suffer. That was his one great talent, after all.\nHe met her gaze, and hoped his eyes said all that his lips wished to.\nDuring normal executions on the Glare, the mirrors were covered with\nblack cloth until all the mirrors were in place, but Zymun afforded Kip no\nsuch decency and didn’t wait until the mirrors got killing-hot.\nThey seared him instantly.\nKip was already exhausted from his ordeal directing the mirrors. But fat\nkids know how to take punishment.\nZymun didn’t keep Kip covered until all the mirrors were brought into\nline. He didn’t care how executions on the Glare were usually done, or\nabout minimizing the condemned’s suffering. He wanted the opposite. As\nsoon as the city’s mirrors could be turned, Kip was pummeled with hot light\nin every color.\nGreen hit Kip first, tearing his eyes open like a too-large swallow of\nwater—except that the swallowing just wouldn’t end. He felt a crack as\ndeep as his bones, taking his breath, stabbing his eyes, and sending shivers\ndown every limb as his halos blew out.\nSlivers of luxin exploded out of the white of his eyes, blinding him\nmomentarily. Blood trickled down his face.\nThen sub-red burrowed into him like hot coals pressed sizzling through\nhis eyeballs.\nIt was pain unlike anything he’d ever experienced. When he’d fallen in\nthe fire and burned his left hand, he’d squeezed it convulsively into a fist—\nbut here the fist was his mind itself, crackling, cooking, splitting in the heat\nlike an overcooked sausage.\nBreaking the halo shattered the boundaries of his self. He was suddenly\nconnected to all the green around him. The green drafters on the Jaspers felt\nlike beacons; the bane felt like a star come to earth. It was dazzling, it was\nbeautiful, it was insanity itself, and it called to him.\nAnd then he was connected to the sub-reds, and to the red bane.\nAnd then orange hit him.\nYellow.\nSuperviolet. Each like the blows of a spiked mace cracking his skull,\nagain, again, again. Crushing him.\nIt was like someone was gagging him, forcing impossibly too much light\ninto his eyes at the same time that someone else brought a sledge down on\nhis fingers, on his wrists, on his knees, his ankles, his groin.\nFor a drafter, there was only one choice on Orholam’s Glare: to not draft"

Every conversion generated heat.\nConverting so much meant burning up.\n‘Did you cast sub-red, or fire?’ Janus Borig had asked him once, oddly\nintense.\nWrithing against his steel bonds, Kip vented fire now in the only safe\ndirection he could, waves of it bursting from the outer edges of his arms and\nforearms like wings reaching out wide and up into the sky.\nBut he couldn’t vent it all. He was only prolonging things.\n“Why is this taking so long?” he heard a distant voice demand.\nAs he felt his heart convulse in an irregular, belabored beat, too late he\nfigured it out. Puzzles and prophecies. Remember blubber. What is it about\nblubber?\nBlubber bounces back.\nHe was the Turtle-Bear. He was a dragon. He was sitting passive before\nall these mirrors, acting as if they had no will, acting as if he didn’t either,\nwhen instead the mirrors were pressing one message in upon him with great\nforce from every direction—one word, one command: die.\nHe didn’t have to be passive. He could fight.\nHe didn’t have the mirror array, but Kip had seen how it worked, and he\ncould draft all the colors it could. He could surely not equal its power, but\nwith the superviolet bane broken, he could mimic its function.\nHe left alone the mirrors nearest him—the Great Mirrors focused on him\n—so that Zymun wouldn’t think he was attacking, and then Kip shot his\nwill up through the mirrors reflecting killing light into him, and found the\nmirror array on the Prism’s Tower roof, still connected to all the mirrors\nthrough superviolet. Manipulating it was like trying to use a spoon to eat, if\nthe spoon’s handle were a pace long, but—clumsily—he began to press his\nwill on it, and he began to turn distant mirrors.\nThe blue bane and the superviolet were defeated, and Kip knew the\ndrafters of each were on Big Jasper—he could feel them.\nKip couldn’t attack Zymun without risking the man simply shooting\nhim. But he could help the islands’ defenders.\nSo Kip, flawed mirror that he was, burned for his friends, shooting blue\nand superviolet light to every corner of Big Jasper, spotlighting friendly\ndrafters so they’d have a source, helping them repel the attacks at the walls.\nHe slaved mirror towers nearest to superviolets to them, arming them for\ntheir fight.\nAnd then he had an idea about paryl, the bane the Wight King didn’t\nhave.\nIf he were fast enough, before he died, he could use the master color on\nthe very—\nHe felt the mirror array snatched away from him, and his will locked\nwith one who stood at the top of the Prism’s Tower, and they communicated\nat the speed of thought, mind to mind.\n‘You attacked me,’ Aliviana Danavis said.

He’d insulted\nthe goddess of Pride in the worst way possible: he’d handled her.\nHumiliated her.\n‘You failed,’ she said. ‘I left a door open for you to win here, but you\nmissed it. You lose. I won’t join you in a loss. Can’t. Goodbye, Kip.’\nAnd then she tore away the control of all the mirrors from him, easily.\nHe threw his will against her, but hers was the will of a goddess now.\nSuperviolet controlled the mirrors, and the superviolet goddess would not\nlet anyone be her master. A Ferrilux does not yield.\nMaybe he could have beaten her had he been fresh. Maybe if he’d\nthought of it instantly. On a good day, his will might be second to no one’s.\nBut today wasn’t a good day.\nHe knew Aliviana’s will now, felt the sheer scale of it. He couldn’t beat\nher.

She’d lost interest in that\nplan now.\nHe saw then the outlines of it, barely. Superviolet is orderly, and\nconcerned with divining order where others couldn’t see it. She had hunted\ndown, visited, and repaired the ancient Great Mirrors in every arc of the\nSeven Satrapies.\nThey were the answer to a question Kip hadn’t known enough to ask.\nWhat were the Great Mirrors for? Communication. Defense. Artillery.\nSource. But they were also lightwells. Not figuratively, the way the term\nhad come to be used now, meaning ‘where the buildings were kept wide\napart so the sun could still reach the ground,’ but literally: vast repositories\nof light against the night.\n‘Give them to me,’ Kip pleaded. ‘It’s not too late.’\n‘No,’ she said. Stern. Simple. Like an experienced mother to a child\npleading to stay up far too late. Her mind was made up. Kip simply needed\nto die so she could get on with other things she needed to do. The less he\nfought, the better it would be for everyone.\nHis strength was fading fast, and hers was implacable. It was like trying\nto scale a sheer wall that got taller by the moment.\nKip had promised himself he wouldn’t scream. A turtle-bear might\nscream plaintively, wheezing in pain like some pathetic, persecuted fatty.\nDragons don’t scream. Dragons don’t beg or grovel. Dragons roar.\n“MORE LIGHT!” he shouted. He shouted as if all his soul were carried\nin the sound.\nHe could feel their shock, their wonder. All but the soulless one.\n“How’s he still alive?

He was\nno Prism.\nAs he roared, Kip gathered his remaining will and threw light back into\nthe mirrors with all his fading strength.\nBut with the mirrors locked into place by the goddess herself, each\nreflecting light from Orholam’s Eye straight to Kip, he was only throwing\nlight harmlessly back toward the sun.\nIt was a ruthlessly closed system, a thousand mirrors each focusing their\nlight to the greatest mirrors, and those focusing those concentrated beams\non Kip.\nHe was burning to death, flames venting out to the sides uncontrollably\nin great wings. Tears sizzled on his cheeks. He felt the gallium necklace\nsoften and melt on his chest, the chi bane burning another hot point into his\nskin.\nAnd then something cracked.\nUnder the heat of Kip’s returned onslaught, a single flawed mirror high\nin the Prism’s Tower—its surface blackened and half melted from a past\nexecution—suddenly shattered.\nA weak beam of light shot through the broken mirror’s empty frame,\nthrowing light out to the east.\nIt wasn’t enough.\nKip couldn’t wrest control of the mirrors from the goddess. She was too\nstrong. He’d broken his halo in every color; his will had failed.\nHe’d failed.\nI’m so sorry, friends. He looked at them one last time through the\nblazing glory of the light, and found, oddly, that he could actually see them.\nThe chi bane touching his chest helped his gaze cut through everything. He\ngathered up the vision of his wife, his friends, the Chromeria he’d loved,\nand held them in his eyes.\nHe wouldn’t finish this job.\nUnless—\nChi! He could use chi to reach the seven Great Mirrors around the\nsatrapies, and—\nBut no. It was too late. Ferrilux held the array now.\nBesides, he was too weak to throw chi to the ends of the earth.\nHis strength was at an end, his body shutting off, his talent burnt out, red\nburning out to black, yellow numbing to cold gray, green winking out, blue\ndying, and with each turning off, the heat in his body ratcheted ever\nskyward, his thoughts collapsing, focus dulling, his light dimming.\nHe thought, too late—far, far too late—that he couldn’t split white light\n—but maybe he could draft it.\nAnd so he could.\nIt filled him, then, with one last gasp of power, a glorious final breath of\nlife and light and happiness, all flooding too late through his broken limbs\nand broken talent and broken mind.\nHis last thought was of that sole, single shattered mirror in the tower—"

It was a cry into the darkness\nbeyond the horizon, whose answer, if answer there ever was, he would\nnever hear.\nAnd as a single beam escaped, all the thousand mirrors minus one\nremained in their executioners’ stations, functioning perfectly, concentrating\nthe fading light of the setting sun on the condemned, burning him to death.\nHe sank against his bonds into the burning white of Orholam’s Glare, a\nmighty man with arms outstretched, and his head slumped at last, as his\nburden overcame him.\nChapter 130\nFerkudi had barely hopped off the little platform that had sped him down\nthe escape chains when a groom shouted to him from the open yard of a\nnearby smithy. “My lord, do you need a horse?”\nAfter a quick glance around, Ferkudi realized he was the ‘my lord.’\n“Yes!” he said belatedly, looking back up the escape chain, where the other\nblues out of the prospective Mighty were coming. “Five of them! But who\nsaid to—why?”\n“High General Danavis said, ‘Anyone comes down those chains, they’ll\nprobably need a good, fast horse.’”\nFerkudi clambered up into the saddle. He loved horses. He and horses\nunderstood each other. Two of his five men had already reached ground.\nThey readied their horses while Ferkudi sat in the saddle, suddenly\nawkward that he wasn’t helping; he was just sitting on his horse like he\nthought he really was a ‘my lord.’ He looked up at the next man descending,\nand noticed the arrows flying up in the air at him. There were reports from\nmuskets, too, but those had been a constant from everywhere. “They shoot\nat you?” he asked. He hadn’t really noticed if they’d shot at him. He’d been\nwatching the whole battle unfold, all the ships and the bane, and the\ndescending sun.\nIt looked like it was going to be a real pretty sunset tonight.\n“Yessir. Used a glove on the line to brake now and then to make myself\na tougher target.”\nThey waited together on their horses. The groom held the last two and\nlooked up at Ferkudi.\nHe blanked, then dug in a pocket for a coin. He offered it to the man.\n“Milord!” the man said, scolding. “It’s a war. I don’t need a gratuity.”\n“Oh, right, right.” Ferkudi tucked the coin away and busied himself with\nchecking his weapons, as if that took his full attention.

Ferkudi was out of his saddle instantly. Caught him.\nThe man had been hit with several arrows. One under his ribs. One was\nstuck under his helmet’s chin strap and made the skin of his opposite cheek\nbulge.\nThere was no way the man should still be alive, but he’d held on.\nFerkudi took him in his arms and lay him on the ground.\nHe whispered praises and a blessing in the man’s ear, and when he\nraised his head, the man’s eyes were glassy, unseeing. They left him there,\nonly taking the time to array his limbs somewhat and beg the groom to take\ncare of him.\nThen they saddled up and rode, hard.\nHe had no compunctions about taking four horses out of he didn’t know\nhow many. His was the farthest assignment away from the escape-chain\ndisembarkation point. They avoided blockades the defenders had set up,\nasking questions and cutting through strange narrow alleys, with the sounds\nof muskets and fighting everywhere growing more intense.\nWhen they reached the wall near Overhill, it became plain how\ndesperate things had gotten here.\n“Where the hell’s the rest of the Seventh?” Ferkudi asked a poor woman\nstruggling to beat out the sparks that had landed in her family’s thatch roof.\nThe woman slapped a sopping-wet dress against the spreading flames.\n“Half those bastards took some nobles’ coin to defend the walls near their\nown houses up south. Commander here done nothing to stop ’em when they\nleft.”\nWithout a word, Ferkudi spurred his horse onward.\nAt the wall, he leapt out of the saddle and slapped the stallion’s flank.\n“Good boy!”\nNo need for him to die, too.\nAs he mounted the wall without so much as being challenged once, he\nsaw the wan terror on the defenders’ faces.

From the charred\nbodies, it was clear that hundreds and hundreds of the enemy had died in\nthat attack—but there were still so many more, and while the mundane\nsoldiers had died in droves, the drafters and the wights had survived.\nNow, whatever the reds’ original plan had been, they attacked without\nany discernible plan at all—and they attacked with rage to spare. They had\nno siege engines, no siege ladders, instead merely throwing themselves\nagainst the walls and using red luxin to clamber and stick and boost\nthemselves as well as they could. It was stupidly inefficient, even insane, as\nthe Chromeria always said.\nBut the numbers were on their side, and as fast as the few defenders atop\nthe wall could pick them off with arrows and musket balls, still the rest\nclimbed faster, heedless of their own dead, heedless of all but rage.\n“We wait for our chance,” Ferkudi said. “Corvan Danavis is gonna give\nus a distraction. Maybe that’ll be it.”\n“And until then?”\nSome of the attackers had torn up still-burning trees and had flung them\nagainst the walls as makeshift ladders. The defenders couldn’t dislodge\nthem.\n“Until then we keep these poor bastards alive. We defend the wall,”\nFerkudi said, hopping up and sprinting. His men ran hot on his heels along\nthe top of the wall. They were spotted instantly, and soon missiles spitting\nflames were crackling past their heads.\nThey rammed into a tree and hurled it back from the wall, astonishing\nthe scrawny defenders—surely the worst of the city’s worst—who’d been\nunable to move it at all.\nBut it wasn’t enough. Somewhere a hundred paces down some reds\nburst into view on top of the wall and lit into terrified defenders.\nFerkudi and his men cut through those fleeing.\nHis axes sent limbs spinning. As each of his axes got stuck—one in a\nBlood Robe’s shoulder joint and the other pinched between a screaming\nwight’s ribs—a wight popped into view over the top of the wall, and\nFerkudi butted his bear helm into the thing’s face, sending it flying off the\nwall.\nThe next minutes passed in that odd blur of fighting—every moment\nlasting an eternity and every minute gone in a blink.\nThe reds reached the top of the wall in new places every minute, and\nFerkudi spread his Mighty out. Most of the other defenders had\ndisappeared, which at first Ferkudi thought was good—no one in his way as\nhe ran back and forth.\nThen he realized how bad it was.\nOne of his Mighty, Arius, went down with a leg wound. The nearest\nman, Amastan, flashed hand signals: Arius would live, but he’d fight no\nmore today.\nAnd then, inattentive for a moment while he tied a tourniquet around\nArius’s bloody leg, Amastan took a spear through his armpit.

Dying,\nAmastan clawed a pistol from the bag at his hip and handed it to the\nwounded Arius, even as he used his other hand to hold the spear piercing\nhim in place. From his back, Arius shot the pagan drafter in the face, and\nthey all collapsed on him.\nSuddenly, the wall felt very, very empty.\nScreaming defiance, Ferkudi reached up with his will and triggered the\nmirrors. He was flooded with blue light from a half-dozen directions in the\nwaning light of the day. He jumped up on the battlements and bellowed his\nchallenge at the Blood Robes below.\nIt drove them mad. Drafters who’d been unstoppably far to one side for\nFerkudi to possibly fight abandoned attacking where they were and came to\njoin the horde directly in front of him. They climbed over one another,\ncrushing each other, making a ramp of their very bodies, heedless of\neverything except trying to kill him.\nHe hurled blue-luxin javelins into them. He broke reaching arms. He\nsmashed faces with his knees and with his hellstone-knuckled fists. He\ncarved great crimson wounds into their crimson bodies. Split heads with his\nglittering hand axes. Smashed once-men into each other. Extinguished\nflaming wights with blunderbuss gusts of blue luxin. Picked up wights and\nhurled them bodily from the walls.\nBut what he completely forgot was to let go of blue.\nIt should have helped him remember, blue should have, rational as it\nwas.\nBut even blue can’t overcome the full grip of battle fury.\nHe didn’t remember the danger until he felt something twisting around\nhis very will. It froze him, and locked up all the luxin in his body.\nHe couldn’t move. He stood with a Blood Robe’s chin in one hand, a\nfistful of his hair in the other, broken-necked. The dying man dropped from\nFerkudi’s grip, almost taking him down with him. Better that he had. Now\nFerkudi was exposed at the top of the wall, defenseless, hands extending,\nmuscles straining against the empty air, his inchoate yell the only thing that\ncould escape.\nA red wight hopped up to the top of the wall a few paces away. His hair\nwas slicked back to his head with white, fire-retardant gel and, uncommonly\nfor a red wight, this man had no fresh burns or burn-scars whatsoever on his\nhalf-naked body, over which red danced and flickered. A careful red wight.\nHe balled fire in his hand, even as others mounted the wall and coiled to\nunleash it in Ferkudi’s face, when something dark and soft hit him from\nbelow. A wet cloth?\nFerkudi couldn’t even move to see where it came from. The wight threw\ndown the wet dress—and was pierced through the ribs by a spear.\nAn instant later, he realized that the roaring of blood in his ears had been\njoined by another roar, and he heard impacts around him, saw bricks flung\nfrom inside the city pelting the Blood Robes taking the wall, and then"

The woman he’d seen beating at her\nflaming thatched roof with that wet dress pulled the spear from the\nwounded wight’s ribs and stabbed him with it again and again.\nThen she stood, looking for Ferkudi’s approval. She looked scared and\nexhilarated, and her grip on the spear was all wrong.\nFerkudi noticed others claiming the top of the wall now, too: men in\ntradesman’s caftans, women in burnouses. They’d picked up the weapons\ndropped by the fleeing soldiers, and now suddenly even the soldiers were\nreturning.\nAnd Ferkudi was at the heart of it all. He was the frozen heart of it all.\nThey rallied around him, saving him, and saving themselves and their\nown homes.\nBut Ferkudi felt the blue twisting deeper into him, vengeful, seeking to\nstill his very heart, his lungs. Breathing became slower, slower, and panic\nrose in him.\nAnd then it snapped.\nMot’s hold on blue was dropped, and Ferkudi fell.\n“What was that?!” Arius asked. The people had carried the wounded\nMighty to be together so that they could be protected together.\nFerkudi lay gasping, and slowly felt sensation and control returning to\nhis limbs.\nAnd then Mot seemed to wink out of existence altogether, and the blue\nwas truly free.\n“The blue bane is broken,” Arius said, and a big crooked-toothed smile\nlit his dark face.\n“Good, good,” Ferkudi said, pushing himself to his feet, his legs\ntrembling. “Now we can attack.”\n“What?” Arius asked.\nFerkudi took a step. His leg folded and he caught himself on the edge of\nthe wall. He picked up one of his hand axes from a Blood Robe’s split skull.\nHad he thrown this ax? That never worked! And then he found his other\none, stuck where it had split another drafter’s mouth. Yuck. The guy wasn’t\ndead, either.\nFerkudi slashed the man’s throat and gave him a moment to die before\nretrieving that one. “Where’s Itri? Where’s Yuften?” he asked. “We gotta\ngo. We got orders!”\n“Itri got burned. Bad. They gave him poppy wine. He’s out, but… we’re\ngonna have to give him the black mercy. Yuften’s got a broken arm.”\n“It’s my off hand! I can fight!” Yuften said, limping into sight.\nApparently the broken arm wasn’t his only wound. “I’m with you, sir! To\nthe end!”\n“Are you hurt?” Arius asked.\nFerkudi checked himself. There was a lot of blood on him, but none of it\nseemed to be his. He’d had some hair singed off—that’s right, now he\nremembered extinguishing the flames with blue. He was sore in a dozen\nplaces and knew that by tomorrow that would expand to a hundred.

But he\ndidn’t seem to be injured, just exhausted with the bone-deep weariness and\nthe shakes that come every time after the terror and thrill and total muscular\nexertion of a battle. And Ferkudi had never fought so hard or so long in his\nlife.\nHe sucked down some watered wine from a skin someone put in his\nhand, and watched the red drafters and wights falling back.\n“Shit,” he said at a sudden thought. It could be mere exhaustion and\nlightsickness. But maybe it was more. “How are my halos?”\nArius looked at him. “Strained to the absolute limits, sir.”\n“But not broken?”\nYuften said, “Wouldn’t lie to you, sir.”\nSo merely exhausted, lightsick, and half-dead. It didn’t make Ferkudi\nfeel better. Nor did the adoring looks in all the people’s eyes—even the\nwoman who’d saved his life.\n“We have our orders,” he said plaintively. He looked at the people and\nthe few soldiers standing atop the wall, all jubilant at their victory. They\nwere already talking of what they’d done, sharing stories and asking each\nother if they’d seen some dragon’s wings or fire wings or something down\nnorth on the island, and something about a beam of white light like\nOrholam’s finger stretching across the sky. (Ferkudi did remember a white\nlight, briefly, there at the end.) They were all thrilled with themselves—but\nthey weren’t proper soldiers. These were people defending their homes.\nThey wouldn’t leave this wall to go charging across that hellscape out there,\nnot even if led by Ferkudi.\nAnd if they did? They’d be massacred in the first counterattack.\nThe people had rallied. Ferkudi had saved the wall at its weakest spot…\nbut he’d saved nothing else. He’d spent the last, best portion of his life’s\nstrength on this fight, and he’d changed nothing. The red bane remained.\nDagnu still ruled it, and the seed crystal was intact.\nThey’d be back tomorrow at first light, and Ferkudi wouldn’t be able to\nstop them.\n‘Avoid battle, seek victory,’ Breaker always said. Ferkudi had gotten\ncaught up in a battle instead, and he’d won it. But he’d guaranteed the\nBlood Robes would win the next battle, tomorrow.\nHe sank down, and sat on a ledge. He didn’t even have the strength to\nstand now.\nHe’d had his orders, and he’d failed.\nChapter 131\n“You’re a tenacious little bastard,” Karris said. She’d regained her breath\nfrom the run, and had been in the only group that made it off the blue bane\nbefore it dissolved and dropped everything and everyone on it into the\nwaves.\n“I accept the compliment,” Grinwoody said, hands on his knees,\ndripping water, chest heaving.\nShe hadn’t been waiting for him—not specifically—but she had needed\nto re-form her forces here, just outside the city walls. Half of her people had\nbeen dropped into the water, and not a few of those in water deep enough to\ndrown men wearing armor. She’d sent her good swimmers to save those\nthey could while she did the necessary work of cataloging the wounded,"

She’d sent her good swimmers to save those\nthey could while she did the necessary work of cataloging the wounded,\ngathering weapons and armor, and coordinating the attack on the yellow\nbane.\nDestroying them all was the only route to victory. Even if she didn’t\nhave much hope of it.\nThe wall’s defenders had lowered ladders for them, and now she\nclimbed up to start sending the necessary messages, but first, she grabbed\nan officer’s long-lens to see what she could of the Jaspers situation.\nHer Mighty were cleaning up the stunned blue wights and drafters on\nCannon Island. Good, as far as it went, but with the blue bane dissolved, her\npeople were marooned out there, useless to her for at least another hour.\nShe turned the lens toward the green bane, her next target. The officer’s\nlong-lens wasn’t very good, but she thought she saw—yes, another. A green\nwight fell, seemingly at random. The drafters under his control stared at one\nanother, baffled. Karris couldn’t see why, either; then, when the Blood\nRobes were looking the other way, she saw a small form pop up out of the\nvegetation covering the forestlike surface of the green bane.\nThe archer sprinted forward a few steps, bow in hand, then dove down\nout of view again. He was running toward the great central tree-thing that\ndominated the middle of the green bane.\nHe popped up again, and she saw him loose an arrow, but couldn’t see\nany target anywhere in bow range of him. Then she saw an enraged giant\ngrizzly burst from a cage the greens had been keeping it in, surely more\nthan three hundred paces away from the figure. It stood on its hind legs and\nroared as greens scattered. The giant grizzly went berserk, but Karris was\nalready looking for the little archer: Winsen, she saw now. She was sure of\nit.\nWinsen was attacking the green bane—by himself.\nMadness. But she was too far away to do anything for him.\nShe slewed the long-lens to the yellow bane, overshot and saw the Great\nFountain.\nNo, no, no! It was being attacked.\nShe put the lens down, and turned to shout to her people to move\nimmediately, when a messenger from Corvan came galloping in. Several\nother messengers were already waiting for Karris, but he practically rode\nover the top of them.\n“High Lady White!” he shouted. “Urgent message from High General\nDanavis: Good work stopping blue! Forces have breached the walls in three\nplaces we know and are assailing the command post at the Great Fountain\nnow. We can hold. Don’t reinforce us. At least one platoon of the White\nKing’s best has been tasked with finding and killing you personally. Don’t\ngo to green next. Go to Orholam’s Glare. Now!”\n“What’s at Orholam’s Glare?” Karris asked, hardly able to absorb all the\nbad news. Then she noticed the Thousand Stars. All of the city’s mirrors\nwere pointed exactly where they would be for an execution.\nWhat?!"

All of the city’s mirrors\nwere pointed exactly where they would be for an execution.\nWhat?!\n“Have you not seen the great wings of fire?” one of the other messengers\nasked, turning to point.\nBut just then, an incredible beam of incandescent white light leapt from\nsomewhere on Big Jasper’s north shore up to the Great Mirrors (Orholam’s\nGlare?) and out to the east. The beam was the width of a man’s spread arms,\nwith a mass, a weight, to it. It was whiter than white, like mother-of-pearl\nand ivory lit from within.\nKarris had seen something like this, just once, at Garriston—and that,\ndrafted by Gavin himself, was but a candle to this inferno. She had no\nquestion now what it was: white luxin.\nBut no one could draft that much.\nNo one could draft that much—and live.\nAnd then it stopped.\nWho could possibly draft so…?\nOh, God.\n* * *\n“So it’s too late,” Dazen said as the sun set and the darkness gathered.\nOrholam had just told him of the battle being waged and lost beyond the\nhorizon. Of Kip strapped in, being executed. Of Karris being hunted by her\nown merciless brother.\nHere, in Orholam’s own presence, it was perhaps impossible to feel fully\nhopeless, but Dazen felt an emptiness vast as the space between him and\nthose he wished he could rush in to save. It’s what he would have done,\nbefore.\nNow he was a shell of that man. Clean, perhaps now. But broken.\nUseless. The consequences of his choices lying before his eyes.\n“Too late?” Orholam asked. “What do I look like? A broken-down old\noar-puller?”\n“Please don’t try to cheer me up.”\n“You’ll need this later,” Orholam said. He stepped away from the gun-\nsword He’d been leaning on. Somehow, its tip had sunk deep into the\nmarble of the black roof they stood on.\n“‘Later’?! Is that a joke? There is no later! The sun’s down!” Kip was\ndying. Karris was dead, or would be any moment—and there was nothing\nhe could do to save them. Dazen swept his hand out in the direction of the\nChromeria as the last light died. “It’s all darkness now! Look!”\nJust as Dazen’s hand waved to the dark hopelessness of the dead\nhorizon, a wide beam of white light shot out squarely at him from exactly\nwhere the Chromeria must be.\nIts brilliance nearly blinded him. It was so intense there was a physical\nweight to it. It almost knocked him off his feet. Merely standing in its path\nfelt like sucking in a great gasping breath after being submerged in a lake\nfor far too long. It was pure, unsealed white luxin, a torrent, like someone\nhad pumped the crank of a well and hope and courage and life shot forth,\none time—then stopped.\nAnd it was gone.\n“What was that!?” Dazen breathed.\n“That was Kip. Fighting. Dying.” A tear rolled down each of Orholam’s\ncheeks, but He seemed proud of Kip, even in His sorrow. “That was your"

Dying.” A tear rolled down each of Orholam’s\ncheeks, but He seemed proud of Kip, even in His sorrow. “That was your\nanswer.”\n“To what?”\n“The only question.”\n“Why?” Dazen asked, weeping.\n“Yes. Why all your suffering? Why Alvaro’s? Why Kip’s?” Orholam\nsaid.\nDazen wept harder. “It was his cry for help, wasn’t it? I should have\nbeen there to save—”\n“Stop. You’re not getting it. Kip outgrew his overt self-pity before his\nfather could outgrow his subtler kind. He wanted your help, yes, but not to\nsave his own life. He wanted your help to save those you both love.”\nDazen raised his hands, supplicating, disbelieving. “How can I\npossibly…?”\nOrholam was studying the descending night sky. The moon hadn’t yet\nrisen. “Awfully dark out here,” He said. “Dark enough a drafter of black\ncould find source in the sky, don’t you think? That’s one color you can still\ndraft, isn’t it?”\nThe consequences of doing that settled around Dazen’s neck like a\nmantle of iron. Softly he said, “It’ll obliterate me.”\n“It will, if you let go of Me,” Orholam agreed.\nDazen looked angrily at him. “I don’t understand what You think I can\ndo from here.”\n“I don’t require your understanding.”\n“Just my obedience,” Dazen said bitterly. “Got it.”\n“And your strength,” Orholam said.\nDazen stood, laboriously, and in the process got his hands thoroughly\nbloody. He didn’t feel strong. He hadn’t felt strong this morning, before\neverything this awful day had thrown at him. He followed Orholam to\nwhere He’d left the sword as if in a trance.\nHe didn’t want to die, but now, finally, he was ready. If it was all for this,\nthen so be it.\nOrholam extended a hand to him, and Dazen took Orholam’s clean hand\nin his own bloody, three-fingered one.\n“You remember the coordinates?” Orholam asked.\n“I never forget anything. You know that. But… uh… coordinates?”\n“Kip gave you the position of the Chromeria. But there’s only one\ndrafter in the world strong enough to throw magic that far.”\nDazen shrugged. “Kip was strong enough.”\n“He was.”\nWas. That little word was a punch in the guts.\nIt pissed Dazen off, and not at Orholam this time.\nIt sank into the cool ashes of his heart and blew the embers to flame.\nThey’d killed Kip. They’d murdered his son.\nHe was going to make them pay for that.\nHe had a sudden thought. “The bane are there?”\nOrholam nodded. “Kip and Karris got two. There’s five left.”\n“Five on one. That’s hardly fair,” Dazen said.\n“Five on one?” Orholam asked, amused. “Not five on two?”\nDazen looked at Him, opened his mouth, shut it. “Yeah, that’s what I"

You… do Your\nthing. Whatever that is.\nBut the time for sniping was finished. Impossible magic, against\nimpossible odds?\nThat’s what I do.\nHe breathed out, widening his pupils and gazing toward the darkest part\nof the sky.\nBefore, he’d wrestled black luxin to obliterate, to destroy others, and to\ndestroy himself, to rip himself asunder and blot out parts he hated. It had\nbeen the sum of all wild beasts, bucking against him like a mustang,\nwhipping its tusks toward his belly like a giant javelina, charging him like\nan iron bull—and in all the fights, he’d been a brute with a whip,\ndetermined to break the beast. Like a cornered, injured animal, the black\nluxin had been all violence and madness, both against his enemies and\nagainst himself.\nNow, entering the great beast’s demesne, he extended an open will with\nhis open right hand, offering partnership, not mastery.\nAnd the black came roaring from the night upon him—charging over the\nhorizon and into Dazen’s undefended, wide-open eye. Dazen lay supine,\nexposing his belly to the snarling maw of the great wolf Death.\nHere am I, Death. Let us walk together one last time, and fight each\nother no more.\nThe beast paused, snuffling at his bloody open hand, even as the magic\nfilled Dazen’s eyes and made his bones hot within him.\nA shiver passed through him, from the crown of his head, down his\nspine and hands, which burned hot with blood, and to the heated soles of his\nfeet, rooted in the blood that connected skin to tower.\nWithout the scent of fear inflaming its predator’s nose, but accepted,\nrespected, the great black beast calmed. Then its power entered him.\nEven at Sundered Rock, he hadn’t drafted so much. He drew and drew,\ntaking all the dark night into his soul. He drew, lancing those darkened\nmemories for all his own old poison, all the hatred and envy inside him, all\nthe cruelty of taunting victory he’d unleashed before. He connected the\ndarkness above with the old darkness within, though each was punctuated\nby its celestial lights. He was beyond fear now. How could he be daunted?\nHe could give no more than everything in him, and that was exactly what he\nplanned to do.\nHe threaded his fingers tight through the beast’s mantle and then with a\nyell of defiance, Dazen slapped its flank: Take all this, and go! Go!\nThe black luxin leapt toward the horizon like a war hound on a lead\nseeing a cat and leaping to the hunt. It nearly tore Dazen’s arm off. He\ncould only nudge it this way and that, directing his fraying will toward the\nChromeria.\nIt took all the excellence of Dazen’s superchromacy to maintain the\nexact tone. The slightest flaw would mean madness or agonizing death or\nthe obliteration of memory and self or even time."

The slightest flaw would mean madness or agonizing death or\nthe obliteration of memory and self or even time.\nEven the descending starlight eroded the black as they flew across so\nmany leagues, and Dazen had to cushion every quantum that infected his\nstreaming black, had to split it away from the stream and push more power\ninto it, like a sprinter shrugging off battering rain, forging through buffeting\nwinds—and he lost precious luxin continuously as he did it, a hundred\ntimes a second. Dazen could feel the black unraveling in his grasp, like the\nsouthern lights dancing across the sky, defying his control.\nAnd as the magic unraveled, it unraveled him. He braided the open\ncords together again and again, weaving them tight with fingers that felt a\nmillion paces away. He himself was dissipating, losing awareness altogether\ninto the cold dark, but he pulled himself back to consciousness again and\nagain.\nThis was for Karris. This was for Kip. This was for Marissia. This was\nfor mother. This was for Gavin. This was for Sevastian…\nHe couldn’t fail them. He couldn’t fail them again.\nBut then he was there. He couldn’t see the islands, he couldn’t see\nanything, but he could feel the entirety of Big Jasper and Little Jasper both,\nthose shapes he knew and loved so well. He could feel the physical and\nmagical shapes of the bane, each one extending overlapping bubbles of\ncontrol far beyond themselves. No red drafter could draft red within the red\nbane’s bubble, nor green in green’s, nor yellow in yellow’s, and so on.\nDazen didn’t have enough time or will or magic or life left to obliterate\nthe bane. They were too far away, too dense, too numerous, too different\nfrom one another.\nThe control he would need to find the seed crystals themselves was far\ntoo fine for his skills. Father had always told him he needed to develop his\nfine-drafting skills, but Dazen had always ignored him, believing more was\nbetter: always the hammer, never the tweezers.\nThere they lay: all the bane, everywhere around the islands, like leeches\nclinging to the Chromeria’s face. He could pierce those bubbles of drafting\ncontrol easily with the black, but to find five single figures—these so-called\ngods?—in the few seconds he had left? To find the bane’s hidden seed\ncrystals?\nIt would be like trying to pick a lock with a feather duster.\nHis will, thus overextended, began to fray apart now in hopelessness.\nThe black he’d flung so far dissipated into the amorphous clouds as the\nmagic finally pulled itself away from his fingers.\nAnd then he felt her.\nHe wouldn’t have thought he could know anyone from this distance, but\nhe couldn’t have missed her, not if she’d been twice so far away. Her will\nburned in the evaporating cloud he’d thrown, like a lighthouse burning\nwhite in the black of a lost captain’s night.\nKarris!\n* * *\nKarris’s Blackguards and all the other soldiers they’d recruited on the spot\nhad made it halfway to Orholam’s Glare when they’d been jumped by the"

Forty wights was a huge\nproblem. They were clad head to toe in white, gloved and hooded to hide\nwhat colors they drafted. In moments, she was in a fight for her life.\nAnd no fair fight. Every one of the Blackguards except the monochrome\nblues were feeling it. The bane had tightened their grip. Anyone who had\nthe least luxin left in their bodies had to fight against luxin locking up inside\nthem—and every drafter except the youngest had some luxin permanently\nin their bodies.\nEven those who’d carefully drained their power with hellstone were\nslowed. The best off fought as if in a high wind. Those worse off fought as\nif in water, sluggish, their old strength turned against them.\nBut then she felt something. The air turned colder, somehow murky, as if\na dry fog had rolled in. The city darkened perceptibly. Night had arrived on\nsprinting feet instead of its usual gentle wings. But, in the fighting,\neveryone around her missed it.\nShe stepped back from the fight, back into the mass of Blackguards here\nto protect her.\nThere was something familiar—\nShe gasped.\nGavin!\nShe opened her will to him, and she knew. He was dying.\nShe felt his strength faltering, fraying. Her heart froze.\nLive, damn you, live! You come back to me!\n* * *\nBut it was too late. He was dying. He was failing her, again.\nHe could feel her weighed down by the bane’s oppressive power. Her\nlight dimmed, her limbs heavy from the very luxin that lived in her,\nshackled, unable to defend herself from the death he knew was stalking her.\nHe could feel the lock and knew how he might release her from it, but from\nthis distance, it was like feeling the teeth of a key with a fingertip.\nNo.\nNo, not while he had breath.\nHe released all else and clung to her, his lighthouse, the white in the\nfoggy seas of his black.\n* * *\nKarris was frozen, even amid the clash of arms around her. Gill Greyling,\nblood splashed across his face, was shouting something at her. ‘Retreat.\nWe’ve failed. We can’t…’\nMere words.\nIt was like they didn’t even notice.\nDon’t do it, my love. Please, no. Gavin, what are you doing?\nThere was something fatal and final she could feel in Gavin’s will.\nPlease, no. Forgive me, my love, but I gave up on you once—don’t you\ndare do it, too.

More black!”\nThe sky above was dotted now with thousands of stars, shining, brilliant.\nThe descending darkness should have given him more source, but it only\nmade those points of defiant light shine all the brighter.\nOrholam said, “Even eagles must sometimes dive into a lake to hunt, no\nmatter that it momentarily destroys the lake’s reflection of the sky.”\n“What are You even talking about? Reflection of the—”\nDazen looked at the sword stuck into the black crust covering the tower.\nWhen he’d stepped through to the other side of the mirror, the tower in\nthat other world had been white.

He had lived by the blade, wrongly sacrificing the innocent. It\nwas only right he himself should be its final sacrifice.\nThis is for you, Vell Parsham, my first murder. You tried to warn me.\nShe’d said, ‘End me now, Lord Prism, but someday, may you end it all\nor be ended. Know that Orholam is just, and tremble.’\nThis is for you, Edna, who thought your sins so black you couldn’t\nspeak them. I understand you now as I couldn’t then.\nThis is for you, Titrit, whom I despised. I came to despise myself more.\nThis is for Dulcina Dulceana… He couldn’t think of her, but he\nremembered her words and his own disbelief at her quiet, her peace. She’d\nsaid, ‘You’ve been doing Orholam’s work all day, and will do so all night\nand through the morrow. Let me give you a gift. The only gift I have. The\ngift of my five minutes. You may speak or we can be silent. You can Free\nme first if you prefer solitude, or at the end if you prefer company. As you\nwill.’ She’d believed in him so much—she’d been so generous of spirit that\nshe’d given him her last five minutes: a poor woman giving her last mite to\na man whose treasury overflowed.\nHer grace had broken him.\nGoing in to his first Freeing, Gavin had believed in two gods, and with\nher had died his faith in the wrong one.\nThis is for you Aheyyad Brightwater, that flower I plucked too soon.\nThis is for… this is for all of you."

Men and wights both\npaused in their fighting, backing away from their enemies.\n“What is it?” Gill asked. “What’s happening?”\nKarris was looking out to sea toward her lost love, so she saw it first.\nFar out beyond East Bay, the lights of a ship winked out. Then another’s,\nfar to one side. A burning ship’s fires simply disappeared. Then she noticed\nthat the stars on the horizon were gone.\nHer breath caught in her throat as she saw it for what it was. Like a\nsandstorm thundering across the desert, towering into the night, an immense\nblack wave broke over the horizon, wider than the Jaspers themselves, and\nas high as the clouds.\nIn the distance, she heard screams at its onslaught.\nAs if the sea were swelling and devouring all before it in a massive\nwave, every light on every ship was extinguished in turn, into the bay, and\nthen over the towers, over the walls, and then—in the time it takes to suck\nin a startled breath—over the Jaspers entire.\nAll went utterly, utterly black. Blacker than mere night. This was the\nblack of blindness, after a life spent working light. It penetrated everything,\nsoaking everything as water does—then scouring it away with all the\nstrength of an earthquake’s wave.\nEerily, it was silent.\nAnd it was, unmistakably, unquestionably, Gavin.\nThen, just as the wails of alarm and despair were rising up from women\nand men struck blind and dismayed at their sudden loss—the wave was\ngone.\nAs light returned to their eyes, Karris could feel the wave dissipating. It\nhad been held together this far, but it wouldn’t last even another league.\nGavin had…\n“promachos,” Gill whispered, awed. “That was him. That was Gavin,\nwasn’t it?

We can draft!”\nNumerous bane-islands were still out there, so at first no one believed\nher, but then there were slowly the snaps and hisses of glorious colors\ncoming alive from burning mag torches.

It was part of what made him an excellent\ncommander, and in truth, he’d never understood how other people couldn’t\ndo it.\nWhich was why right now he was cursing in the face of a shaking\nmessenger, spit flying as he bellowed, “How old is this message?! And\ndon’t tell me you don’t fucking know!”\n“Maybe, maybe half an hour, sir? Less?” the messenger said. “I came\nstraight here, but the others—”\n“An hour?” Corvan demanded.\n“Uh, maybe? Maybe, sir. Yes. There was so much fighting, and I wanted\nto make sure I got through safely so I didn’t—”\n“Get out of my face!”\nTwo of Corvan’s bodyguards, one from either side, suddenly threw their\nshields up in front of him as a fireball the size of a woman’s head arced\ntoward him. It bounced off their shields and rolled into the crowd behind\nhim.\nNope. Not a fireball the size of a woman’s head. A literal flaming\nwoman’s head. Odd.\nThe messenger blanched. A coward. It was the last trait a messenger\ncould afford—but one didn’t find out which messengers could handle the\njob until they’d been through a battle or two.\nA distraction, Kip said. Kip needed a distraction.\nThe city was in a bad way. Corvan had just had news that the wall\nbordering the poor neighborhood of Overhill nearest the red bane was\nnearly abandoned, most of its defenders lured to the walls elsewhere in the\nnobles’ neighborhoods, or even worse, lured to guard their houses against\nthe looters they feared during the battle.\nIf the city survived until tomorrow, Corvan was going to find those\ndamned nobles and put them on the walls as rank infantrymen themselves.\nBut first came survival.\nCorvan had found any plan with too many working parts tended to fall\napart in direct relation to how many parts depended on other parts doing\nwhat they should, so his battle plan was simple: defend and delay. As\nislands, the most obvious weakness of the Jaspers was that they were easy\nto lay under siege.\nBut anyone laying them under siege was, in effect, under siege\nthemselves. Karris had directed the isles’ fishermen to deliberately overfish\nthe nearby waters, not only to stockpile dried fish but to deprive invaders.\nFresh water was an even bigger problem for a besieging armada, so where\nthere were springs that drained into the sea, Corvan had massed defenders\nin greater numbers than any other general would have. If the fight lasted\nlong enough, the availability of potable water might actually be the key to\nthe victory.\nEverywhere, he’d prepared the defenders with how long to hold their\nwalls, and what to do when they lost them, and how to signal everyone else\nthat such loss was imminent.\nThe defenders would stagger their losses, hopefully containing those to\nnonessential areas.

A few natural ambush choke points could be used if the\nlocal commanders dared.\nCorvan liked to push certain decisions down the chain of command as\nmuch as possible. Men paralyzed waiting for orders that might never come\nthrough the chaos of battle were dead men, not defenders.\nToday the hope had been to hold the Blood Robes off the walls.\nUnsurprisingly, that hadn’t worked out.\nThe next plan had been to make them pay in rivers of blood for every\nstreet they took, delaying them until dark, when the Jaspers’ defenders\nwould no longer be at a disadvantage.\nBut there were places the Chromeria couldn’t afford to lose, full stop:\nsome of the gun emplacements that could be turned against the city and the\nChromeria itself, certain neighborhoods, the Lily’s Stem—and the Great\nFountain. Corvan had set up his headquarters here to stress to his people\nhow it was the linchpin to their defense. Not only was it the most abundant\nsource of fresh water in the city with its artesian well, but it sat at one of the\nfive great intersections of the city. That made it hard to defend, but also easy\nto dispatch reinforcements to anyplace in the city that needed it.\nThe battle had come here, in surprising force.\nThe razor wings and bomb wings and the crawling vermin will-cast to\nburrow into the street barricades before bursting into flame had waited until\nthe assaults by tens of thousands of Blood Robe soldiers. Kip had warned\nCorvan of this: the use of munds as cannon fodder and auxiliaries.\nIt had meant a catastrophic loss of life for the attackers, especially as the\nbane had been so confused, so late in locking down all the Chromeria’s\ndefenders.\nThe defenders had lost neighborhood after neighborhood, including\nsome sections of wall with their most powerful guns—all spiked before\nthey were abandoned, luckily.\nBut the Blood Robes hadn’t broken off the attack here, even as full dark\nwas gathering.\nWhy weren’t they withdrawing?\nAfter all, at night the Blood Robes were deprived of their greatest\nadvantage—their drafters and wights. Why wouldn’t they wait until\ntomorrow to attack again? Were they hoping to take the city before full\ndark, and were giving their attack a few more minutes to succeed? Did they\nthink Corvan’s forces so close to breaking?\nHe thought them wrong, though not by much.\nThat was when Kip sprang his own gambit: attacking the bane\nthemselves with small squads. Suicidally small squads.\nKip, repulsing unbelievably strong magical attacks, was trying to wrest\nvictory directly from the enemy while their forces were at Corvan’s throat.\nIt was just the kind of move Corvan would have attempted as a young\nman, though not, he thought, with such small forces.\nHis people had fought the Blood Robes to a standstill. Indeed, some of\nthe invading soldiers had even withdrawn to their bane.\nCorvan swore aloud again, suddenly putting the pieces together.\nThose Blood Robes had withdrawn to protect their bane from Kip’s\nMighty. Kip’s men had been striking at the heart of the White King’s power\nand had needed the distraction Kip requested so they wouldn’t be\noverwhelmed.\nBut the messenger was a coward."

His wife, Polyhymnia, the Third Eye, had called him her\nTitan of the Great Fountain. He’d set up his defense here partly because of\nthat.\nBut that plan couldn’t work because of the bane’s influence locking\ndown red.\nMagic rocked the isles again and again. Not only the loss of blue—there\nwere reports of white?! Some even claimed to have felt black.\nBut even as detached as Corvan liked to think he was in the midst of\nissuing orders and hearing reports and dodging razor wings, he realized he\ncouldn’t even comprehend everything that was happening elsewhere. There\nwere at least two battles happening here simultaneously, probably three, all\noverlapping one another.\nAnd he might be screwing up all of them.\nNow, why weren’t these damned Blood Robes retreating with the\ncoming night? Why?!\nThen, suddenly, the black luxin returned in an enormous wave.\nDazen!\nThe wave scoured the islands, breaking the bane’s control of all the\ndrafters, freeing them to do what they could.\nThe defenders and attackers were equally astonished, breaking from\nfighting for a few moments and then rejoining the fray. But even that didn’t\nmake the Blood Robes flee.\nAnd then the black wave was gone.\nCorvan immediately deployed his drafters, but the sun was already so\nfar down that they had little source. Some had mag torches, but those were\nrare and expensive—Corvan left it to the drafters themselves to decide if\nthey needed to use them.\nIt allowed some pushback at key places, but there weren’t enough mag\ntorches to fuel the defense.\nWhy the hell had Kip stopped sending light from the mirror array?! He\nhadn’t been answering the messages they’d flashed to him for a while now.\nAnd now was when they needed him on the mirror array most. These few\nminutes could make a real difference!\n“Send messages to Kip again. Tell him if he’s got any more tricks, now\nwould be a good time—”\n“Sir, the superviolets say that the Ferrilux has seized the mirror array,”\nan attaché said.\n“What?!” he demanded.\nFerrilux’s bane had been killed, but she had not. And she’d taken the\narray, which likely meant Kip was dead.\nDammit, Aliviana.\nBut he couldn’t think of her as his daughter. Not right now. And maybe\nit wasn’t her anymore. Maybe she wasn’t in control anymore. Maybe she\nwas a victim, too.\nSo why would Ferrilux seize the mirrors as night came? Why put herself\nin such peril that she would try to take the mirrors even without her bane or\nher wights?\nHe looked out at the other bane once more.

With colors from\neach of the towers and the mirrors, the wights would be able to attack with\nmagic, all night long, anywhere in the city.\nAside from the purely strategic disadvantage of fighting all those wights\nwith no magic themselves, Corvan realized that in mere minutes his people\nwere going to be fighting street to street against literal monsters in the dark.\nThe terror would be overwhelming.\n“Sir! We’ve got more wights massing to attack. Hundreds at least!” an\nattaché shouted over the din.\n“What colors? What colors, Lieutenant?

Not a one of his household had stood by him. He\nhad treated them so well, and this is what he got?\nWhen the spasms passed, he pulled himself to his feet. He was past the\nworst of it now. Two bites into his garlic-and-almond chicken before he’d\nstopped. Two distracted bites before he’d recognized the tastes weren’t\nexactly garlic and almond, and stopped, and forced himself to vomit. Not\ngarlic and almond, but two poisons whose odors most resemble those:\narsenic and cyanide.\nHe braced himself against the doorframe, and slowly, slowly checked\nhis Ilytian pistol. There was a chance that an assassin might come and make\nsure the job was finished. Then, reassured, he opened the door.\nNo one was outside. All the Blackguards had abandoned their posts,\neither traitors or men and women who put their loyalty to Karris above their\nloyalty to anyone else on the Spectrum. Certainly Zymun had had no\nBlackguards attending him when he’d murdered Kip. Zymun was stupid,\nbut he wasn’t that stupid.\nAndross tottered across the hallway to Felia’s old chambers. Opened the\ndoor slowly, in case its occupant had been given a musket.\n“Who’s there?!” a young woman called out.\n“It is I.”\n“Who the hell are you?” Teia demanded from the couch. Good, good."

Who’s coming? No, you\nmayn’t take control! I know your—”\nAnd then Teia crashed into her—and shoved hard, launching her off the\nrooftop.\nTeia stepped to the edge, and as she passed out of sight, Aliviana still\nseemed to be falling fast—but using only paryl as she was, Teia couldn’t\nsee all the way to the ground.\nMoments later, she heard the crunch of a footstep behind her.\n“Well, color me less than impressed.”"

I have to see if I can figure out what the Ferrilux was trying to\ndo.”\nChapter 134\n“Is the black powder ready?” Corvan asked. The battle was raging at the\nbarricades all around the Great Fountain. Corvan’s drafters had all burned\nthrough their mag torches. The Cwn y Wawr war hounds had each fought\nlike a dozen men, but now every one of them bore wounds and was\nexhausted, panting, those intelligent eyes seeming to bear full knowledge of\ntheir coming deaths. The men Kip had recruited from Daragh the Coward’s\nforces had fought as if every last one of them wanted to win medals, and\nevery last one of them would’ve earned one, too.\nBut the end was coming, and they knew it, and those hard men seemed\nto have no regrets that this was how they would face it.\n“Yes, sir, powder’s ready,” his lieutenant, Lorenço, answered. Corvan’s\nusual attaché, Miriam, had leapt into a razor-wing attack, saving him. Her\nthroat had been cut. She’d been alive when they’d carried her away, but\nhadn’t looked good. “But… sir, can you tell me what you’re planning?”\nSomething had happened with the mirror array atop the Prism’s Tower—\nperhaps the Ferrilux had been killed—because the mirrors were doing\nnothing. Maybe that was the only reason the Great Fountain—and the city\n—still stood, but it wasn’t enough.\nCorvan had been right that the bane had meant to be sources for the\nBlood Robe wights and drafters all through the night, and losing the mirror\narray was a setback for them—but not the total catastrophe Corvan\nwould’ve hoped.\nThe bane themselves, with single mirrors each, couldn’t reach many\nparts of Big Jasper, and they could only focus their light on one area at a\ntime.\nSome were more adept at this than others, clearly, already shining light\nto one area for ten seconds, then another for ten, then another, then"

As it was, the defenders were merely facing superior\nnumbers of drafters and wights with lots of magic, while they themselves\nhad none.\nThe dam was straining, and Corvan guessed his forces had only minutes\nhere before they were overwhelmed. Hell, even if they held here, it was\nsurely only minutes until key points elsewhere in the city broke.\nIf they hadn’t already.\nHe wondered if any of Kip’s Mighty were still alive.\nHe wondered if a distraction now—so very long after they’d requested it\n—could still do them any good.\n“You ever try to read your wife’s mind, son?” Corvan asked. The young\nIlytian was a newlywed.\n“Yessir,” Lorenço said. “Doesn’t usually go well for me.”\n“Me, neither,” Corvan said. ‘Titan of the Great Fountain,’ dear?

I took command of armies when I was younger than he is now.\nGot it?!” There was a small chorus of agreement, but many were too tired\nor too hurt to reply.\n“You take these next moments to shore up the barricades.

You would’ve loved it.\nHe sketched out the arcs in his mind. It was actually going to work a lot\nbetter in the dark. Half pyroturgy, half luxin imbued with will—and a shit\nton of black powder.\nLooking one last time at his people, he said, “Pleasure. Honor. All the\nshit. Keep fighting. And get back farther. This is most likely just gonna\nblow me up.”\nHe crouched to jump and then sheathed his entire body in red luxin. He\nlooked over at Lorenço, who was standing by the black powder launch pad\nwith the linstock in his hand.\n‘Titan of the Great Fountain’ my ass.\n“Lieutenant,” he said. “Now.”\nWith a loud report, the first of the powder barrels was flung sky-high.\nChapter 135\n“I’m… not dead?” Dazen said, opening his eyes. “I’m not dead!”\n“Yet,” Orholam said.\nDazen glowered at Him. “Well, that’s not a very nice joke after what I\njust went through.”\n“It’s funnier in other realms.”\nThat didn’t make him feel any better. “When You say ‘yet’ what kind of\ntime frame are You operating on?”"

Being alive, I mean? In the\nmore immediate sense, I mean, not in the sense of ‘I made all this shit and\nthat means you, too, especially the shit part.’”\n“I want you to remember this, a little later,” Orholam said.\n“Which ‘this’? This, the You saving me, or this this, my impertinence?”\nDazen asked. “I’m doing it again, aren’t I?”\nAs the last fog of the black departed from him, Dazen noticed that the\ntower he was kneeling on was now awash with water, not blood. And the\ntower’s entire shell of black luxin that the blood had covered over was\ngone. Dazen now knelt on radiant white luxin like what he’d seen on the\nother side of the Great Mirror of Waking—an entire massive edifice of the\nluxin he’d so long believed mythical.\n“Are you ready to continue?” Orholam asked.\n“Continue?” Dazen turned his hands palms up. “I thought that was my\npenance. What, that didn’t count?”\n“It counted for quite a lot.”\nDazen expelled a breath. “Thank You, by the by,” he said, standing with\ngreat effort. He was exhausted.\n“You’re welcome.”\n“What’s next?” he asked. The waning wick of his life was already\nsmoldering on its last wax. “I can only draft two colors—if you call black\nand white ‘colors’—Wow, am I scattered after that.”\nHe looked at Orholam. Then at the tower. Then at Orholam.\n“This one is going to be death, isn’t it?”\n“No, no. This will be—”\n“Oh, good!”\n“—a good penance,” Orholam said, nodding. “And life for many.”\nDazen wrinkled his brow. “You say that as if we’re somehow in\nagreement.”\n“Promachos, hurling black luxin across half the breadth of the satrapies\nwas a well-nigh lethal and well-nigh impossible magical test—”\n“Yes! It was! Thank You!”\n“—that allowed you to do exactly what you wanted.”\nDazen had no answer for that.\n“Doing impossible magic to overcome ludicrous odds and smash my\nenemies?” he said. “That’s what I do!” So maybe he did have an answer.\n“Did,” Orholam said quietly. It was the gentlest whipcrack Dazen had\never heard. It had a sound of finality to it.\nDazen had the sudden and too-slow-arriving insight that Orholam was\naccustomed to having the last word.\nOrholam continued, “There was never a question of your will or your\nability, Dazen, so such a test is hardly a test at all, much less a penance.”\n“So You’re saying this is the one that’s going to be hard for me,” Dazen\nsaid.\n“Yes.”"

What could such a\ntest possibly be? “Just when I was starting to like You,” he said. His\nbravado was thin, but on a cold night a thin cloak is better than none, and\nthis night was starting to feel cold indeed, in the gale of Orholam’s gaze.\n“What do You want me to do?”\n“Touch the mirror.”\nI already did that, Dazen thought. But he was smart enough not to say it,\nbarely. He moved over toward the great shining thing, torrents of clear\nwater gushing over its surface and onto his feet, threatening to wash him\naway as he came close. But he reached through the water and touched the\nmetal.\nThe waters ceased.\nAnd he saw himself.\nBehind him, Orholam said gently, “Behold Dazen Guile, who thought\nhimself the least of his brothers.”\nHe saw himself, the image crisp and clear in the starlight. He stood\nslouching, with two fingers cut off, his dogtooth smashed out, cheeks\nhollow from privation, back striped through injustice and bowed through\ntravail—and yet still here. He’d been a great beauty before the last few\nyears: muscular, strong-jawed, broad and tall, agile and self-possessed with\na winning smile and prismatic eyes. No wonder they’d loved him. They’d\nseen the flawless bark of the great sequoy, not the rot within, the roots\nwithered, waiting for the next great wind to topple him. He studied himself\n—with only one eye now, but that one eye was bright and clear.\nHe’d been hiding all his life. Now he hid no more.\nDiminished though Dazen was, he was not devoid of all virtues, not\neven in his body. He was still tall, still broad, and strength was rallying in\nhis every limb.\nHe studied what he’d long avoided, and there was now no detail\nobscured, no truth denied. Here he stood in the cold light of eternity, and by\nsome magic greater than chromaturgy, all that was wretched and self-\ndeprecatory and judgmental and hating fell away like a serpent’s scale from\nhis eye.\nHe had seen through Orholam’s mask of being an old prophet, and\nbeheld something ineffably beguiling beneath the old prophet’s age spots\nand deep wrinkles and snaggle teeth.\nAnd now he saw something of that same beauty in himself, an image of\nthe divine.\nHere was Dazen Guile through the eyes of charity.\nAnd as unwilling tears flooded his eyes, he realized that—wonder of\nwonders!—he was glorious."

You mean some magic? I just threw a volcano of black luxin at\nthe Jaspers. I wiped out everything magical there. Surely I spoiled anything\nKip was trying to do.”\nCalmly, Orholam said, “White luxin is not overwhelmed by black.”\nDazen thought of a thousand reasons why that wasn’t necessarily the\ncase, and then realized who he was talking to. “It is really frustrating to\nargue with you,” Dazen said.\n“I get that a lot,” Orholam said. “Ditto. Oh, by the by, hurry.”\nChapter 136\nQuentin had arrived too late. He’d spent all day serving: first carrying food\nand water, later attending to the wounded in the poorest parts of the city,\ncomforting the dying when he could.

So he’d served in his\nuncomfortable clothes in the soot and smoke and blood—neither danger nor\nmagic moving him—until he saw he saw that white beam shooting out to\nthe east.\nHe’d run immediately, praying, praying he not be too late.\nHe was too late.\nThe traitor had already been lowered from Orholam’s Glare, and a\nblonde-haired noblewoman held his body, weeping.\nThe crowd in the square was large, angry, confused, scared. They’d been\nwitness to magic such as they’d never seen—such as no one had ever seen.\nBut the man who’d done it was dead, and the city was still under attack. It\nseemed like everything should have changed with so much magic, but\nnothing had.\nBlackness had rushed over the city entire, as if even the light mourned\nthe dead man, and abandoned them with his passing. But then that, too, was\ngone, and nothing had changed, unless it had changed for the worse:\neveryone had expected the Blood Robes to withdraw with the coming of\nnight, and they’d redoubled their efforts instead.\n“Are you quite done?” Zymun asked.\nThen Quentin saw the woman as her face lifted in tear-streaked rage,\nand every bad premonition he’d had was confirmed.

Now she’s the White, and no one even talks\nabout her tawdry early days. Me? I don’t call a woman like her a disloyal\nwhore, I call her practical. Besides, who wants to share a loser’s bed? You\nought to consider trying her approach: find out what it’s like to be fucked by\na winner, for once. Tonight, maybe? I can promise you won’t remember\nKip’s name by dawn. Hell, you might not even remember your own.”\nHe looked up at his men, and the Lightguards laughed belatedly like the\nsycophants they were. Some of them chuckled awkwardly instead, like men\nwho suddenly felt like they’d gotten into something much worse than\nthey’d bargained for.\nTisis launched herself at him, screaming incoherently.\nHe slapped her hard, as if he’d been waiting for it.\nThen he leaned over, just as Quentin finally made his way to the front.\n“Careful, sweetheart. I’m going to interpret that pathetic attack as spirit,\nfire, whatever you want to call it. But do it again, and I call it treason. And\nyou’ve seen what I do to traitors.” He turned. “Now, then, what’s happening\nup on top of my tower?”\nTisis’s nose was streaming blood, but she rose to her hands and knees.\nJust in front of her, one of the Lightguard shifted his weight and put a\nhand on his hip, flaring his cloak out around where his pistol was tucked,\ncocking it with the back of his hand as he did so, as if by accident. He\ncleared his throat to cover the sound, looking away.\nZymun’s back was turned, and the Lightguards were turning with him to\nhead back to the Chromeria.\nTisis leapt to her feet, grabbing the pistol from the Lightguard’s belt. She\nleveled it at the back of Zymun’s head, not a pace away.\nBut a spear butt flashed up between them and threw the pistol into the\nsky. And in a blink the spear’s holder—the Lightguard commander, Aram—\nwas holding Tisis, his spear under her neck, choking her.\n“Treason!” Aram shouted.\nSeveral other Lightguards took up the shout. It all had the feeling of\nsomething poorly choreographed. The people in the square looked merely\nhorrified."

You stupid,\nstupid girl.”\nHe turned back to the crowd. “The Glare is too cruel for this poor\nwoman. And I shouldn’t want her to have to wait for justice. Who knows\nwhat might happen before tomorrow? Put a rope up on the Glare, and hang\nher. Immediately.”\n“No!” someone cried out in the crowd.\nZymun went purple. “What?

How could we let this go?\nLike that sleeper waking, stretching his arms, Dazen stretched out his\nmagic luxuriously toward the Chromeria, and the pains stretching thus\nbrought him were pains leaving his body. White blazed out from him to the\nhorizon and beyond, toward his beloved islands, his beloved wife, and all\nthose many others he loved there. It was a great gift—a privilege!—to bring\nsuch light.\nDazen’s will burned white through the darkness, over the face of waters\nas if tracing the white-luxin line Kip had thrown toward him back to its\nsource.\nAs he raced back, he felt a whisper of will in the fading white luxin Kip\nhad cast. Was it a prayer? Desperation, but no message was discernible at\nthis distance as the luxin was disappearing. Dazen’s heart leapt. It was Kip’s\nwill, Kip’s voice!\nKip was alive?!\nBut then he realized, like a distant cannon’s flash outruns the sound of\nits firing, that what he was sensing now, becoming clearer and clearer with\nevery league his will came closer, was only the last echo of his dead son’s\nvoice. And yet he grabbed after it, desperately, that this one remaining piece\nof Kip might not be lost to him.\nThe message became clear only as Dazen closed on the Jaspers\nthemselves.\n“Please! God!

No trace of living will remained, but the luxin he’d been\nweaving had not yet decayed completely, though it was unraveling by the\nmoment.\nWhat were you doing, son?\nIt had something to do with the mirror array, but Kip hadn’t averted the\nlarger mirrors from himself—as any sane man being baked to death on\nOrholam’s Glare would’ve been trying to do. Why not?\nBut there were seven fading streaks, like dim arrows of chi and white\nluxin. And then those, too, were gone.\nAnd now nothing of Kip remained.\nFinish what I’ve begun?

Each mirror tower held an odd reservoir, like liquid luxin of its own\ncolor within or beneath it. Tyrea’s Great Mirror outside Rekton brimmed\nwith sub-red, a shrine outside Idoss stored red, Ru’s Great Mirror stored\norange, Blood Forest’s held yellow, Melos—capital of the ancient united\nkingdom comprising most of Ruthgar and Blood Forest—held green, Paria\nheld blue, and Ilyta superviolet.\nBut why would Kip look for more light as he was dying from too much?\nBecause he wasn’t looking for it for himself.\nKip had given his life trying to bring light for his friends, who would\nneed it to fight in the darkness.

He felt the\nmirror turn and then shiver as it came into place, as if it were made for this,\nas if the mirror was settling into an old groove—and felt it lock, not on him\nbut on the Great Mirror right behind him.\nOf course.\nConnected once again to its ancient network, under its cascading\ngardens and beautiful waterfalls, the surface of the Great Pyramid of Ru\nsuddenly flowered with orange runes and ancient designs. Dazen heard cries\nof fear turn to shouts of delight as the people of Ru came forth to see this\nwonder. But he had no time to enjoy it with them. He’d already moved on.\nThe Great Mirror in Blood Forest at Apple Grove had already been\nraised by Kip—but there were children playing at the base, in the way of\nthe gears. They might be crushed if Dazen moved it without warning.\nHe shook the Great Mirror, beginning the process. It threw several off\ntheir feet.\nThen he moved on. He’d come back.\nOutside the ruins of Kip’s home village of Rekton, within sight of\nSundered Rock, he found a fallen statue, perhaps of the old Tyrean Empire\nwarrior-priest Darjan. It once guarded and marked the mirror’s location.\nDazen realized then that at least some of the Great Mirrors were older than\nLucidonius, older than the nine kingdoms he’d conquered. They were at\nleast as old as the Tyrean Empire, fifteen hundred to three thousand years\nold.\nNow the crumpled statue seemed to guard nothing more than an orange\ngrove, but still a slow mist of paryl rose from the very soil. It shivered at\nDazen’s touch, and a puff of superviolet joined it, allowing his will to\nthread down and down through seemingly solid earth.\nHe gathered color after thickening strands of color into his grasp like the\nfibers of a rope. And taking it full in hand, heaved heavenward.\nThe earth split, tree roots tore, and in a fountain of dirt, a spire shot into\nthe sky.\nDazen laughed as the magic poured through him.\nHe glanced in wonder and awe at Orholam beside him and found Him\nsmiling His own delight and encouragement: ‘Go on!’\nDazen sank into it once more. This was his old strength, doubled and\nredoubled. He felt virile, potent, alive in a way he’d not felt in years. The\njoy of drafting came back to him. It was like, after being buried alive and\nbreathing as shallowly as possible, he’d suddenly broken free of the prison\nearth and was taking the deepest breath of his life. He was strong.\nNo, ‘strong’ didn’t cover it. He had the might of a Titan.\nA vast disk shot into the air, and then, with a pulse of magic that had lain"

He had the might of a Titan.\nA vast disk shot into the air, and then, with a pulse of magic that had lain\ndormant waiting for this moment, it vibrated, and all the dirt and detritus of\nlong ages jumped off its surface and it gleamed as sharply clear as the day it\nhad been made. On protected gears and belts undecaying, on luxin and old\ninfusions of will, the mirror swiveled to answer Dazen’s call.\nAnd his will shot away again. To an abandoned temple atop the first\nsoaring butte of the Red Cliffs outside Idoss.\nThen to a high valley between green round-shouldered mountains in\nIlyta, where the superviolet mirror had been buried beneath the banks of a\nriver. Bandits had set up a camp on this forbidden ground, a camp that had\nbecome a village. If he raised this mirror without warning, houses would be\ndestroyed, and perhaps innocents kidnapped for ransom or slavery or even\nchildren crushed.\nDazen shook the earth hard, laid a hex foreboding doom, and moved on.\nIn Paria, near two vast and trunkless legs of stone, the blue mirror lay\nhidden under the lone and level sands. A brickwork floor opened smoothly\non centuries-old hinges, swallowing half a dune effortlessly, and the mirror\nrose.\nIn Ruthgar, the green mirror rose from the heart of a butte over the\nverdant grasslands outside the once-great city of Melos, setting a nearby\nherd of iron bulls stampeding.\nBack to Blood Forest, where for the first time he realized that though the\nwell of white luxin might be limitless, his own endurance was not. He\nblinked, and wondered how long it had been since he’d blinked last.\nThe children had scattered. Some still watched from a distance, clinging\nto a wary young man near Kip’s age as if he were a father to them all. A\nsafe enough distance.\nDazen knew what he was doing now, and he pulled the Great Mirror to\nits groove. This one was a different design, though, from some other people,\nsome other time, claimed and retrofitted by later conquerors but not made\nnew.\nThis mirror was connected, communal somehow. It spoke to… trees? He\nfelt root speak to root, and his will was drawn from this mirror to others,\ndeeper into the forest, all the way to Dúnbheo and Green Haven and other,\nsmaller mirrors. It wasn’t a luxin-based web, though, so Dazen couldn’t\nraise all of them directly.\nInstead, he turned the first mirror toward them—and they answered! The\nGreat Mirrors of Dúnbheo and Green Haven didn’t even need to be raised;\nthey’d never been hidden in the first place. Some of the smaller mirrors\nwere broken, nodes that lived only in memory, but others had rested\nshielded within the trunks of great trees. Now coiled roots pushed out, and\nothers, stretched, pulled taut. Working like ligaments and muscles, with no\ngears anywhere, the tree roots worked together to heave several dozen\nmirrors across the satrapy into position.\nHad this been the work of some empire Dazen had never heard of? Was\nthis the magic of the pygmy peoples?"

Was\nthis the magic of the pygmy peoples?\nBut there was no time to study the marvel, or even to wonder at it.\nDazen felt his body gasping, his own strength stretching him too far.\nBack to Ilyta, where some people had scattered, but others had come\nbearing their muskets and long knives. Bandits, Dazen hoped. But maybe\njust the sons of bandits, only trying to defend their homes from something\nthat filled others with dread.\nBrave men, regardless.\nDazen shook the earth once more. One last wordless warning to people\nwho could die in a war they didn’t even know about.\nSome fled, but others stood their ground, shaking their spears as if some\nmonster stomped between their homes. You’ve built your home on the\nmonstrous, you fools. As did we. The cowards who ran would live, while\nthe brave died.\nDazen could wait no longer.\nHouses shattered and tore apart, the earth rent, a spire shot into the sky,\nand then the superviolet mirror slashed through the village. The brave fell\nand the rubble of their own homes crushed and buried them.\nHe flashed back to his own body, staggering.\nNo, not yet. He’d taken seven colors, but there were nine. He sank deep\ninto the mirror to feel for those last two, but found only a single trace: a\nbane atop Hellmount, far, far to the west, pulsing like the sun, its slopes\nlittered with the burnt bones of the dead who’d tried to approach, to claim it\nfor themselves. But there was no mirror nor lightwell for that great chi\nbane, nor anywhere else. Nor for paryl. Even the ingenuity of the drafters of\nold had never subdued those colors.\nNo wonder the Chromeria had always feared those colors. Light cannot\nbe chained indeed. Not all of it anyway. The mystery always escapes us.\nFinished, he came back to his body again.\nHe felt disconcertingly wonderful, but he knew it was a false strength\nnow. He’d lifted weights with the strength of a thousand men, but his\nmuscles were going to give out on him without warning at any moment.\nThe whole thing must have taken only a few minutes, because even as\nhe gasped on the sweet night air, he could feel the distant Great Mirrors still\nfinishing turning, still settling their beams onto the Great Mirror behind\nhim.\nAnd then, as more strength came into his hands than perhaps had ever\nbeen held by one person, he realized that he was deeply and truly fucked.\nThe Mirror of Waking began to spin. Suspended on nothing at all that he\ncould see, it began to turn into a blur, on several invisible axes. The air\nfilled with its sound, and wind whipped over him.\nDazen felt the lightwells under each of the seven Great Mirrors in their\nfar-spread satrapies slowly uncorking themselves like shaken bottles of\nbubbly wine. They would blast perfect, pure light in their respective spectra,\npulsing in time with each rotation of the Great Mirror behind Dazen. Thus,\nbasically simultaneously, Dazen could direct light from every arc of the\nSeven Satrapies to any point and to as many points as he wished."

Drafting white\nwas like sprinting downhill—deceptively effortless, so long as he kept his\nfeet under him. Giving him this much power was like giving that downhill\nsprinter a hard shove in the back.\nHe’d done what no other drafter could have done. No other drafter in the\nworld could’ve handled that much magic. No other drafter could’ve reached\nso far. Other than Kip, no one could’ve lifted so much as a single one of\nthose towers alone.\nHe’d raised five.\nBut now? Even if he could handle the light, somehow feeling the colors\nneeded despite his color-blindness, even if he could survive more than\nanother few seconds of so much power, the Chromeria was far beyond the\nhorizon. The mirrors themselves could settle into their old grooves to find\none another, but it would be impossibly fine work to strike at a single foe on\nthe island or to take the mirror array and use it himself.\nDazen couldn’t strike down wights from here. He’d broken the bane’s\ncontrol of magic, but he couldn’t fight those floating islands from here,\ncouldn’t unwind their magic and drown the wights in their thousands. Not\nfrom here.\nHe couldn’t save the Chromeria.\nHe was a runner collapsing on the last lap, begging that someone carry\nhim to the finish line.\nWithout warning, the colors bubbled forth from their long\nimprisonment. Dazen didn’t know what else to do but throw them toward\nthe Chromeria. First, they effervesced across the sky, but then he wrestled\nthem back to a tight beam. One last act of white will.\nIn the now tightening spray of colors, he felt a vortex reaching out,\ngiving him a point to aim for. It was an answering Will, some desperate or\nbrilliant drafter who intuited that now, in the middle of the night, after the\nwash of black luxin had freed the skies, she or he should mount the Prism’s\nmirror array.\nMaybe there was some hope after all—\nDazen felt the colors sucked in, suddenly. One two threefourfi—all of\nthem!\nA full-spectrum polychrome.\nA man—yes, it felt like a man—of chthonic strength and titanic will.\nAcross the immensity of the space between them, their wills meshed like\nthe gears that had raised the Great Mirrors, and without words they knew\neach other.\nFather.\nDazen?\nDazen felt a shock of revulsion ripple through his entire body. The gears\nground to a halt.\nHis father—and since when was Andross a full-spectrum polychrome?\n—his father wanted him to hand over control of the mirror array.\nOn the one hand, it was the obvious solution. Andross was there. No one\nelse was. Who else could handle the magic? Who else had the will and\nconcentration and pure fortitude?\nBut at the same time, it was a horror beyond countenancing.\nIf he gave his father this power, Andross Guile would be seen rescuing"

That must have been so hard for him!’\n‘Yes, yes, but he was wiser than the rest of us. He knew what was\nnecessary to save the world. He did that for us. He was a man of vision. A\ngreat man, willing to do what was necessary for all the rest of us. A hero.’\nEverything in Dazen shouted No!\nAnyone but him!\nTears of rage poured. Dazen felt a cooling reassurance from the old\nmonster, and a repeated demand that Dazen give him control of the array.\nNow. Like that was more important than anything.\nYou murderer! You killed Sevastian! You killed all that was good. We had\neverything and you killed it all. Don’t you dare say it was for the world. It\nwas for you, your pride! You always had to be the best. You always had to\nbe right. You always had to prove yourself smarter than anyone else!\nAlways, always!\nBut the distance was vast, and they couldn’t hear each other’s words.\nOrholam, please, no!

His fists knotted white.\nHe felt a presence, and he opened his eyes.\nOrholam stood in front of him.\nHe knew.\nAs they locked gazes, Orholam’s left eye deepened and morphed, and\nDazen saw standing there a throng, silent in their penitents’ garb, but\nadorned in their Sun Day finest cosmetics and jewels. More than two\nthousand women and men, each with Dazen’s knife wound over their\nhearts. His victims from all the Freeings. His peaceful accusers.\nAround them stood a vast multitude: the fathers who’d never dreamed\ntheir sons would die before them; the husbands so devastated at losing their\nwives they couldn’t even care for their children; those children, who’d lost\ntheir mothers; the orphans who’d had only one parent to begin with; the\nbereaved spouses hastily and unhappily remarried; the families who held\ntogether but always kept an empty seat at every dinner, every feast, and\ntried to tell themselves that it was all for the best, that this was Orholam’s\nwill, though they could never fully believe it. Because it wasn’t.\nThey were his victims all. Dazen’s murders had rippled out into the\nworld in a swamping wave greater than he’d even imagined. Not one corner\nwas untouched.\nHe wept.\nHe couldn’t look anymore, didn’t dare to keep on seeing the truth of\nwhat he’d done—but in tearing his gaze away, he was arrested by another\nimage, this one in Orholam’s right eye.

Did I make you proud?’ Sevastian asked.\nHe died before the weeping Andross could find the will to speak.\nThen, a mercy: Orholam’s eyes were merely eyes once more. But there\nwas only truth reflected in both His eyes, and none of it was soft.\nOrholam said, “I’ve forgiven your many, many murders. Will you\nforgive him one?”\nChapter 138\nThough Gill was one of perhaps half a dozen people who understood what\nhe was seeing, he felt no less awestruck than everyone else he saw turning\nto the north, their eyes widening, jaws slack.\nIn the distance, rising into view from the Great Market, though the\nmarket itself was hidden by Ebon’s Hill, was a creature from legend.\nOutlined in fire, a titan emerged as from the earth itself, stretching skyward.\nIt seemed to pluck a barrel from the ether, took it in its fist, and then hurled\nthe thing, flaming, into the ground somewhere in the Blood Robes’ ranks.\nThe flash of light was followed a moment later by the sound of the\nexplosion.\nWhen Corvan Danavis had told them what he planned, he’d said,\n‘Should be a last stand to remember.’\nAnd no one watching seemed to notice that the flash also showed the red\ntitan had no body. The outline of fire was all it had—all it was—an outline\nof burning red luxin stretching high into the darkness of the night, grabbing\nbarrels shot or lofted into the air. The titan moved with astonishing fluidity,\nand it really did throw the barrels of black powder, but with the benefit of\nforewarning and distance, Gill could see it for what it was—amazing\ndrafting.\nTo everyone else, it was as if a great djinn had risen from the earth to\nintervene in the battle.\nBut then, just as they emerged into the great avenue running from the\nChromeria to the Great Market, getting their clearest view yet, Gill heard\nthe sound of a pistol shot.\nHis and Big Leo’s were two of the only faces that turned toward the\nsound. Near the base of Orholam’s Glare, a body fell dead, practically\nheadless.\nHigh Lady Karris’s luxiat slave, Quentin, held two smoking pistols over\nthe body, a surprising, powerful gravitas in the usually tremulous young\nman’s face.\nThe Lightguards nearby were flinching back from the pistol shot, some\ncowering, others lifting their weapons instinctively, as if to block.\nThey were holding Tisis Guile as if she were their prisoner.\nNow the Lightguards, shaken, were recovering. Some were pulling their\nown muskets toward Quentin, who’d dropped the pistols and had thrown\nhis hands up in surrender.\nSomeone was going to shoot him.\n“Stop!” Karris shouted beside Gill, and she ran toward the Lightguards.\nGill ran beside her with Big Leo only one step behind, and the people\ncrowding the square melted back for her and Gill and the rest of the\nBlackguards cutting through."

They dropped Lady Tisis. Some\ndropped their muskets. Half a dozen, including—Gill saw through the gaps\nin the crowds—that crippled bastard Aram, ran back toward the Chromeria,\nmoving with surprising speed despite his crutch.\nAnd then they were there. Gill had expected to find some poor bastard\ndead, but instead he found two.\nThe man Quentin had shot was bleeding still, blood somehow still\npouring from his shattered braincase onto the paving stones, but slowing,\nslowing, even as they arrived. Lady Tisis had been punched several times at\nleast, and looked in terrible condition emotionally—but not seriously\nwounded. Gill didn’t concern himself with her further for now.\nNo one else appeared armed.\nThough many looked afraid of the Blackguards, of Karris, of glowering\nBig Leo with his great chain, no one in the crowd appeared threatening, or\nguilty, or shifty.\nA flash from behind him made Gill whip his head around. A last flash of\nred light from the Great Market, the following sound of a distant explosion,\nand now the titan was gone.\nHigh General Danavis had said he had a better than even chance of\ndying if he tried whatever he was planning—and almost no chance of not\nbreaking the halo, which was really the same thing. Gill could only hope\nthat he’d accomplished what he hoped, that he’d made those pagan bastards\npay.\nPart of Gill wanted to urge Karris to take them all to the general, to help\nthem in whatever desperate straits they were in. But that wasn’t his role. He\nwas a trainer of the Blackguard, not a general.\nAs he turned back to things nearer at hand, Gill realized that the young\nman whose wreck of a head was still pumping blood on the ground could\nonly be Zymun Guile.\nHe sought his ward’s reaction, but the White’s face was a cipher. She\nwas already looking to Tisis, who was moving, pushing people out of her\nway.\n“Zymun was about to hang Tisis,” Quentin told Karris. “I was too late\nfor… High Lady, I’m so sorry.”\nTisis reached where she was going, kneeling, pulling a body into her lap,\nand the crowd melted back to let Karris see.\nTo let Karris see Kip.\nDead.\nBeside Gill, Big Leo dropped to his knees, dropped his big chain with a\nclatter to the stones.\nBut Gill didn’t even look at him. Big Leo wasn’t his ward; Karris was.\nAnd if he lived a hundred years, Gill would never forget the expression on\nher face now.\nIt wasn’t denial, for in her face there wasn’t rejection, but instead the\nnote of confirmation of something suspected. He saw in her face her last\nhope for happiness die. It was as if she’d thought, At least I’ll have one\ngood thing, and though it was less than I wanted, I shall make myself be\ncontent with this.\nAnd now she’d had that last good thing snatched away and smashed\nbefore her eyes."

He wasn’t the\none who could be that for her—\nSuddenly, she keened, and her scream was so incoherent that everyone\nwho heard it understood perfectly.\nEyes turned away, faces filled with shame around the square.\n“NO!”\nShe seemed to almost attack Tisis as she pulled Kip’s body into her own\narms. She froze, trembling, muttering her denials under her breath as she\nstabbed fingers into his neck to feel for the pounding of life there.\nFinding none, she stood, Kip’s body sliding limp, gracelessly, out of her\nlap.

I know\nyou!”\nSuddenly her ire turned on a man in the crowd. An artisan by his dress.\nHe looked familiar, but it took Gill a moment to place him. That was it: the\nkopi seller from her favorite little stand. Parian by his look, but Ilytian by\nhis accent. Gill couldn’t remember his name or any other connection,\nthough.\nKarris quieted as the little man came forward uncertainly.

He came forward, and he knelt beside\nher. “I’m afraid,” he said, “that you have been very much misled.”\nShe expelled a breath, so hopelessly that she clearly wished it were her\nlast.\n“Shh, shh,” he said, brushing back her hair behind her ear as if soothing\na child. “Very much misled about the extent of your failures, and even more\nso about your own worth, Karris Agapêtê. Be still, child. Be still. For about\nthis at least you are right: your son isn’t dead, only sleeping.”\nKarris took a sharp breath, and Gill’s hand convulsed on his spear. What\nnew insult was this? Was the old man mocking her?\nBut Karris lifted her head, and the hope in her voice as she spoke to the\nold man hurt Gill most of all. “Then you’ll wake him?” she asked.\n“Of course,” he said, slinging his pack around and pulling out his little\ncups, and filling them with his dark, steaming brew. “What do you think\nkopi is for?”\nHis eyes twinkled as with many lights. And as he gently poured the\ndrink into Kip’s mouth, suddenly the night lit with incandescence above\nthem all.\nEvery eye turned to the Prism’s Tower as a great white light from the\neast hit it, unimaginably pure and bright.\nThe whole tower lit with color, and then, too, did all the other towers of\nthe Chromeria in turn as every one of the Thousand Stars flared to life\nthroughout Big Jasper—radiating first with white light, then with every\ncolor under the sun.\nThen, under the control of some masterful hand on the mirror array, the\nnight filled with light. Directed by some great intelligence that could hold a\nhundred details at once, the Thousand Stars blossomed and turned—here\nshooting red source, here focused tight and hot enough to burn some unseen\nenemy, here giving blue or green, here flooding the enemy with light they\ncouldn’t use, and in fifty other places seeking out friendly drafters to give\nthem exactly what light they needed."

Cheers broke out throughout the square and\nthroughout Big and Little Jasper.\nBut Gill, after checking for any immediate threat from the outpouring of\nmagic and seeing none, saw little more of it. He saw only his mistress’s\nface, and she saw only Kip—and her son suddenly took a deep breath, and\nsat up, eyes opening.\nOnly as Kip breathed out, smiling as if waking from a pleasant dream,\ndid Gill realize that the old kopi seller had disappeared.\nChapter 139\n“This here is the point where you make a decision,” Orholam said.\n“You’ve got to be joking,” Dazen said. “I thought that’s what I just did.”\nHe was an old cloak drenched in the rain and now wrung out, and there was\nnothing he wanted so much as to hang up in the air to dry a bit. He’d just\ngiven father everything the old cancer had wanted for more than forty years.\nWorst, he’d given father vindication. It made Dazen’s heart hurt. Could he\nnot just curl up in a corner for the next decade or two?\nOrholam said, “You came all this way for one reason. Did you forget it\nalready?”\nTo kill You? Oh, not that. “To save Karris?” Dazen asked.\n“You still want to?”\n“What are you talking about? She’s on the other side of the world. Me\ndrafting anything is impossible at this point. Like, I thought it was\nimpossible before, but now? It’s really, really not happening.”\n“A man is more than his magic, Promachos.”\nWow, that sounded like a deep lesson, but c’mon…“What can I do? You\ngot another ship and crew tucked away inside the reef somewhere I didn’t\nnotice? What’s the rush now? It’ll take me weeks or even months to get\nback. Everything will be over by then. There’s no way I can get back in\ntime to help.”\n“Time. Psh,” Orholam said.\n“Easy for You to say.”\n“What about your glider? What’d you call it, ‘the condor’?”\n“That would be handy. You know, if I hadn’t destroyed it in Tyrea,\nhundreds of leagues from here. You gonna make me a new one?”\n“Right now I prefer making things new to making new things.”\n“You are really hard to understand sometimes,” Dazen said. “It’s lost.\nBroken. I destroyed it so no one could learn its secrets. And I couldn’t fix it\nanyway, now.”\n“Like I said, fixing is My specialty,” Orholam said. “You want to fly\nwith Me?”\nDazen said nothing for a moment. “You’re serious.”\n“I seem to recall you rather enjoy it.”\n“Flying? What?!” Dazen’s exasperation was as unbounded as the night\nsky.\n“That vexation you’re feeling?” Orholam said. “Been feeling that for\nyou. For years.”\nThis did not make Dazen feel less vexed."

It is pretty dark\nout, and some people say Orholam can’t see at night.”\nDazen glowered.\nIt turned out that the reckless, winsome Guile grin had nothing on\nGod’s.\n“So what is this?” Dazen demanded. “You’ve actually got a condor up\nyour sleeve? No, You’d have to do me one better, wouldn’t you? An eagle\nor something?”\n“A machina, up My sleeve? That’d be cheating. Now, hurry. It’s a long\nfall if you miss the timing.”\n“Timing? What timing?”\n“For the jump! You do remember where the gap is on the level below\nthis, right? Go through that gap—or it’ll be a short fall.”\nDazen said, “You want me to jump? Off this tower? In the dark?”\n“Admit it, your last leap of faith was terrible,” Orholam said.\n“Huh?”\n“I’m giving you a do-over. A second chance,” Orholam said. He bent his\nknees, readying himself to run. “It’s what I do. Any moment now. Three…\nTwo… Oh, don’t forget the blade!”\n“Right!” Dazen turned back. The gun-sword was still sticking out of the\nnow-white tower.\nHe yanked it free. Behind his back, he heard Orholam yell, “Now!”\nHe turned.\nOrholam was gone.\nOh no. No, no, no!\nFear grabbed at his legs to hold him in place. It was probably already too\nlate. If the timing was so tight, then he’d surely already—\nDazen kicked Fear in the face.\nAs he sprinted toward the edge, he shouted, “I can’t believe You’re\nmaking me do this!”\nAnd he leapt.\nChapter 140\n“Can you fight?” Karris asked. Baffled, the crowd was torn between\ngasping at the dazzling spectacle of lights above them or at the young man\nsilently healing at their feet. Healthy skin was surfacing from beneath his\nburns, and where he’d been burned bald, hair was growing in speedily—but\nas if it were natural, as if this were something that happened every day.\nBut none of them mattered.\n“Yes,” Kip said tentatively, then, gaining strength, “Yes! Let’s go kick\nsome ass!”\nBig Leo hauled Kip to his feet as easily as Karris might lift a quill.\nKip immediately collapsed again.\n“Well, that’s awkward,” Kip said, looking at his limbs like they were\npurposely embarrassing him.\n“Son—can I call you son?—I’m so glad you’re alive,” Karris said, “but\nother people are dying. My people. Right now. If we live, we’ll—”\n“We’ll do all sorts of things,” Kip said. “Got it. But you need to go. So\ngo.”\n“You showed me how to win,” Karris said, and she felt like the Iron\nWhite again as she said it. “We have to kill the White King. And that’s on"

Who knows how long this will last,” she said, pointing\nto the spectacle of many lights dancing above them. “Right now is the only\ntime we’re going to have the advantage. We win now or we lose. Kip, I love\nyou. Can I take Big Leo and the Mighty?”\nShe knew she sounded scattered, but there were too many things to do\nall at once.\n“Yes,” Kip said at the same time Big Leo said, “Uh-uh. I’m not leaving\nyou again.”\n“Leonidas,” Kip said.\n“Don’t call me that.”\n“Big Leo, you can’t think I’m in danger now,” Kip said. “Orholam\nHimself saved me. I’m gonna be fine. You think He did all that to let me get\nkilled two minutes later?”\n“I’ll stay,” Tisis said.\n“Me, too,” one of the nunks of the Mighty said.\n“See?” Karris said.\n“Besides, you didn’t help at all with the blue bane,” Karris said. “Think\nof this as a second chance.”\n“Leo didn’t help with the blue?” Kip asked. “I thought—Holy shit, man,\nthe rest of ’em are never gonna let you live that down.”\n“Fine. I see how it is,” Big Leo said. He looked at the nunk volunteer.\n“But not you. Anyone who volunteers might be Order. I’m not sure they’re\nall dead.” He pointed to two of the other nunks at random. “You and you,\nbut keep ten paces out.”\n“Yes, Commander,” they said. The original volunteer looked offended,\nbut kept his mouth shut.\nBig Leo loosed his big copper chain. “Wight King’s flotilla’s that way,\nright?”\n“Straight down the main street,” Gill said. “But we’ll have to make it\nthrough the Great Market and maybe even past the orange—”\nBut Big Leo wasn’t paying attention. He swung his great thick chain\nover his head, and suddenly, it took fire, whooshing with each great circle.\n“Let’s go kill some pagans! For the Iron White. For the Lightbringer!”\nAnd then as they roared in return, he ran, as if he didn’t care if he had to\ndo it all himself, as if he’d simply take all the glory for himself, and if they\nmissed out, so much the worse for them.\nIn a moment, everyone followed—not only the Mighty, not only Karris’s\nremaining Blackguards, but practically every able-bodied civilian in the\nsquare, too.\nKarris looked at Kip, shrugged, and then hopped off the platform. Gill\nwas holding a horse for her.\n“Go on,” Kip said. “That’s your battle cry. That’s your advantage.

He was looking up at Andross Guile, limned in\nlight at the top of the Prism’s Tower.\nChapter 141\nGavin had once said, ‘The only thing more dangerous than winning a battle\nis losing one.’\nNow Karris knew what he meant.\nNot once, but twice as she and her people fought across Big Jasper,\nKarris saw jubilant Chromeria forces rush around corners and blunder into\neach other—and go blasting away at one another with muskets and magic\nbefore they realized they were killing their allies.\nShe’d only been saved from the same by the great beam of white light\nthat followed her everywhere she went—Andross tagging her somehow,\nwhich had not only saved her from friendly fire but also drew enemies.\nNot that she should really complain.\nNor was there was any way to do so, if she’d wanted to.\nBut it did make what she’d hoped would be a simple jog across Big\nJasper into a running battle that took the entire night.\nHer forces had torn into the weakened northern flank of the White\nKing’s drafters encircling the Great Fountain, and demolished them. A\nyoung general named Lorenço was commanding in Corvan Danavis’s stead.\nHe was relieved to see them, and delighted to give over command.\nBut Karris didn’t want to command, and it took valuable time to get the\nstrike force she wanted out of him. She also reclaimed her own Blackguards\nthat she’d sent on before her to help High General Danavis. Lorenço\nbelieved the grievously injured high general was dying, and had put him in\nthe care of physickers nearby. Karris would have liked to thank the man or\nat least say goodbye, but there was no time.\nOnce she had her force, she didn’t go out of her way to save others or\neven to attack shaken Blood Robes—not much, anyway. And yet, for every\ncompany they encountered that simply melted at the sight of them, others\nfought tooth and nail. Clearly, many had no idea of what had happened out\nof their own sight, and most of the Blood Robes thought they were still\nwinning and that the Jaspers would soon be theirs.\nNor was fighting in the middle of beams of light an unqualified\nadvantage—for some of the Blood Robes were canny enough to use the\ndarkness to spring traps, especially with will-cast animals: Karris’s people\nwere attacked by wolves, a tiger, a giant javelina, and even a bear once.\nBut everywhere they went, they shouted, “The Lightbringer has come!”\nand with their ever-burning coruscation of every color and the heavens\nalight with untimely scintillance, the Blood Robes believed them and were\nsore afraid.\nThe idea spread through their battlefields like a slow, stubborn fire.\nKarris’s people forced the Blood Robes in their sector all the way back\nto the wall they’d climbed on their way in and smashed them against it, men\nand women suddenly panicking that they would be left inside the city they\nhad worked so hard to enter.\nAs she crossed the wall itself, from that higher perch, she could see her\nbrother’s own dragon-ship out beyond the orange bane—but first her eye"

He ran to one yawning edge of a\nsudden abyss, much too far, and bounced, ludicrously high and far to the\nother side.\nLanding, he split a yellow wight nearly in half with a spearlike thing—a\ntygre striper?—who in the world knew to how fight with one of those these\ndays?\nBut it could be nothing else. It bent and straightened—now plastic, now\nrigid—as the warrior cut through half a dozen yellows in turn, all fleeing\nhim or fleeing to get off the crumbling yellow bane. The young man\nsprinted with great long strides, impossibly long and fast, and Karris\nrealized his very legs must be fitted with the same kind of sea demon bone\nthat made the tygre striper directly susceptible to the Will.\n“Shit, I don’t see Einin,” Big Leo muttered. Then he shouted, “Ben-\nhadad! Ben!”\nAnd then Big Leo was gone, taking the Mighty with him to rescue his\ncomrade, who, truth be told, didn’t look like he needed rescuing.\nIn minutes, though, they all re-formed on the orange bane.\nIt was the last place Karris wanted to be. You couldn’t trust your very\neyes here. The orange bane was virtually paved with uncured lumber and\nflat stones—anything the Blood Robes had been able to find to make\nthemselves pathways on the oleaginous surface. To step off the paths and\nstreets was to risk sinking to the waist in orange goo.\nKarris immediately feared traps, but nothing happened as they charged\nacross the surface. There were few oranges, and they’d not been expecting a\ncounterattack, so perhaps for once, Karris and the Chromeria’s defenders\nwould get lucky.\nAnd then the surface of the bane shifted as if in an earthquake, and\nbehind them an orange hill rose and rose.\nThey ran, faster, and faster. Ben-hadad blitzed on ahead of them all, with\nhis great inhuman loping strides, looking for traps or ambushes or even safe\nhavens.\nBut then they were plunged into darkness as the hill rose so high that the\nmirrored light from the Thousand Stars could no longer reach them.\nAnd then the bane settled behind them—and split open ahead, yielding\nto the wood decks of the White King’s own dragon-ship flotilla of a dozen\ngalleys lashed together.\nIts eerie white wooden skin bristled with ivory, metal, and luxin spikes,\nand its mouth gushed fire from spouts out its draconic mouth.\nKarris and her people were out of range of that fire, but she saw\nhundreds of his warriors leaping out onto the orange bane.\nShe recognized their standards: these were Koios’s personal guard,\nmaddened, screaming, carrying their own colors forward into the night.\nKarris had fewer than three hundred elite warriors with her, many of"

Dawn was achingly close, but too far off to make a difference\n—and suddenly, alone, her three hundred were facing thousands of the\nWhite King’s best and freshest troops.\nFor the moment, the Chromeria was winning this battle. Hell, they might\nwin the battle outright, regardless of what happened in the next few minutes\nto Karris.\nBut that didn’t make a whole lot of difference right here, did it?\nAs Gavin had said, ‘Dead winners and dead losers have only one thing\nin common. Unfortunately, it’s the most important thing.’\nChapter 142\nThe great, winged machina must have flown directly at the tower, nosed up\nhard to vertical at the last moment to avoid a collision, and stalled just in\ntime to catch Orholam gently.\nIn jumping late, Dazen was going to get nothing gentle. He plunged\nafter the falling condor, seeing Orholam nonchalantly pulling Himself into a\nfinely carved wooden seat and tying a rope around His waist, even as the\nmachina fell sideways, slowly spinning.\nDazen fell only slightly faster, head angled down like a boy diving into\nthe water, sword flopping about hazardously in the air.\nHe realized that the principles of flight, which he’d only been starting to\nmaster when he’d made the first condor, also applied to his body. There was\nprobably something smart and dextrous he should be doing right now.\nOrholam have mercy, it was as if they were two horses racing each\nother, and he’d taken the outside track to doom. He started to pass the\ncondor, too far away to grab on to the tail or the seats, coming equal to its\nnose before the condor, now headed straight down, began falling as fast as\nDazen was.\nBut then the condor swooped, raising its nose and swerving into him. He\nbounced off its nose, the machina smacking his head and knocking the wind\nfrom his lungs, and the sword almost out of his grasp. He slid down its\nback. Or, more appropriately, up its back, as it was inverted, still falling. As\nDazen slid, he grabbed for Orholam’s chair, or his legs—anything. But his\nthree-fingered left-hand grip failed him again. He slid up to the tail, and\nthere clung with his hands and knees gripping the winged machine like a\nbad rider clamped helplessly to the back of a spooked horse, feet braced\nagainst some small protrusions of the tail that hadn’t been there in his\nversion of the machina.\nThe wind tore at him as if he were as welcome as a tick, but he held on.\nHe wasn’t going to die. Not yet.\n“Hey!” a baritone voice shouted at him. “Can you move your feet,\nplease?”\n“I’m not back here for fun!” he shouted back.\n“Get your feet off the elevator flaps or we’re gonna hit the trees.”\nDazen looked up, not at the speaker, but at the horizon.

The condor was\nleveling out slowly, but it needed to climb rapidly, or it was going to smash\ninto the hills ringing the plain around the mountain tower’s base.\nHe scooted forward and pulled his feet off the nubs where he’d braced\nthem and instantly felt gears shift and the tail flex. He tucked his head tight\nagainst the condor’s back as it shot up into the air.\nHe didn’t move again until it leveled out. Then he scooted slowly,\nslowly forward, until he reached the windbreak on the condor’s back. He\ntook the only other chair. Chairs? That was a nice innovation.\nNo one had even offered to help him.\n“Thanks for the help!” he said. “No, I kept the sword, too. No problem.”\nOrholam and the captain of the air machine glanced at him as if he’d\nonly just boarded.\n“Oh, did you hit your head?” the captain asked. “Sorry about that.”\nHe didn’t sound sorry at all. “Not your fault,” Dazen said, though\nOrholam could have given him warning.\n“I know,” the captain said. “I meant I’m sorry you hurt yourself. I was\nbeing polite.”\nReal polite.\nDazen returned the favor by staring at the man. The man had apparently\nalso hit his head recently, as there was an ugly lump and abrasions across\nhis forehead. But that wasn’t the main thing that made Dazen stare. This\nman was ethnically unlike anyone Dazen had ever seen: fine, straight black\nhair, broad cheekbones, and skin folded across his upper eyelids.\nNo, scratch that. This man was unlike any Dazen had ever seen in real\nlife, but not in art. There’d been a statue of a man like this at the beginning\nof the pilgrimage. Or… no. Not a man like this. This man.\nNot this man, this immortal.\n“Oh, hey, I’ve seen you before,” Dazen said. “It’s an enormous pleasure\nto get to meet you in person! I saw your statue. You must be really special!”\nBeing overly friendly was sometimes the best way to irritate the surly.\nThe immortal grunted.\n“This your island?” Dazen asked, relentlessly chipper.\nThe immortal grunted again. Maybe a no.\n“Dazen Guile. Nice ta meetcha!”\nThe immortal glowered at him. “I know who you are.”\n“You’re an immortal, huh? How’s that work? What do you do?”\nThe immortal looked over to Orholam. “My lord? Permission to\nabandon ship?”\n“Denied,” Orholam said happily.\n“This is about my failure with V, isn’t it?”\nVee? Dazen felt like a child among adults talking over his head.\n“Not a failure, not yet,” Orholam said. “And this is no punishment.”\n“Please don’t say it’s a reward”—the immortal cleared his throat and\nadded quickly—“my most gracious lord. I beg you.”\nOrholam said nothing.\n“So it is a reward,” the immortal grumped. “And since you said ‘Not\nyet,’ you’re sending me back to her.”\n“If it’s possible,” Orholam said."

We’re going into a battle that gives the immortals pause?\n“There’s victuals and a wineskin in the pack, and blankets,” the\nimmortal told Dazen, nudging it with his foot, but not moving from the\nwheel. “Eat. Sleep.”\nAfter devouring the best food of his life, Dazen did.\nHe woke to a hand on his shoulder.\n“You’ll want to see this,” Orholam said.\nThe sun was beginning to lighten the sky. Dazen felt a hundred times\nbetter.\nOrholam pointed over the edge of the condor.\nThey had to be hundreds of paces in the air. Dazen felt a brief moment\nof vertigo, then saw them—streaks in the water. “Are those… sea demons?”\nhe asked. “What are they doing here? I thought there were only eight left.”\n“Seven of the eight accepted Orholam’s mercy last week,” the truculent\nimmortal said, though Dazen hadn’t been asking him.\n“Last week?” Dazen asked. “But I only asked the boon for them\nyesterday. That was yesterday, right?”\n“It was,” Orholam said with a twinkle in his eye. “But I knew you’d\nask.”\n“But what if I hadn’t?” Dazen asked.\n“That’s Karris Atiriel at their head. Unable to reverse Lucidonius’s soul-\ncasting and bring him back home, after her years as Prism, in order to join\nher husband, she became a sea demon herself.”\n“I thought she established the Blackguard,” Dazen said. “Wasn’t half\ntheir purpose—”\n“Her intention was that no one would ever again do what Lucidonius\nhad done, even as she planned how to copy him herself. Instead, her success\nproved to others that drafters less gifted than Lucidonius might also\nsucceed. Now, after all these centuries, she’s ready. She’s finally chosen to\nabandon her husband to the self-destruction that he loves more than he\nloves her or anything.”\nDazen absorbed that for a few moments, then asked, “But what are they\ndoing here? This doesn’t look like release. They’re still sea demons.”\n“They serve, Dazen. Broken as they are. In gratitude to you, they asked\nthat before they die, they might use what they’ve become for the good of\nthe people they loved, and for you.”\nDazen was about to find that very touching, when he saw something\natop the sea demon. A platform? “What’s that on her head?” He squinted\nagainst the distance, but he lost it.\nOrholam was grinning. “That? You’re gonna love it. Do you want to\nknow the last part of your penance, Promachos?”\nThere’s more? No, I do not want to know about any more penance!\n“Yes, please?” he said."

Just like this next part could look a lot like a leap of faith, but it\nreally isn’t.”\n“What are you talking about? A leap? We are going to land together,\nright? I can suggest some really—”\n“Not together, and we’re not landing. This is your part. I’m not getting\nout of the machina,” Orholam said. “Now, remember, the sea giants despise\nthe bane, but they’re susceptible to their influence. In particular, Karris\nAtiriel is highly sensitive to the orange bane, even still. Do your best to\ndestroy it before she arrives, would you?”\n“Sure, but I still don’t—”\n“Good. Kip will really appreciate it. Put this on. Oh, and one last thing,”\nOrholam said. He handed Dazen a canopy-pack and the gun-sword.\n“What?” Wrestling the pack on, strapping it tight with Orholam’s help,\nDazen saw a fleet of ships and the bane like floating islands dotting the\nwaves in the first gray light of the morning. The condor was closing fast. He\nfelt disoriented. Why had all this waited until now?\nOrholam embraced him, and at first, Dazen was too stunned to even\nreturn it. For all that Orholam looked like a reedy old man, His hug redoled\nof an unstinting strength that was unmistakably maternal: a mother\ngathering her hurt child into her arms, fierce in defense, gentle in\nencouragement.\n“Never forget,” Orholam said softly. “I see you. I hold you in My eyes.”\nThen He threw Dazen off the side of the condor.\nChapter 143\n“Brother! I don’t want to kill you. But I will,” Karris shouted.\nHer people were doing better against vastly superior numbers than they\nhad any right to be doing. It helped that everyone on both sides had\nexhausted both luxin and gunpowder, which left her with her Blackguards\n—not to mention the Mighty, who’d now been joined by all two dozen\nprospective members, and Ferkudi, and Winsen (who’d apparently\ndestroyed the green bane by himself).\nSomehow they’d followed Karris, despite everything.\nOr not Karris, she knew. Ferkudi and Winsen had come to fight for Big\nLeo and Ben-hadad. They fought for one another, like brothers do.\nBut not her brother.\nKoios had lost patience and joined the fray himself.\nHe cut a swath through all of them, his own men first, heedless,\nmurderous, then the Blackguards as well, battering them with jets of luxin,\nimpaling men with great spikes, even blasting Gill Greyling far off to one\nside.\nComing finally in front of her, he threw one hand up, and a cage of blue\nluxin shot up around her from the ground at her feet.

She would\nhave expected orange, here on the orange bane, but Koios had always been\nmost adept with blue.\nKarris snapped off one of the bars imprisoning her, and then another.\nBut there was a lethal drop on every side. There was nowhere to go.\n“Give up now,” he said. He pulsed with every color, rivulets of light\ncascading from his head and down his body, his luxin armor now more like\na carapace than a suit. “Your people die. But you don’t have to join them.”\n“You’re losing,” she said.\n“Am I?” he said, and she hated that she could still hear echoes of his old\nvoice in this monstrosity. He shook his head. “I have a dozen seed crystals\nin reserve. I can grow new bane in a day, and the Ilytian pirate kings’\nreinforcements will arrive tomorrow. I overextended today in my eagerness.\nBut nothing you’ve done has accomplished anything. Not a thing. You’ve\ndelayed me by one day. Tell me, do you think your people can fight again\ntomorrow as they did today?”\n“You’re lying,” she said, heart sinking. “It’s all lies.”\n“Let’s see about that,” he said. He pulled out a brilliant green jewel,\nholding it with a thumb and forefinger.\nHe waved his other hand, and the blue bars of Karris’s cage disappeared.\nKarris darted forward, but she felt the green luxin inside her body\nsuddenly stiffen.\nShe skidded on her knees. Against her will, her hand opened, and the\nscorpion tumbled out of it.\n“Worship me,” he said. “The very immortals weary of your Chromeria’s\ntyranny. They fight for me! I am a god of gods!”\n“You’re a slave and you don’t even see it,” Karris said.\nHe sighed. “They’ve brainwashed you. It’s so very sad. I loved you,\nsister. I loved you so much. I love you still, but not like this, sister. Not like\nthis.” As he rolled the green jewel between his fingers in the first of dawn’s\nlight, its color flashed like a green wink. Her hands came up, palms spread\nas in supplication. He smiled at her, but it was an ugly smile, and in his\nother hand, a blade sprouted, longer and longer.\n“Say the word, sister, and live. Or… I’ll just to have to remember you as\nyou were, before they corrupted you.”\n* * *\nDazen was drifting downward beneath his canopy, trying to slow the\nthudding of his heart and choke down the tightness in his throat.

It’s gotta be a perfect throw, right?\nHowever, it quickly became apparent that he wasn’t going to land on\nBig Jasper at all.

He was headed for the darkness of the ocean.\nSurely there’s going to be a crosswind coming soon?\nAny time now.\nThere was no crosswind.\nBut what he did see as he fell was a bane—orange? maybe red—and a\nflotilla of ships all lashed together, and then a battle of some sort. A circle of\nBlackguards and some others were holding off many, many more enemies.\nAll right, all right, maybe this is the right place after all. Good throw, old\nman.\nHe pulled out the Blinding Sword and pulled open the breech. There was\nno powder. Dazen started checking his pack to see if he had a powder horn\nsomewhere.\nSurely he had a powder horn somewhere.\nThe Blackguards were all in a circle around a narrow tower of some sort\n—and they all had their backs to it, making a last stand—and there she was\natop the tower, his Karris, confronting a polychromatic wight.\nAnd she was on her knees.\nBut Dazen was coming right down behind that big rainbow bastard.\nDazen found the powder horn and tugged it clear of the canopy-straps.\nCutting this close, Orholam old boy.\nHe uncapped the powder horn with his teeth—\nAnd then something invisible caromed off him, sending him spinning up\nand sideways, tangling the cords of his canopy and throwing him wildly off\ncourse. The powder horn went flying, and he nearly lost the sword, too.\nHe saw a flash of light that illuminated two winged figures fighting,\ntumbling through the air away from him, locked in combat.\nSpinning and swinging wildly off course, Dazen gripped the sword with\nwhite knuckles, trying to get his bearings. He was fast approaching the\nluxin tower—but not the part where he wanted to land.\nHe was too far away. Now he was going to land behind Karris, at the\nvery, very edge of the tower. He might not be able to stay on it at all.\nHe had only moments to make a decision.\nWithout black powder, he couldn’t shoot the gun-sword, but he could\nthrow it like a spear. That worked, once in a while, throwing your sword.\nOnce in a long while.\nAlmost never.\nAnd throwing a sword like a spear while spinning and swinging…?\nBut Dazen was the Promachos. That was who he was! He was the hero\nwho arrived on the wings of the dawn and saved everyone at the last\nsecond. He could make the throw! He had to!\nOr… he could give up all that.\n* * *\n“Hey! Hey!” someone shouted in the air above them. The voice was\nfamiliar.\nLocked in place by the green seed crystal’s influence over the green\nluxin in her body, Karris couldn’t move, but she saw Koios look up quickly,\nalarmed, blinking against the glare of Orholam’s rising eye.\nA black blade landed across her open hands. It cut her palm as it slid\nthrough her grip, and the black luxin sucked greedily at the green luxin in\nher blood.\nAnd suddenly, as the green luxin immobilizing her was devoured, she\nwas freed.\nBut then Koios saw her moving, and saw the blade in her hands."

No blood poured from\naround the blade. Then, abruptly, it was as if he were collapsing in on\nhimself. She realized what was happening: the blade was sucking every bit\nof luxin out of him in turn: sub-red, then red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\nand superviolet—\n—until Koios was, quite suddenly, merely a burned man with rage and\ndisbelief in his wide eyes, wearing a necklace with colored and black jewels\non it. She ripped the necklace off him and threw it off the tower.\nThen she ripped the sword out of his chest. There was no blood, still,\nwhich stunned both of them.\nHe threw a hand at her to lash out with magic, and she moved the sword\ndesperately to parry the attack—but no luxin missile flew from him.\nKoios looked down in horror at his mortal flesh.\nHis head shook, no, no. He threw his hand forward again, again, as if\ntrying other colors in turn and finding none of them.\nHis eyes filled with fear. He backed away, desperate. “Ye immortals! My\nservants! Come to me now! I command it!” Koios cried. “Save me now!”\nExtending his arms, he leapt off the tower as if he fully expected to be\ncaught.\nHis body crunched on the deck of the ship far below, crushed.\n“Um. Hate to be a bother,” a voice called out behind her.\nGavin? “Gavin!” she cried.\nHer husband stood with his toes on the very edge of the tower, his hands\ncartwheeling as he tried to keep his balance.\n“Uh…” he said. “Hi, honey. Help?”\nThen, before she could move, he plunged out of sight.\nShe was at the edge the next instant, as if she hadn’t had to cover the\nintervening space.\nShe looked down, afraid of seeing his broken body beside her brother’s\nfar below, but instead she saw Gill Greyling. He’d almost climbed the entire\ntower, coming after her—and now he’d snagged Gavin out of the very air.\nTwisting as he held Gavin’s wrist in his hand, the Blackguard said, “I\nlost one Gavin, sir. I’m not losing another.”\nAnd then she was helping hoist her husband up the tower. The battle\nimmediately below them was finished—the Blood Robes had broken at the\nsight of their master leaping to his death.\nAnd then her husband was up, and safe, and in her arms.\nThe dawn was glorious, but there were a million things to do. But none\nof them mattered right now. The feelings were too big to hold in for one\nmore moment.\nShe had never cried so hard in her life.\nChapter 144"

He’d thought\nthat it was simply the night, bleeding the colors from the land as it does, but\nthe rising light of the incipient dawn was making it clear. There was\nsomething wrong with the colors; they were wan and weak. He said, “I\nblew my halos. On the Glare. It’s been really nice holding and being held\nby you, but now… I have to know.”\nTisis took a deep breath. She’d hadn’t looked in his eyes since the\nbeginning. But as she looked at him now, she seemed relieved. “They were\nstark white, right after. All the way through. Now they’re blue. Just your\nnatural blue.”\n“No halos at all?” he asked.\n“No, none.”\n“Well…” he said. “That’s, um, great. I guess.” He wasn’t going to have\nto be Freed in the next few days, so that was something.\n“What’s wrong?” she asked.\n“I can’t draft,” he said quietly. Grief speared through his stomach. That\nwas why the colors felt weak, emotionless. His vision now felt as\nimpoverished and textureless as a drafter’s vision is compared to the\nimmortals’. He was seeing the way munds do.\n“What?” she asked. “No. Maybe you’re just tired? Lightsick?”\nHe shook his head, forcing a smile. “My life was spared, but not my\npowers. I’ve tried every color. They’re gone. They’re all gone.”\n“Oh, honey,” she said, putting her hand to her mouth.\nHe could’ve been the Lightbringer; now he couldn’t even draft. He was\na mund. Many drafters would have preferred death to that. He would have,\na year ago. He looked away. “Do you think—do you think you can love a\nman with broken eyes?”\nShe didn’t get mad at him, which he would have deserved. She only\nsqueezed him tight.\n“I’m so sorry,” she said again.\n“Me, too,” he said, wiping his eyes clear. He took a deep breath. “And\nnow let’s be done with that.” He was almost surprised that the words rang\ntrue. “I think… I think I’m kind of finished with self-pity. It probably\nshould’ve taken less than dying to figure out how good I’ve got it, but I do.\nI’m here. With you. So I’m a mund. So what?”\n“A mund?” she objected, a smile turning her lips at last. “Kip Guile, the\nlast thing you are is mundane.”\nDid you think I would forget you, little Guile?\n“Huh?” Kip asked Tisis. She and Commander Fisk were helping him\nstand.\n“I didn’t say anything,” she said.\nHe was wobbly, but maybe he’d recover quickly if he walked around a\nbit. “I think I’ve figured something out about myself: I really hate watching\na battle.”\nThe view from the elevated platform was excellent.

Though Ebon’s Hill\nhid everything in Weasel Rock and Overhill, Kip could see West Bay and\nEast Bay and the still-burning fires at the Great Fountain. The predawn light\nwas just beginning to tell the tale of how much damage the Blood Robes\nhad done to the city. Smoky plumes rose from numerous areas, but Karris\nhad stockpiled water and firefighting supplies, and organized neighborhood\nteams, and it seemed those fires weren’t spreading. The rattle of muskets\nwas still constant, sometimes in volleys, but more often in crackles around\nthe entire island. Few of the cannons were firing at this hour. Most had\neither been silenced or were waiting for the dawn to better reveal their\ntargets.\nThe superviolet, the blue, the yellow, and the green bane had been\ndestroyed. As far as he could see, the rest were still afloat. He didn’t want to\nthink what that probably meant for Ferkudi and Ben-hadad. He wanted to\nrejoin the fight, but he knew Commander Fisk and Tisis weren’t going to let\nhim do that. Probably they wouldn’t have let him fight even if he started\nturning cartwheels. But they were right, he was in no shape for any of that.\nHe was useless.\nIt was not a good feeling.\nNow, what was that voice he’d imagined?\n“What was that?” Tisis asked.\n“What?”\n“In the water!”\nBut whatever it had been, Kip missed it—and turned his aching head\nand burning eyes as far as possible while doing so. He immediately\nregretted the action. All right, definitely not in any state to fight. He might\nas well volunteer to go fall on an enemy’s spear.\n“It went right past the Lily’s Stem,” Tisis said. “Here I was about to\nsuggest we get back to the Chromeria to be safer, but… if that thing hadn’t\nturned it could’ve taken out the bridge without even noticing.”\n“A sea demon?” Kip asked.\nThen he heard a throaty boom of some huge cannon and turned. Few\nother cannons were firing now, and none sounded like that.\n“What was that?” Tisis said. “I think I know that gun. Orholam’s beard,\nis that The Compelling Argument?”\n“The what?”\n“My sister tried to buy it off a merchant Phineas something maybe? He\nwouldn’t sell, and said he’d never make its like again. Swore it was\ndestined for someone else, but demonstrated it for her to try to drum up\nother business.”\nKip could only see a wisp of smoke in the air in the direction he’d heard\nthe blast. Sometimes cannoneers wrapped burning sackcloth around a shell\nto be able to watch its trajectory. In a few more moments, he was rewarded\nwith another shot, arcing identically to the first, to thud into the sub-red\nbane.\nCommander Fisk had a long-lens to his eye. He handed it to Kip with an\nodd look. “Please tell me I’m not crazy.”\nIn the half-light, though, it was hard to find anything.\n“Find the old Tyrean embassy. Couple points right of it, halfway out in\nthe bay,” Fisk said."

Couple points right of it, halfway out in\nthe bay,” Fisk said.\n“Where’s his ship?” Kip asked. For in the water, there appeared to be a\nship’s square forecastle, moving at speed, undulating, floating without the\nadvantage of a ship. A man danced to an inaudible beat, with hot points of\nlight burning in his beard as he loaded a huge cannon all by himself.\n“Gunner?” Kip said. What was that forecastle resting on?\nGunner fired again, then jumped up on the barrel of his big cannon and\ndanced from one foot to the other, eyes straining as if waiting for\nsomething. He pumped his arm as if successful, though at what, Kip had no\nidea.\nA moment later, the entire sub-red bane exploded. Light flashed over the\nislands and a cloud mushroomed in the early morning, smoke rolling in on\nitself.\n“Did he just—?” Tisis asked.\n“He sure seems to think so. And—is Gunner on top of a sea demon?!”\n“Not sure,” Fisk said.\nBut whatever it was, Kip wasn’t going to see it, because Gunner and his\nfloating forecastle disappeared behind the Tyrean embassy.\n“Enough. This one is under my protection!” someone shouted.\nKip looked around. It was a familiar voice this time. But there was\nnothing to be seen. A feeling of foreboding came over him. “Rea?” he said.\n“Rea Siluz?”\nTisis looked at him. “Who?”\n“Nothing,” Kip said. “Were you going to go wrap that wrist and get\nsome poppy?”\nWhen Aram had deflected her pistol during her attempt to shoot Zymun,\nhe’d sprained her wrist. It was very swollen now, but she hadn’t wanted to\nleave Kip, hadn’t left all through long hours of the morning.\n“Yeah.” But she looked at him oddly.\n“Commander Fisk?” Kip said. “I’ll stay right here, promise.”\nAs they went, Kip walked to the very edge of the platform and craned\nhis neck. A rain of burning embers was still drifting down from the sub-red\nbane—luckily for the city, most of it was landing in the water. Kip could\njust barely see Gunner’s forecastle—now resting on the seawall of East\nBay. The pirate was gesticulating furiously, but he didn’t appear hurt, and\nthe forecastle deck was leaning at an angle as if it had been dumped off the\nsea demon’s back.\nKip stepped back, and something brushed his shoulder.\nThere was no one on the platform with him, but that touch made his\nwhole body tingle. He looked at his shoulder. The sleeve was cut open—\nand smoking. The barest line of blood welled up as he gripped his arm.\nThe premonition he’d felt suddenly resounded again in his gut with all\nthe urgency of a sick man who’d ignored the first belly twinge and now was\nabout to vomit.\nAbaddon.\nHe tilted his head back and saw—and he saw in glorious, weighty,\nmore-real-than-real color, because as he was drawn inexplicably, inexorably"

She leapt instantly, faster than human thought,\nbringing up a blazing sword—\nThe concussion of their collision blew away Abaddon’s illusory body\nand face. The black, smoking fragments dazzled Kip’s eyes but not Rea’s.\nAbaddon beat her back, and with hammer blows of sword on sword and\nsword on shield, the immortal battered Rea out of the air like a man\nswatting a moth to the ground.\nShe fell to the street below the platform, elegant armor scraping on the\ncobblestones, baffled, afraid.\nTen paces out, the two Mighty nunks looked around as if they’d heard\nsomething. But they hadn’t been drawn into the bubble; they couldn’t see\nthem.\nThe locust thing that was Abaddon drew Comfort, his mother-of-pearl-\nhandled multichambered pistol, and shot rapidly at Rea’s prone form.\nRea blocked the shots with shield and then sword, getting knocked back\nand back, finally falling to the cobblestones. She looked more shocked at\nhis power than in fear for her life, though.\nSmoke curling lovingly from his pistols around his body, he paused in\nfiring, not to reload: that pistol never needed reloading. “Concede this world\nto me, Aurea.” He gestured to his pistol. “This is no Sundering Blade, but if\nI kill you with it here, you can still never return to this realm. Go. Tell\nyourself that you’ll be back someday. I’ve won today.”\nWhy was he telling her that? There must be some shred of a chance Rea\ncould still win, or he wouldn’t be giving her a chance, right? Or was there\nsome old affection between them that Kip couldn’t even guess at? Aurea?\nRea looked at Kip, and he could swear he saw an apology in her eyes.\nThen, taking advantage of her distraction, Abaddon fired at Rea, but\nshe’d already winked out of the space where she’d been lying a moment\nbefore, fleeing.\nShe’d abandoned this world.\nBut then it made sense, didn’t it? If there really were a thousand worlds,\nthat left nine hundred and ninety-nine more for her to fight for, didn’t it?\nOne battlefield lost didn’t mean much, on that scale.\nThe nunks who were supposed to be protecting Kip seemed to have\nheard the final shots or the ricocheting of the musket balls off the street,\nbecause they charged toward the platform now.\nAnd died, instantly; their heads obliterated with a single shot each."

Kip had no idea what emotion\nthat was intended to convey. Then the creature said, “Where is my cloak?”\n“It’s right over there. Can’t you see it?” he asked, pointing to the far side\nof the platform.\nAbaddon’s fist lashed out and cracked Kip’s ribs. He fell and almost\ntumbled off the platform. He groaned, holding on to the corner post, staring\nout to East Bay in the half-light.\nRea, please tell me I’m not really alone here. Please.\n“The master cloak. Where is it?”\n“You’ve made a big mistake,” Kip said, facedown, woozy. “Huge.\nGigantic.”\nGunner was out there, so far away Kip could barely see him, standing as\nif he was holding a long-lens up to his eye. With the hand out of Abaddon’s\nsight, Kip tried to gesture to Gunner: ‘Shoot here, yes, here!’\n“Me?” Abaddon said. “No, no, no. You have no idea, do you? This battle\nwas never about Koios and this little empire. It was about the fate of this\nentire world. Even now your Wight King calls out for our aid—and will get\nnone. The djinn have been freed from his control. The bane will grow again\n—in a single day, with my help. We’ll inspire such bloodlust that these\nbarbarians will scour these Jasper Islands. Massacre everyone. Even now,\nlook! Are your worthless mortal eyes keen enough to see the black sails of\nPash Vecchio’s fleet on the horizon? The pirate king comes with our\nreinforcements, and what do you have? No one comes for you. You’ve been\nabandoned. What’s your last hope? Some sea demons? Do you know how\nweak those really are against the right magics? It’s been a defense worthy of\nsong. But none will sing of what you did here. None will be left to do so.”\n“It’s funny you mention my eyes,” Kip said. “Because you’re right. I am\nblind to other realms. I don’t know them, nor understand them when I see\nthem, and when they affect my life, I’m left breathless and dazed. But I’m\nnot the only one blind.”\n“I know.

You\ncan’t even imagine how they work. You can’t imagine caring about\nanything other than yourself. It makes you stupid, Abaddon. It makes you\npredictable. It makes you weak. Do you know what humans can do? We can\nsuffer. If you just give us one solid thing to brace our will against, we will\nmove the world. We will hold on. Past reason. Past belief. Do you know\nwhat we know that you don’t?”\n“I should take you to join my menagerie. Perhaps a thousand years of\ntorment will teach you some respect. What are you hoping for, little Guile?\nOrholam’s hosts have abandoned this realm. I feel not the touch of a single\none of them now. Soon we shall free our brothers and…” He trailed off, his\nhead twisting to the side. “I see something about a gunner?”\n“Thanks,” Kip said. “Sometimes it takes a while for a compelling\nargument to come together.”\n“What?”\nKip reached out and touched Abaddon’s foot. Abaddon could move way\ntoo fast for Kip to mock him out loud, but he thought, You’re in my bubble\nof causality now, bitch.\nThe immortal looked at him, his head tilting. “We seem to have such\ntrouble communicating, you and I.”\nKip couldn’t help it; he glanced toward the seawall protecting East Bay,\nwhere he could just barely see the lonely foredeck of a ship that had been\nrun aground, and the black cloud of smoke that had been belched from its\nmighty throat. Kip shouldn’t have looked, but perhaps Abaddon was so\ncrafty he would think Kip’s glance itself was a distraction, a misdirection.\nBetween the raised platform at Orholam’s Glare and Gunner’s mighty\nCompelling Argument soared the old Tyrean embassy. There was a space no\nwider than a man’s forearm is long through which a cannonball might clear\nthe embassy and still hit the platform.\nIndeed, though Kip was visible, the embassy probably blocked Gunner’s\nview of Abaddon.\nKip didn’t care. He hoped Gunner put the exploding shell straight in his\nown lap. His life for Abaddon’s? Yes. Absolutely yes. This is for my nunks,\nyou bastard.\nBut even as the first diced heartbeat passed, Kip saw that the shot was\nsimply too far, even for Gunner.\nThe cannonball—a smoking, flaming streak—was heading wide. Either\nGunner had miscalculated to try to miss the embassy or the cannon itself\nsimply wasn’t accurate enough. The shell was going to miss.\nThen he and the immortal saw the same impossible thing: the flaming\nmissile was curving—curving in midair—\nCurving toward them.\nKip scrunched up into a fetal position, turtle-bear once more, one last\ntime, hunching around Abaddon’s ankle—they had to be touching for the"

And—ow!\nshit!—it was really hot!\nKip scrambled to his knees, flicking burning pieces of metal and wood\nfrom his clothes and skin, little burn holes dotting his tunic and trousers.\nBut he was too weak to stand.\nAbaddon stood before him, above him still, knocked back five paces by\nthe cannon shell still raining down around them. His coat and cloak had\nbeen ripped away in the blast.\nHis burned and blackened wings unfurled in a crack of rage, but\nwhatever wounds had torn his wings, they weren’t new; they’d happened\nlong ago, in millennia beyond counting. Abaddon was unhurt.\nKip’s deception and Gunner’s excellence and a curving, exploding\ncannonball had done nothing to this immortal except knock his clothes\nawry.\n“ !” Abaddon bellowed in that voice that reverberated in\ntones above and below human ken. “You think any mortal weapon could\nkill me?”\nHe leaned over, pained by his long-ago-broken ankles, and picked up his\nsword, which he’d lost in the blast—now disguised as a cane once more.\n“I don’t need to kill you,” Kip said, though his heart dropped.\n“What? Are you hoping your father will arrive with the sword?”\nAbaddon asked, derisive. “He’s a league away, killing that idiot Koios. Do\nyou think with the master cloak abroad that I’d actually lose track of the\none blade that can hurt me in this world? No. He’ll not come in time for\nyou. Now, where is my cloak?”\nHe lifted a foot and casually stomped on Kip’s head.\nIt felt like Kip had been kicked by a horse. But blubber bounces back.\n“Get out of here,” Kip said. “You bug me. Ha. Get it? You’re an insect?”\n“You can die easy now or you can die over the course of ten thousand\nagonizing years. Last chance.” Stomping on Kip’s head with each word for\nemphasis, he said, “Where. Is. My. Cloak?”\nThat was the magic of the master cloak. Even the immortals couldn’t see\nit. No wonder Abaddon was a bit put out that Kip had taken it.\n“I have a better question,” Kip said, nose streaming blood. “Keep firing\nas fast as you can. It reloads itself.”\n“Enough of this,” Abaddon said. “As fast as—what?”\n“A better question than ‘Where is my cloak?’” Kip said quickly, “would\nbe ‘Where is my… pistol?’”\nAbaddon reached for his holster to draw his revolving-chambered pistol,\nComfort.

She’d always been fast.\nA hole appeared through the middle of Abaddon’s left eye as a gush of\ngases and smoke jumped out of the empty air to Kip’s left. Only the pistol’s\nbarrel protruded from the invisible master cloak. One report followed on\nanother. Five shots. Ten shots. Fifteen. Twenty, as fast as she could fire\nthem, perforating the immortal relentlessly.\nTeia said nothing. She wasn’t the kind of assassin to give a lecture to\nannounce her presence.\nShe also wasn’t usually the kind to miss with half of her shots, but then\nKip saw why as she dislodged the master cloak and her head became\nvisible: she was firing blind. She wore a scarf around her eyes and had also\nducked her head into the crook of her elbow to shield her light-sensitive\neyes from the muzzle flash of the pistol every time she pulled the trigger,\nonly taking a quick, unsteady peek every few shots until Abaddon\ncollapsed, hemorrhaging blood everywhere.\nWith a word to her, Kip took the pistol from her hand, then stood over\nthe immortal, whose chest and arms were drenched with several shades of\nimpossibly vivid green and black and red blood, the colors already fading in\nKip’s sight as the immortal’s life faded and their realms separated once\nmore.\n“I know I can’t kill you without the Blinding Knife,” Kip said. “But I\ncan banish you, can’t I?”\nHe shot Abaddon in his nasty insectoid head. Twelve times. Then his\nchest a few more. Then the joints of his flailing limbs. Then his stomach—\nwho knew where this immortal kept his heart? No point taking any chances.\n“Get… out… of my world!”\nKip kept firing until the color faded and the immortal’s blood boiled,\nturned to smoke, and blew away with an ungodly stench. The rest of its\nflesh followed. In moments, nothing was left but Abaddon’s clothing.\n“Dammit, Teia. Took your time, didn’t you?” he said.\n“Is that a thank-you?” she asked. She was sitting with her head against\nher knees. “When’d you see me coming?”\n“I didn’t. But I knew you wouldn’t sit out a whole battle,” he said.\n“We’d never let you live that down.”\nShe gestured to the chain-spear still wrapped around her waist. “Faced\nan immortal, and I forgot to use your gift. Sorry.” She flashed a wan smile.\n“I guess it’s aptly…” She trailed off. “I’m not feeling so good, Kip.” She\ntwitched. Her skin blanched deathly pale.\nHe barely caught her before she collapsed.\n“It’s gonna be all right. We’ll take care of you, Teia,” he said, his chest\ntightening.\n“I know,” she said. “I know.”\nChapter 145\n“Form up,” Big Leo ordered. “One last time.”\nThey were all standing looking out toward the pirate ships anyway.\n“Might as well make an easy target for ’em, huh?” Winsen said.\n“Running’s still an option,” Ben-hadad said. “They might not get us all.”\n“Says the man with bouncy legs,” Winsen said, but he took his place in"

Never even listened to the offers.\nOffers that would have put us in debt for a hundred years, by the way.”\nDazen said, “This is personal. I sank Pash Vecchio’s great ship, his pride\nand joy.” In the time it had taken them to safely get back down from the\nWhite King’s high platform, the pirate king’s fleet had pulled within range,\nwith a great ship the twin of the Gargantua coming to point-blank. “I guess\nwhen you make enough enemies, it’s gotta catch up with you sooner or\nlater.”\nKarris sighed, then straightened her back to stand tall. She looked\naround at all of them as if to lock them in her mind’s eye now. “Where’s\nGrinwoody?” she asked.\n“Grinwoody?” Dazen asked.\n“Yeah, he fought with us all night,” Karris said. “Saved me a time or\ntwo.”\n“Good fighter for an old guy,” Big Leo said.\n“He what?” Dazen asked.\n“Haven’t seen him,” Big Leo said. “Not since we came out here. Maybe\nhe fell behind?”\nNo one else had seen him, either, and no one had as much interest as\nDazen did in pursuing the inquiry, as they were staring out at hundreds and\nhundreds of pirates bearing down on them.\n“Pirate king’s a mercenary, right?” Ben-hadad said. “So… surely he’s\ngonna want to switch sides again now that the White King’s dead? Right?”\n“Ben, Ben, Ben,” Winsen said as if he were a child. “The leadership of\none side is dead, and he’s got the leaders of the other side staring down the\nbarrels of a thousand guns. You really think—”\n“Not a thousand,” Ferkudi interrupted. “Don’t exaggerate! Twelve port\npieces, twenty hail shots, two top pieces, thirty breech-loading swivel guns,\nsix slings, six fowlers, and we don’t have to worry about the culverins and\ndemiculverins and sakers—they’re probably not gonna waste long-range\nguns when we’re this close, right? And less than half the total could be\npointed our direction at once since they can’t broadside us with both sides\nsimultaneously—though with the muskets and pistols all those pirates are\npointing… And then there’s the other ships—huh. Yeah, maybe a thousand\nguns, after all. Never mind.”\nWinsen went on as if Ferkudi hadn’t spoken. “Pash Vecchio’s a vulture.\nWhat do you think he’s gonna do?”\n“Hold us for ransom?” Ben-hadad said hopefully.\n“A vulture with a grudge,” Dazen said as the other ships of Vecchio’s\nfleet continued to fan out.

He wore a waistcoat under\nhis coat, but no tunic, showing dark-olive skin under many gold chains. He\nlooked something like a huge, obscenely rich version of Gunner.\n“And there he is,” Dazen said. “Sometimes I hate being right.”\n“Huh, where’d you pick up that keen understanding of what a super-\narrogant guy will do?” Winsen asked.\n“Win, shut it,” Big Leo said.\n“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Dying makes me grumpy, sir.”\n“Gavin Guile!” the pirate boomed between ranks and ranks of men with\nmuskets all pointed at Dazen. Vecchio was broad and happy and intense and\nspoke in the tone of a man who wouldn’t be ignored. The man was also\nholding two exquisite flintlock pistols, entirely plated in gold.\n“Pash Vecchio? Your Majesty,” Dazen said.\n“I see my reputation precedes me!” Vecchio said. “Or did you recognize\nthe ship?”\nEven as he smiled, Dazen swore under his breath.\n“Do you know? Someone sank its twin!” Pash Vecchio said. He spun his\ngold pistols around his fingers, not precisely pointing them at Dazen and not\nprecisely not. “All hands on deck, too. Terrible loss.”\n“Terrible loss,” Dazen agreed, pained. Please, let this not be out of the\nfrying pan, into another frying pan closer to the fire.\n“There’s a battle on, Guile. And is that High Lady Guile with you there?\nWho would believe my luck? You’re even more lovely than I’d heard. And,\ngiven the soot and blood you’re covered with, as formidable too.”\n“Thank you?” Karris said.\n“Why don’t you both hop aboard my newest little treasure?”\n‘Treasure.’ That didn’t bode well. Not that there was any option to\ndisobey. The ship had hundreds of well-armed pirates on it, in addition to\nthe sailors. Imprisonment was better than death, but Dazen had had quite\nenough of imprisonment.\nHe gritted his teeth and refrained from doing anything stupid, climbing\nup the extra-long gangplank to get onto the ship.\nThe Blackguards and the Mighty lined up on the deck with Dazen. No\none had moved to disarm them without the Pash’s order, but no one had\nstopped aiming their muskets at them, either.\n“Here’s the thing, Lord Guile,” Pash Vecchio continued, “O sinker of a"

The powder magazine would be considerably more secure if—”\n“Silence!” Pash Vecchio said. He licked his lips. “We talked. It was\nrather… more direct than peregrinational.”\nPirates. Did they all try to impress with their verbal gymnastics, or was\nthat an Ilytian trait?\nBut Pash continued, “What I was trying to say—and there’s a battle\nwaiting here, so let’s not drag this out—is that you, Gavin Guile—”\n“—Dazen Guile—”\n“—you sank a ship I loved. I was very, very… very, very, very perturbed\nabout that. Disturbed even. Mad even. Mad. But it turns out there’s one\nthing I love more than my flagship. And you managed to find it.”\nOh, nine hells. Seriously? What did I do now?\n“My daughter. Behold, the pirate queen!”\nA girl jumped out of the door to the captain’s cabin. Dazen recognized\nher. Orholam’s balls. It was his mother’s room slave.\n“High Lord Guile,” Fiammetta said. She bowed instead of curtsying, as\nshe was wearing short trousers, a vest, and somewhat fewer gold chains\nthan her father. She had a beatific smile, and had grown out her bright hair\nin curls. She was either adopted, or took quite a lot after her mother.\nThis was the slave girl he’d sent home, practically on a whim, guarded\nby the Cloven Shield mercenary band. She hadn’t said she was even from\nIlyta; she’d said she was from Wiwurgh, in Paria.\nBut of course she had.\nBecause what do you do if you’re the intelligent daughter of an\nincredibly wealthy pirate king? You pretend that you’re just a lowly slave\nunless things get really terrible, because you know he’s going to save you\nand you’d like him to be able to ransom you cheaply, and you don’t want to\nstir up his enemies who might kill or buy you to get back at him.\n“Dazen?” Karris asked.\n“My mother’s former room slave, whom she’d ordered freed… but my\nfather hadn’t quite gotten around to freeing yet,” Dazen said.\n“Nor had any plans to,” Fiammetta said.\n“You never mentioned that,” Karris said.\n“Turns out,” Fiammetta said, “Gavin Guile did those kinds of things\nquite frequently. Swooped in, saved people, left. Protecting his people,\nrisking his life as if that was just what he did. There must be a hundred\nvillages that have stories of the Prism himself coming and saving them from\na rampaging wight, or bandits, or a rapacious local governor.

We thought they’d turned on each\nother.”\nDazen shrugged apologetically.\n“You went alone?” she asked, and he wasn’t sure if her outrage was that\nof a wife or of a Blackguard.\n“The way I hear it,” Fiammetta said, “he couldn’t help himself. Traveled\nthe empire and fixed problems wherever he went. Ships saved from storms.\nCures brought from afar. The ruthless brought to justice. Practically\ninvisible, yet bringing light wherever he went. People love a man like that.\nPeople follow a man like that.”\n“They did,” Dazen said. Once. He tried to say it without bitterness. For\ngood and ill, a Guile might never forget what he’d done, but other people\ncertainly did.\n“They do still,” a woman’s voice said from the recesses of the captain’s\ncabin. “I traveled all over the Seven Satrapies, and everywhere I went, they\ntold me tales of their Gavin Guile, who came and stood for them, who\nfought for them.”\nDazen’s knees almost went out from under him, and he heard Karris\ngasp as she recognized the voice.\n“Everywhere,” Marissia said, “they love him, and when I asked them if\nthey’d fight for Gavin Guile in his hour of need, they ran to answer the\ncall.”\nDazen couldn’t speak. He couldn’t believe it, couldn’t believe his eyes\nas Marissia strode out of the gloom.\nDazen crushed her in a hug, and Karris—gracious Karris!—joined him\nimmediately.\nHe choked out, “I thought you were dead. I thought that was on me,\ntoo.”\nFiammetta, who had apparently become a great friend of Marissia’s,\ncouldn’t help herself. She crashed into the hug, too.\n“But how? How?” Gavin asked.\nMarissia said, “Your father’s an asshole, but he doesn’t always murder\npeople when he can avoid it. He exiled me to one of those little islands he\nowns. I escaped.”\n“But how did you—?”\n“Escape? Gavin Guile,” Marissia said in a reproving tone, “I am not a\nwoman without resources.”\n“I—”\n“Enough!” Marissia said. She was radiant, smiling fiercely despite the\ntears streaming down her cheeks. “Come see!”\nShe pulled him out onto the forecastle, where she raised one of his arms,\nand the pirate queen Fiammetta came to his other side and raised the other.\nThousands of voices roared at seeing him, not just those sailors on the great\nship but the sailors on all the others around them.\nPash Vecchio’s fleet had to make up more than a third of the White\nKing’s entire armada.

How could I not stand for him\nnow?’”\nDazen was speechless. Proud as he was, he’d never understood what\npeople meant when they said they were humbled by a gift.\nHe understood now.\n“This isn’t Pash Vecchio’s fleet, Gavin Guile,” Marissia said. “It’s\nyours.”\nPash Vecchio cleared his throat awkwardly. “I was against all this, but…\nbut you should really have a daughter. Then you’ll understand.” He\nglowered. “Come on, Orholam with the squirts, people, this is the part\nwhere we betray the pagans and destroy their armada. Isn’t anyone going to\ngive the order?”\n“What order?” Dazen started to ask. Was this why the whole pirate fleet\nwas coming to bear not on Big Jasper but on the White King’s battered\narmada, into which they’d already driven a wedge?\nO my sweet Orho—\n“Fia?” Pash Vecchio said, unlimbering a massive curving sword. He\nflicked it spinning into the air.\nFiammetta jumped up to a gunwale and snatched it out of the air. She\nshouted, “Who stands with Gavin Guile?”\nPash Vecchio launched a signal flare even as she brought the blade down\nwith an impressive flourish.\nThe people roared, and the thunder of many cannons rose like a chorus\nof a thousand voices, shouting:\n“I stand, I stand, I stand with Gavin Guile.”\nChapter 146\nThe goddess once known as Aliviana Danavis watched the battle play out\nfrom atop the Prism’s Tower as the sun rose. She’d tended to her wounds\nthroughout the night, pausing when her flesh required it and simply\nwatching as Andross Guile directed astonishing quantities of light with deft\ncontrol. She was glad, then, that he’d chosen to become an old man rather\nthan a god.\nThe fall had not only nearly killed her, it had shaken her. More\nimportantly, it had shaken Ferrilux’s hold on her. The immortal was more\ncunning than she’d given him credit for, and if not for being hurried by this\nbattle, he might have taken her over by degrees.\nIt was going to be a very long war between them.\nShe limped to the edge of the tower. Not everyone realized it yet, but the\nbattle had already been decided. The pirate fleet was fresh and had better\nposition, and the Blood Robes’ leadership was in utter disarray, some ships\ncounterattacking and colliding with other ships fleeing, contradictory\norders, confusion—it had all the elements of an impending slaughter.\nNor was the fleet the only surprise: that, the hosts and their immortals\nmight have destroyed. The dawn had brought sea demons, and they were\ndevouring the bane from beneath. The fresh seed crystals with which the\nBlood Robes had planned to renew any bane they lost simply winked out of\nLiv’s perception, ingested into those great cruciform mouths and digested\nby their great cetacean gullets."

The sea demons were a conundrum she hadn’t studied yet.\nShe would have to, in the coming centuries.\nShe heard the clank of the mirror-array frame’s metal on metal as it\ncame to a rest. Then Andross Guile began unstrapping himself. He looked\nweary, and angry.\n“What are You playing at?” he demanded. He wasn’t looking at Liv. He\nwas looking skyward. “Orholam! That can’t be it. This was to be my last\nand greatest game. This was to be everything!”\nShe studied him, curious. He had summoned magic from the far corners\nof the empire. He’d empowered thousands of drafters through the entire\nnight, and killed countless of his enemies by his own will. He’d saved the\nempire. Turned the war.\nAnd it wasn’t enough for him.\nSuddenly, to Liv’s left, the old spectral form appeared. “Kill him!”\nFerrilux hissed. “We’ll give you all power. Power such as Koios could only\ndream of. But kill Andross Guile now!”\nWith stony eyes, Liv met Ferrilux’s gaze for a moment and then turned\nher back. Ferrilux hated being ignored more than anything. She smiled.\n“How dare you take it from me,” Andross Guile said to the heavens.\n“This was to be my greatest trial and my greatest achievement. But you had\nthem do all the parts I didn’t know if I could do.”\nHe climbed out of the mechanism. He looked toward the door into the\nPrism’s Tower, but no one came out.\nAndross Guile, the Lightbringer, was utterly alone.\nGathering the superviolet to her to float her down, Liv stepped to the\nedge of the tower.\nThe battle was over now. There would be hours of murderous cleanup,\nbut now it was only a matter of bloody time. Now it was just meat\nslaughtering meat.\nThe old man had dropped to his knees. “I don’t understand,” he said.\n“My whole life. My whole life…”\nPeople, Liv thought. So strange.\nShe floated down from the tower and crossed the bridge. There was\nnothing for her here now.\nIt was a mistake. She had barely left the Lily’s Stem when she saw him,\nbeing carried in a litter.\nHer father.\nHe shouldn’t have been able to see her, but there was something odd\nabout people’s vision when they were close to death. It was another thing\nshe would have to investigate someday, she thought.\nFor the moment, she pulled her hood down, hoping this more mundane\ncloaking would save her the bother of speaking with him. But even\nsurrounded by his soldiers and being hurried to the Chromeria, he saw her.\n“Stop! Stop!” he commanded them, and they did. He pushed a man out of\nhis way, and stared at her, transfixed. “Aliviana?”\nFor some reason, she froze. He was dying, she saw. Internally bleeding\nin half a dozen places, as from a great fall.\nHis men piled up behind him, unready for the sudden stop."

Some old defiance. Some old, human\noutrage. It almost felt good.\n“‘Done to me’?” she asked. “They did nothing to me. I chose this.”\n“Liv. No. My daughter. My darling one. Please. Come back.”\nCome back? To what? To being human and frail? To being subservient?\nNo. There was a hierarchy, she saw now. But it was organized by power, not\nby affection.

He hesitated when he saw Andross sitting in his wing-backed chair.\n“Please, sit,” Andross said, lighting a lamp with one finger, gesturing for\nGrinwoody to sit in the other chair. There was a cocked flintlock pistol on\nthe arm of his own chair. A measure of whiskey was waiting on the table for\neach of them. Andross had never said ‘please’ to Grinwoody, not in all their\nyears together.\nGrinwoody dropped his head, his mouth twitching at a hundred\nthoughts. Then he took off his servants’ white gloves and tucked them away\nin a pocket. He sat opposite Andross.\nThey sat, sipping their whiskey, as if they were two gentlemen enjoying\na pleasant summer day rather than mortal enemies whose paths had crossed\nas a battle wound down.\n“Smoke, Lord Anazâr?” Andross asked.\n“Please.”\nThey smoked as a fleet and a city burned, as sea demons tore through the\nremaining bane and devoured the wights thrown into the water and the\nWight King’s fleet dissolved into chaos.\n“It was an excellent gambit,” Andross said.

That was… unexpected.”\n“Oh, I know. You might’ve chosen any of the dozens of poisons it won’t\nwork for. What can I say?

If they got deathly ill shortly later, I’d sell them\nimmediately.”\n“I don’t know whether I should be angry at you that you’re so lucky or\nat my own error, or if I should be impressed that you kept the ingredients\nsecret even from me for all these years. So why is it instead that I’m hurt\nthat you didn’t trust me enough to tell me?”\n“It’s a hell of a thing,” Andross said.\n“What? All your secrets? My infiltration? Trying not to make a single\nmistake, knowing it will get you killed, against an enemy who can make a\nhundred and never lose?”\n“Betrayal,” Andross said quietly.\n“You goddam Guiles. It’s not even fair, opposing you.”\n“You chose to be in opposition. You might have done otherwise.”\n“No, I think not,” Grinwoody said.\n“How’d you do it?”\n“Which part?” Grinwoody asked.\n“The hardest part. Getting me to buy you of my own accord.”\n“You actually weren’t the target, oddly enough. You were my second\nfailed attempt. I was trying to get purchased by Ulbear Rathcore. He\nseemed more likely to go far than you did.”\n“In a kinder world,” Andross said. He sipped. “But… a slave?”\n“Impossible to keep many secrets from your slaves.”\n“And if I were terribly abusive, what? You had a magistrate standing by?\nWitnesses who would swear you’d been enslaved illegally? That sort of\nthing?”\n“Naturally,” Grinwoody said. “I almost called on him a dozen times that\nfirst year. I did not like taking orders. Caused me quite some panic when he"

Then I realized I had assassins at my command. Getting\na magistrate to authenticate papers wasn’t going to be any problem. Now,\nyour turn. Who was your assassin? Everyone drank the bloodwine. I nearly\ndrank it myself. I usually do. You almost got me—but I had too much to do\nin the morning, so for the first time in many years I abstained. But no one\nelse did. I have spotters to watch for such things. The only thing I can figure\nis that your poisoner must have drunk the lacrimae sanguinis, too. Who was\nit?”\nAndross shrugged.\n“There are only five people it could be,” Grinwoody insisted. “And\nthey’re all dead. It was one of my high priests, wasn’t it? Atevia Zelorn?”\n“It actually wasn’t my doing,” Andross said.\nGrinwoody almost dropped his zigarro. “You can’t be serious. All this\ntime playing against you, and I’m undone… by some side player? Who?”\n“Karris, I think,” Andross said.\n“Little Karris? Karris killed four hundred and thirty people?”\nGrinwoody sat back. “And here I thought that Iron White business was a\npretention to impress the small folk.”\n“Then she became what she pretended,” Andross said.\n“Perhaps so.” Grinwoody looked at his empty glass. He set down his\nzigarro, and glanced at the pistol. “But I did not.”\n“I thought you were my friend,” Andross said suddenly. There was a\nragged edge in his voice. In another man, it might have seemed close to\ntears.\n“A mistake I never made of you,” Grinwoody said.\n“So I see,” Andross said, all iron control once more. “Your papers are on\nthe table. Take them as you go.”\n“My papers? You’re letting me live?” Grinwoody asked. But he stood\nimmediately. He was no fool.\n“Good play should be rewarded, and you won. Far be it from me to\nsnatch the fruits of twenty-three years of service from your lips. Far be it\nfrom me to deny your victory.”\nGrinwoody picked up the papers, slowly. “Do I look victorious to you?”\n“No, but the game that you lost was some other game, against someone\nelse. Nothing to do with me. Me you outwitted, me you convinced to\nexpose my back. I have no excuses. Spying is a well-known stratagem in\nthe great game, and betrayal a time-honored tradition. How can I begrudge\nyou those?”\n“You surprise me,” Grinwoody said. “I hadn’t expected to find you\nequanimous in defeat.”\n“You’ve never seen me lose.”\n“Except your temper.”\n“At setbacks. At delays in my game. But our game is finished. Now is\nthe time for me to examine my loss, and to learn from it.”\nGrinwoody pursed his lips. “After all these years, you still are able to"

The ‘my lord’ had been\nreflexive, a mistake.\n“‘Andross,’ please.”\n“Yes. Of course.”\nAndross said, “There’s an island off Tabes on the Ruthgari coast. Good\nlittle harbor, tricky approaches to dissuade raiders, and looks crude from\nwithout but is luxurious within. Comfortable for a household of fifteen or\ntwenty. I meant to keep it secret even from you. Do you know of it?”\n“Yes. Followed the money, of course.”\nAndross inclined his head. “It’s yours. The deed’s among those papers.\nSell it if you wish. Fair wages, I think, for twenty-three years of your\nlabors.”\n“But you purchased me.”\n“Yes. Yes, I did. And the man who sold you to me now owes me a great\ndebt.”\nHe said this without emotion, but the malice was clear. Grinwoody was\na victor, but any others who had betrayed Andross were simply enemies.\nAnd his memory was long and long.\n“Naturally,” Andross said, “should I see you again, or hear of your\ninterference…”\n“Naturally,” Grinwoody said.\nHe took his papers and walked to the door as if he expected Andross to\nshoot him in the back at every step. But he stopped when he got the door\nopen. He looked back. He looked as if to experience this magnanimity from\nAndross Guile was itself a deep draught of bitter-almond tea.\n“I want you to know something, Andross. In all my years of working\nwith spies and murderers and traitors and scum,” Grinwoody said, “I’ve\nnever met a man who deserved betrayal more.”\nChapter 148\n“Sit down,” Andross said. “We have to figure a few things out before we go\nout there.”\n“Do we really?” Kip asked. He came and took a seat, though.\nThe curtains were wide open in his grandfather’s sitting room, windows\nopen to the sun. Outside, the work of repairing the city—and the empire—\nwas well underway. The funerals were over: by necessity, done quickly,\nefficiently even for the defenders, and expeditiously at best for the\nattackers.\nThe people of the Jaspers would mourn even as they rebuilt, but Andross\nwas keen to give everyone reasons to cheer as soon as possible, to focus on\nvictory and unity, not on the costs of what they’d been through.\n“Yes, we must,” Andross said. “You won our game. And though I told\nyou that I would claim the mantle of Lightbringer if you left the beach, you\nnever conceded that. I received the signal the bane had landed moments\nlater, so you may have still been on the shore.”\n“Are we really doing this?” Kip asked. “I can’t even draft.”\n“Nothing in the prophecies about drafting after becoming the\nLightbringer. I managed to do pretty well at ruling for many years while\nonly drafting on the rarest occasions.”\nKip expelled an exasperated breath, looking away."

All that I\nknow. But it’s complicated, and no one in the tale comes out looking good.\nNot me, not her, not Corvan.”\n“You added that last part just to make me curious, didn’t you?” Kip\nasked.\nAndross stopped himself before he denied it. “I’d like to get it off my\nplate. And my conscience.”\nFor a moment, Kip thought about forgiveness, and time. “I’m not ready.\nIt might be a while until I am.”\nAndross paused, then nodded. “I forget,” he said. “Felia would do this to\nme, too. Great leaps of intuition and then long, slow cud-chewing on facts\nthat seemed simple to me. But she would chew and chew, and then\nsuddenly understand a whole person or a whole family, it seemed. I could\nnever guess where it would strike with her, nor, it seems, with you. How I\nmiss her. I wish you could’ve met.”\n“We could’ve, actually. She came to Garriston for her Freeing. She\nnever tried to talk with me. I’ve thought of that a few times. Seemed weird\nto me that she wouldn’t want to meet her only grandson, bastard though I\nwas,” Kip said. “She was afraid I was your bastard, wasn’t she?”\n“Yes. Wrongly,” Andross said. “Do you want to have that conversation,\nafter all?”\n“No. No. I should have liked to meet her quite a lot, though. It seems to\nme this family has kept far too many secrets for far too long, to our own\ninjury.”\nAndross said, “We keep secret what we fear makes us weak, not\nrealizing in our fear that it is the keeping of secrets itself that weakens us.”\nHe lifted his eyebrows then, as if surprised at hearing the sentiment from\nhis own lips. “Let’s let it lie for now, then, not a secret, but simply a\ndifficult discussion that can wait a while. I do have another that can’t.”\n“I figured, coming in to see you, that the meeting wouldn’t be all\nrainbows and daisies.”\n“This will be known henceforth as Ascension Day. In the future, this\nwill be a holy week—from Sun Day to Ascension Day, commemorating the\ngreat victory of Orholam’s light over the forces of darkness, and celebrating\nthe coming of His chosen one: me.”\nKip nodded.\n“You don’t seem angry,” Andross said.\n“Are you worried about threats to your throne already?” Kip asked."

I’ll have requests, but I’ll go, and I\nwon’t cause you problems.”\n“I know,” Andross said. “And I don’t like it.”\n“Huh?”\n“I’ve been very carefully vague in my wording with all my commands,\nin everything I’ve done as promachos to prepare the islands for Ascension\nDay.”\n“Okay…”\n“I’m saying, when we go out there to the blast of the ramshorns and the\ndancers and the pyroturges, we have to declare someone the Lightbringer.\nBut it doesn’t have to be me.”\nKip felt like a turtle-bear charging into a granite rock face. “Huh?”\n“You could’ve done everything I did.”\n“Not true,” Kip said.\n“You did more than I did.”\n“Arguable.”\n“You laid the groundwork for everything I did. You figured out the\npuzzle. I didn’t!”\n“That I can concede,” Kip said.\n“You paid more than I did, and if it weren’t for my blunders with\nZymun, you would’ve been on those mirrors all night. You would be being\ndeclared the Lightbringer in a few minutes. I should be, at best, an adviser\nto you, if not on the run for my life for everything I’ve done.”\n“I would’ve loved to have had you as an adviser.”\n“I know the truth. You and your father did the magic; I turned some\nmirrors.”\n“You brought source to thousands of different drafters simultaneously\nand battered and confused and burned wights and immortals until dawn. No\none else could’ve done that. I couldn’t have.”\n“Don’t you want it?” Andross insisted. “Don’t you want to be the most\nimportant person in history? It’s this close! Reach out and take it! Play one\nmore game with this as the wager. I’ll do it! I’ll do anything!”\n“Anything, anything to prove it should belong to you?” Kip asked.\n“You have no reason to believe I’ll rule well.”\n“I believe you’ll find reasons to rule well.”\nAndross’s face reddened.\n“No, no, I know I seem like I’m being flippant. And, fine, I sort of was,\nbecause I know how you love that, but mostly I’m not.” Kip took a breath.\n“There are things in this life that I need. Things that I can hardly function\nwithout: My wife, a few close friends, hard work, the camaraderie of shared\npurpose, things to figure out. Some leadership, because I’m pretty good at it\nand I chafe under incompetence. But I don’t need power. I don’t need every\neye to be on me every time I walk into a room. I don’t need strangers to\nknow who I am or be in awe of me. I wouldn’t give up those first things in\norder to be the most important man in history.

But I don’t need it. You? You\ndo.”\n“I’m the best one for the job!”\n“So what’s your problem?” Kip asked.\n“I didn’t earn it! I didn’t beat the overwhelming odds. I didn’t show the\nmagical genius. I didn’t die twice. You did! We fulfilled all the prophecies—\nnot me. I’ve spent my life preparing for this, and now I’ve proved myself to\neveryone except the people who matter—the son and grandson I’ll defraud\nin taking it. How can I accept a crown I didn’t earn?”\nKip gave him a sidelong look. “Maybe… rule as if it’s a gift, and not\nsomething you’re owed?”\nAndross’s temper flared for a moment, then cooled. “I wouldn’t trust\nanyone with the power you’re giving me.”\n“I know,” Kip said. “And hell, in a month?

Live victoriously.”\nAndross grew thoughtful, then scowled. “You know,” he said, “I can’t\ntell if you’re wise beyond your years or just a dumb kid full of slogans.”\n“Me, either,” Kip said.\nAndross cracked a smile even as he shook his head. “Definitely gonna\nhave to exile you somewhere.”\n“Somewhere nice?” Kip asked.\n“No, just far away,” Andross said.\n“I could use a good wedding trip with my bride.”\n“Oh, Orholam have mercy.”\n“Also I need a job. I don’t think I have any money.”\n“So it begins,” Andross said darkly.\n“Actually, I might’ve also put the family on the hook for a few expenses\nin Blood Forest.

And maybe some bankers.\nDefinitely some bankers. Maybe all the bankers.”\nAndross said, heading for the door, “Hellmount’s good for a\nhoneymoon, I hear.”\n“Oh, grandfather,” Kip said, stopping him before he went out. “I heard\nfrom the messengers that you also brought light to my people at the siege of\nGreen Haven and saved the city. And definitely saved my friends. Thank\nyou.”\nAndross stared at him for a few moments, then nodded and left.\nAlone, Kip wondered if he’d done something very, very good or very,\nvery bad.

He turned to head out the other door and saw his father watching\nhim. “How long have you been there?” Kip asked.\n“You know,” Dazen said, fiddling with the black eye patch he wore now,\n“when I was kid, when Sevastian died, I felt like I’d suddenly lost not just\nmy brother but also my father. Growing up, I longed for someone who\nwould mentor me, tell me how to do things—instead of just judging me\nwhen I failed. My father’s work was always everything to him. The scraps\nwent to Gavin, and I got nothing. I missed out with you—”\n“Not exactly your fault,” Kip said. “You didn’t know I existed for most\nof my life.”\n“I’m not talking about those years. I mean since I found you.”\n“C’mon, you’ve been a bit busy saving the world.”\n“That was my father’s excuse for all the terrible shit he did, too,” Dazen\nsaid, “but…” Dazen cleared his throat. Adjusted his eye patch. “I mean, I\nsee you do what you just did with your grandfather, and, Kip, I’m so damn\nin awe of you…” His eye misted up, but he kept going. “And… I’m so\ndamn sorry. You needed a father. And now I’m too late.” And suddenly tears\nwere streaming down his cheek and his breath was strained. “I missed my\nchance. You’re a man already now. And a fine one,” he said, getting control\nof himself. “A better man than I ever was. And I want to be proud of you—\nbut you did it all without me. How can I take pride in what you’ve done\nwithout my help? You didn’t need me. To do all this, you didn’t need me.”\nKip squirmed. He had needed his father, not just in the early years but\nsince then. He’d not meant this to go to casting guilt, but he didn’t want to\nrush in and say anything untrue to try to brush it away, either. The wound\nwas real. He didn’t blame Dazen, but it still ached.\nIn many ways, he barely knew his father, and that very thought was\nedged with razor desolation.\nDazen was quiet for a long while, and Kip—as he never could have\nbefore—filled the silence not with words but with listening.\nFinally, Dazen took a deep breath and said, “Kip, when I didn’t deserve\nit, Orholam gave me a second chance—maybe a thousand-and-second\nchance. I don’t deserve it with you, either, but… Kip, if it’s not too late, can\nwe start over? Can I try again at being your dad?”\nChapter 149\nWhen a protocol officer had questioned where Gavin should be seated in\nthe overflowing great hall (the whole Dazen thing would be dealt with later,\nAndross had decided), Andross Guile had given one of the most Andross\nGuile responses Dazen had ever heard: “The sun is not dimmed by the\npresence of other stars in the sky, nor even by the moon.”\nAll in white with gold brocade, Dazen was seated on the platform.

He\nwas quite the subject of fascination, of course, and the marveling that he\nwas still alive had already started to turn to what his new position might be.\nClearly, he couldn’t be Prism again. He couldn’t draft. But no one expected\nhim to do nothing. Certainly Andross didn’t; he’d already started to float\nideas about how to use his son’s reputation and charisma to stitch the\nsatrapies back together.\nBut every one of their meetings thus far had been public. They hadn’t\nhad to speak about the long night, or Sevastian.\nFor the moment, Dazen was quite content to be simply the White’s\nhusband, and he was happy to sit at her right hand rather than her at his. She\nwas resplendent in her whites, but she’d dyed her hair from its harsh\nplatinum white, now, back to her natural auburn. He loved it.\nAndross had contrived some last-minute duty that kept Kip busy while\neveryone else was being announced and seated. Rather than being ushered\nin a side door at the front, though, in the hush of the hall, the young man\ncame in from the back with Tisis. He walked with his head ducked, trying\nto be inconspicuous on the long walk up the center aisle, chagrined at being\nlate.\nKip had learned a lot in the last few years, but he could still be\ncharmingly naïve.\nHe had no nobles under his own authority, and all his own soldiers were\noutside the great hall, so perhaps he really hadn’t expected anything.\nThe Blood Foresters stood for him first. Then the Tyreans, who counted\nhim one of their own. His Mighty, seated in the front row as if family,\nstood, too.\nThen, in singles around the hall, drafters stood. They knew what he’d\ndone.\nWith help, King Ironfist (still ‘king’ technically, until some formalities\nwere worked out) stood. He gave Kip the old Blackguard salute.\nAll the Blackguards followed suit.\nAnd then everyone stood, from the High Luxiats down.\nDazen and Karris stood late in order to let Kip know that no one was\nstanding because they were following their lead.\nThe youngest Guile looked humbled, honored, as his eyes went from\nface to face and he recognized friends young and old. Kip and Tisis\nembraced Dazen and Karris and took their places beside them.\nOne of Kip’s Mighty, Winsen, coughed loudly. Suddenly there were\ngasps throughout the room, and then laughter spread fast on its heels. Those\non the platform had to turn around to see it: at the front of the room, next to\nthe staid official banners of Houses Guile and White Oak and Malargos, and\nAndross’s banners and the Lightbringer’s banner, and the banners for the\nvarious satrapies, a very ad hoc, homemade-looking banner unfurled. It\nappeared to be a child’s drawing of a turtle with a shock of hair on its head\nand a goofy grin on its face, with big bear claws and wings of fire.\nSeeing it, Kip immediately blushed and buried his face in his hands."

Us?’\nDazen couldn’t stop smiling. In some ways, they were still just a bunch\nof damn kids.\nBut they loved one another, and that was priceless.\nNaturally, Andross Guile waited until the furor had died down, and then\nwaited some more. But once he’d begun, with all the usual pomp and\nspectacle Dazen expected from such a ceremony—the magic, the music, the\nprocessionals, a surprisingly brief prayer by High Luxiat Amazzal—the\nascension ceremony was short and to the point.\nThe Colors and representatives for each of the Seven Satrapies and the\nsix remaining High Luxiats (one had belonged to the Order and was dead)\neach knelt before Andross and swore their fealty to him as Prism, emperor,\nand Lightbringer. Everyone else in the hall was allowed to take the oath\nfrom their own seats.\nAndross had moved fast in these first few days. Indeed, not just fast;\nhe’d moved like a man who’d been making a list for decades of all that\nwould need to be done.\nIt wasn’t impatience, either. Amid all the work of cleanup and\nreconstruction and burial and immolation of enemy corpses, there was still\nthe euphoria of their improbable victory. Only the war was on people’s\ntongues. Lesser stories—such as vast banking families being given\nultimatums, and certain troublemakers being thrown in prison, new laws\ncurtailing slavery and the capture of fugitives, restructuring in the\nMagisterium—these didn’t even need to be hidden: they simply weren’t that\ninteresting in comparison to all else that had happened.\nAndross had gathered the Spectrum and High Magisterium and\nsuggested a sentence of death or bereavement (a term he claimed he’d dug\nup somewhere, but he may have simply invented it) by the Blinding Knife\nfor the Blood Robe drafters and wights who’d been captured. The\nsuggestion was unanimously approved.\nBereavement was, he claimed, what had happened to Gavin when he’d\nbeen stabbed with the Blinding Knife and had lost his magical powers but\nnot his life. Andross planned to use the opportunity to figure out the exact\nmechanics of the blade: Did it matter who held it? Did what the wielder\nwished to have happen to the condemned change what the blade did?\nKarris’s young luxiats—whose ranks were suddenly swelling by the day\n—were reclaiming lost knowledge, including some from books older\nscholars swore previously had left entire pages blank. Dazen didn’t know if\nthis was a reclamation against the old workings of black luxin, or if Andross\nwas instructing his forgers among the scholars to insert his own preferred\nteachings.\nBut the crux of it was that the luxiats claimed that before Vician’s Sin,\nretiring drafters at the Freeing simply retired.

They were Freed, not of their\nlives but of their bonds of service—and also their magical gifts, as Dazen\nhad been.\nExcept that some also died, judged by Orholam Himself, it was said. So\ndrafters, never certain what they would receive at their judgment day, would\nstill approach it with fear and trembling. Sun Day would remain a somber\nand holy occasion, but also one filled with joy for the righteous.\nSo they claimed. The world would find out soon enough.\nDazen had only begged his father to wait a little while. He had an\nintuition he wanted to explore.\nAndross had granted it, saying the scholars could use the extra time\nanyway.\nIn the meantime, the Blood Robe drafters were held in mirrored cells or\ndarkness or in rooms carefully draped with colors they couldn’t draft.\nAndross hadn’t even suggested utilizing the dungeons Dazen had crafted\nand been held in, and Dazen certainly didn’t want to think of them ever\nagain.\nSurprisingly enough, Dazen rather enjoyed all the pageantry, though\nmost of his enjoyment came from the fact that he wasn’t the person on\nwhom the entire ceremony depended for once.\nThen Andross stood and spoke. “We have endured much, and we have\nmany labors before us. Changes are coming. I shall not restore to us some\nmythical golden age from the past. The only golden age open to us lies\nbefore us. If these satrapies are to endure, they must rest upon a foundation\nof justice. This will be hard, for many of us have suffered such grievous\ninjustices that we’ve allowed ourselves to inflict injustices on others, as if\nwe each were impartial judges who happen to rule in our own favor, always.\nThis coming age will bear great fruit, but we will have to till the rocky soil\nof our own hearts to plant that fruit so that our ch—so that our children and\nour children’s children may enjoy it.”\nHe pursed his lips, and then, in a less practiced voice that suggested he\nwas diverging from the speech he’d memorized, he said, “Some of us have\ndone things in this war… even done things to win this war for which we\nmust repent. I foremost among us.”\nDazen had more than a merely healthy cynicism for his father’s every\nact and word, but this hit like a right cross. Confession? Contrition? From\nAndross Guile? Was this another put-on? Another trap?\nBut from where Dazen was seated behind the old man, he hadn’t been\nable to see his face, couldn’t tell if this was just another game, another\nmanipulation, and already Andross was back to his scripted remarks.\n“This is the project we begin. As we fought together, we will work\ntogether, all of us: luxiat and noble and drafter and farmer and fisherman\nand smith. We will mourn together, and we will celebrate our victories and\nOrholam’s. We will bind up the wounds of these Seven Satrapies, and we\nwill make them stronger, and more just and more honorable than they were\nbefore.

By the grace of Orholam, despite our many losses, the list of our\nallies and friends has grown in these dark hours, and those who sacrificed to\nserve in our darkest hours shall not go unrecognized in the light.”\nAndross was a plain speaker, given to sentences too long for many\npeople to follow, and it wasn’t the kind of speech designed to draw forth\napplause, but it did anyway. These people needed it.\n“Oh. There is one other matter,” Andross said with obvious relish and a\nsmile. “The much-delayed official wedding of my son to Karris White Oak.\nThis will begin tomorrow. The party will continue for a week. And as a\nspecial additional pleasure, my grandson, Kip, will soon celebrate his own\nlong-delayed official wedding to Tisis Malargos as soon as her family\narrives. As we’ll be celebrating already, I’d like to join my ascension\ncelebration to their parties. Naturally,” Andross Guile said, “you are all\ninvited.”\nHe smiled, and the years sloughed off him as the people roared their\napplause. He actually looked more than surprised; he looked delighted, as if\nthe acclamation was soaking long-dry soil in his heart.\nDazen, obedient token and good son, stood and waved, to even louder\napplause. Kip copied him from across the aisle and got his own applause—\njust as loud.\nThen Karris stood, and then Tisis, and the applause grew louder still.\nDazen grinned at Kip, and saw his son had the same fool grin he did.\nMust run in the family.\n“Not a bad speech, old man,” Dazen said after all those on the platform\nhad recessed off to one of the side rooms.\n“Felia wrote it,” Andross said. “Thirty-eight years ago. Not all of it, of\ncourse. But she told me to give them some reason to cheer at the end.” He\npursed his lips. “She should be here.”\n“She did all she could to make it so the rest of us are,” Dazen said.\nAndross expelled a slow breath at that. He seemed different. They\nwalked together out a rear exit of the hall. They were about to go separate\nways, but now they paused.\nThe new Lightbringer said, “Kip was right, you know: I’m the right\nperson for this time. I know the personalities, the old feuds, the true stories\nbehind family myths, the economies and the familial ties. With help from\nmore handsome and tactful faces, I can bind up these satrapies as no one\nelse could hope to. I know what can be broken and what can only be bent\nslowly. I can make these lands better—safer, stronger, richer, fairer, more\njust, more open, more free. I have perhaps ten years left to my mortal span,\ntwenty if I’m disciplined and fortunate, and I will make this land endure—\nnot fall apart under a weaker personality or less capable hands.”\n“Why are you telling me all this?” Dazen asked.\n“Son, you know how I view vows.”\n“Yes.”\n“This office? I vow to do my best to be worthy of it.”\nDazen nodded his thanks and turned to go."

Not that it will mean anything to you,” Andross\nsaid to his back. His voice lowered. “Not that it should. It shouldn’t. But\nI’m grateful for both of you. Proud of you.”\nFists tightening, Dazen barely suppressed the urge to spin and punch his\nold man in the face.\nYou dare?!\nHe wanted to scream Sevastian’s name in the old murderer’s face for an\nhour. And then Gavin’s name for just as long.\nHe wanted to shout, ‘I gave you my empire; I gave you my victory; you\ndon’t get to have my family, too!’\nBut… it was a step. A tenuous step, beginning a long climb toward\nwholeness for this broken, quarrelsome, ravaged family. Dazen could\nsabotage it now—and goddam but Andross deserved to be pushed into the\nabyss—or he could help. They weren’t going to complete it today or this\nyear. Maybe they never would. Maybe they were too broken. Maybe\nforgiveness was too hard.\nBut he could take one tiny step. Couldn’t he?\n“Well, then—” Andross said, turning away.\n“Thank you,” Dazen said. He couldn’t look back, couldn’t risk meeting\nthe old man’s eyes. That was too much, for today. “Thank you… father.”\nChapter 150\nAfter the ceremony, Kip went to the infirmary and spent some time with his\nold Nightbringers who were wounded, bringing comfort and cheer where he\ncould. Not all the living were well, but they were all being tended to\nadmirably.\nWith that realization, he made to where two more wounded awaited him:\nTeia and Ironfist.\nAt the lifts on the way there, Kip was surprised to find Ferkudi, Ben-\nhadad, Winsen, and Big Leo. They’d been waiting for him.\n“Where’s Tisis?” Big Leo asked.\n“Taking care of the real work so I can goof off with you layabouts,” Kip\nsaid. He smiled. “It’s good to have all of us together again. Most of us, I\nshould say. Dammit. Sorry.”\n“No, you’re right. Cruxer should be here,” Ben-hadad said. He\nswallowed.\n“And Goss,” Ferkudi said. “And Daelos.”\n“And others,” Big Leo said. “Lots of others.”\nIn the battle, they’d all proven themselves heroes. But Kip hadn’t\nneeded a battle to show him that.\nThey made it to the private room Teia and Ironfist were sharing. It was\nguarded by an honor guard of Tafok Amagez and the new Mighty and the\nBlackguards. After knocking, Kip stepped inside the door, then slipped\nthrough the black curtains, careful not to let in any light that might kill Teia.\n“You in here?” Kip asked, not really serious.\n“Sadly,” Teia said. “Some old guy keeps telling me stories about the\nglory days or something.”\n“If I could move, I would so kick your ass for that,” Ironfist’s voice said."

At least he still had that.\n“It’s so dark in here,” Ferkudi said. “Why doesn’t someone—”\n“Ferk, no!” Kip said, but he was too late.\nFerkudi threw open the curtains. The day was blinding bright. Ironfist\nflinched, and Teia shrank back, throwing her hands over her eyes.\nBut then nothing happened.\n“Well, I guess that answers how long that lacrimae sanguinis stays\nactive,” Kip said.\nThen Teia collapsed.\n“Oh, no!” Ferkudi said. “What happened?!”\n“You idiot!” Ben-hadad shouted. “What have you done?!”\nThen Teia suddenly grinned, and Kip noticed that she was wearing black\neye caps over her eyes. She reached over to her bedside table, though, and\nplaced two slightly-less-unsettling leather eye patches over them.\n“Orholam’s hairy butt crack, Teia,” Ferkudi said. “You nearly stopped\nmy heart.”\nThey all looked at him, incredulous.\nWinsen said, “You do realize that’s the opposite of what just happened,\nright? The literal opposite.”\nFerkudi looked back at them for a moment, then, chagrined. “Oh. Oh, I\nmean… sorry, Teia. I wasn’t thinking.”\n“I really missed you, Ferk.” She sat up and hugged him. “But that hurt\nlike hell, and if I ever get out of here, I’m definitely gonna kick you in the\nstones for it.”\nHe looked uncertain. “Am I supposed to let you do that?”\n“No, you’re supposed to try to stop me. I’m just telling you because I\nknow you can’t.”\nShe grinned then, and Kip could see that she was trying things out,\ntrying to see if she could fit back in with her friends’ old banter. ‘Do I have\na place here?’\nFerkudi looked confused. Did this go in the Box? It was obvious that\nTeia wasn’t going to be out sparring with them anytime soon—if ever—so\nwhere was she going to have a chance to make good on her threat?\nC’mon, Ferkudi, please…\n“Challenge accepted!” Ferkudi said, and Teia’s smile exploded light\neverywhere.\n“So, Winsen,” Ironfist said gruffly. “What’s this I heard about? You\nkilled a bane?”\n“Eh. Wasn’t so hard,” Winsen said. “Sort of embarrassing, actually.\nBreaker told me I had to shoot the crystal. I missed it ten times. Target this\nbig. Only two hundred paces away. Ten misses. Ten.”\nOf course, he was discounting how he’d sneaked and fought his way\nacross the bane—alone, evading hundreds of wights and drafters and\nsoldiers, and killing so many he’d had to start retrieving his arrows and\ntheirs, not to mention saving lives on other bane from his perch."

For a long, perilous time, he’d held the wall\nnearly alone against Dagnu until the astonished locals had rallied to him.\n“Better than I did!” Kip said. “I barely even made it out the front door!”\nThey laughed.\n“Better than I did!” Teia said. “I barely made it out of my room.”\nAnd again.\nThen they looked to Ben-hadad, who painted a disconcerted look on his\nface. He’d saved Einin’s life (she would recover, but was in the infirmary\nnow) and then killed Belphegor and destroyed the yellow bane. “Wow,” he\nsaid, “sounds like you all did terrible. I kicked ass.”\nThey laughed and jeered.\nWinsen said, “Yeah, sure. You know I saved your bouncy butt three\ndifferent times, don’t you, Froggie?”\n“‘Froggie’? Froggie?! Don’t you dare!” Ben-hadad said.\n“It’s the Spring of Doom!”\n“The Leaping Lancer!”\n“It’s the Hopping Death!”\n“Someone save me from the Sprinting Cripple!”\nBen-hadad shook his head stoically, muttering as he realized he simply\nneeded to take his punishment and hope that they didn’t stumble upon a\nnew Name for him.\nFinally, Ironfist said somberly, “You all were… superlative.” He didn’t\nsay ‘unlike me,’ but they all heard it.\nTheir joviality died.\n“Don’t do that,” Kip said. “You were trying to save the Chromeria and\ndestroy the Order before they killed us all. Cruxer fucked up. We know you\ntried.”\n“Maybe if I’d slowed down, he could’ve heard me. I was trying to be\nlike… like Andross Guile, and I should’ve just been me.” Ironfist winced at\nhis pain.\n“You brought an army, a navy, and the best general in the world,” Kip\nsaid. “Without any one of those, we’d all be dead. Truth is, we all failed.\nAnyone here not able to think of something you could have done differently\nthat wouldn’t have saved lives? Anyone?”\nThey shook their heads, one at a time, and some looked away.\n“There’s no shame in it,” Kip said. “Cruxer shouldn’t have gone after\nIronfist. He should’ve been guarding me. Maybe he would’ve saved me\nfrom Zymun and Aram. He failed us, but without him I wouldn’t be\nstanding here. Most of you wouldn’t, either. He was our heart. Sometimes\nyou do your best, and it’s not good enough. That’s why we have each\nother.”"

Ow! Not the chest, off the chest!”\nThey soon headed out—the blast of light from the window had Teia\nsicker than she’d wanted to admit.\nAs they went, Kip realized that in the coming days there was going to be\na lot of swinging between laughing and crying, teasing and mourning,\ntelling stories and sitting silent, hugging and fighting. It was all right.\nNo, it was better than all right; it was good.\nIt’s what families do.\nChapter 151\nWith the normal difficulty of a woman getting married the next morning,\nKarris tried to set her to-do lists aside and enjoy the massage.\nEnjoy massage, dammit.\n“Seems really fast to try to organize a wedding, much less one on this\nscale,” Rhoda said, working Karris’s wrist high over her head with her\nmagical hands. “How are all the details going?”\nKarris sighed, and Rhoda pulled hard on her wrist, extending all the\nmuscles in her arm and shoulder and into her rib cage. “Aha!” Rhoda said.\n“You tricked me into that,” Karris complained. She grunted. “Not. Ow.\nThat I’m complaining.”\n“Extensions today. You really beat the hell out of yourself, didn’t you?”\n“It was a battle, so mostly it was other people beating the hell out of\nme.”\nRhoda tsked. Her hands quickly cataloged the weird places Karris was\nsore, then tapped her tight sartorius. “So, this got this tight from riding? A\nhorse, I mean?”\n“Rhoda!”\nThe loud masseuse laughed. “No, no, good for you two. It is so good to\nsee you happy, High Lady. I’ll be securing your wrists so you can relax your\nupper body while we do these extensions.” She got to it, covering Karris\nwith warm towels as she rolled onto her back. “There’s a bit of a trick to\ndoing this so it won’t leave any hard-to-explain bruises the next day. If you\nwant me to show you or your husband how it’s done…”\nKarris closed her eyes and shook her head, smiling."

If you\nwant me to show you or your husband how it’s done…”\nKarris closed her eyes and shook her head, smiling.\n“I’m sorry, High Lady, I didn’t mean to overstep.” Of course, Rhoda\ndidn’t sound at all sorry. “Try to relax into these.”\nShe told herself that she was the reason they were doing a big wedding\nin the first place. She’d demanded one, way back when. It had seemed like a\ngood idea at the time.\nHaving a few months to plan it probably would have been a good idea,\ntoo. It did make sense, from a political perspective. Andross was showing\nthe big happy family, and using all the love and adoration the people had\nbuilt up for Gavin and Karris, and Kip and Tisis, to add a halo effect of love\nand adoration to his own rule and legitimate himself. Hard to rebel this\nweek when last week everyone saw you smiling with your father.\n“Oh, that’s a little tight,” Karris said.\n“We just have to hold that until I finish this leg,” Rhoda said. But she\ndidn’t work ten or fifteen times down Karris’s left leg as she had on the\nright. Instead she wrapped it up with the scarf and secured it to the table, as\nshe had done with both wrists and her other leg.\nEyes still closed, Karris said, “I guess I can see why people who really\nlike the feeling of vulnerability might—”\n“Aha, see this tension in your neck?” Rhoda said, her fingers massaging\nKarris’s jaw. “Open.”\nKarris opened her mouth. “Rhoda, I think I’m done with this. I’d like—”\nSomething was stuffed into her mouth, and when Karris tried to spit it\nout, her eyes flying open, there was no red for her to draft, no green, and\nthen thick strong fingers jabbed deep into the pressure points behind\nKarris’s ears.\nBefore she could scream, a gag so thick it held her jaw open and tongue\ndown was secured across her face.\nRhoda scrubbed her hands through her wild hair. Her face was tracked\nwith tears.\nKarris bucked against the bonds, but they only tightened. She tried to\nscream, but almost no sound emerged, certainly nothing that would alarm\nthe Blackguards outside the door, who were used to being banished from\nthe room and chided for investigating any little moan of pain.\nVisibly summoning her courage, Rhoda put one hand behind Karris’s\nhead and one under her chin, preparing to snap her neck. Then she stopped.\n“He told me not to talk to you. But you have to know. I don’t want to do\nthis. Everyone spies on the Jaspers. I thought he was just another noble,\nexcept he paid more than anyone. And when he saw I could keep my mouth\nshut, he paid more still. And then I got invited to the parties for the people\nhe trusted… I thought it was all wild parties and free thinkers and free\nspirits, you know? The Order?

Told\nhim I was out. I promised him my silence, and I told him I wouldn’t do it.\nThat I was done.”\nNo. Please, Orholam, no!\nRhoda’s face contorted with grief. “He killed my mother for that! And\nnow he’s holding my brother. The only family I’ve got left. He’ll kill him if\nI don’t do this. I’m sorry. I’ll die for this. But it’s what I have to do.”\nRhoda took a deep breath and stepped forward, putting her hand on\nKarris’s chin. Then there was a sound like someone’s back being slapped,\nand hot light flashed from within Rhoda’s chest, bright enough it shone\nthrough her clothes. It burned in flashes up and down her spine, making her\nneck glow.\nFlash-boiled from the inside, her eyes went cloudy gray an instant\nbefore she collapsed out of sight as if boneless.\nA godawful sound of cooking gases hissing out of the entry wound filled\nKarris’s ears. Then the smell of horribly burnt meat and viscera filled the\nroom.\n“Too bad,” Andross Guile said, his face appearing over Karris. He\nsettled the towel primly back in place over her nakedness where it had\nfallen away in her struggles. “I’d really hoped she would talk more.”\nHe loosed her feet, then her hands, and then, as she took out the gag for\nherself, he opened a robe for her, turning his gaze aside.\nIt gave her a moment to collect herself. At first she wanted to hit him or\nthrow something, maybe not at him maybe right at his damn head, what did\nhe think he was doing here, did he think she gave two shits about getting\ndressed when she’d just—Okay, fine, she did care a little about getting\ndressed, what did she even ask first? What the hell he’d done to her friend?\nCould he not have stepped in a little tiny bit earlier? She’d almost had her\ndamn fool neck snapped!\n“How long were you there?” Karris asked, despite herself.\n“I had a suspicion she was the last of them, and you were the most likely\ntarget for Grinwoody’s wrath.”\n“What?! Why would I be his target?”\n“Because I told him you were responsible for destroying the Order.”\nHer jaw dropped. “You set me as bait?”\nHe didn’t bother to answer. “I was hoping she’d say if there were any\nothers left, but you heard her; she’s the kind who kept her mouth shut.”\nThe door exploded open so suddenly Karris almost flipped, and\nBlackguards were suddenly all over the room. They’d smelled the burning\nand heard a man’s voice.\nThe next minutes were filled with the predictable—scouring for other\nassassins, moving Karris and Andross to a secure room, (eventually) getting\nKarris fully dressed again (thank you!), and surely taking care of the body."

I’ll not do her a good turn in return for her treachery. But\nI will send my best men to find her brother, so we can kill the Order people\nholding him. If our people save him as an ancillary cost…” Andross\nshrugged. “Sometimes one must do good in order to obtain what one\ndesires.”\nKarris shook her head. “Wow. You know, once in a while, I think there’s\nsome things you can’t admit about yourself, High Lord. You like secrets, so\nI’m gonna tell you this one.”\n“It won’t be a secret if you tell me,” Andross said as if utterly\ndisinterested, but she didn’t believe it; if he really didn’t want to hear what\nshe was about to say, he’d have interrupted her to talk about something else.\n“Oh, I trust you to keep it quiet,” she said. “It’s this: I think there’s a\nsliver of kindness growing in you. You better watch out for that.”\nHe looked at her critically, nonplussed. “Look at you. Full of hope.\nNaïve despite all evidence and experience to the contrary. Making people\nfeel better about themselves wherever you go. Leaving them eager to be\nwith you, and follow you. You do make an excellent White.”\nKarris held her breath, and when he moved to speak, she interrupted.\n“And I’m going to choose to believe, right now, that the next words out of\nyour mouth are not going to be a clever put-down that undercuts everything\nyou just said.”\nHe grinned wolfishly, eyes glittering. “Of course not,” he said after a\nmoment.\nShe wondered if he’d changed his mind about what he was going to say\nnext, but she couldn’t read anything except amusement in his deep eyes.\n“You saved me,” she said.\n“Mmm.”\n“You didn’t have to. I’m one of the few who can stand in your way now,\nand I’ve showed I will if I think it necessary. You could’ve waited at the\ndoor and listened from there. You could’ve had people seize Rhoda and\ninterrogate her after she killed me. Then you could’ve installed your own\nWhite. It would make your life a lot easier. The assassination of a White? It\nwould have prompted the Spectrum to give you every remaining power that\nyou don’t already have. And don’t tell me it didn’t occur to you.”\nAndross sniffed. He motioned to his new body man, whom Karris didn’t\nrecognize. The slave set down what looked like a ledger book on a side\ntable. “Your wedding present.”\nHe hadn’t answered her question at all. What? Now? A book?\nWith a polite tone and wearing her most pleasant diplomatic expression,\nshe said, “You’re too kind. A book.

Gee, I’ll have to\ncrack that open while I eat my sawdust sweetmeats.\n“You’re young. I know you’ve no interest in it now. But someday you\nmight.

Those would’ve been my two\nquestions… when they occurred to me about an hour from now. So…\nwhy?”\nHe studied her, and his eyes seemed to soften. “Because you’re family.”\nThen he left.\nChapter 152\n“Darling,” Karris said with a note in her voice like he’d just come back\nfrom the bathroom and he’d forgotten to tuck something away.\n“Yes?” Dazen asked, double-checking his clothes. They’d decided to\nprocess forward together. Different satrapies had different traditions on such\nthings, and he’d been nervous that he (being so recently thought dead)\nmight actually get more applause and cheering than she did. Probably a silly\nfear. And Karris wouldn’t have cared if he had. But hell, they were already\nmarried, and they were a team, so they were walking together.\n“Your hand?” she said.\nHe lifted his right hand.\n“The other one. Did you think I wouldn’t notice? What is that?”\nHe looked down at his left hand and wiggled his fingers. “Just think of it\nas a bit of, uh, cosmetics. Surely today of all days, you’re not going to\nobject to a little harmless hex-casting, are you?” he asked.\n“‘Harmless’?” she whispered loudly. “You can’t go out there with a hex-\ncrafted fake hand.”\n“Honey…” he said. And he gave her the most innocently charming\nDazen Guile smile she’d ever seen. Or at least he hoped it was. “I just\ndidn’t want anything about me to distract anyone from you.”\nShe actually blushed, and straightened her dress. It was a gorgeous\nsomething with lots of details that he couldn’t really notice except for the\nfact that they united together beautifully to heighten his eagerness to take it\noff her.\nThen she looked back at him sharply. “Wait… the tooth, too? You did\nnot!”\nHe gave a lopsided grin to bare his dogtooth. “Go on, try to guess.\nDenture or hex?”\n“Honey! I am the White,” she whispered, looking around at the various\nattendants who were trying to give them a few private moments before they\nwent out together. “You can’t—”\n“Relax,” he said. “C’mon, it’s what I said last night, and that worked\nout, didn’t it?”"

He looked at the shut great doors, with\nthe Blackguards ready to open them at their signal. “Shall we?”\n“No, wait,” she said. “I have something for you.”\n“Hmm?”\n“A wedding gift.”\n“A wedding gift? Well, now I feel like the louse,” Dazen said.\n“Don’t worry. At first I planned to give you something truly awful, like\nmake you Nuqaba,” she said.\n“Endless rituals and bumping into the people who burned out my eye in\nthe first place? I’m not sure how happy I could’ve pretended to be about\nthat.”\n“Yeah, I thought it might be too awkward. Too many Guiles at the top as\nit is,” she said.\n“High Lord, High Lady,” a steward said. “Whenever you’re ready. Or…\nthe musicians can loop this song another fifteen times, as you will.”\n“Oooh, I love the sassy ones,” Dazen said.\n“But… now I’m lousing this up because I’m pressured,” Karris said.\n“Anyway, it did make me think of your eye patch. And your eye. All you’ve\ngiven for these satrapies. I couldn’t stop thinking of that Parian metaphor\nabout the evil eye and justice and mercy. And I can’t stop thinking how you\nhad that harsh kind of retributive justice burned out of you. You gave up the\nevil eye. You have no condemnation to give. And I thought there’s\nsomething beautiful in that.\n“And I don’t want people to look away from your eye patch because\nyou’ve been wounded. I want them to see it and be reminded of what you\nsacrificed for them.” She took out a white silk eye patch with subtle\nembroidery, white on white. “I’m having others made. Jeweled ones nearly\nas prismatic as your eyes used to be. Different expressions. I figured I can\nplay dress-up with you every day.” She looked up at him, nervous. “I’m\nkidding. I mean, I am having some made, but you don’t have to wear it if\nyou don’t like it. You don’t have to wear any of them if you don’t like.”\n“I love it.” He took off his black eye patch and closed his eye, ducking\nhis head while she put the white eye patch in place.\n“Ready?” she asked.\nThe great doors opened. They processed forward together, but the cheers\nand the music and the voices were all hushed to Dazen’s ears. These first\ndays with her had been full of such wonder he could hardly believe it. He\nfelt like he was continually being reminded of things he adored about her\nthat he’d somehow forgotten in the time they’d been apart. He felt so\nunited, so whole.\nThey’d wanted to stay up late last night, just talking—so they did.\nTalking, connected, they wanted to make love—so they did. Resting safe in\neach other’s arms, they wanted to tell each other everything, so they did."

Resting safe in\neach other’s arms, they wanted to tell each other everything, so they did.\nIn these first days, conflicts seemed but trifles easily overcome, and all\nthe demands on their time were somehow met, and only heightened their\njoy of reunion at the end of the day.\nThey weren’t children; they knew this was a special time and a fleeting\none, but there was nothing cynical in that recognition, nor at all resigned to\neventual stagnation: they were, simply, in the first great thaw of spring, and\nthey were enjoying the warmth of the sun, without demanding that it never\nrain or snow again.\nThe ceremony went on, with more speakers and more prayers than\nDazen would have liked (one of the trifling conflicts), and he kept stealing\nglances at her as if to memorize every detail of her irrepressible smile.\nThen they faced each other, held each other’s hands, and renewed their\nvows.\nAs they finished, he said, “Do you mind if I maybe show off a little?”\n“Dazen Guile,” she said. “If I was bothered by you showing off, I\nwouldn’t have married you. Twice.”\n“So I had this dream last night,” he said.\n“You’re telling me about this now? We’re supposed to process out.”\n“They’ll wait,” Dazen said. As if twenty thousand people weren’t\nwatching. “So this dream… Orholam was talking to me and He said, He\nsaid that because I asked a boon for others and not for myself, that He\nwanted me to carry a new message for Him in a special way for all those\nwounded and left bereft by this war. He said with Him, sometimes the\nhealing is fast and sometimes it’s slow, and oftentimes it’s not finished\nwhile we still live. But with Him, it’s never, ever partial.”\n“That’s a good message, honey.” She smiled and squeezed his hand. His\nmaimed hand.\nFirst her expression flashed apologetic, then she looked down, confused.\nThat was the hand whose fingers were illusions.\nBut the illusions had held.\n“So yeah,” he said. “I kind of lied? I didn’t really forget my wedding gift\nto you. Orholam’s really?”\n“What!?”\nHe locked his gaze with hers, and as if they were all alone, not in front\nof thousands, he pulled off his eye patch.\nHe’d thought this moment was going to be a gift for her, but instead he\nwas awestruck anew by the unmerited favor he’d been shown. For he didn’t\nsimply see his bride through the new eye as well as he would have seen her\nthrough the old eye he’d lost. He saw his bride through eyes made new. He\nsaw her truly, lit by an unstinting compassionate light, and he knew her\nevery strength and every fight and every wound as he had never known\nthem before, and his heart swelled as if to cover every hurt and rejoice in\nevery joy.\nHis feelings for her had smoldered for most of his life, banked patiently\nas if against his will, a stubborn affliction almost, a strong but by now\nunsurprising love—but now it surprised him, after all, as his love leapt up at\nseeing this divine creation before him, a jewel with more facets and color"

And he squeezed her hand with the hand\nOrholam had made whole.\n“Now, for the fun part,” he said, grinning reckless foolishness. His body\nfelt so full of hope and light he couldn’t contain it. “I’m not sure how this is\ngonna go. Or if, honestly. You ready?” he asked.\nShe didn’t know what he was talking about, but her grip was as strong as\niron and her face was radiant.\n“Whatever it is… Hell yeah!” she said.\nThe high drapes opened and bathed them in Orholam’s light.\nDazen raised his hands and it was as if all the goodness that had been\npouring into him through these days came bubbling out to bless everyone\nhe loved here—and his love had grown a dozen times over—and with skill\nand brilliance and no small amount of audacity, never stopping to consider\nwhether he could really do what he was about to attempt, without giving it a\nlittle test first just in case, but simply believing, as if he were Prism once\nmore, about to dazzle the thousands with spectacle and wonder, he called\nthe colors to him.\nHe called. And they came.\nEpilogue 1\nAn hour before his second wedding, Kip looked in the full-length mirror on\nthe wall of the small parlor and marveled: part of him supposed that most\nanyone could look presentable if they were worked on by the most\ntenacious hairdressers and personal stylists, and he certainly had been\nthrown upon the untender mercies of those predators as they dug for any\nshaking sliver of attractiveness to drag out of its den and into the light to be\ndevoured—but instead his wonder was directed at how he himself saw that\nschlub.\nSeeing himself now, somehow he felt like he saw better than he ever\nhad.\nThe cosmetics, the clothes, the hair, the shaved and lotioned skin, the\nanointing oils, the posture, the dazzling bright colors and pleasing patterns:\nthese were all the lampshades we settle over our light hoping to cast a hue\nand color others will find acceptable. We hope we’ll find it acceptable, too.\nBut others don’t even see that color, for they view us through their own\nlenses, filtering our already-filtered light in ways we can only guess. Nor do\nwe see ourselves true, for we wear our own lenses, and sometimes the eye\nitself is dark, and how great the darkness!\nKip had been so certain for so long that there was nothing he could do to\nmake himself acceptable that he’d hidden his light altogether. The mirror\nhad been an enemy who, overwhelming in his might, had simply needed to\nbe avoided. But the mirror is ever a liar: when you yourself cut out half the\nlight by which you see, how can the mirror be anything but?"

But the mirror is ever a liar: when you yourself cut out half the\nlight by which you see, how can the mirror be anything but?\n‘Let me see my skin, but with no pink tones.’… ‘Oh, how awfully pale\nand ugly I am.’\nWe see others not as they are but as we see. We see ourselves not as we\nare but as we see—and as we are seen, for we each cast our light on each\nother, too. Surrounded by those who cast only brutal light, we see some\ntruth, and sometimes necessary truth, but a lie if we think it all the truth.\nKip had been shedding filters and lampshades for the last few years now.\nBeing stripped of drafting was different, though. It not only changed his\nsight, but it changed the very light he cast in the world. It certainly was\nchanging how people saw him.\nHe’d gone to the Threshing Chamber immediately, hoping his loss might\nbe temporary. But the testing stick had shown nothing. He’d kept it like a\nbad-luck charm: he was a mund.\nOthers had paid more in this war. Others had worse injuries. This burden\nwasn’t going to be easy, and yet… he felt hopeful. As one must wear\nclothing, one must wear shades—clothing itself is one of them!—one must\npresent oneself to the world, and yet he felt that now he could bring more of\nhis light to the world than ever before. He looked now into the mirror and\nfelt, well, approval.\n“Looking pretty good there, soldier,” he said. He straightened his back—\nnot that these clothes let him slouch much—and then he flexed a bit.\nSomeone whistled behind him, and he felt the blood rush to his face. He\nspun.\nIt was Rea Siluz, in a shimmering burnous, a strand of pearls at her\nneck, and a bright galabaya down on her strong brown shoulders. She was\nliterally radiant. Skin bright and luminous, eyes brighter still and\nmischievous. A smile like a current in a river where you thought, ‘That’s a\nnice smile,’ and then suddenly you were three leagues downstream\nwondering what had happened. Every part of her was beautiful and strong\nand potently feminine, and the sum was more than its parts.\n“Wow! You’re just—wow!” Kip said. He suddenly understood why\npeople had worshipped the immortals.\n“I didn’t want to underdress for your big day. Still…” She seemed to\ndim a bit. A couple of smile lines appeared, and her teeth suddenly seemed\nless than perfectly straight, and her proportions shifted slightly. “Better?”\n“Perfect for starting a riot,” Kip said.\nShe sniffed. “Here you said you loved a spectacle.” But she shifted still\nfurther, until she looked like the prettiest mother in the city rather than in\nthe history of the world.\n“You came,” he said, smiling broadly. His heart welled with\nappreciation. “I wasn’t exactly sure how to send you an invitation. The\nluxiats looked at me funny when I asked.”\n“It’s a big day. Days of profound healing capture our attention as much\nas days of war.”"

But I have to admit, I’m still not really\nsure why I’m doing this. I’m—well, look,” Kip said. He picked up the\nThreshing testing stick and showed its lack of colors to her. “I’m not even a\ndrafter now. Not a satrap—oops, missed that bet, I guess. Not a king. Not,\nnot anything. And don’t get me wrong, I’m pretty much delighted just to be\nalive, but I don’t really understand doing the whole big-spectacle-wedding\nthing.”\n“It’s not really for you,” Rea Siluz said.\n“And if you’re going to get married a second time, don’t you usually go\nmore casual rather than more formal?” Kip asked. The entire island was\ncelebrating the party of a century. “Seven days! Do you know I have to give\nfour speeches, and that was with me winning the argument about how many\nI had to do!”\n“Kip. It’s not for you.”\nKip knew it wasn’t only for Gavin and Karris, and certainly not for the\nmuch-lesser-known Kip and Tisis. It was a celebration of victory, and of\nlife. It was as necessary as midwinter festivals amid the chill and death of\nevery year. The people had mourned, and now was time to celebrate.\n“So I had this question,” Kip said.\n“About me running away when you faced Abaddon,” Rea said.\n“Well, I wouldn’t put it that way,” Kip said. He paused, then admitted,\n“Out loud.”\nShe laughed. She’d apparently forgotten to tone down the beauty of that\nsound.\n“You said once that you were less than he had been but more than he\ncurrently is. I kind of took that to mean you’re more powerful than\nAbaddon.”\n“Kip, our power isn’t measured by numbers in a ledger.”\n“But… I didn’t really misunderstand, did I?”\n“No,” she admitted.\n“And you don’t lie, do you?”\n“Oh, my little Guile bulldog. Next you’re going to ask—”\n“Why did he kick your ass?” Kip said.\n“Why indeed?” she asked as if baffled.\nOr as if teasing him.\nKip cocked his head as the possibility dawned on him. “You… you\ndidn’t.”\nShe nodded.\n“You let him win?” Kip asked, outraged.\n“I prefer to put it that I wagered on you, Kip. Yes, I had the power to\npush him out of your world for a time, but only you could bring him fully\ninto it and thereby make him vulnerable to being banished from this world\nforever.”\n“Well… dung,” Kip said. “I mean, well done.”\n“Good job, little one. Controlling that tongue will be harder for you than\nkilling ‘gods’ ever was.”\n“Hold on. You’re not going to leave now, are you? This feels like\ngoodbye. Before this torture of a wedding, too.

Every\nmoment I am with you is a moment I cannot be elsewhere in the other\nrealms. My liege has few warriors as gifted as I.”\n“Is that an answer, or a dodge?” Kip asked.\n“A dodge,” Rea admitted happily. “But don’t worry, my tenacious\nTurtle-Bear, it is granted to me that I may come to you in your moments of\ndeepest need. You see, Kip, you are the mirror in blood of my own deepest\ntemptation.”\n“Huh? That doesn’t sound good.”\n“When the Thousand Worlds were young, many of my dear brothers and\nsisters fell. Much is given to us, as the first created of the Am. But we have\nno bodies, though we can filter our light such that we put on bodies for a\ntime. But we don’t experience a body as an organizing principle of our\nselfhood, as you do. We are not given in marriage. We have no children.\nThus, even as your kind wish to taste our powers, never realizing the costs\ntherein, so our kind thirst for what you humans have that’s denied to us. The\nrebels among us promised us that we could have it all, that we could\ntranscend the bounds laid out for us. And in some things, they did not lie,\nthough they knew not all the truth, and spoke less. My great temptation was\nto be a mother, as you mortals experience such things. Motherhood is a true\nand good and beautiful thing. How could one impugn such a desire?! I\nthought. A true and good and beautiful thing—reserved for others? What an\noutrage! This I longed for: to be a demi-creator, to be all the source of\nsustenance and love to one utterly dependent on me. To experience the\nunquestioning love of a babe looking up from the breast, though\nunknowing, utterly dependent, utterly sated, utterly adoring? It is a true\nlove, a mother’s. It is godly and good—but it is a love and gift and burden\nmeant for mortals, not my kind. I was tempted to covetousness, because\nhere was a love denied me. Who could deny me love? If He denied me this\nlove, He must not love me. Was that not the work of a tyrant? Surely the\nName above Names was holding out on me.\n“Rather than apprehending my pain according to the Love I knew, I\napprehended His love according to my pain. Thus misapprehending, my\npain threatened to turn His no to anger and thence to rage and thence to\nrebellion.\n“Each of the elohim were tempted thus, according to our station and our\nweakness. Some weren’t even close to rebelling. I was close, but ultimately\ndid not. I made the right choice, though it has meant sacrifices. I\nvolunteered for you, Kip, but you are so fit for me that I might as well have\nbeen assigned. You are… so much of what I love about mortals. And my\nLord has allowed me to taste as much of human motherhood with you as I\ncan bear. I will be here for parts of today, and I will be there at future"

I will be here for parts of today, and I will be there at future\nmoments of great joy for you, and I will be at your end, if it is at all\npossible.”\n“What do you mean, as much as you can bear?” Kip asked. He was\ntearing up, and he wasn’t sure why.\nShe stopped as if gut-punched, and her glory dimmed palpably. But\nwhen she spoke, it was with a steady, quiet voice. “As human parents do, I\ngot to taste what it means to fail my child.”\n“What?” he whispered.\n“In that closet…” she said, and a grief as potent as all her earlier glory\nflowed from her, palpably darkening the room.\nShe didn’t have to say another word. There could be nothing else she\nwas referring to except that lightless, godforsaken closet where Lina had\nlocked him and gone on her binge, blotting out her cares and worries and\nmind and recollection of her son. The closet where his mother had forgotten\nhim. Abandoned him without food or water to the rats for three days while\nno one noticed. While no one cared to look for him.\nAnd suddenly, Rea was weeping, too, and he knew that she could see\nthat closet right now. He knew, instantly, that she could see it in the present\nmoment, with an immediacy before her eyes that even he could no longer\nfeel. She was seeing Kip screaming as the rats began biting him, as the\nblood poured down his back and as he threw himself against the walls,\nscratching and clawing for an escape that didn’t come. She could see his\nfear turn to terror, turn to despair, turn to madness. She was watching the\npain that would shape and scar his entire life, even now as she spoke.\n“I was supposed to be there, Kip.” She could barely breathe the words\nover her sobs. “I was supposed to save you.”\n“What?” he asked as bitter tears spilled down.\n“I was elsewhere, fighting, doing good. I knew I could get to you in\ntime. But when I entered your time, Gader’el and Suriel were waiting for\nme in ambush. For three days I contended with them while you suffered. I\nwant you to know—and I am allowed to say this much—I wasn’t with you.\nBut He was. When I arrived to save you, He was already there.”\n“But He did nothing,” Kip said as he wept, the wound opening afresh.\n“He spoke to you.”\n“No. I was alone.” But Kip could remember it now. A few words only, in\nthe many hours. A few calm words, but they’d kept his sanity.\n“Kip. What if, in your darkest moment, He was there, all along, weeping\nwith you?”\n“If He saw me, if He cared, He could have saved me. He could have\nsaved me with a word.”\n“Indeed. And that’s the problem, isn’t it?”\n“What? ‘Indeed’?” Kip asked. “What does that even mean? I don’t\nunderstand Orholam at all.”\n“If even we could, I don’t think my friends would have rebelled. What I"

What I\nknow is this: A tapestry made of only white threads is perfect, but blank.\nWhen He starts letting us add our own colors, things get more interesting.”\nKip scoffed. “Color metaphors are a little bitter for me at the moment,”\nKip said, holding up the blank color stick again. Then he shrugged as if he\ndidn’t care. “I prayed that He would help me escape that place.”\n“And you did.”\n“I didn’t pray that He’d get me out after three fuckin’ days.”\n“You asked Him to get you out immediately and He said no. I don’t\nknow why, Kip. But I know that sometimes when He says no to our desires,\nHis no is mercy. I envied mothers, Kip, and now, having loved like one, I\nsee how profoundly I’m not built for that blessing and that burden. For we\nimmortals never forget. You Guiles have a miraculous memory—a gift of a\nredeemed sin from one of my kind deep in your ancestry—but we\nimmortals carry all our memories before us at all times. I experience it as\nthe present moment, always. My failure and your suffering will never not be\nbefore my eyes.”\nHer compassion was so genuine and so costly that Kip didn’t shoot back\nin anger, but he couldn’t keep the bitterness from his tone. “So there’s some\ngreater good that makes it all fine?”\n“I didn’t say that,” she said. “I can’t answer every tragedy, but I know\nmy Lord’s character and I know His power. I choose to trust Him, and\nthough I’ve doubted that choice at times, I’ve never regretted it.”\n“I suppose I’m the last person who should shake his fist at Orholam,”\nKip said. “Sure, I’ve been through some shit, but look at what I have. I\nshould just shut up forever.” On the one hand, he’d saved his friends, his\nwife, and more thousands than he could know. He had been given his life\nback, when he should be dead. But on the other hand, he’d lost his best\nfriend and many others, and he’d lost his powers and his claim to being the\nmost important person in history.\nWhy, in the darkness, in the quiet, did he keep looking at the wrong\nhand?\nHer tone was gentle. “He doesn’t want you to shut up, Kip. I know\nyou’re not thinking just about the closet. You’re scared that you lost your\nidentity when you lost your magic, and even though you chose this, it still\nhurts. You’re still scared, despite everything.”\nKip scowled. So much for nonchalance. “Stop… understanding me and\nstuff.”\n“Kip. It’s okay to be angry.”\n“I feel ungrateful,” Kip said. “Greedy. I’m alive! Cruxer’s not. I’ve got it\namazingly great, and I did the right thing, and people love me—but\nsometimes all I can think about is what I’m never going to be.” He must’ve\npressed his fingers against that testing stick a hundred times, praying\nstupidly, blindly."

Not sure if my assignment to her is a\nreward or a punishment for how I’ve done with you.”\n“Bit of both?” Kip said.\nShe looked up for a moment, and he got the impression again that she\nwas seeking permission for something.\n“Don’t blink,” she said, grinning suddenly at him.\nRea Siluz’s figure shimmered, and burst into something other. She didn’t\nget any bigger, but suddenly the room seemed to strain to contain her\nessence. To look at her carried a sensation for the eyes like when the ear\nhears a perfect harmony reverberate with overtones and undertones as the\nwaveforms dance in joy. She was brighter than color, more alive than the\nsun on green grass. She wore black dragon’s-scale armor etched with\ndesigns in fire, and a helm of gleaming gold, and her eyes shone with\nlavender mischief. Her presence had a physical weight to it, like walking\nfrom a cool basement into the anvil of the desert sun. Kip dropped to the\nfloor.\n“I told you I love a spectacle,” Rea said, and she smiled fiercely, and that\nsmile was terrifying and sexy and breath-suckingly, knee-weakeningly, eye-\nblindingly bright; it was a flame that beckoned on a cold night and a fire\nthat burned like a forge.\nKip’s tongue failed him. He averted his eyes. He had to. The very room\nseemed more alive in the light of her presence. He nodded at the floor.\nI remember.\nI didn’t take it seriously.\nHoly shit.\nShe flared golden wings out broader than the room; they went right\nthrough the walls. There was a hum of gathering energy. Then she beat\nthose enormous wings once and shot out of the world.\nSlowly, he stood up and dusted himself off.\nAlways fooling around with people—people?—he shouldn’t. One of\nthese days that was really going to bite him in the ass. He saw the testing\nstick on the floor. He’d knocked it down as he fell. He reached over and\npicked it up.\nFor an instant, the testing stick’s edge seemed to flash green like a quick\nwink at sunset. Kip scowled.\nHe looked at it more closely, but there was no color in the ivory. None.\nHe pressed his finger on the stick again.\nNothing.\nMust have imagined it.\nEpilogue 2\nThe dawn prayers atop the red tower had concluded.

But the\nmoment their feet touched the stairs, they immediately broke into happy\nconversation, eager to dive into days full of instruction and labors mental,\nspiritual, and—as the Jaspers needed workers for repairs and healing—quite\nphysical.\nA few worshippers and contemplatives remained, huddled in warm\nlayers against the early morning’s cool wind, hoping to hoard a treasure of\nquiet calm in their hearts against the chaos of the coming day.\nTeia was here on her physicker’s orders, sitting with her father. Every\nday she was supposed to try to last one minute closer to dawn before\nshielding her eyes once more behind layers of leather and her pitch-black\nspectacles. She couldn’t even make it halfway to dawn yet, but it was good\nto sit beside her father.\nHer physicker’s hope was that her contracting pupils would break down\nthe crystals of the lacrimae sanguinis slowly so that the poison might be\nworked out over months without killing her. In the meantime, contracting\nagainst the hard crystal matrices would help her keep her eyes from\natrophying so that she wouldn’t be blind when the poison did dissipate. He\nsaid ‘when,’ but she’d heard the ‘if’ he was hiding.\nWhat it actually meant was that she felt incredible pain and nausea every\nday, to the point where sometimes she hoped to die.\nReally, they had no idea whether it would work and she’d be\nrehabilitated, or if they were simply daily tearing open again a wound that\nwould otherwise heal.\nEven if it worked, she had a long, long road ahead of her. She most\nlikely would never work for the Blackguard again.\nSo now she was on the disability dole, like a Blackguard who’d had a\nlimb blown off. Her injuries weren’t visible, weren’t debilitating in the\nsame way, but she was just as useless to the Blackguard. A sudden flash of\nlight—such as, oh, every single time someone drafted, or lit a lantern, even\nthe flash of sunlight on steel—might kill her. Even if it didn’t, it could blind\nher permanently, and it would definitely incapacitate her as she seized up,\nvomiting.\nSo she was forced to wear impossibly dark spectacles and the eye\npatches over both eyes.\n“Baba,” Teia asked, “what are you supposed to do with a bird with\nbroken wings?”\nHe put his hands on her shoulders, and when he finally spoke, there was\na hitch in his voice. “I don’t know what you’re supposed to do. But I would\nhold her. Just hold her.”\nAnd so he did, embracing her silently, not trying to fix anything. He was\nnot, perhaps, a great man who shook the pillars of the earth, but he was her\nfather, and for today at least, for this hour, his embrace blunted the jagged\nblack edges of her hellstone thoughts.\nHe held her as she cried, and in some deeply aching, wordless place\ninside her, just a little, something thawed.\nFinally, she cleared her throat and said, “Come on, Baba. We’ve gotta go\nget ready soon so we can be there when Kip and Tisis get married. Again.\nNobles are weird.”\nHer father grunted. “So… do I have to thank Kip for sending those"

Again.\nNobles are weird.”\nHer father grunted. “So… do I have to thank Kip for sending those\nbandits to find me and save me from the Order before I can punch him in\nthe nose for breaking my little girl’s heart? Or can that wait until\nafterward?”\n“Baba! Don’t you dare! And he didn’t break my heart. I’m fine. And\nthose men aren’t bandits… anymore. Daragh’s men were the only ones\ndisreputable-looking enough to get into that neighborhood without raising\nany eyebrows.”\nBut they’d barely started heading inside when someone barked from the\nstairs, “Hey! Shithead!”\n“Excuse me?” Teia’s father asked.\n“Not you. That stunted little crotch fruit of yours,” Winsen said. “Hey,\nlayabout! Sluggard! The hell you doin’ up here still?”\n“What are you talking about?” Teia asked. “This is what I’ve—”\n“Training?” he said as if she were as dumb as a bag of rocks. “I know\nyou’ve got a nice gig here, getting fat and fartin’ around with daddy. No\ndisrespect, buddy—though I’m not sure why I oughta respect you. You\nclearly have none for yourself or you’d not have spawned our navel lint of\ndoom here.”\n“Wh-what?” Teia’s father said.\n“Teia,” Winsen barked, “vacation’s over!”\n“You flea-bitten, pox-eaten son of a whore!” Teia said. “You shit-licking,\nvomit-slurping, fart—er, sorry, Baba. Winsen, you know—”\n“Oh,” Winsen interrupted. “Shit. Right.” Something hit her chest. She\nsnatched it out of the air before it hit the ground. At least she still had her\nreflexes.\n“What’s this?”\n“Here, come inside.”\nInside, where it was much darker, Teia examined them in paryl.\nThey were glasses—no, more like small goggles, barely more than eye\ncaps connected at the bridge of the nose. She shed her dark spectacles and\neye patches, keeping her eyes shut tight, and put them on. She frowned.\nThese new eyepieces had wide, curving lenses to preserve her peripheral\nvision, but otherwise fit tightly to the angles of her face perfectly, with\nleather cushions blacking out light from the sides or below. But the lenses\nwere clear.\nNot helpful.\n“What’re these?” Teia asked.\n“This is the fun part,” Win said, and he smacked the frames at her\ntemples.\nShe cried out as tiny spikes stabbed into her skin and the lenses suddenly\ndarkened.\n“What are you doing?!” Teia’s father demanded.\n“I told ’em we should cut you loose like so much deadwood,” Winsen\nsaid, “but Ben-hadad and Breaker been working on this all week.

They\ncopied some ideas from Breaker’s old spectacles, which were supposedly\nmade by Lucidonius himself or whatever. Then they added some new tricks.\nThese’ll darken or lighten almost as fast as your own eyes can dilate or\nconstrict—and you won’t even have to think about it. There’s, ehh, maybe\nsome slightly or totally forbidden will-casting in there, though you won’t\nhear me telling the tale. They’ll allow you to isolate whatever spectrum you\nwant—including superviolet, which you couldn’t see before, so I guess\nthat’s a bonus? Breaker had to beg Súil to help. She claimed the paryl\nnearly fried her brain.” Winsen shrugged. “Guess that explains what\nhappened to make you the way you are, using paryl all the time. Anyway,\nnow you can see. Without dying.”\nTeia couldn’t breathe. She hadn’t drafted paryl since that night, when\nshe’d used the barest sliver necessary to make the master cloak work—and\nonly for the few moments necessary to attack Liv and later Abaddon. The\nlatter had left her shivering and puking, certain she was going to die. But\nthis… Maybe Teia wouldn’t be able to draft the paryl cloud that made her\ninvisible to even sub-red drafters, but she could suddenly—maybe? maybe!\n—do everything else.\nShe felt like a champion sprinter going from losing a leg to merely\nhaving a limp.\nShe tried to change the spectrum she was seeing. The goggles worked\nflawlessly, instantly, dimming and focusing the light so she could see once\nmore.\nDumbstruck, she glanced at her father—and looked away fast.\nHe was blubbering. Oh hell, she was gonna lose it, too.\n“I dunno,” Winsen said, resigned. “I voted against taking you back. But\nthe others said, ‘It isn’t a vote, Winsen. Once you’re one of the Mighty,\nyou’re one of us forever, Winsen.’ Bah!”\nOh, nine hells.\nHer boys. Her brothers hadn’t forgotten her. As she’d been blind, they’d\nseen her. As she’d been in the dark, they’d found her. They’d known.\nThey’d understood. As she’d pulled away, they’d pursued her. They’d all\nbeen working to restore her. They’d saved her, body and soul. Her brothers\n—abrasive, idiotic, absentminded, cranky, wonderful, beautiful, brilliant,\nsteadfast, and self-sacrificing as they were—her brothers had worked\ntirelessly to make her whole.\n—And then they’d sent Winsen to give her the news. He was the worst!\nA sharp little laugh burst from her lips. Winsen! Of course it had to be\nWinsen. Because they couldn’t treat it like it was a big deal.\n“Win?” Teia said.\n“Yeah?”\n“You know, for the longest time I used to think you were an asshole.”\n“Oh yeah?” he said, waggling his eyebrows. “And now?”\n“Oh, I still do.

I just used to, too.”\nEpilogue 3\nDazen waved his empty hands around the corner before he entered the\nhidden room. “Please don’t shoot,” he said. “It’d feel ridiculous to die now\nin some silly accident.” He poked his head around the corner.\nIronfist lowered the flintlock unsteadily, grumbling, “What makes you\nthink it’d be an accident?” He looked like what he was: a man who’d\nrecently lain on the brink of death. They’d hidden Ironfist away in Murder\nSharp’s old lair.\n“Aren’t you supposed to be somewhere?” Ironfist asked. Maybe he’d\njust woken.\n“No. It’s all fireworks and celebrating now. Kip and Tisis are good and\nhitched. Re-hitched? Anyway, I’d just be a distraction right now. Don’t\nwant to steal the spotlight.”\n“Still got the old magic, don’t you?” Ironfist said. Then his brow\nfurrowed. “Poor choice of words.”\nDazen waved it away. He came in, ignoring Ironfist’s frown at the big,\nwrapped-up sword he was carrying. “So, are you enjoying your time… uh,\nresting, or do you have one more adventure in ya?”\n“Weddings and hobbling around watching sycophants rush to kiss the\nroyal… ahem, ring isn’t exactly an adventure.”\n“You seem to be forgetting what happened the first time I tried to marry\nKarris. You know, when our eloping somehow turned into the Prisms’\nWar?”\n“I actually did mean to come to Kip’s ceremony,” Ironfist confessed.\n“How long have I been here?”\n“Long enough for Gill to get bored watching you sleep.”\n“That’s not really an answer,” Ironfist said.\n“Well, you didn’t answer me, either.”\nThe two men stared at each other. Then Dazen waggled his eyebrows.\nThey both knew Ironfist was a man of action. He had to be bored out of his\nmind. He wasn’t in any shape for a battle of wills. “What’s the adventure?”\nIronfist asked grudgingly.\n“Epic derring-do. Legendary opponents. And total secrecy. Even\nafterward. I expect you to be too weak and say no, but I thought you’d be\nfurious with me for going to face so much danger without asking you. ‘I\nwould have come,’ you’ll say later. ‘If you’d waited for me, you’d still have\nyour legs,’ you’ll say. Pfft.”\n“Have I ever told you that you’re a real piece of… work?” Ironfist\nasked.\n“Look, they told me you were cranky, and I knew you were going to be\ntoo weak to come. But I just knew someone would be mad if I didn’t at least\nask my old friend along.”\n“Friend?” Ironfist asked. He swallowed, but then growled, “I don’t even\nlike you.”\n“A sadly common malady among my friends,” Dazen said.\nIronfist laughed despite himself, then winced at his wounds. “Orholam’s\nbeard, mercy.”\n“You know what I came for?” Dazen said."

It’s yours anyway. Always\nplanned to give it to you.” Ironfist pulled open a drawer on his bedside table\nand tossed a white stone tied on a leather thong to him.\nDazen caught the white luxin and looked at the lambent stone, then\nlifted his white eye patch and stared at it more. “I really drafted this at\nGarriston, huh?”\n“Why’re you still wearing the eye patch?” Ironfist asked.\n“It’s a bit intense to see everything without it. Maybe I’ll be able to build\nup some tolerance to it eventually, but for the time being it looks like I’m\ngoing to have to labor under the burden of having a slight aura of mystery\nabout me.”\n“You can make anything look good, can’t you? It’s annoying. Not to\nmention the getting-healed-instantly thing. Everything works out for you,\ndoesn’t it? No wonder you don’t have friends.”\n“It’s true, there’s just not many people with the ego strength for it. That’s\nwhy I’ve had to go for pirates and prophets and beautiful women and\nBlackguards and traitors and kings. Sometimes traitorous kings even—king,\nreally. Singular. Don’t want to exaggerate. The other king wasn’t as friendly\nas you are.”\nIronfist only shook his head.\n“I figured it out,” Dazen said.\n“‘It’?”\n“History.”\n“A suitably humble claim.”\n“Not all of it. Just the relevant bits,” Dazen said. He took out the sword\nfrom where he’d propped it carelessly on the ground and unwrapped the\ncloths around it.\nIronfist goggled at it. The Blinding Sword didn’t look at all the same as\nhe remembered. A dark, molten and shimmering iridescence swept down\nthe entire blade. There was a depth to it, like staring into the night sky, with\nall the colors of creation seen twinkling in the muted seven stars on the\nblade. Entire sections of it dulled though as it turned, as if it were covered\nin a polarizing lens.\nDazen started tapping the white luxin on the blade, then on the pommel.\nHe rubbed it down its length like a whetstone.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Well, she told me not to draft or I’d draw the wrong kind of attention.\nNot that I’m eager to draft just now. You ever run a long race and it wipes\nyou out, and then a few days later you think you’ve recovered and you run\nagain and then you realize, no, you really, really haven’t recovered? That’s\nhow I feel about drafting right now. Like I don’t know if I tore some\nmuscles or if they’re really tired, but either way, I hurt like hell.”\n“What are you talking about?” Ironfist said. “Who told you not to draft?\nWhat ‘attention’?”\n“I’m trying to awaken the white luxin in the sword. I know it’s there.”\nHe stared up at the ceiling. “C’mon, you told me white luxin isn’t overcome\nby black.”"

I know it’s there.”\nHe stared up at the ceiling. “C’mon, you told me white luxin isn’t overcome\nby black.”\nHe tossed the chunk of white luxin to Ironfist, then passed him the\nsword. “Here, you try.”\n“Try what?” Ironfist demanded, but before the words were out of his\nmouth a scintillating shine flashed down the length of the blade in every\ncolor. The muted seven stars surfaced through the darkness and now shone\nas hot in the blade as Orholam’s Eye at noon. In the light of the blade, every\ncolor in the room suddenly glowed brighter, sharper, and more real.\n“Great! That’ll do,” Dazen said. He took the sword from Ironfist’s limp\nhand and quickly wrapped it back up in the cloths, as if worried someone\nwould see it, though there was no one else in the room, and no windows,\nand no one who even knew where it was hidden.\n“Huh,” Dazen said, now that it was fully covered once more. “Guess\nthat’s what I get for thinking I’m so special. Good job. You can probably\nput away the white-luxin chunk now. It might draw attention, too. They\nweren’t terribly specific.”\n“Who?” Ironfist looked at him, but he looked more troubled than in awe.\n“What have we just done?”\n“Not ‘we.’ You. You just fixed the sword. It’s what I figured out. Before\nVician’s Sin, drafters used to retire. The Knife passed through a drafter’s\nheart, purging her of the buildup of toxic luxin but also taking away her\ndrafting. You ever hear about this?”\n“Some.”\n“Between the drafter’s conscience and the Prism’s judgment and\nOrholam Himself, other things might happen: a blue drafter who’d misused\nhis Color would find himself blind to blue, where one who’d used his Color\nwell might find himself granted more drafting ability even than before—\neven more years, or an additional color. A faithful artist might find herself\nmade a superchromat, or a traumatized woman might find her memories\neased or even erased. And lastly, some few would be judged worthy of\ndeath for what they’d done with their gifts. And the sword would then blind\nthem to all color forever—or to all light forever, with death. It prefigured\nthe final judgment of the afterlife, not only for drafters but also for those\nwho watched, and they called it the Freeing, because once judgment is\nrendered, we’re freed from fear, and because so often mercy prevailed. You\nknow about Vician’s Sin now?”\n“The others told me, yeah.”\n“After Vician’s Sin, the white luxin went dormant in the blades—all of\nthem. The Knives would still kill and steal, but unbalanced by white, the\nKnife almost always killed, and it never gave gifts. Orholam sent prophets\nto call the Chromeria to repent, but they beat and killed the prophets, and\nwhen Vician finally died, the Chromeria began murdering innocents in\norder to make their own Prisms and to cover up their sins.

The stories kept\nleaking out, so they commissioned their most fanatical as luxors to suppress\nthe truth, even wielding black luxin to erase lines from books and from\nmemories. Handling the black luxin repeatedly corrupted the luxors more\nthan they already were, whereupon the purgers themselves were purged and\nthe crime deemed complete.\n“The Chromeria henceforth was a house of hypocrisy, its jealousy for\npower held side by side—sometimes within the same heart—with all its\nacts of mercy and tending to the indigent and sick.”\n“And you think we just fixed it?” Ironfist asked.\n“We? You.”\n“Why me? I didn’t do anything!”\n“Despite all your doubts, you held on to the white luxin, didn’t you?”\n“Doesn’t seem like enough, does it?” Ironfist rubbed his lower lip. “You\nreally believe Orholam intervenes personally?”\nDazen snorted. “How’s your prayer go? ‘God hears. God sees. God\ncares. God saves’? I more than believe it now. I know it.”\nIronfist looked away. “Do you know this word ‘ebenezer’?”\n“What’s that, Old Abornean… some kind of stone?”\n“The word’s Old Abornean, but the practice is ours. Means ‘rock of\nremembrance.’ When a great event happened in our communal life, we\nwould set up a stone there so we’d be reminded every time we saw it. A\ngreat event in our own lives might even necessitate replacing our name. My\nbirth name, Harrdun, means ‘gazelle.’”\n“Let me guess, ‘rhinoceros’ was already taken?” Dazen asked.\n“If you’re going be so you, I’m gonna need more poppy.”\n“Fresh out,” Dazen said. It wasn’t true, but he needed Ironfist sharp for\nwhat they were going to do next. “Please, go on.”\n“After… a race I did, they called me Izdârasen Winaruz.”\n“They gave you a double name for a race? Must have been some race.\nWhat’s it mean?”\nIronfist seemed reluctant, but said, “‘He Carries His Hope with the\nStrength of a Lion.’ But, you know, that’s way too long to ask the trainers to\nshout at a Blackguard scrub—”\n“And it was a Parian double name, so everyone would have known you\nwere a big deal. For winning a race.”\n“We didn’t win,” Ironfist said. “Anyway, it was a burden, so I welcomed\nit when they named me Ironfist. Not too flashy, not too original, but solid. I\nwanted to be hard enough to protect those I loved, because I didn’t believe\nthat Orholam cared about me. I’d accepted early on that I wasn’t important\nenough to attract the attention of the maker of all things. So I remade\nmyself into one who would be strong, and one who would be important.

I had to become the best. So I did. But to save them, I lost them.\nAnd myself.\n“Then that day at Ruic Head, He spoke to me. Orholam Himself. He\nhelped me. Helped me in war. I had turned myself into someone utterly\nworthy of rejection, but He accepted me. He saw. He reached out his hand\nto save me, and I took it, and I… then didn’t acknowledge it in the days\nafter that battle. I didn’t come clean. Didn’t change my name or my life. I\nwas too embarrassed. I had too much to lose—like the Magisterium in your\nstory, after Vician was dead.\n“I knew, at the very least, that confessing would mean I would lose my\nposition as commander. Even self-confessed, an Order traitor as the\ncommander of the Blackguard? Unthinkable. Would Andross Guile be\ncontent with less than my head? And then, how would I blunt the\nChromeria’s rage with my sister? What about the Order’s? I… I had to\nthink it through.\n“But I didn’t. Not really. I simply fell back into my old ways, telling\nmyself I’d come clean soon—and then I lost it all anyway. And when my\nuncle was there, right in front of me, and all he asked for was the black\nbane… Though he is what he is, he was the last family I had left. I obeyed\nhim from sheer habit. And then I left, ashamed. And then my brother died,\nand I learned he’d been trying to save me for all those years, to stitch back\nto wholeness a man split down the middle—while himself so wounded and\nguilt-stricken from Aghbalu. He served, for me. I damned myself by\nseeking vengeance and to save my sister’s life. I saved her life, but I lost her\nsoul and mine. My brother served humbly instead, and somehow I missed\nhim for all those years. Right beside me, standing faithfully in a blind spot\nso large I missed the best thing around me. I had my chances to turn around.\nAnd with every one I didn’t take, I brought a little more hell to earth. I even\nkilled my best student, a young man like my own son. It’s too late for me,\nGuile.”\n“Maybe Orholam has something to say about that?” Dazen said,\ngesturing to the sword Ironfist had just fixed.\n“I can’t explain that! But look, I can’t make up for what I’ve done. The\nmisery I caused in my arrogance.”\n“You’ll never balance the scales,” Dazen agreed. “So what?”\n“I… I don’t follow.”\n“Becoming a good man’s easy.

By\nyour logic, because he couldn’t take away all the misery he caused,\neverything he did in the years between that massacre and his dying—\nincluding his dying for Kip and those boys—all of it was worthless.\nBecause he couldn’t balance the scales.”\n“I never said that.”\n“You’re measuring yourself by a standard that’d make you furious if\nanyone used it on your own brother.”\n“It’s not the same thing.”\n“My point exactly.

Ironfist, you’re a liar and a\ntraitor and an apostate and a pagan, a man who ordered murders and a\ncoward. So that’s a little rich, isn’t it?”\nAngry clouds gathered in Ironfist’s brow, but they sat there and then\nreceded some as Ironfist nodded.\nDazen said, “Arrogance is a ladder, and your ladder got you to the top of\nthe mountain. The top of the Blackguard. You know what you find on\nmountaintops? An amazing view—and no life. No food, no water, no\nshelter, no companionship. Maybe it’s time you come down.

And we really need him as trainer with\nthe state the ’guard is in.”\n“You’re asking me to be the commander of the Blackguard again?”\nDisbelief.\n“Seems like.”\nIronfist’s jaw tightened with suppressed emotion. “There are others who\ncan do the job.”\n“Oh, I know, you’re not that special,” Dazen said. “But I already offered\nit to all of them. Every last one said they’d love the job, but they’d rather\nserve under you instead. Threatened to resign en masse if you didn’t get it,\nactually. So if you don’t take the post, the Blackguard is finished. It’ll be a\nhundred years before it recovers. If ever.”\nIronfist’s lips compressed, and his forehead tightened. He whispered,\n“They didn’t really…”\n“They did. But honestly, I don’t think they like you that much. I think\nthey just really want a chance to hit you with one of those Blackguard\nNames. You know, one of those sort-of-respectful, more-kind-of-mocking\nthings?”\n“They want to change my Name?”\n“Yeah, I dunno, maybe Ironfist’s too flashy and original for ’em. I don’t\nknow if they conspired on this or what—they’re so insubordinate\nsometimes—but you’d have to accept the new Name if you came back.”\n“Do you know what it is?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Well?”\n“I think they’re gonna call you ‘Rex.’”"

Those little shits!”\nBut the man seemed to glow. He was suddenly soaking all of this up, a\ngreat treasure of joy that he would examine later. His Blackguards meant so\nmuch to him, and that they loved him still was favor he didn’t believe he\nmerited. It was precious to him beyond all words.\nThen he pressed his lips together, and his eyes hollowed. “I miss ’em,”\nhe said. “All of ’em we lost the day you made this.” He gestured to the\nwhite luxin. “And since. My sister. And my brother most of all.”\n“Me, too,” Dazen said quietly.\n“So is that it?”\n“There is a condition,” Dazen said, taking Ironfist’s acceptance for\ngranted.\n“Yeah, I figured,” Ironfist said. “Several, I guessed. You are still a\nGuile.”\nThe truth was, if Dazen hadn’t been at least a little bit of an asshole as\nhe delivered his offer, he knew that Ironfist would get stuck in his own\nhead, and might actually have turned it down. Being an asshole about it\ndirected Ironfist’s gaze outward, to the job, to the people who needed him,\nto the personalities he saw himself needing to rein in.\nBut that was fine. Dazen could pretend to be an asshole when required.\nPretend.\nHe said, “There’s just the one condition—well, for me. A few other\npeople have to sign off on this, and they might really need convincing, but\nyou know what? I am really convincing.”\n“Hadn’t noticed that about you,” Ironfist said.\n“So here’s the thing,” Dazen said as if it pained him. “I need you to get\nup, like, right now, while everyone’s distracted with the big wedding\nspectacle, and come do that thing with me.”\n“‘That thing’?” Ironfist asked, sitting up more in bed. He was trying to\nlook irritated, but Dazen could tell he was on the hook already. A man like\nIronfist needed to be needed, needed to be active, or he’d just die. “You\nmean that adventure? I thought you were joking.”\n“Nope. Has to be you. Has to be now, while everyone’s distracted.”\nIronfist hesitated. “What are you going to do with the Blinding Knife\nwhile everyone’s distracted?”\n“We, you mean. As in ‘What are we going to do?’”\n“No, I meant you. I’m not touching that thing.”\n“Right, agreed. That’s fine. And I meant you’re going to help me get\nthere to do what I have to do. So you can parse that as us doing it or as me\ndoing it while you help me, I mean, whatever floats your—”\n“Gavin!”\n“Dazen.”\n“Whatever!”\n“Well, here’s the thing. You’ve been there, too, like I have. And there’s\nno one else I can trust to not succumb to them. And we’ve only got one"

And regardless of how good I\nlook, I’m not at my full strength, either, so I guess we’ll just be wounded\nwarlords together.”\n“‘Wounded warriors,’ you mean?”\n“Eh, you and me? Come on. We’re a bit more than just ‘warriors,’ don’t\nyou think?”\n“Just shut up and tell me.”\nDazen finally got serious. “It’s now or never. I’ve always been proud,\nHarrdun. I’ve always wanted my greatness to be known, to be\nacknowledged. This? This will be the greatest thing I ever do, and no one\nwill ever know it. That’s my penance. Or at least my way of showing I’ve\nchanged. Maybe you’ll find some penance in it, too.”\n“Gavin,” Ironfist said, low and dangerous. He was halfway out of his\nbed now. “What are we gonna do with the Blinding Knife?”\n“The wedding’s a huge spectacle, not just on the mortal side but this…\nlibrarian? I dunno. One of them who likes Kip has arranged some spectacle\non the immortal side, too. The truth is, both the mortal and the immortal\nspectacles are merely a distraction for two old warlords—one of whom is\nthe last person you’d expect to go all hooded-man-sneaky—to go quietly to\ndo something only they could possibly do, right under the noses of\nhundreds of watching immortals, while hoping that the right half of them\nare watching the wrong thing. We’ll have no allies with us, none. No help\nwhatsoever. It’ll just be you and me, against the eight of them. We’ll take\nthem one at a time, though, at least if we’re lucky.”\n“Wait. Uh-uh. Gavin, you are not going back down to those cells to face\nthose—”\n“Oh, yes I am. And unless you want to explain to my widow afterward\nwhy you made me go alone, Commander, you are, too.” Dazen gave him\nthe big smile that he knew Ironfist hated. “Ironfist, buddy! C’mon!

Few authors\nunderstand the complexities of your job, but thank you for all you do.\nThanks to Bryn A. McDonald for taking on the mammoth task of\nproducing a book of this size and complexity, and to my heroic copy\nediters. (Hi! Yep, I’m totally stetting that!) Thanks to Lauren Panepinto and\nyour team for consistently brilliant covers and so much more besides. No\none finds out what’s in a book if they never pick it up, so pretty much all\nmy success is because of you. (Bring this up the next time you ask for a\nraise.)

I can’t even tell how ingenious you are,\nbecause I are American and thus more polygluttonous than polyglotinous,\nyet I know from my brief, bruising encounters with little Latin and less\nGreek how much effort goes into your work. I do think of you when I write\nplays on words—and usually just laugh. Writing is pain. Should translation\nnot be? (But seriously, sorry for the Gunner chapters.)\nThank you to my beta readers: John, Tim, Elisa, Heather, and John again\nfor also being my gamma reader, and Keith for being my alpha to omega\nreader.\nThank you to my agent, Donald Maass. You have been a tireless\nadvocate and a straight shot of sanity. Thanks to Katie for all the follow-up\ne-mails to foreign publishers and for the continual education on a complex\nbusiness.\nThank you to Simon Vance, my audiobook narrator. With your skills,\nyou bring all the benefits of adding talents together and none of the\ndrawbacks. I am so glad you were brought to this project under false\npretenses.\nThanks to Joseph Mondragon. I came across your synopses of\nLightbringer online and realized to my great chagrin and greater delight that\nthey were better than mine. (Turns out that writing a huge book and\ndescribing briefly what happens in it are different skills. Who’da thunk?) So\nI did what people do on the Internet and stole your work.

That she’d received a note instead of a knife in the back meant the\nOld Man didn’t know (at least for sure) that she was the one who’d\npoisoned the entire Order. That the note had been planted in her very pocket\nsuggested that he had at least one last Shadow.\nAndross had given Grinwoody the chance to run, but he just couldn’t do\nit.\nThat was why she was here, foolish as it was. She had too many friends\nupon whom the Old Man still wanted vengeance.\n“What the hell happened to all of us on Sun Day?” she asked. “I’ve been\ntrying to find out, but everyone’s just claiming it was an act of Orholam. No\none’s telling me anything.”\n“Not even your friend the White?”\n“You know how that infiltration went, don’t you?” Teia said. “I’ve been\ndemoted for being absent without leave. I’ve been lucky to keep my place\nin the Blackguard.”\n“You were at the Feast of the Dying Light,” the Old Man said. “I wasn’t\naware you were invited. You were supposed to be watching Gavin Guile.”\n“I’d just got back. Master Sharp took me to the Feast, just for a bit, he\nsaid. Said I shouldn’t miss out on the holiest day of the year and my first\nchance to drink the bloodwine and see the community I was giving so much\nto serve. Then, afterward, he saved me. He guessed what the poison was\nand told me our only hope to live through it. But he drank too much of it. I\nwatched him die.”\n“As I watched many more,” the Old Man said.\n“What happened?” she asked.\n“One of the high priests betrayed us, a man named Atevia Zelorn. He\npoisoned the wine. He gave his life to betray us. This was his home. He was\nacting, I think, on Karris Guile’s orders. We will have our vengeance soon.”\nTeia cursed as if she hated the White.\nYou just couldn’t run away, could you, Old Man?\n“So what’s the plan?” she asked.\n“We build anew,” the Old Man said. “I still have riches. I still know\nwho’s weak, who can be bribed, who can be blackmailed, who’s fearful,\nwho can be conned or seduced. Best of all, I still have several\nshimmercloaks. You and Aram will be the foundation on which we rebuild\nthe Order.”\n“Aram?!” she couldn’t help but say.\nThe man beside Grinwoody in the dark didn’t speak, but he gave a\nsatisfied, arrogant little grunt.\nGrinwoody spoke for him. “Aram is sharp and bitter and\nunquestioningly obedient—and a better fighter than most people would\nguess, considering. And in a sign that our gods have power beyond the\nChromeria’s knowing, I’ve discovered that Aram is a lightsplitter. You,\nAdrasteia Sharp, my strong right hand, you will train him. You two will be\nour first team of the new era.”"

There were no\nothers. This was the last root of the Order, the last tiny smoldering ember.\n“No,” Teia said. “That’s not how it’s gonna be.”\n“Excuse me?” Grinwoody said. “Young lady, if I have to teach you\nlessons in obedience as I did your master, I—”\n“It was me,” Teia said. “I never left the Jaspers. I told Guile you planned\nto betray him. I killed Halfcock and Aglaia Crassos and Ravi Satish. I\nfollowed Atevia Zelorn, and I poisoned the bloodwine. All of it was me.”\nFull-spectrum light suffused the entire room as Grinwoody hit some\nhidden switch as Aram snapped into a ready position with his spear. The\nlook of black rage suffusing the Old Man’s face was fearsome to behold.\n“Well, now you’ve made a very big mistake. Why would you tell me\nsuch lies? Do you think this is a game?” The Old Man slapped a hand\ndown, triggering something that slapped a bar down over the cloaks\nhanging on the pegs, clicking as it locked them into place. He threw back\nhis hood, released the voice-changing collar. “Aram, kill her if she moves.\nChild, do you want to die?”\n“Oh yes, but not today, I think.”\nHis eyes narrowed. He didn’t believe her. He didn’t think she was\ncapable of all she’d done.\nShe said, “You know, Sharp liked to think of the Order as piranhas. But\nhe told me once that there’s a fish that hunts piranhas. Vampire fish, they\ncall it. Fangs longer than my fingers. Said he never could get those fangs to\nwork in his dentures. Too long to fit in his mouth without stabbing himself,\nhe said. He thought that was appropriate, because though he always\nentertained a fantasy of killing you, he was never willing to bleed to do it.”\n“So you killed Elijah, too?” Grinwoody had his hand under the desk,\nclearly holding a pistol.\n“I found this mask in his workshop. With some help from my friends, I\nfinished it. And now I’m going to finish what Elijah started, and what you\nstarted, too.” She pulled out the alien, skeletal half mask. With leather loops\nover the ears to hold it up, it covered only from the forehead to the upper\nlip. Vampire-fish fangs hooked down from the upper jaw. A black cloth\ndraped below that to conceal the lower half of the face and the neck. The\ncloth was imbued with orange luxin to make an illusion of a skeletal,\nmonstrous neck and a toothy lower jaw snapping up to meet the hungry\nupper fangs.\nTeia said, “You wanted to make me dangerous. I’ve become ever so\nmuch more than that. Do you want to know the biggest secret about my\nshimmercloak?”\nGrinwoody stood, a pistol in each hand, trembling with rage, but he\ndidn’t fire yet. He needed to know. He always had. His eyes shot a glance to\nher shimmercloak, locked to its peg."

        "text": "meet all his needs: physical, social, moral, and spiritual.\nAppendix\nON LUXIN\nThe basis of chromaturgy is light. Those who use this magic are called\n‘drafters’; a drafter is able to transform a color of light into a physical\nsubstance within their body. Each color luxin has its own properties, but the\nuses of those building blocks are as boundless as a drafter’s imagination and\nskill.\nThe magic in the Seven Satrapies functions roughly the opposite of a\ncandle burning. When a candle burns, a physical substance (usually wax) is\ntransformed into light. With chromaturgy, light is transformed into a\nphysical substance, luxin. If drafted correctly (within a narrow allowance),\nthe resulting luxin will be stable, lasting for days or even years, depending\non its color.\nMost drafters (magic users) are monochromes; they can draft only one\ncolor. A drafter must be exposed to the light of her color to be able to draft\nit—that is, a green drafter can look at grass and be able to draft, but if she’s\nin a white-walled room, she can’t. Many drafters carry delicate and\nexpensive colored spectacles developed by Lucidonius himself, and later\nimproved upon by the Technologist, so that if her color isn’t available\nwhere she stands, she can still use magic.\nMonochromes, Bichromes, and Polychromes\nMost drafters are monochromes: they are able to draft only one color.\nDrafters who can draft two colors well enough to create stable luxin in both\ncolors are called ‘bichromes.’ Anyone who can draft solid luxin in three or\nmore colors is called a ‘polychrome.’ The more colors a polychrome can\ndraft, the more powerful she is and the more sought after are her services. A\nfull-spectrum polychrome is one who can draft all seven colors in the\nvisible spectrum. A Prism is always a full-spectrum polychrome.\nMerely being able to draft a color, though, isn’t the sole determining\ncriterion in how valuable or skilled a drafter is. Some drafters are faster at\ndrafting, some are more efficient, some have more will than others, some\nare better at crafting luxin that will be durable, and some are smarter or\nmore creative at how and when to apply luxin.\nDisjunctive (Discontiguous) Bichromes/Polychromes\nThe spectrum of visible light exists in a consistent order: paryl, sub-red, red,\norange, yellow, green, blue, superviolet, chi. Most bichromes and\npolychromes simply draft a larger spectrum on the continuum than\nmonochromes. That is, a bichrome is most likely to draft two colors that are\nadjacent to each other (blue and superviolet, red and sub-red, yellow and\ngreen, etc.). However, some few drafters are disjunctive (or discontiguous)\nbichromes. As could be surmised from the name, these are drafters whose\ncolors do not border each other. Usef Tep was a famous example: he drafted\nred and blue. The Iron White is another, drafting green and red. It is\nunknown how or why disjunctive bichromes come to exist. It is only known"

It is only known\nthat they are rare.\nSubchromacy and Superchromacy\nSubchromat: One who has trouble differentiating between at least two\ncolors, colloquially referred to as being color-blind. Subchromacy need not\ndoom a drafter. For instance, a blue drafter who cannot distinguish between\nred and green will not be significantly handicapped in his work.\nSuperchromat: One who has greater-than-usual ability to distinguish\nbetween fine variations of color. Superchromacy in any color will result in\nmore stable drafting, but it is most helpful in drafting yellow. Only\nsuperchromat yellow drafters can hope to draft solid yellow luxin.\nOuter-Spectrum Colors\nFor more than four hundred years—from the time of Prism Vician until the\nbeginning of the Age of the Lightbringer—knowledge of outer-spectrum\ncolors (i.e., paryl and chi) was suppressed by the Chromeria. Paryl exists far\nbelow sub-red on the spectrum; chi is equally far above superviolet. During\nthis age of suppressed knowledge, very few people understood the unique\nproperties of these types of luxin, much less their usefulness. The idea that\nthere are more than seven draftable colors was theologically problematic for\nsome; paryl and chi were considered not only blasphemous but quite\ndeadly.\nBut if colors are to be so broadly defined as to include colors only one\ndrafter in a million can draft, then shouldn’t yellow be split into liquid\nyellow and solid yellow? Where do black and white luxins fit? How could\nsuch colors even fit on the spectrum? As ancient knowledge of the four\nsuppressed colors—white, black, chi, and paryl—is carefully rediscovered\nby luxiats, our understanding of their properties and distinctions will propel\nus beyond our horizons, into uncharted academic waters. The prospect is\nthrilling to many of us.\nP\nHYSICS\nLuxin has mass. If a drafter creates a luxin haycart directly over her head,\nthe first thing it will do is fall to the ground and crush her. Luxin density,\nfrom heaviest to lightest, is as follows: red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\nsub-red,* paryl, superviolet, chi. For reference, liquid yellow luxin is only\nslightly lighter than the same volume of water.\n(*Sub-red mass is difficult to determine accurately because it rapidly\ndisintegrates into fire when exposed to air. The ordering above was\nachieved by putting sub-red luxin in an airtight container and then weighing\nthe result, minus the weight of the container. In real-world uses, sub-red\ncrystals are often seen floating upward in the air before igniting.)\nTactility\nEach type of luxin has a unique feel, as follows:\nSub-red: Again the hardest to describe due to its flammability, but often\ndescribed as feeling like a hot wind.\nRed: Gooey, sticky, clingy, depending on drafting; can be tarry and thick\nor more gel-like.\nOrange: Lubricative, slippery, soapy, oily.\nYellow: In its liquid, more common state, like effervescent water, cool to\nthe touch, possibly a little thicker than seawater.

In its solid state, it is\nperfectly slick, unyielding, smooth, and incredibly hard.\nGreen: Rough; depending on the skill and purposes of the drafter,\nranges from merely having a grain like leather to feeling like tree\nbark. It is flexible, springy, often drawing comparisons to the green\nlimbs of living trees.\nBlue: Smooth, though poorly drafted blue will have a texture and can\nshed fragments easily, like chalk, but in crystals.\nSuperviolet: Like spidersilk, thin and light to the point of\nimperceptibility.\nScent\nThe foundational scent of all luxin is lightly resinous. The smells below are\napproximate, because each color of luxin smells like itself. Imagine trying\nto describe the smell of an orange. You’d say citrusy sweet and sharp, but\nthat isn’t it exactly. An orange smells like an orange. The below\napproximations are close.\nSub-red: Charcoal, smoke, burned.\nRed: Tea leaves, tobacco, dry.\nOrange: Amandine, rich.\nYellow: Eucalyptus, mint.\nGreen: Fresh cedar, resin.\nBlue: Light mineral or coca.\nSuperviolet: Faintly like cloves.\nParyl: Saffron.\nChi: Metallic, like the air during a lightning storm.\n*Black: No smell, or smell of decaying flesh.\n*White: Honey, lilac.\n(*Mythical; these are the smells as reported in histories and legends.)\nM\nETAPHYSICS\nAny drafting feels good to the drafter. Sensations of euphoria and\ninvincibility are particularly strong among young drafters and those drafting\nfor the first time.\nGenerally, these pass with time, though drafters abstaining from magic\nfor a time will often feel them again. For most drafters, the effect is similar\nto drinking a cup of kopi. There are vigorous ongoing debates about\nwhether the effects on personality should be described as metaphysical or\nphysical.\nRegardless of their correct categorization and whether they are the\nproper realm of study for the magister or the luxiat, the effects themselves\nare unquestioned.\nEffects on Personality\nThe benighted before Lucidonius believed that passionate men became reds\nand that calculating women became yellows or blues. In truth, the causation\nflows the other way.\nEvery drafter, like every woman, has her own innate personality. The\ncolor she drafts then influences her toward the behaviors below. A person\nwho is impulsive who drafts red for years is more likely to be pushed\nfurther into ‘red’ characteristics than a naturally cold and orderly person\nwho drafts red for the same length of time.\nThe color a drafter uses will affect her personality over time. This,\nhowever, doesn’t make her a prisoner of her color, or irresponsible for her\nactions under the influence of it. A green who continually cheats on his\nspouse is still a lothario. A sub-red who murders an enemy in a fit of rage is\nstill a murderer. Of course, a naturally angry woman who is also a red\ndrafter will be even more susceptible to that color’s effects, but there are\nmany tales of calculating reds and fiery, intemperate blues."

Be careful in your application of\ngeneralities. That said, generalities can be useful: a group of green drafters\nis more likely to be wild and rowdy than a group of blues.\nGiven these generalities, there is also a virtue and a vice commonly\nassociated with each color. (Virtue being understood by the early luxiats not\nas being free of temptation to do evil in a particular way, but as conquering\none’s own predilection toward that kind of evil. Thus, gluttony is paired\nwith temperance, greed with charity, etc.)\nSub-red: Passionate in all ways, the most purely emotional of all\ndrafters, the quickest to rage or to cry. Sub-reds love music, are often\nimpulsive, fear the dark less than any other color, and are often\ninsomniacs. Emotional, distractible, unpredictable, inconsistent,\nloving, bighearted.

Paryl is the color of dark\ndrafters and night weavers and assassins because this spectrum is\nusually available at night. Renders the drafter much more susceptible\nto empathy, able to absorb emotions in a way other drafters cannot.\nChi (KAI): The upper-spectrum counterpart to paryl. (Often referred to\nin tales as ‘as far above superviolet as paryl is below sub-red.’) Also\ncalled the revealer. Its main claimed use is nearly identical to paryl—\nseeing through things, though those who believe in chi say its powers\nfar surpass paryl’s in this regard, cutting through flesh and bone and\npossibly even metal. The only thing the tales seem to agree on is that\nchi drafters have the shortest life expectancy of any drafters: five to\nfifteen years, almost without exception. If chi indeed exists, it would\nmostly be evidence that Orholam created light for the universe or for\nHis own purposes, and not solely for the use of man, and would\nmove theologians from their current anthropocentrism.\nLegendary Colors\nBlack: Destruction, void, emptiness, that which is not and cannot be\nfilled. Obsidian is said to be the bones of black luxin after it dies.\nWhite: The raw word of Orholam. The stuff of creation, from which all\nluxin and all life was formed. Descriptions of an earthly form of the\nstuff (as diminished from the original as obsidian supposedly is from\nblack luxin) describe it as radiant ivory, or pure white opal, emitting\nlight in the whole spectrum.\nL L\nUXIN AND IFESPAN\nGeneral Effects. At this point, it has been established beyond question that\ndrafting shortens the lives of those who do it, and almost all scholars accept\nthat this is not because those who draft are intrinsically more fragile, but\nbecause of the act of drafting itself. The reasons for this are unknown, but\nthe more luxin drafted, the shorter the drafter’s life. It is believed that the\nbody will heal some amount of the damage drafting does. Thus, a drafter\nwho drafts minimally daily will be able to draft far more cumulatively than\none who attempts to draft a great deal in a short period of time. The\nChromeria encourages drafters to honor Orholam’s gift of our lives by\ndrafting in moderation, except in emergencies.\nVarious Colors and Lifespan. It’s been noted that, even as drafters of the\nvarious colors tend to evince particular personality traits, so too do those\nwho draft certain colors seem to live longer. Only one color has been\nproven to the Chromeria’s satisfaction to never be safe to use: chi always\nkills its practitioners, almost always within five to ten years. As Life is one\nof Orholam’s Seven Great Gifts and being party to the wanton destruction\nthereof cannot be within Orholam’s will, the Magisterium successfully\nenjoined the Chromeria to cease teaching chi-drafting three hundred forty-\ntwo years ago.\nAs for the rest, debate rages on the exact causal connections, but it has\nbeen noted that superviolet drafters tend to break the halo earlier, while at\nthe opposite end of the spectrum, paryl drafters may live to a full natural"

However, this last is uncertain, given their overall small numbers\nand the fact that many of those recorded as such belonged to the Order of\nthe Broken Eye, where names were often handed down to give the illusion\nof immortality to enhance the Order’s reputation and intimidate opponents.\nON THE OLD GODS\nSub-red: Anat, goddess of wrath. Those who worshipped her are said to\nhave had rituals that involved infant sacrifice. Also known as the Lady of\nthe Desert, the Fiery Mistress. Her centers of worship were Tyrea,\nsouthernmost Paria, and southern Ilyta.\nRed: Dagnu, god of gluttony. He was worshipped in eastern Atash.\nOrange: Molokh, god of greed. Once worshipped in western Atash.\nYellow: Belphegor, god of sloth. Primarily worshipped in northern Atash\nand southern Blood Forest before Lucidonius’s coming.\nGreen: Atirat, goddess of lust. Her center of worship was primarily in\nwestern Ruthgar and most of Blood Forest.\nBlue: Mot, god of envy. His center of worship was in eastern Ruthgar,\nnortheastern Paria, and Abornea.\nSuperviolet: Ferrilux, god of pride. His center of worship was in\nsouthern Paria and northern Ilyta.\nON TECHNOLOGY AND WEAPONS\nThe Seven Satrapies are currently experiencing an age of great leaps in\nunderstanding. The peace since the Prisms’ War and the following\nsuppression of piracy has allowed the flow of goods and ideas freely\nthrough the satrapies. Affordable, high-quality iron and steel are available\neverywhere, leading to high-quality weapons, durable wagon wheels, and\neverything in between. Though traditional forms of weapons like Atashian\nbich’hwa or Parian parry-sticks continue, now they are rarely made of horn\nor hardened wood. Luxin is often used for improvised weapons, but most\nluxins tend to break down after long exposure to light, and the scarcity of\nyellow drafters who can make solid yellows (which don’t break down in\nlight) means that metal weapons predominate among mundane armies.\nThe greatest leaps are occurring in the improvement of firearms. In most\ncases, each musket is the product of a different smith. This means each man\nmust be able to fix his own firearm and that pieces must be crafted\nindividually. A faulty hammer or flashpan can’t be swapped out for a new\none, but must be detached and reworked into appropriate shape. Some\nlarge-scale productions with hundreds of apprentice smiths have tried to\ntackle this problem in Rath by making parts as nearly identical as possible,\nbut the resulting matchlocks tend to be low quality, trading accuracy and\ndurability for consistency and simple repair. Elsewhere, the smiths of Ilyta\nhave gone the other direction, making the highest-quality custom muskets\nin the world. Recently, they’ve pioneered a form they call the flintlock.\nInstead of affixing a burning slow match to ignite powder in the flashpan\nand thence into the breech of the rifle, they’ve affixed a flint that scrapes a"

This approach means a\nmusket or a pistol is always ready to fire, without a soldier having to first\nlight a slow match. Keeping it from widespread adoption is the high rate of\nmisfires—if the flint doesn’t scrape the frizzen correctly or throw sparks\nperfectly, the firearm doesn’t fire.\nThus far, the combination of luxin with firearms has been largely\nunsuccessful. The casting of perfectly round yellow luxin musket balls is\npossible, but the small number of superchromatic yellow drafters able to\nmake solid yellow luxin creates a bottleneck in production. Blue luxin\nmusket balls often shatter from the force of the black powder explosion. An\nexploding shell made by filling a yellow luxin ball with red luxin (which\nwould ignite explosively from the shattering yellow when the ball hit a\ntarget) was once demonstrated to the Nuqaba, but the exact balance of\nmaking the yellow thick enough to not explode inside the musket but thin\nenough to shatter when it hit its target is so difficult that several smiths have\ndied trying to replicate it, probably barring this technique from wide\nadoption.\nOther experiments are doubtless being carried out all over the Seven\nSatrapies, and once high-quality, consistent, and somewhat accurate\nfirearms are introduced, the ways of war will change forever. As it stands\ncurrently, a trained archer can shoot farther, far more quickly, and more\naccurately.\nON CHROMERIA PROHIBITIONS\nTattoos. From a time when factionalism ran high, before all the noble\nhouses had intermarried so much, before single families existed with a\nkaleidoscope of skin tones within single generations.\nAt the time, for a number of reasons, the Parians had been more isolated\nand were more uniformly dark-skinned, which gave numerous drafting\nadvantages that some of them interpreted as being expressions of Orholam’s\nfavor on them as the people who had united under Lucidonius first.\nColored lenses could be lost or unavailable when needed, and were\ninitially prohibitively expensive, so lighter-skinned drafters had taken to\ntattooing blocks of their own colors on their skin so they’d always have a\nsource available. But color tattoos didn’t work nearly as well for darker-\nskinned drafters, which included most of the Parians, who were the\npolitically dominant force at the time.\nRather than lose their advantages, several of the most powerful families\nunited to argue that wights were hiding incarnitive magic behind tattoos.\nThey successfully rammed through a prohibition on tattoos, conveniently\nignoring that naturally very dark skin could hide incarnitive magic and\nluxin-packing just as well.\nIncarnitive luxin. A term for luxin when it is incorporated directly into\none’s body. This is forbidden by the Chromeria as debasing or defiling\nOrholam’s work (the human body itself) with man’s work and is seen as a\nslippery slope to trying to fully remake the body and become immortal. In\ncertain cases, the luxiats have turned a blind eye to more minor or\nprosthetic uses.\nPets"

In\ncertain cases, the luxiats have turned a blind eye to more minor or\nprosthetic uses.\nPets\nDogs: Being highly susceptible to will-casting, dogs are not allowed on the\nJaspers. Ships carrying dogs that so much as dock without permission face a\nsmall fine, while disembarking with a dog may result in seizure of the ship\nand striping for shipowner and the dog’s owner and death for the dog.\nCats: As they are necessary to control the populations of mice and rats, cats\nare allowed on the Jaspers. That they’re highly resistant to will-casting also\nplays a part. The Beneficent Hiram D., the renowned will-caster of Blood\nForest, testified on the matter before the Magisterial High Court, saying,\n‘Cats shrug off all attempts at either being mastered or cajoled to do what\nthey don’t wish to do, either amused or profoundly insulted that a human\nwould even make the attempt. Before investigating this matter on your\nlords’ instigation, I wasn’t afraid of cats. Now I am.’\nOther: Other animals are allowed, prohibited, or subject to taxation in\naccordance with how domitable they are. Horses, for example, must display\na registered brand, pass yearly inspection, and pay a duty, making them a\nluxury item beyond even the already heavy expenses of keeping them fed\nand stabled on an island.\nOne more small, silly scene just for those of you who can’t stop until the very last page:\nwww.brentweeks.com/shawarma-scene\n—Brent\nTHE END\n*I said “deserve to be.” Not “will be.”"
