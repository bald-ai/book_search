Each color of luxin has unique physical and metaphysical\nproperties and innumerable uses, from construction to warfare. Trained at\nthe empire’s capital, the Chromeria, these drafters lead lives of privilege,\nwith satrapies and powerful houses vying for their services. In exchange,\nthey agree that once they exhaust their ability to safely use magic—signaled\nwhen the halos of their irises are broken by the colors they draft—they will\nbe killed by the emperor, the Prism, in a ceremony on the most holy day of\nthe year: Sun Day. The drafters who have broken the halo (called wights) go\nmad with the luxin coursing through their bodies. If they run away instead\nof surrendering, they must be hunted to death. Only the Prism can draft with\nlimitless power, and he or she alone can balance all the colors in the\nsatrapies to prevent the chaotic luxin from overwhelming the lands. Every\nseven years, or on a multiple of seven years, the Prism also gives up his or\nher life, and the ruling council appoints a new Prism. If the Prism refuses\ndeath, he or she is likewise hunted down.\nThe current Prism is Gavin Guile.\nBook One: The Black Prism"

If the Prism refuses\ndeath, he or she is likewise hunted down.\nThe current Prism is Gavin Guile.\nBook One: The Black Prism\nPrism Gavin Guile learns he has an illegitimate son living in a satrapy that’s\nthreatening civil war for the second time in fifteen years. But Gavin is\nactually Dazen Guile in disguise; after the battle that ended the last war and\nkilled his brother, he stole Gavin’s identity. Now he has to take\nresponsibility for his brother’s bastard. Gavin travels to Tyrea with Karris,\nhis former fiancée and now a member of his elite defensive corps, the\nBlackguard. They find Kip, his son, in time to save him from a rebellious\nsatrap who is calling himself King Garadul. The king allows them to leave,\nbut takes Kip’s knife—the only thing left him by his mother. While Gavin\ntakes Kip back to the Chromeria to begin his magical education, Karris\nstays in Tyrea to rendezvous with a spy in the king’s army.\nKarris is captured by the king’s forces, and she discovers King Garadul’s\nright hand, a wight who calls himself the Color Prince, is the one fomenting\nrebellion. He is her brother, whom she’d thought long dead.\nKip tests into the Chromeria’s school for drafters and meets a friend\nfrom his hometown, Liv Danavis, daughter of one of Dazen’s greatest\ngenerals. Gavin is focused on killing wights and finding a political solution\nto the war, but he must also deal with the man he’s secretly imprisoned deep\nbeneath the Chromeria: his brother. Gavin’s father, Andross, tasks him with\ngoing back to Tyrea to stop the rebellion from becoming an empire-wide\nwar and with retrieving the very knife Gavin allowed the king to take when\nhe rescued Kip.\nWhen Gavin, Kip, and Liv arrive at Tyrea’s capital, Garriston, they meet\nLiv’s father, former general Corvan Danavis. They realize the city is\nindefensible, so Gavin begins to draft an entire wall. Gavin has almost\ncompleted the wall when a cannonball destroys the gate he’d been drafting.\nGavin’s forces defend the retreat of Garriston’s citizens as they attempt to\nescape via barges. Kip learns where Karris is and decides to rescue her. Liv\nfollows him, but they are separated when Kip is captured by the Color\nPrince’s forces.\nKip is imprisoned with Karris, and in the chaos of battle they manage to\njoin the army marching toward the city. Kip kills King Garadul, and Liv\nsaves both Kip and Karris by agreeing to join the Color Prince if he’ll use\nhis sharpshooting skills to prevent their deaths in battle.\nKip races to meet another threat: he knows a young polychrome,\nZymun, has been assigned to assassinate Gavin. He doesn’t stop the attack,\nbut Gavin survives when Kip intercedes. Kip takes the dagger Zymun used\nand realizes it is the same blade his mother gave him. Gavin, Kip, and\nKarris escape the city on barges with much of the city’s civilian population.\nGavin is unaware that his brother has escaped the first of multiple prison\nchambers back at the Chromeria.\nBook Two: The Blinding Knife"

Karris and Gavin build a harbor\nfor the refugee fleet, and Gavin hunts the blue bane, a horror forming in the\nCerulean Sea. If he doesn’t destroy the bane, an ancient god will be reborn.\nKip returns to the Chromeria to test into the Blackguard. He befriends a\nfew of his fellow Blackguard candidates, including Teia, a color-blind paryl\ndrafter and a slave. Her owner forces her to steal valuable goods and to spy\non Kip. As hard as training is, the new interest his grandfather has taken in\nhim is worse. Andross demands Kip play a card game, Nine Kings, for high\nstakes.\nA librarian, Rea Siluz, introduces Kip to Janus Borig, an artist who\ncreates ‘true’ Nine Kings cards, which allow drafters to experience history\nas it happened. But it’s not long before Kip finds Janus mortally injured by\ntwo assassins. Kip manages to kill both, acquire their magical cloaks, and\nsave Janus’s deck of true Nine Kings cards. Kip uses a new deck made by\nJanus to beat Andross in a game, winning Teia’s slave contract. Kip gives\nthe cloaks, the cards, and his mother’s knife to his father, who’s just\nreturned with Karris. Gavin has destroyed the blue bane and resettled the\nrefugees, so he’s ready to manipulate the Spectrum (the ruling council of\nthe Chromeria) into declaring Seers Island a new satrapy and make Corvan\nDanavis its new satrap.\nKarris is given a letter from Gavin’s dead mother and learns Gavin has\nloved her all along. He broke their betrothal so Karris wouldn’t have to\nmarry a man she might not love. Karris approaches Gavin that night, but\nhe’s already in bed with another woman—a woman he didn’t invite.\nEnraged at losing Karris again, Gavin throws the woman onto his balcony.\nShe tumbles over the railing and falls to her death.\nCertain he’ll be arrested for the murder, Gavin decides he must free his\nbrother to take his place as Prism. But Gavin realizes his long-imprisoned\nbrother is crazy, so he kills him. Gavin returns from the prison to find the\nSpectrum has declared war and that his two Blackguards, the only witnesses\nto the girl’s death, have sworn Gavin acted in self-defense, leaving him free\nto be Prism.\nAs the trainees continue with their elimination matches, Kip almost\nenters the Blackguard ranks—but loses at the last moment due to cheating\nby some of the other trainees. But his friend Cruxer uses a loophole to get\nKip in anyway.\nGavin and Karris reconcile and marry just before they go to war against\nthe Color Prince. With the new Blackguard inductees and the Chromeria’s\nforces, they must destroy a green bane that is birthing a new god, Atirat. Liv\nis still with the Color Prince’s army and uses her superviolet skills to help\ncreate Atirat."

As he\nconfronts Andross, he draws the knife his mother gave him and stabs\nAndross in the shoulder. Gavin tries to stop the two, but can only redirect\nKip’s knife into his own body. He falls overboard, and Kip jumps after him.\nThe ship sails on, only Andross aware of what truly happened. Gavin is\npicked up by Gunner, a master cannoneer on a ship they’d earlier destroyed.\nKip is rescued by Zymun, who says he is actually Gavin and Karris’s long-\nlost illegitimate son. Gavin wakes to find he is completely color-blind…\nand a slave rower.\nBook Three: The Broken Eye\nAdrift in a boat with Zymun, Kip is able to escape before they’re press-\nganged by pirates. Weeks later, he makes it back to the Chromeria, after\nsurviving the jungle, starvation, and worse.\nBecause she married the Prism, as soon as she returns to the Chromeria,\nKarris is stripped of her rank in the Blackguard and given orders to take\nover the spy network of the White (the head of the Chromeria). Meanwhile,\nAndross Guile reveals that he has been miraculously healed from being a\nred wight. With the absence of Gavin Guile and the war under way, the\nSpectrum swiftly elects him promachos—commander in chief of the\nChromeria.\nTeia is quickly recruited by Murder Sharp, a skilled paryl assassin for\nthe Order of the Broken Eye. When the Order steals her slave paperwork,\nand then frames her for murder, Teia finds herself helpless to resist. She\nstruggles to balance her training as a Blackguard inductee with assignments\nfrom the Order, but finally confesses everything to Ironfist and the White.\nThey commission her to serve as the Chromeria’s spy on the Order, and\nKarris is assigned as her handler. As Teia continues her initiation into the\nOrder, she discovers that she is a lightsplitter, a rare drafter who can use\nshimmercloaks (such as the ones Kip recovered) to make herself mostly\ninvisible.\nUpon his homecoming, Kip informs the Spectrum and Karris that Gavin\nis still alive, but avoids implicating Andross in Gavin’s accident, which\ngains him a powerful if untrustworthy ally. He finds himself under Karris’s\ntutelage for drafting and reunites with his old Blackguard squad, the\nMighty: Ben-hadad, Big Leo, Teia, Ferkudi, Winsen, Goss, and Daelos.\nAndross grants the group access to restricted libraries so they can research\nheretical Nine Kings cards and the Lightbringer, a long-prophesied savior of\nthe satrapies, hoping they’ll gain information to win the war. In the process,\nKip befriends mousy Quentin Naheed, a luxiat with extraordinary skills as a\nscholar."

In the chaos of a sea battle with a ship they’re\nattempting to seize, a young Ruthgari noble, Antonius Malargos, leaps\naboard their ship and offers to free the enslaved rowers if they help him\nbreak his ship free. They succeed, capturing Gunner and the Blinding Knife\nin the process, but Antonius takes Gavin to Ruthgar, to be imprisoned by his\ncousin Eirene. There her ally the Nuqaba of Paria arranges for Gavin to be\npublicly blinded.\nThe Mighty discover that everything about heretical cards, and much\nabout the Lightbringer, have been erased from the records. Kip also realizes\nthat the weapon that allows Prisms to be made or unmade is the very knife\nthat stabbed Gavin. When Kip reports to Karris, they have a falling out over\na poorly timed joke. Soon afterward, he is approached by Tisis Malargos,\nEirene’s sister, who proposes marriage to tie their families together. Kip\nlater finds the true Nine Kings cards his father hid. Mistakenly drafting near\nthem, he falls unconscious and enters the Great Library, where he meets the\nimmortal Abaddon. Kip absorbs every one of the cards—except the\nLightbringer card. He manages to grab Abaddon’s shimmercloak, but dies\nfrom drafting so many cards. Teia, however, resuscitates him. Kip then\ngives Teia the cloak he stole from Abaddon. She later realizes it is the\nmaster cloak, and more powerful than any of the other shimmercloaks.\nAndross manipulates Kip into confessing that he found both Andross’s\nlost deck and Janus Borig’s true cards, but Kip lies, saying they were all\nblank. Andross tells him to marry Tisis and go to Ruthgar to serve as his\nspy, while Zymun (who has just come to the Chromeria and announced that\nhe is Karris and Gavin’s long-lost son) will serve as Prism for seven years.\nKarris receives word about Gavin’s location just in time to assemble a\nsmall crew to save him—though not in time to save him from being blinded\nin one eye.

She kills\ntwo of the other nominees who attempt to kill her, and is declared the new\nWhite.\nBefore Ironfist finds his dying brother, he meets secretly with his uncle:\nthe perfidious Grinwoody, hidden in plain sight as the slave of Andross\nGuile, is also the Old Man of the Desert, leader of the Broken Eye.

Whistling a nursery song, he gathered\nbarbarities and cruelties and outrages as Gavin lay on his back in the center\nof it all, arms spread, thrashing against his bonds. Dustpan filled to\noverflowing with creosote sins, Orholam turned toward Gavin for the first\ntime.\nAs he turned, his face was blinding bright, unknowable, a miasma of\nrazor-edged light, but at the corner of his mouth, his beard twitched with a\ntorturer’s glee.\n“Servient omnes,” Orholam said. All shall serve.\nHe upended his dustpan over Gavin’s face. Gavin screamed, but his\nwords were taken from him like silk torn from the spool in a spider’s gut,\nunwinding until it snapped inside him, leaving him empty and shattered\ninside. He tried to turn, twist, look away, but his eyes were propped open.\nThere was no escaping the bulbous, congealed ordure schloomping toward\nhis eye.\nThe whole mass fell. And as it fell, it caught fire and burnt in the air,\nsizzling, spattering, spitting angrily.\nAnd afire, all the world’s sin fell into Gavin’s eye and set his orb aflame.\nThe fire sank sizzling into his socket, gases escaping, tssst, like a sigh from\na disappointed father at his failure son.\nAnd the fire lodged in his eye, burning, and he screamed for ages past\ncounting, until his throat was raw and tongue was dry, until deserts blew\nbarren sands into snow, and his attempts to shriek faded, and his skin grew\nhard and cracked, and the burning shard impaled him, pinning him to the"

But\nhis arms jerked hard against iron manacles.\nHe was shackled to a table, arms extended. The nightmare wasn’t over.\nThe nightmare had just begun.\nChapter 2\nTeia lowered the silk noose toward her damnation. Rope spooled out from\ncareful fingers toward the anxious woman quietly working at the desk\nbelow. The target was perhaps thirty, wearing a slave’s dress, her copper-\ncolored hair pulled up in a simple ponytail. As Teia watched, the woman\nfolded a piece of the luxin-imbued flash paper that all her spies used. She\npaused and took a sip of an expensive whisky.\nDon’t look up! Please don’t look up.\nThe woman was Prism Gavin Guile’s room slave. She was the White’s\nhidden spymistress. She was Teia’s former superior and her mentor.\nMarissia put down her whisky, and as she sealed the note, she said,\n“Orholam, forgive me.”\nTeia was using the shimmercloak that Murder Sharp had given her, but\nbecause she was clinging to the ironwork on the ceiling, it hung away from\nher body, and it didn’t hide the dangling noose at all.\nBut Marissia didn’t look up. She put the note aside and pulled out\nanother sheet of thin paper.\nAs her mentor leaned forward again, Teia dexterously flipped the noose\nover Marissia’s head and then dropped from the ceiling, holding the rope.\nDraped over a beam above, the noose jerked tight around Marissia’s throat\nand hauled her to her feet. The sharp movement flung her chair backward\njust as Teia, holding the other end, swung down and forward. The falling\nchair cracked across Teia’s shins a moment before she crashed into\nMarissia.\nSomehow Teia kept from releasing the rope, and she didn’t cry out.\nMarissia was choking, grabbing at her neck, scrambling to get her feet\nunder her.\nAmazing how pain shuts down your thinking. If Teia hadn’t just gotten\nher shins destroyed, there were a dozen things she would have done. Instead\nshe clung stupidly to the rope, gasping, tears springing from her eyes, face-\nto-face with her old superior.\nAs Marissia regained her feet, Teia saw the problem: she wasn’t as\nheavy as Marissia. Marissia noticed it, too. Though gagging, she grabbed\nthe rope above her head and pulled down with all her strength.\nSomething shimmered in the corner of Teia’s eye, and Murder Sharp\nbecame visible as he took quick steps across the carpet. He buried a fist in\nMarissia’s stomach.\nMarissia’s strangled cough blew spit across Teia’s face. The slave\nwoman went slack.

In quick motions, Sharp took the noose from Teia,\nthrew a sack over Marissia’s head, and bound Marissia’s hands behind her\nback in such a way that any move she made to escape would tighten the\nnoose around her neck.\nMaster Sharp was gifted with knots.\nHe forced Marissia to her knees and checked once more that she could\nbreathe—all the fight had gone out of her.\n“Not good,” Master Sharp said, turning back to Teia. He was a lean man\nwith sharp features, orange-red hair, and a short beard the color of fire. His\nmost remarkable features, though, were his teeth and his too-big, too-\nfrequent smile, which he flashed now joylessly, from mere habit. Usually\nthe teeth he revealed with that smile were too white and too perfect. On\nmost hunts, he wore dentures made of predators’ teeth. But today, perhaps\nbecause his mission wasn’t to kill anyone, he wore dentures of beaver teeth\n—a full, disconcerting mouth of big, wide, flat incisors. They barely fit in\nhis mouth.\n“Not very good at all. But you kept her from destroying any of the\npapers,” he continued, “so I’ll accept it.”\n“You were here the whole time?” Teia asked. She set the chair back\nupright to give herself a moment of not looking at the monster who was\nnow her master. She massaged her aching shins. Orholam have mercy, those\nbeaver teeth made her skin crawl.\n“This is too important for me to let you bungle it. She was some kind of\nsecretary for the Prism. Who knows what she has access to?”\nSecretary? So the Order didn’t know what Marissia really was. Why,\nthen, was it kidnapping her?\nAnd why kidnapping? Teia had thought that the Order only killed\npeople.\nNot that it wouldn’t murder Marissia later.\nHanding Teia the noose, Murder Sharp strode to the window to look\ndown at the islands. Even from where she was, Teia could see a thick curl\nof black smoke rising to greet the morning sun.\nEarlier this morning, their trainer Tremblefist had blown the black\npowder stores beneath the cannon tower so Kip and the rest of the Mighty\ncould escape by sea. He’d probably given his life doing it. The squad had\ngotten away while Teia had chosen to stay here. And now she was doing\nthis.\nShe was a fool.\n“We’re lucky,” Sharp said. “The few Blackguards who weren’t already\non the parade route have abandoned their posts to get down to that tower.\nStill, no time to waste. You watch her. Break her neck if she screams.”\nHe shook his head at that last part. He’d said that for Marissia’s benefit.\nHe made a fist and mimed hitting her stomach. Knock the wind out of her if\nshe screams, he meant.\nWhy he hadn’t just gagged her, Teia didn’t know, but she didn’t ask.\nShe’d learned not to push the mercurial assassin. Sometimes he had deeper\nplans. Sometimes he didn’t think of the obvious. But he never liked being\nquestioned, and there was no upside to Teia appearing too smart.\nSharp scooped all the papers off the table and into a sack. He opened"

But he never liked being\nquestioned, and there was no upside to Teia appearing too smart.\nSharp scooped all the papers off the table and into a sack. He opened\ndrawers and grabbed every paper with writing on it, and thumbed through\nall the blank pages to make sure nothing was hidden from him.\nThen he was off, searching the rest of the room.\nMarissia gave two sharp little tugs on the rope in Teia’s hand.\n“Shhh,” Teia said.\nMarissia waited a few moments and tugged again. She wanted to say\nsomething.\nWhat was Teia going to tell her? She hadn’t known Marissia outside of\ntheir work, but she’d felt a kinship and deep respect for the woman. They\nhad both been slaves. Both were spies, and Marissia had risen as high as\nany slave or spy could.\nMarissia had once told Teia that the Order would make her do something\nterrible. ‘Let it be on my head—but do it,’ she’d said.\nBut there was no way she could have guessed that the something terrible\nwould be her own kidnapping and likely murder.\nAnother tug. Master Sharp had ducked into the slave’s closet off the\nmain room, out of sight and earshot. “He’s gone. Only for a moment,” Teia\nwhispered.\n“Third drawer, left side,” Marissia whispered. “Halfway back, straight\nup. Push hard. Quick!”\nMaster Sharp had left the drawer open, so Teia had only to take one step\nand stoop. The surface felt flat, but as Teia pushed hard on it, she felt\nsomething snap with a slight chalky scent of broken blue luxin, and a tiny\nsection of the wood sank in. A folded piece of parchment dropped into her\nhand.\nTeia stepped back into place, stashing the parchment in a pocket. “Got\nit,” she whispered.\n“Tug when you need me—”\nMaster Sharp stepped back in. “What’s she saying?”\n“Um? What?” Teia said. For one terrifying moment, her mind went\nblank. “Oh, she’s trying to bribe me.” Teia said it like she was bored.\nStaring at her hard, Master Sharp ran a freakishly long pink tongue over\nthose horrid wide teeth. “I took a bribe…” He smacked his lips. “Once. Had\nno plan to let the man go, of course, and killed him as soon as I got the\ncoin.” Sharp tucked a package of documents tied with red or green ribbon\ninto his sack. Teia was color-blind, so she could tell only that it was one or\nthe other. “No harm, right? The Old Man… disagreed. Emphatically.”\nHe smiled, too broadly. Something about those teeth twisted Teia’s\nstomach more than when he’d worn a full set of wolves’ fangs.\n“How much did she offer?” he asked.\nTeia froze. There was a hook in that question. Marissia the Prism’s room\nslave might have squirreled away a small fortune. Marissia the spy would\nhave saved a lot more, and with her life on the line, would she not offer a\nlarge bribe? But maybe not too large, a spymistress would be smart enough\nto start small—"

You said we needed to—”\n“We don’t need to worry about her.” His voice lowered dangerously.\n“And don’t question me.”\nOrholam have mercy. That cemented it.

And you’ll\ncome to the Crimson Path eventually.” The true friendliness should have\nmade him less scary, but any comfort she might have felt was ground to\npaste between those inhumanly wide teeth.\nHe walked over to Marissia, still on her knees. “How much would you\ngive us?”\nTremulously, she said, “As much as you want, I swear. I can get access\nto the Prism’s account if we act fast. Please, sir, please.” She broke off as if\nterrified. It twisted Teia’s guts because she couldn’t tell which was real:\nMarissia’s earlier bravery or her current terror. Maybe both.\n“I’ve changed my mind,” Master Sharp said. “If she yells, kill her.” Had\nhe forgotten he’d already threatened that?\nOr did he actually mean it this time?\nMarissia collapsed, sobbing quietly.\n“Hmm,” Sharp said, standing so close to Teia his sweet breath washed\nover her face. “How have I never noticed…” As if it were the most natural\nthing in the world, he pushed her lower lip down with a finger. “You have a\nbeautiful lower left dogtooth.” He pushed her lip right and left, examining\nher teeth as if she were a mare. “No, just the one. Good color on the rest,\nbut boring.” He shrugged, smelled his finger, licked off her saliva like a\nchef tasting soup. “Better. You listened to me about the parsley, didn’t you?\nAdd mint, fresh leaves when you can. Tuck them in the gums. Don’t chew\nor you’ll get bits in your teeth. Unsightly.”\nHe turned away, and she hoped he didn’t notice her tremble.\nHe said, “I need to check the White’s room and make a distraction. Be\nready to go quick. If I’m not back in five, untie her, throw her off the\nbalcony as if she suicided, and make your way out the same way we got in.”\nHe threw his hood over his head and pulled the laces through the grommets\nquickly, cinching the mask tight over his nose and mouth, leaving only his"

He turned and began\nshimmering.\nOn the back of his gray cloak, the image of a tufted gray owl appeared\nwith its wings spread and talons extended to strike. The image shimmered\nout of phase with the rest of the cloak, and disappeared last.\nThe door opened, showing a hallway marked with smoke and pools of\nblood and scratches and divots in the stone walls from arrows and bullets\nfrom the Mighty’s battle with the Lightguards earlier. That felt like a\nlifetime ago. Then the door shut quietly.\nTeia instantly shot a wave of paryl gas in an arc where Murder Sharp\nhad been standing to make sure he was really gone. He was.\n“Quickly,” Teia said, “what do you want me to do?”\nMarissia got up on her knees. Her voice was breathy with controlled\nfear. “Did he take the papers from my desk? Package. All tied together in\nred ribbon.”\n“Yes.”\nTeia could hear the heavy sigh of despair expelled into the hood over\nMarissia’s head. The spymistress said, “Teia, you have to get those papers. I\nwas to keep them safe for Karris.”\n“What are they?”\n“They’re the White’s instructions for her successor. They have\neverything Karris needs to know how to rule. Secrets. Plans. Names. There\nare things in there Karris can’t learn any other way.”\nOh hell no. How was Teia to steal papers from Murder Sharp? “We\nweren’t sent for the papers, Marissia. We were sent for you. I think Sharp’s\njust grabbing whatever is lying about.”\nMarissia sagged. “Any other day. Any other hour, and all those papers\nwould be locked away safe… No matter. No time.” She bent for a moment.\n“He’ll take it all to the Old Man’s office anyway. That parchment you\ngrabbed from my desk. It’s a code. Crack it. It’s the combination or key\nword to the Old Man of the Desert’s office. Teia, that office is here, in the\nChromeria. Maybe in this very tower. That means he—or she, we don’t\neven know for sure that the Old Man of the Desert is a man—is here. But if\nyou open the office without using the code, it’ll wash the room in fire.\nEverything in it will be destroyed. You can’t let that happen. Not least\nbecause the White’s papers will be destroyed, too.”\n“I’ll find it, I swear. But what—” Teia cut off at the sound of steps\noutside the room. She tapped Marissia’s shoulder to tell her to be silent, and\ndrafted, disappearing with her own borrowed shimmercloak.\nBut whoever it was walked past, and Teia heard the banging of the door\nto the roof. She and the squad had had quite the fight up there, only hours\nago, but only a single Blackguard was standing watch now. Master Sharp\nsaid the commanders of the Blackguard would isolate the area until they\ncould examine it to try to figure out what had happened.\n“What about you?” Teia asked. “How do we save you?”"

Teia wished she could see Marissia’s face, but the bag stayed\nperfectly still, giving no hint of her fear or her bravery or her hatred or her\ndesperation.\n“We don’t,” Marissia said quietly.\n“You’ve seen Sharp’s face. They’re going to kill you.”\nMarissia’s head bowed. “Just… pray for me,” she said, and there was\nher fear again.\n“At least let me give you a knife.”\n“And what happens to you when this assassin finds your knife on me?”\nMarissia asked.\nBefore Teia could protest further, the door opened and closed. Master\nSharp was speaking before he was even fully visible. “Give me that cloak.”\n“My shimmercloak?” Teia asked.\n“It’s not yours. It’s the Order’s, and don’t forget it.”\n“I’m the one who stole it! I risked everything to—”\n“Now!”\nTeia unclasped the choker and handed Master Sharp the burnt-hemmed\nshimmercloak. He lowered his own hood, threw Teia’s cloak on over his\ncloak, attaching the choker awkwardly. He pulled his hood back up, but\ncouldn’t lace it properly. He swore.\n“What are you doing?” Teia asked.\nHe swore again, and said to Marissia, “You do other than what I say, and\nyou die now, and not easy. Understand?”\nHer head bobbed, the sack trembling as she wept. He slashed the rope\nbetween her neck and her wrists, and slung her over his shoulder. “Teia,\nhelp me with the cloak.”\nTeia spread out the second, bunched cloak over Marissia’s body. Given\nthat Marissia was slung over Sharp’s shoulder, it covered her fully, if\nawkwardly.\n“I have to sneak out without a cloak?” Teia asked.\n“You go out the way we came in. Outside. Collect the climbing\ncrescents as you go down. Be quick. You won’t have long before people\nstart looking up here.” He poked Marissia. “You, when I tell you, you\nscream that there’s a fire in the White’s quarters. Because there is.”\nOh, that was why he hadn’t gagged Marissia. The Blackguards would\nrecognize her voice when she called out.\nStill holding Marissia over his shoulder, Master Sharp stooped to pick\nup the bag full of papers he’d stolen.\n“You want me to take the bag?” Teia asked.\nHe almost handed it to her, then paused. Anxiety hammered great blows\nagainst her mask of nonchalance. He said, “Better not. Get climbing.”\n“I could bring it to—”\n“Now,” he said, and there was quiet menace in his voice. Without\nwaiting, he turned his back, and far more slowly than usual, the cloaks\nbegan shimmering, the fox emblem on Teia’s burnt cloak showing dark gray\nagainst the gray and then fading.\nThe door opened, and Teia smelled smoke.\n“Fire! Fire in the White’s quarters!” Marissia shouted. “Fire!”\nAnd then the door closed behind them."

Once the\nsmoke started billowing out of the White’s windows, eyes would turn\ntoward the Prism’s Tower. Teia couldn’t be clinging to the walls in full view\nwhen that happened.\nBut Teia had a card to play that Master Sharp didn’t know about.\nShe had her own cloak, the master cloak that Kip had given her. She\npulled it out of her pack, the material thin and weightless as liquid light.\nShe put it on. Drew the choker around her neck. Pulled up the hood,\nsnapped it closed over her face. She could follow Sharp unseen.\nBut after extinguishing the fire, the Blackguards would search the tower\nexhaustively. If Teia followed Sharp, the Blackguards would find the\nclimbing crescents stuck to the outside of the tower. The Order had spies in\nthe Blackguard, so they would learn of it, and they would know Teia had\ndisobeyed.\nIt wouldn’t be proof that Teia was a spy, but the Order didn’t need proof.\nThey would kill her.\nBut if she didn’t follow Sharp, they would kill Marissia.\nMarissia had ordered Teia to let her die. The old Teia, the slave Teia,\nwould have accepted that order and shrugged off responsibility for what\nhappened next. Teia wasn’t that Teia anymore.\nThis was war, and Teia was behind enemy lines, alone. She had to make\nher own decisions and live with the consequences. Like a warrior. Like an\nadult. Like a free woman.\nIn the unholy calculus of war, Teia was somehow suddenly worth more\nthan a woman older, wiser, smarter, and better connected than she was. Teia\nwas starting to suspect that the Order was a greater threat to the Chromeria\nthan even the Color Prince. Saving Marissia—even if Teia could figure out\nhow—would jeopardize the Chromeria’s best chance ever to destroy the\nOrder. And only Teia knew now about the Old Man’s office. Only she had\nthe code.\nIt’s war, T. Friends die.\nJaw clenched, heart leaden, Teia went out onto the balcony, closed the\ndoor behind her, and stepped onto the climbing crescents.

She knew how he hated to be\nbound, how even the encumbrance of blankets twisted around his legs in\nbed made him panic and flail. Marissia, here? But where was here?\nHe remembered now. He must be at Amalu and Adini’s, the chirurgeons\non Big Jasper. He must have been panicking, delirious. It had all been\nnightmares. Marissia was here. There was no prison. Everything was going\nto be fine.\nKarris had pulled him out of the hippodrome where they’d put out his\neye, and he must have come down with a fever. He’d only dreamed he was\nin that blue hell he’d made for his brother. He’d only dreamed that his\nfather knew everything. Fever dreams. Impossible dreams.\nOh, thank Orholam.\nMarissia put a wet cloth in his mouth, and he sucked weakly. She wet it\nagain and repeated the process, until he motioned that he’d had enough. She\nwiped the crusted spit from the corners of his mouth.\nOnly then did he try to speak. “Marissia, where’s Karris?”\n“Your lady wife is safe, my lord. She’s been made the White.” It was\noddly formal for Marissia, but Gavin hadn’t yet sorted out the blurred\nboundaries between his room slave and his new wife. Doubtless Marissia\nwas upset that he had married, and who knew how Karris had been treating\nher? With Gavin’s absence, he was lucky Marissia was even still employed\nin his household. A more jealous wife would have sold off the room slave\nwho’d been so close to her husband.\nBut Gavin didn’t have time to worry about a slave’s feelings with all the\nproblems facing him.\n“The White?” he asked. “You didn’t just say…”\n“Orea Pullawr has passed into the light, my lord. My lady Karris Guile\nhas ascended to serve as the new White.”\n“I thought that old crone was going to live forever,” Gavin said. But he\nfelt an intense surge of pride at his wife’s accomplishment. The White!\nIn retrospect, though, maybe Orea had been preparing Karris for that all\nalong.\nOrholam’s balls, the other families were going to lose their minds.\nAndross Guile as promachos, Karris Guile as the White, and Gavin Guile as\nthe Prism?\nWell, that brought up a host of other problems. But Gavin was back, and\nwith Karris beside him, there were few things he—“Marissia, is there\nsomething odd about the sound in here?”\n“My lord.” There was a dread monotone to her voice.\nWith difficulty Gavin sat up. His bed was the kind of palanquin on\nwhich nobles were carried when injured, with drapes on all sides for\nprivacy, but small and light so that slaves could navigate corners and\nnarrow streets.\nA wall was not far behind Marissia.

Gavin tore back\nthe palanquin’s other curtains. Everywhere the one curving wall, sparkling\nquietly with inner light. Gavin couldn’t see the blue of it, but he could see\nall he needed to from that winking crystalline luxin. He was in the blue hell.\nHis gaoler had somehow brought Marissia here to care for Gavin’s wounds.\nTo keep him alive. For punishment.\n“How are you here?” he asked.\n“I was kidnapped. By Order assassins who were contracted by your\nfather.”\n“What?!”\n“My lord, I have secrets I would tell you. I don’t know how long I\nhave.”\n“You expect them to kill you.” He could see it in the tight calm of her\nface, like an improperly tanned hide stretched too far over a drum.\n“I was allowed to see my kidnappers’ faces. And High Lord Guile’s.\nYour father brought me here himself. Alone.”\nGavin’s arm shook from the mere effort of holding himself seated. He\nfell back on the palanquin. “Of course he did,” he said. “He couldn’t let\nanyone know about this place. But someone had to care for me, and he\nguessed that you would know about these cells after so many years with\nme, so he accomplished numerous tasks at once. That’s my father. May\nOrholam damn him.”\nIt was also very much Andross Guile to discard the slave after she’d\nserved her purpose.\nHe wouldn’t even guess that Gavin would be put out by it. Andross\nwouldn’t think of it as murdering Gavin’s lover; he would think of it as\ndestroying a piece of Gavin’s property. Gavin could always buy another\nroom slave, one prettier and younger, even. This one had to be more than\nthirty years old, after all.\n“Marissia, I’m—”\nHe could see on her face that she knew it, too. “I don’t know how much\ntime we have, my lord. Please don’t. My courage is leaking away by the\nmoment. Please treat me like a scout or a captain in your armies, so I can\nthink of myself as a warrior, because I can’t bear…” Her throat clenched as\nshe lost her words to fear, the thief.\nGavin hesitated and then gathered himself. “Water. The cup this time.”\nHe didn’t try to sit up. With a trembling hand, she gave him water. He took\nit, clumsily, his left hand missing the third and fourth fingers.\n“Report,” he said when he was done, and though he lay on his back, his\nvoice was all command.\n“What I have to say is quite sensitive, my lord. What do we do about\neavesdroppers?”\nHe thought about it. “If my father brought you here himself, it means he\nisn’t trusting even his closest spies to know about this place. So he would\nhave to be eavesdropping himself. He knows I may sleep for another few\ndays, so I doubt he’d gamble his time that way. Just sitting here, waiting for\nme to wake, doing nothing else while he doubtless needs to do much? No."

She looked away from his eye.\n“I am—that is, I was Orea Pullawr’s spymistress.”\nGavin felt as if he’d been punched in the gut.\nMarissia hurried on. “At first I just met with a few of her contacts, but I\ndid well. She kept expanding my role until, in the last few years, when she\nwas losing mobility, I took over everything.”\nGavin couldn’t look at her. He stared straight up. Furious, he tore off the\npalanquin’s roof.\nMarissia fell silent.\nThe action left him exhausted, aware again of how sick he’d been. He\ncould only stare up—up the anus of the blue hell, as it shat bread on the\npoor souls within. He would be eating Andross Guile’s shit-mercy for as\nlong as he chose to live. “And how exactly did that fit with our\narrangement, Marissia?”\n“I did my best to make it fit, my lord.”\nHe half laughed. “You did your best?”\n“I never betrayed you.”\n“What did the White have over you? I was here! You’re mine!” he spat.\n“What could she threaten you with that I could not protect you from? I’m\nnothing now, but I was… I was indomitable. Do you not remember what I\ndid for you? Do you not remember the Seaborns?”\n“I remember, my l—”\n“People think I killed that young asshole in a rage because he’d\ndamaged my property. I did it so no one would ever harass you again. I\nkilled a man and ended up having to purge his entire family—for you. For a\nslave. And for that—for that!—I get no loyalty? From you who shared my\nchambers and my bed. From you, whom I trusted more than I trusted even\nmy own mother.”\n“My lord…” She was weakening, losing whatever courage she’d\ngathered to tell him all this.\n“What did you tell the White?” he asked, voice dangerous.\n“I told her nothing that we hadn’t agreed on. I swear. I swear.”\nMarissia had been the White’s gift to Gavin. A young, pretty, smart\nvirgin to be his room slave, untainted by the politics of Big Jasper or\nloyalties to any other family. She was a rich gift indeed, and an unusual one.\nShe had a passing resemblance—more pronounced in those early years—to\nKarris. The White had obviously thought Gavin had a type.\nAs a young, single Prism, he could have easily had many room slaves.\nWealthy subjects were always giving gifts, looking for favor, and looking to\nplace spies near him.\nA procession of room slaves wouldn’t have been a problem except for\none reason: the food chute down to his brother’s prison connected to his\nown room.

So rather than trust that a hundred searching eyes\nwould all miss one hidden secret, Gavin had decided to turn one spy to his\nown side. He’d assumed that the young Marissia had been ordered by the\nWhite to spy on him.\nBut who was the White to command more loyalty than Gavin in his\nproud prime?\nThe White had asked him to kindly give the girl a few weeks to adjust to\nher new life. It would be bewildering for a young slave from the reaches of\nthe Blood Forest to adjust to life here, she said. Give her time.\nGavin had gone further than that. He had plotted how to take full\npossession of his newest acquisition as a general might plot a military\ncampaign. He had seduced her as if she were a princess. It was not a hard\nlabor, and not entirely a deceitful one, either. He’d been immediately\nattracted to Marissia’s obvious intelligence, her beauty, and—no less\nimportant to the young, arrogant man he’d been—her desire to please.\nIn that first year when Karris had left and he’d been so heartbroken and\nbelieved he would never see her again, Gavin had even thought that he was\nin love with Marissia.\nAs if one could love a slave the way one loves a woman.\nIt was the stuff of scandal. It was the subject of satirical stories and\nsongs. An entire sequence of comedies was devoted to the dullard Old\nGiles, the henpecked lord who left his wife for his slave, left all his lands\nand titles to marry her, and had adventures as he cluelessly attempted the\nbasic labors of farmers, or millers, or salt rakers, or brick makers, or bakers,\nalways failing and always then having to try another occupation in the next\nstory. Usually in another city. Usually because his lady wife had shown up\nat his place of business.\nOther tales of masters and slaves in love were darker and not sung much\nin front of lords or ladies. Those were tales of the too-pretty room slave\nwhose jealous mistress sold her off to the silver mines or the brothels, or\nmurdered her outright. Like every good gift, beauty was a blessing for the\nrich, but sometimes a curse for the poor.\nThe frisson of danger for a lord, who might be mocked by his friends for\nbeing an Old Giles, didn’t compare to what a room slave had to feel, afraid\non the one hand to please her master too little, and afraid on the other hand\nto be seen pleasing him too much.\nGavin had decided many times that instead of feeling love-love, he\nloved Marissia as a master loves a favored hound. You could love a hound.\nA hound could love you. But loving a hound as one loves a woman?\nUnnatural. Disordered.\nWhatever his few qualms, he had won over Marissia’s heart along with\nhis ownership of her body, and eventually, after he was sure she cared for\nhim more than anything in the world, he’d confronted her with evidence of\nher spying for the White, pretending he felt betrayed by what he knew had\nbeen the point all along.\nIt had, of course, been unfair.

How could Marissia have said no to the\nWhite herself—her owner—when she hadn’t yet even met Gavin? But his\nscheme had worked. After shaming and terrifying her, Gavin had made his\naccommodation with her: Marissia would continue to spy for the White, but\nshe would ask Gavin what she could share with Orea Pullawr first. There\nwould be certain secrets the White could never know.\nAnd then, by degrees, Gavin had let her learn secrets and false secrets,\nalways watching the White to see what she knew, always testing Marissia’s\nfaithfulness. And faithful she had been, until Gavin had even trusted her\nwith the bread. He hadn’t told her it was for his brother below, but she’d\nunderstood it was some awful secret, and Orea had never learned of it.\nAnd now the White, Orea Pullawr, was dead, and she hadn’t used\nwhatever secrets Marissia had told her to destroy him. So what kind of\npartial betrayal was this?\n“Marissia,” Gavin said. “Why would you do this? What loyalty did you\nowe her?”\nMarissia straightened her back, and looked him in the eye. “My name is\nMarissia Pullawr. The White was my grandmother. You were my\nassignment.

Her word\nwas law on every bit of land her eyes could see. Every drafter in the Seven\nSatrapies owed her obedience. To most people, she was a figure of near-\nmythic stature.\nShe had never felt more powerless.\nShe wasn’t about to let that continue.\nAround her the six other towers of the Chromeria rose as if in an\nembrace, but they were set lower than the Prism’s Tower, like children\nhugging her legs, offering encumbrance instead of comfort. Responsibilities\nto fulfill, duties to attend to, and too many of both. Karris, who had always\nhad an affinity for the blue virtues of order and hierarchy—an affinity oft\nburied by her wanton drafting of green and red—was making a list not just\nof the facts facing her, but also of the actions she would need to take\nregarding each, shelving her emotions for the time being.\nShe had only minutes before Andross Guile arrived, and she needed all\nher faculties for the confrontation. She had to make her own plans before he\narrived, because if she weren’t firmly set on her course before he began\nspeaking, he would steer her toward his destinations so skillfully that she\nwould come out thinking it had been her idea.\nGavin was gone. Her husband, her broken Prism—to save whom she\nhad risked war with Paria and Ruthgar both—had vanished.

Tisis had been the Chromeria’s hostage, guaranteeing Ruthgari\nloyalty. Why had she fled now? A hostage’s leaving without permission was\na breach of treaty and thereby technically an act of war.\nFind Tisis’s friends and slaves. Interrogate.\nCommander Ironfist was missing. Promachos Andross Guile had\nrelieved him of his position, but Karris would fight tooth and nail to\nreinstate him. Of course, first she had to find him, and he’d last been seen\nheading to the docks—which was exactly what she would have done if\nshe’d found herself suddenly without a position and knowing Andross Guile\nwas against her.\nDear Orholam, what if it is Ironfist dead down at the cannon tower?\nDestroy the Lightguard. Failing that, place spies high within\nthe organization.\nRegardless of whether it was Tremblefist or Ironfist dead, how had he\ndied? What had happened?\nInterrogate some Lightguards directly.\nConsult with Carver Black.\nFind locals who saw what happened.\nHow would she find Ironfist? How could she bring him back?\nTell all the Blackguards to look for Ironfist. Offer a reward.\nDo everything. Offer him whatever he wants if he’ll come\nback.\nIronfist was the one person Karris could trust without reservation,\nbecause—\nMarissia was gone. Hard as it was to admit, for Karris’s new duties this\nwas the worst blow of all. Marissia had been the head of all the White’s\nspies for years until Karris had recently begun to take those over.\nKarris thought they’d become something like friends, so Marissia’s\nbetrayal bit deep. And who knew what she’d taken with her?… Or whom.\nDear Orholam. What if Marissia had taken Gavin? But what could\nKarris do? It seemed hopeless. There were no hints at all about Marissia’s\nwhereabouts—or Gavin’s. But the woman couldn’t have absconded with\nhim without help. She had no retainers or family, so that meant she had\nmoney.\nCheck in with all spies. Determine if each one is loyal to me\nor to Marissia still.\nShift all monies to new accounts.\nDetermine how much Marissia has stolen, if possible. How?\nBy leaning on Turgal Onesto? The young banking scion will\nhave the opportunity to prove his worth now.\nThe only good news was that regardless of how high she’d climbed,\nMarissia was still a slave. Her clipped ear meant she would have trouble\nkeeping power if she didn’t have money. Money. Money’s the answer for\nthat snake.\nBut all this was recovery. All this was merely treading water after a\nshipwreck. That wasn’t enough. Karris needed to swim for shore.\nShe was the White now. That meant all the drafters in the Seven\nSatrapies were her responsibility. It meant the Chromeria and Big and Little\nJasper were her responsibility. Taking care of those meant that the physical,\nbrute-force weapons she’d loved for so long were inadequate to the task\nbefore her."

By sheer numbers killed, the Seven\nSatrapies had won battles. But their numbers bled away every night while\nthe Color Prince added to his.\nKarris’s war wasn’t going to be fought on battlefields. It was up to her to\ngive the people of the Seven Satrapies reasons to fight, to bleed, to die, and\nto kill. Others would be the sword in this fight. She would be the lash and\nthe pen.\nShe must unite the Seven Satrapies for this war. Any who opposed that\ngoal, who opposed her, must be brought into line or crushed.\nThere was a knock on the door, and the now omnipresent Blackguards\nannounced Andross Guile. He was only the first test.\nLovely to be starting out easy.\nAndross Guile looked as if he had purloined all the youth Karris had lost\nin the last few months. It wasn’t only that his little round paunch was\nshrinking, or that his skin, formerly pallid from being so long covered from\nthe sun’s gaze, was taking on color again. His back was straight, his head\nhigh, showing the broad Guile shoulders and strong Guile jaw. He was\nenergized by crisis.\nA good man for these times, then.\nAnd that’s the first and last time I’ll ever think of Andross Guile as a\ngood man.\n“It’s nice to see you smile in such fraught times, High Lady,” he said.\nKarris wasn’t a player of that game that Andross liked so much, Nine\nKings, but at this moment, she knew she had only one card: her own\nattitude.\nHe knew more than she did, so it made sense to defer to him. If he were\nIronfist, she would ask, ‘What must we do to win this war?’ But with\nAndross Guile, there was no way she could position herself as the\nsubordinate.\n“Those men I killed,” she said. “How are you going to deal with the\nfallout from their families?”\nHis face jumped off a bridge, tried to flip, and landed on its belly. “Me?”\nShe looked at him levelly. He’d tried to stack the election of the White\nagainst her. During the testing, two of the candidates—secretly his\ncandidates—had tried to push her off the great disks to fall to her death. It\nhadn’t turned out well for them. “If nothing else,” she said, “we share a last\nname. That’s a problem… for you.”\nThen he laughed. “Oh, that is an interesting play. Ha!” He looked at her\nfor a few moments, and she had a brief fantasy that he was bald because his\nbrain generated so much heat it had burnt off all his hair. “I was rather\nhoping that you might choose to be known by your maiden name, to use the\nterm ‘maiden’… loosely.”\nKarris saw Blackguard Gavin Greyling’s eyes go wide.

        "text": "hoping that you might choose to be known by your maiden name, to use the\nterm ‘maiden’… loosely.”\nKarris saw Blackguard Gavin Greyling’s eyes go wide. He couldn’t\nbelieve Andross was speaking to her that way.\nAnd in that moment, Karris thanked Orea Pullawr for forbidding her to\nuse red or green luxin. After years of her constantly using angry red and\nimpulsive green, Karris’s tongue had been a flame. But the months of\nabstaining had given her new patience. Karris let the insult pass beneath her\nfeet with blue disdain.\n“Hmm,” Andross said, as if it were merely interesting that she did not\ntake offense. As if he’d played a good card, and the play hadn’t worked the\nway he’d thought, and thus, because he’d been countered, that was the end\nof it.\nShe wanted to be angry about it, but that was a waste, too, wasn’t it?\nInstead she should take note: Andross will make personal insults\nimpersonally, not because he’s trying to insult you, but because he’s trying\nto find your weaknesses.\n“I’ll never prove it,” she said, “but I know. You tried to have me killed.\nOr you encouraged those who tried. Same thing, as far as I’m concerned. I\nmerely stopped you, so in my view, you shit the bed. You clean it up.”\nA frisson went through the Blackguards assigned to Karris and to\nAndross. They all knew how fast Karris was. They knew how good she was\nat unarmed combat. She was well within lethal range of Andross Guile. And\nthe Blackguards were charged with protecting both the White and the\npromachos. What were they to do if one attacked the other? Pulling apart\nfighters was vastly more dangerous and complicated than simply putting\ndown a threat.\nBut Andross Guile merely tugged on his nose, scratching it. He looked\nat the Blackguards and their weapons and their menacing stances. “Stand\ndown, children. You’re here to make us look good, not to actually do\nanything.”\n“While you’re being an asshole for no good reason to people who can’t\nfight back,” Karris said, “I want to point out something.”\n“Oh, please do.”\n“Orea beat you. You stacked the cards against us. I know you did. You\nowned all six of the other candidates, didn’t you?”\n“All six? That would be excessive, wouldn’t it?”\n“You think you’re the best at all your games. But Orea beat you. She\nbeat you.”\nAndross smiled and shrugged. “Luck,” he said, as if Karris’s selection as\nthe White and the death of two of his cat’s-paws were trifles in the course of\na friendly wager between friends.\n“Not luck. Orholam turns his face against the proud, Andross Guile.”\n“You think the divinity himself selected you?” Andross said, amused.\n“It is the point of the entire ritual, isn’t it?” Karris asked.\nAndross laughed, as if he couldn’t believe how naïve she was. “You\ndrew one stone in seven. And perhaps there was no luck involved at all,\ndepending on how far Orea stooped to get you where you are. You won."

You won.\nTake your victory, but to mistake that for a divine mandate on your—”\n“That’s exactly what it is,” she interrupted.\nHe paused, and saw she was serious. “Oh, you are surprising, aren’t\nyou? I can’t tell if you’re bluffing or if you actually believe that. No, don’t\ntell me. I like the uncertainty. You’re not a player, but you are a fascinating\ncard, aren’t you? After all these years, I finally start to see what my son saw\nin you.”\n“Sons,” Karris corrected. Both of them had fallen for her, after all. To\nthe whole world’s sorrow.\n“I hadn’t forgotten,” Andross said, his voice suddenly stone.\nOh, so this wasn’t all games and feeling out weaknesses and triggers.\nThere was a personal edge in there. Andross blamed her for all this? For the\nwar, for the loss of his sons? The sheer blind audacious folly.\nBut Karris wasn’t here to destroy Andross Guile. She was here to make a\npartner of him. And the truth was, their problems were mutual. Much as\nthey both hated it, they were yoked together not only against external\nthreats, but against internal ones as well. Three Guiles in power went\nagainst tradition, if not law. No one was going to be comfortable with one\nGuile as promachos, another as Prism-elect, and a third as the White.\nKarris waved the Blackguards back. “So, how about it?”\n“It? You mean me smoothing over your murder of Jason Jorvis and\nAkensis Azmith? Surely you’re joking.”\n“Not murder. Summary judgment of traitors. Which is the direction I’d\ngo in my defense if I were brought to trial.”\n“Not self-defense?” Andross asked. “A petite woman like you, against\ntwo big men?”\nAny trial would be agonizing, of course. People who’ve never been in a\nfight to the death always seem to think that split-second decisions can be\nderived rationally, and that a good person will naturally always make the\nbest choice and then carry out what she intends flawlessly.\nSelf-defense would be the stronger case, as Andross knew. Karris had\nbeen targeted for assassination by those two men, each of whom was bigger\nand stronger than she was.\nShe’d been scared, she could say. If her reaction had seemed\ndisproportionate, people had to remember that she was a small woman, and\nthey were large, threatening men. She’d merely done as her training taught\nher: she’d put an end to the threat.\nIt was all true, but it wasn’t all the truth.\nKarris hadn’t been afraid. Combat was scary: you could do everything\nright and still get killed by a stray bullet or an ally’s error or dumb luck.\nFighting two untrained idiots hand to hand? Not that scary.\nShe might have been able to save them, but she’d had time for only two\nthoughts as they held on, balanced at the edge of the testing platform: First,\nthat they were the sons of noble families that were needed in the war, and\nthus they would get away with their treason and blasphemy and murder."

Whoever came back would be the White, and the White would be\nimmune to prosecution. Another perfectly good and true defense.\nBut her path, alleging treason? That would tear those families apart. If,\nduring the ensuing investigations, someone folded and admitted they’d tried\nto manipulate the selection of the White, Karris had no doubt the fingers\nwould end up pointing at Andross Guile. He would have to be executed as a\ntraitor and heretic on Orholam’s Glare, along with who knew how many\nothers.\nAndross said, “If you take that path, you’ll fatally weaken our war\neffort.”\n“Even if I succeed,” Karris admitted. Rallying allies wouldn’t be easy\nafter decimating several powerful families and showing that there was\ncorruption at the very heart of the Chromeria. “I’ve not been elected to be\nthe Gray. I am the White. What is white without purity? Bad enough that\nour promachos is faithless.”\nAndross Guile gave her a long, appraising glance. “Are you suddenly so\nins—so zealous.”\n“Hmm,” Karris said.\nAfter a long moment, Andross said, “I’ll take care of the Jorvises and\nAzmiths. A trial won’t be necessary.” He nodded and moved as if to leave,\nthen stopped. He smirked. “May I be excused, High Lady Guile?”\nShe grinned a little back—no harm letting him think his charisma\nworked even on her—and motioned that he was dismissed.\nOnly after the door closed behind him did she breathe again.\nSurvive first meeting with Andross Guile.\nChapter 5\nIt was Sun Day night when Teia discovered the note on her bed. It was\nsimply folded and dabbed with red wax, no seal impressed on it. Teia flared\nher eyes to paryl, saw nothing suspicious, and picked up the note: “Report\nto Cowardice 27. Now.”\nNo signature.\nCowardice was the nickname of the sixth floor on the dark side of the\nred tower, not just the apparition strangling Teia.\nHere was the problem with serving two masters who demanded total\ndiscretion: Teia had no idea whether Karris or Murder Sharp had left this\nmessage.\nShe hoped it was Karris. She had so much to report it was ridiculous.\nShe also hadn’t slept for two days, and she wasn’t at her best. Sleep\ndeprivation led inexorably to bad decisions. If this note was from the Order,\nshe couldn’t afford any bad decisions.\nThe more immediate problem was what Teia should do with the master\ncloak. But what could she do with it now?

She could disguise it, sure, but as what? What if the laundresses\ncame through and grabbed it? What if laundering destroyed the magic in it?\nTrainer Fisk had once badly translated an Old Parian proverb for his\nclasses: ‘A sword unneeded can be laid, but a sword needed can’t be made.’\nOnce they deciphered what it actually meant, all the young Blackguards\ntook the message to heart: they carried two pistols or more; they carried\nbackup blades and hidden blades; during the entire fight to get out of the\nChromeria, Teia’d kept thinking of her rope spear. She’d left it in the\npractice room. It was still down there. She’d made do with paryl and swords\nand her dagger and a blunderbuss.\nOrholam have mercy on her soul, that blunderbuss. How many of those\nLightguards whom she’d raked with the blunderbuss at the lift had died?\nShe’d killed men. Perhaps more worryingly, she didn’t feel bad about it.\nBut fuck them. They’d been trying to kill her friends.\nShe looked at the cloak, still undecided. She really didn’t know much of\nhow it worked. The Blackguard had taught her that you don’t take a weapon\nyou’re unfamiliar with into battle.\nShe glanced around. No one. She closed her eyes and pictured a\nflamboyant Abornean musketeer’s cloak. Looked down.\nLeagues of brocade and a starry sky’s worth of gold medallions on blue\nvelour, pointed shoulder pads in burnished silver and a starched collar.\nShe touched it, expecting her fingers to pass through the illusion.\nIt was all solid. Real.\nIt couldn’t be. It must be an insanely powerful hex, tricking not just her\neyes, but her mind. Teia closed her eyes tight, waited a few breaths, and\ntouched the cloak again, locking in her mind her certainty that the illusion\nwould be gone.\nIt was solid. Real.\nThe master cloak didn’t fuck around.\nIt was too dangerous to take it until she figured out how to control it.\nShe concentrated again, and the cloak went the flat, solid gray of a\nBlackguard nunk’s cloak, color muted with use, and too short for any of the\nother nunks to borrow. She hung it on the hook at the end of her bunk with\na quick prayer, grabbed her actual nunk’s cloak, and left.\nThe trip to the red tower was a quick walk across the elevated bridges\nthat hung in the air between the Prism’s Tower and the six other towers\nwithout external supports, glimmering like a spiderweb bedecked with dew.\nTeia jogged up the slaves’ stair to Cowardice and Courage, went to the dark\nside of the tower, and found room twenty-seven. She knocked.\nNo one answered. Room twenty-seven was on the outer curve of the\ndark side of the tower; Teia looked down the bending hallways each way,\nwondering if she’d caught a glimpse of a slave leaving down the shadowy\nhall. Best not to be seen at all. Unless that was her contact?"

Unless that was her contact?\nHe wouldn’t appreciate being accosted in the open if he was, so she tried\nthe latch instead. Unlocked. Took one breath, drew in paryl, and went in.\nShe was struck in the face by a beam of light, blinding her after the\nrelative darkness of Cowardice. The light was streaming from the lightwell,\nthe communal reserve of pure sunlight shot down the middle of each tower\nfrom the many mirrors atop them.\n“Lock the door,” a voice said. It sounded slightly off, and Teia knew\nimmediately that it was being altered. Karris had a collar that did that. But\nKarris wouldn’t be concealing her identity from Teia now.\nThat meant Teia was meeting one of the Order’s goons.\nOddly, the realization calmed her. At least she knew what she was up\nagainst.\nShe locked the door. “You mind?” she asked, squinting. The room was\ndark other than that single beam of light, and the door behind her was\ndraped in black cloth so as to absorb the light so it wouldn’t bounce around\nthe room and illuminate it.\n“Light blinds,” a figure seated in the depths of the room said.\nTeia held up a hand against the beam. “Which is why I tend not to stare\nstraight into it,” she said. “Who are you? I’ve got a lot to do. I’m not in the\nmood to play children’s games.”\nWith a clatter, the shutter shut and the room was plunged into blackness.\nShe drafted a paryl torch immediately, flaring her eyes.\n“None of that!”\nShe froze. “None of what?” It could have been a guess.\nThere was a reptilian silence. Teia felt the stirrings of Fear, deep in his\nlair, twisting in her stomach like an old dragon in unquiet slumber.\n“Diakoptês was a lens maker, you know,” the voice said.\nWhen the Order spoke, it was as if it had another language. Diakoptês.\nTeia still had to mentally translate it to Lucidonius. To the Chromeria, he’d\nbeen the one who enlightened them when they were imprisoned in the\ndarkness of paganism. To the Order, he was the great betrayer, the one\nwho’d broken them.\n“So I’ve heard,” Teia said.\nKip’s father Gavin had given him some lenses supposedly crafted by\nLucidonius himself, the most valuable among them sub-red and superviolet\nlenses that allowed any drafter to see in their respective spectra. Whether\nthey were actually Lucidonius’s work or some other genius’s, those lenses\nhad never been duplicated. But that dragon thrashed now, fully awake.\n“You’ve got paryl lenses?” Teia asked. She couldn’t believe it.\n“Not stupid. Good. I require a certain bare minimum intelligence even of\nmy Shadows, though your own master dances close to that flame.”\nOf the few who knew of him, no one spoke of Murder Sharp so\ndismissively. None would dare, except…\nTeia dropped to her knees. “Master. My lord.”\nIt came easily to her, obeisance, prostration. So many years a slave."

So many years a slave.\nBut it was right to be afraid. This was the Old Man of the Desert\nhimself.\nHe didn’t move. Didn’t speak for a long time.\nTeia flared her eyes to sub-red sensitivity, but he was nothing more than\na warm smudge in the darkness. Likely swaddled in many layers, his face\nso dark that he must be wearing thicker layers over it in case she used paryl\nand he missed it. “My lord?” Teia asked finally.\n“None may wear cloaks in my presence. Put yours on the hook by the\ndoor.”\nShe removed her cloak and stood slowly, certain that he had a cocked\nmusket pointed at her. She groped around until she found the hook, and\nhung her cloak on it.\nRight choice. I made the right choice for once, leaving my cloak back in\nthe room.\n“Pull the hook down,” he said quietly.\nShe pulled the hook and a mechanism snapped around the cloak with a\nclick, securing it in place. So the Old Man of the Desert was paranoid about\nhis Shadows and their cloaks, even when he knew (or thought he did)\nexactly which cloaks they had.\nIt was, Teia guessed, perhaps the only way to become an old man when\none ran a network of assassins.\nA light bloomed in the room, cool blue. It wasn’t for her benefit. She\nwondered if it meant he was a blue drafter, or he merely wanted to be able\nto see the expressions on her face as he spoke to her.\nThe altered voice emerged again from his swaddling robes. “You were\nseen getting individual training with Karris White Oak some time ago.”\nTeia’s throat tightened. “Yes, my lord. The, uh, the Archers try to take\ncare of each other.”\n“She took a special interest in you.”\nTeia couldn’t tell if it was a question, couldn’t tell if there were\nsuspicions hidden in that statement. “She seemed to like me. We trained\ntogether a couple of times.”\n“Everything you’ve done tells me I should trust you, Adrasteia. And\nyet.”\nShe said nothing.\n“A crisis is simply opportunity wearing danger’s cloak. On the other\nhand, you know what they say about old warriors and bold warriors.”\n“Uh.” She didn’t.\n“Ah, that’s right. A slave. Not stupid, but not educated, either. No matter.\nI’ll test your loyalty as we go. The perennial problem of a secret order, is it\nnot? The danger of infiltration? You have risen so fast. And your gifts make\nyou so useful, it’s hard not to put you to work. It could be a purposeful\ntemptation. Hmm.”\nHeart pounding, Teia waited again. She turned her palms out, helpless,\nbut didn’t say anything. There were lines here, and crossing any of them\nmight get her killed. On the other hand, she couldn’t seem too self-\ncontrolled, too patient, too formidable.\nFinally she threw her hands up in the air. She was playing the angry girl\nwho would lash out at anyone.

Make her feel she’s doing good by taking you in. That’s an\norder.”\n“Yes, my lord,” she said, as if she felt it far beyond her capabilities.\n“Adrasteia. You admire her, don’t you? Like her, even.”\nTeia swallowed. To lie or not to lie? “I do, my lord.”\n“Never forget.”\n“Forget?” Teia asked. Playing a little stupid had never hurt.\n“You may be called on to kill her and die doing it.”\nTeia prostrated herself. “Yes, my lord.”\n“Do you have doubts?”\nShe nodded, still gazing at the floor.\n“Good. Honest. I would have thought it strange if you didn’t. Adrasteia,\nyour work is so secret that it will be hard for you to learn the wisdom of the\nCrimson Path. But I can tell you this. You will matter. To the Chromeria,\nyou’re an exalted slave. For us, you are a woman who will change the\nworld and leave it better for your sacrifices.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“You worry about Kip?” he asked.\n“He said once that the Order tried to kill him. A Mistress… Hillel?”\n“Indeed. She was one of our best. For who expects a fat middle-aged\nwoman to be an assassin? Not a Shadow, though.”\n“I… He was in my squad, and he was my owner, my lord. I hated being\na slave—I hated being his slave—but he was kind to me. Didn’t rape me.”\nTeia had to acknowledge her closeness to Kip. Bring part of a secret to light\nunbidden, and you might be mistaken for honest.\n“Listen to yourself,” the Old Man said. “He didn’t rape you. Thus he’s\nkind? Don’t you see how diseased that is?

We have learned since then. I swear this to you, Adrasteia. You\nwill never have to act against Kip.”\nThe Old Man of the Desert was very good. He was very, very good. So\nmaybe it was the voice modulator. Maybe it was that Teia had spent some\ntime around the very best. But whatever it was, Teia could tell he was lying.\nSome tiny flutter in his voice, some pause a fraction shortened as if he’d\npracticed beforehand, the stilted lack of contractions.\nFor some reason, until now this had been simply an assignment. Now a\nsudden spark of outrage caught in her soul. You tell me I’m not a slave, but\nyou treat me like a moron?\nHow stupid do you think I am?\nThe Old Man must be accustomed to dealing with idiots. He thought he\nwould draw Teia slowly into his circle until she would do anything for him?\nOh, look, a little girl, a former slave, small and stupid. When it comes to\ndeceiving her, I don’t even need to try. It was as if, as she burst from her\nchrysalis—nothing but that old lie ‘I am a slave’—the Old Man was\nstomping on her before her wings could spread.\n“You’re young, and you know little of our faith yet. It is natural to have\nquestions,” the Old Man said, supremely confident.\nOh. Fuck. You.\nThis little girl is going to tear you apart, Old Man. You have just become\nmy mission in life. What had Kip said? Diakoptês didn’t mean ‘breaker’\nexactly, it was more like ‘the one who rends asunder,’ the one who destroys\nutterly. On Diakoptês’s behalf and on her own, Teia was going to wreck this\nbastard.\n“I guess I just have one,” she said. “Will it be worth it?”\n“Oh. Oh, indeed. We will pull down all the artifice of this world and\nbreak it. We will show how hollow the Chromeria is. We will kill their very\ngod and see them scuttle for the darkness like cockroaches exposed to the\nlight of our fury. We will destroy the very edifice on which their power\nrests, and in the end, they will know we did it for good.”\nTeia pursed her lips and bobbed her head eagerly. Took a deep breath, as\nif this were all she had ever hoped for.\nThese weren’t madmen. They were something more dangerous. These\nwere zealots. More dangerous than merely bad men because they would\nnever rest, but also more foolish. Zealots always wanted to explain, to gain\nconverts.\n“And now,” the Old Man said. “A reward for your good service. And a\ntest, I suppose, to see if you are what you appear to be. You’re a bitter child,\naren’t you?”\nTeia looked up angrily, smoothed it over quickly. Hesitated. “I don’t like\nto be wronged,” she said. He’d talked to Master Sharp. Sharp must have\ntold him how she wanted vengeance on everyone. It was her part now. She"

Not ever, not if she was going to get in.\n“Schedules will be juggled to put you in proximity with the new White.\nYou will begin getting close to her immediately. In the meantime… in the\nnext three days, tag one person with paryl. Whoever’s wronged you, I\nsuppose. Or whoever you wish. Only no Blackguards. No nobles. That\nperson will be dead within the day. My gift to you.”\nChapter 6\nSummon Zymun.\nKarris was in no place to do this now, but there was no way she could\navoid it, either. She’d rejected Zymun at birth; if she repeated the insult\nnow, on this horrible night of all nights, there was no way he’d ever forgive\nher.\nForgiving herself was already out of the question.\n“High Mistress?” Gill Greyling said. He must have pulled a double to be\nstill on duty.\nAccelerate promotion of new Blackguards, even at the cost\nof quality.\nTrainer Fisk—Commander Fisk now—would howl, but she would help\nhim pick out those with a natural gift. The nunks would have to learn as\nthey fought. It would mean more dead, but having veteran Blackguards who\nwere constantly exhausted would mean more dead, too, and if they lost too\nmany veterans, the whole force would be degraded for decades.\nLet the young die, so the old can sleep.\nDammit.\nShe motioned for Gill to open the door. It had been too long a day. But if\nit had been a long day for her, it had to have been nightmarish for Zymun.\nHe’d been called on, so soon after arriving at Big Jasper, to perform the\nFreeing. Seventy-five old drafters had submitted to his knife today. Karris\ncouldn’t imagine what he must be feeling.\nGill didn’t obey immediately, instead giving her a few extra moments to\npull herself together, and nearly commenting on her state. Despite his\nnewness, Gill was going to be an excellent Blackguard. The best of them\ndidn’t look out only for their charges’ physical well-being. Finally, satisfied,\nhe opened the door.\nZymun Guile was seventeen years old, though he looked older dressed\nin his Prism-elect’s finery. Stylishly combed black hair, broad shoulders,\nblue eyes already tinged with a rainbow of luxin, a broad nose, and the\ndevastating good looks that seemed the Guile inheritance.\n“High Lady,” he said, his bow flowing smoothly into his kneeling and\ntouching her foot in obeisance. He looked up at her and swallowed.\n“Mother.”\nShe stared at him, somehow unable to move, to respond. He looked so\nlike his father’s family, a dark mirror to their good looks. Could he not look\nlike her, a little?\nIf he resembled her more, would that make this meeting easier or\nharder?\n“Zymun,” she managed. She took his hand and helped him stand.\nHe mistook her pulling, and hugged her immediately.\nShe froze up, but he didn’t notice."

Mother, I was so afraid you’d not want to see me.” His voice\nquavered on the edge of tears.\nShe couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak.\nHe stepped back, getting control of himself. He dabbed at the corners of\nhis eyes to dry tears she hadn’t even seen.\n“I’m, I’m sorry,” he said. “I was out of line. That was inappropriate.\nForgive me, High Lady.”\nForgive him? The words Karris had barely summoned were snatched\nfrom her throat.\n“No…” She’d meant to say, ‘No, son,’ but she couldn’t force the words\npast her lips. “No, the offense is mine. I know your day has been much,\nmuch harder than my own.”\nHe looked at her blankly for a half a moment. “Yes—yes, I… I don’t\nreally know how I’m supposed to feel about today.”\n“You don’t have to feel how you’re supposed to, Zymun,” she said.\n“How do you feel?”\nHe searched her face, then looked away. “How did father do it?”\n“With immense loathing and terrible guilt,” Karris said. “But, speaking\nconfidentially of course, Gavin’s faith in Orholam and the Chromeria itself\nwas never strong. He had trouble believing Orholam would ask for the\nkilling of innocents, whatever they’d sworn or whether they’d agreed to it.\nIt tore his soul, every time. I didn’t know if maybe it was easier for you,\nbecause you’re younger or maybe have more faith than he did.”\n“I only wish I did, mother. I, I wanted to be strong for you. It was the\nhardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.” He heaved a great sigh. “I’ve been\ntrying not to think about it. But it’s good to honor Orholam in this, right?”\nHe looked up at her as if to check her reaction. “I’m just really amazed at\nthe faithfulness of those who I freed to the light today. They’re like heroes\nto me. The self-sacrificing purpose with which they came to this day was so\ninspiring. And if I hadn’t been coached so well, I couldn’t have done my\nlittle part.”\nKarris didn’t know what it was, but something felt off in his response.\nHe’d killed seventy-five people today.\nWhat was the appropriate response to that?\nThe mind is fickle. She’d seen men who’d learned their entire families\nhad been murdered by wights actually laugh because they simply couldn’t\nbelieve it. Soldiers made rude jokes about the bodies of their dead mates.\nMedics laughed about spurting blood and diarrhea. When life is outrageous,\nthe only appropriate response is an inappropriate one.\nBut an appropriate response, muted?\n“Mother,” he said suddenly, swallowing. He whispered harshly, “I killed\nthem.” He convulsed on a sob barely contained. “All those people.”\nShe felt herself suddenly warm. He’d been trying to play strong for her.\nOf course that was it.

Thrown into a world he didn’t understand, with rules\nhe didn’t comprehend, and subjected to incredible demands, he’d had to\npretend.\nHe went on in a rush, “I tried to tell myself that it was for the best. That\nthey were going to meet Orholam, that I should envy them, but, but it was\nmy hand on the knife. I never—I never asked for this. I never knew how\nhard this would be.”\nShe pulled him close and hugged him to her. He dissolved into her arms.\nHe wept quietly for a minute, and then pulled back, putting a brave face\non. “I… Can we not speak of that again?”\nHolding on to his arms, she said, “Only this, Zymun. You honored\nOrholam and those brave drafters by what you did. And me. You did right.”\nHe bowed his head, pursed his lips under the weight of his emotion, and\nnodded. “Thank you,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry we had to meet like this,\nHigh Lady. And I didn’t mean to talk all about myself. You’ve just ascended\nto the chair. Congratulations are in order.”\n“Thank you,” she said. She finally let go of him. It was as if she were\nslightly out of her body as she looked at him. What was she looking for?\nHerself? He was a seventeen-year-old man, not an infant where you pick\nthis trait from his mother and that from his father.\nOh, look! He has a nose—like his mother does. Oh, look! He has two\neyes—like his father does. What a coincidence.\nBut the very thought of a father made her think of Gavin.\nGavin, dear Orholam. There had been no word, all day, no word of\nwhere he was. It was as if he’d been spirited away, as if she’d never\ndragged his half-blind ass back from the hippodrome in Rath. No word\nabout Marissia, either. The bitch. Karris would be meeting with the banker\nTurgal Onesto soon to see if he might help in tracking Marissia, but she\nhadn’t been able to fit that in today with all the other emergencies.\nShe put on a smile to push both thoughts away. Zymun hadn’t noticed.\n“I’m really proud of you, mother,” he said. “The White! Don’t they\nusually pick old crones for that? And you’re hardly that. I mean, you’re\nolder for a drafter, maybe, but not old old. And so beautiful.”\nHe was not quite gifted with the Guiles’ golden tongue, was he? Even\nKip did better than that. But then, if he hadn’t gotten the Guile charm, from\nwhich parent had he inherited that deficiency?\nAnd he was a young man, trying to impress, and he’d been through so\nmuch. She had to make allowances.\nUnderneath all his bravado and awkwardness, he was probably furious\nwith her for her abandonment and her distance, but wanting her approval,\ntoo.

I had no prospects and no friends. Or so I thought. And I was\nashamed. Not ashamed of you—but ashamed nonetheless, for all the wrong\nreasons. But I want you to know it wasn’t your fault. I didn’t leave for\nanything you did.”\nHis lip quivered, and he looked away, blinking.\nOrholam have mercy. Her heart broke again.\n“No, I… I know that,” he said. “I mean, how could it be my fault? I was\njust a baby, right? I hadn’t done anything yet—good or bad, right? I mean, I\ndon’t know, maybe your pregnancy was really awful? And you blamed me\nfor it or something? I thought about it a lot. I just wanted to know if it had\nbeen something I’d done. Or if, or if I seemed like some sort of monster to\nyou for some reason.”\nWhatever leash she’d held on her emotions slipped through her fingers.\nShe turned her back.\nHow could he have thought that?\nHow could he not?\nBut he kept talking, quickly, always quickly. “I mean, they told me I was\na cute baby, but I didn’t know what you thought of me. They didn’t like that\nI was handsome, actually. At least that’s one of the things they beat me for.\nThey said I was a burden. They said I thought I was better than them. It was\na lie. I just wanted to fit in. I just wanted to be accepted by someone,\nanyone. It all got worse when it turned out I could draft. I could show you\nthe scars if you want? Did you get any of the letters I sent you? They said\nthey’d send them on. They promised. They lied about so many things, but I\nwas certain they were telling the truth about sending my letters.”\nEvery dream she’d had for her son. Every hope she’d nourished that he\nwould be protected, loved, that he would grow up knowing both a mother\nand a father—it all burnt and broke at once. Every nightmare from her long\nnights stepped fully armed from the waves in an instant, invading the\nbeachhead her fears had captured in her mind and setting up camp along the\nwhole coast.\nShe’d wanted to let herself off the hook, all these years: he was with a\ngood family, she told herself. The Ashes were her cousins, and had been\nclose with her branch of the family for generations. She’d thought he would\nbe far from wars and danger, that he would be loved and nurtured.\nBut that was all a fantasy, wasn’t it? That her abandonment had\nsomehow been beneficial to him, and not just a selfish sloughing off of a\nproblem onto someone else. Now that hook eviscerated her, she fell to her\nknees, barely able to breathe through her sobs.\n“Mother, mother, please…” he said, and it was as if he were speaking to\nher from far away.

They’d\nseemed to be such good people, but then, the real monsters had an uncanny\nability to hide right in plain sight, didn’t they?\n“Mother, please don’t turn away again,” Zymun said.\nShe beckoned him to come to her. He was there instantly, sitting on the\nfloor with her, burying his head in her chest. He was taller than she was,\neven sitting, so it was an awkward movement, but she thought she\nunderstood. He had never been comforted by a mother, of course he would\nwant to act like a little boy.\nShe brushed his hair with her fingers, and a tiny ray of sweetness\npenetrated all the bitterness.\nHe nuzzled his head in against her breast. “Mother, please, I’m so afraid\nof you rejecting me.”\n“No, never,” she said. “Never again.”\n“Will you promise me you’ll keep me close? That you’ll never send me\naway?”\n“I swear it,” she said.\n“You swear to Orholam? You swear on your hope of the light?”\nIt was a burden, and it invited future pain. It invited the possibility of the\nkind of hurt that she’d pushed away when Kip had made his innocent joke,\ncalling her mother. She’d failed Kip then; she’d not fail Zymun now.\n“I swear to Orholam, by all that is holy, by all my power and light.” And\nfinally, as that oath passed her lips, as she finally felt that she had done one\ngood thing for him in her life, even if it was only utter some words,\nsomething loosened in her chest, and her throat allowed her to say the word\nthat had been denied her too long. “I swear it… son.”\nChapter 7\n“Kip, it’s been four days. Four days since our wedding, and we still…”\n“I know,” Kip said. He was sitting on their little bed in the captain’s\nquarters. Another dread night was falling, and the back slapping and jokes\nabout being a sneaky little bugger from the captain and the mate and the\nsquad had been endured already. The public torture ended, the private one\nbegun.\n“We don’t have to try again right away,” Tisis said.\n“And you wore that because you wanted to wait until tomorrow?” Kip\nasked.\nIn her initial excitement and ardor at Getting Married and Not to Some\nOld Guy, Tisis had packed all manner of lace and silk lingerie. She was\nwearing a celadon nightgown now that showcased her cleavage and curves.\nKip’s new wife was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen—\neven during the day, when she wore baggy men’s trousers and a tunic too\nlarge for her and no cosmetics. Seeing her like this only made everything\nmore painful. “You know the law…” she said.\n“I didn’t until you told me!”\nShe pursed her lips. She didn’t like it when Kip raised his voice at her.\n“Fine, then. We wait three more days, and it’s over. We’ll just… have to\nfigure it out from there.

His vengeance is anything but rash.”\nShe lowered her head, and Kip saw her swallow quickly. She looked at\nher silk nightgown. “I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have worn this, but I didn’t want\nto tell my sister’s slave to bring me something plainer. She’d ask more\nquestions than they already have.” She mimicked the room slave Verity’s\nnasally voice: “‘Is mistress’s lord husband gentle enough?’ ‘Does mistress\nhave any… delicate questions?’ It’s not supposed to be like this, Kip.\nWhat’s wrong with me?”\n“Tisis, quieter? Please?” Kip said awkwardly. “Remember…” Sound\nwent through the walls of the captain’s quarters as if they weren’t even\nthere. Maybe that was where their troubles had started. Maybe if she could\njust relax…\nAnd maybe this was the stupidest thing in the world to worry about right\nnow. The world was falling apart, and Kip—who had fought an immortal\nand stolen the master cloak from him, who was a full-spectrum polychrome,\nwho was maybe, just maybe, the Lightbringer—Kip who had killed a king\nand a god and escaped the Chromeria itself with all the Lightguard after\nhim, who had brought along with himself the best and brightest the\nBlackguard had to offer—Kip, the son of Gavin Guile, couldn’t make love.\nWith his own wife. Who seemed entirely willing—at least on one level.\nIt was as if her body itself was rejecting Kip.\nIt had all been merely mortifying until Tisis had told him that their\nwedding contract was automatically revoked if they didn’t consummate the\nmarriage within seven days.\n“I’m a failure as a woman.” As she stood outside the covers in her\nbarely-there nightgown, Tisis’s skin was covered in gooseflesh.\nShe bares her heart to you, and you stare at her nipples. Nice.\n“Maybe it’s not you. Maybe I’m doing something wrong,” Kip said\nlamely. Neither of them believed that, now.\nThey were really great nipples.\nShe lifted her eyebrows and pulled back the covers he had bunched over\nhis lap. His tunic covered his arousal about as effectively as Tisis’s\nnightgown covered the fact that she had breasts. He bloused the fabric\ngingerly and cleared his throat.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I didn’t mean to embarrass you. I was just… Your\nbody is doing what it’s supposed to, Kip. I’m the problem. I mean, there are\njokes about how all a woman has to do is lie there. ‘Easy as falling off a\nlog.’ Ha!”\nKip could tell she was heartbeats away from breaking down. Tears were\nnot going to help their problem. “Tisis, maybe we should slow down, take it\n—”\n“Slow down? Kip!

Come here. We’ll figure this out together.”\nShe puffed out her cheeks and crawled into the narrow bed with him. He\nthrew the covers over her. He’d been thinking she would lie down with her\nback to him so they could talk and cuddle, but she lay down face-to-face\nwith him instead.\nBefore he could say anything, she kissed his neck, and all hope of\nrational conversation dimmed quickly. Kip still hadn’t blown out the lamp.\nBut her kisses were perfunctory. She broke away almost as soon as Kip\nwent hazy. She reached for a vial on a shelf. Her expression was\ndetermined, not impassioned. She poured olive oil into her hand and tugged\nhis clothes out of the way.\nHer touch was a shock of pleasure, despite everything, as she spread the\noil on him. If she’d continued for very long, Kip would have lost control.\nBut rather than saying, ‘I want to make love with you,’ the expression on\nher face said, ‘I will not fail my family.’ She rubbed the rest of the oil on\nherself, and straddled Kip, hiking up her nightgown just enough to get the\nwork done.\nThere were no more preambles. No soft words or touches. She held Kip\nin place and lowered herself onto him.\nAs before, he was stopped almost immediately. She grimaced and\npushed harder, harder until she was hurting both of them. She eased off,\nadjusting him, making sure he was in the right place, and then she banged\ndown again, wincing each time.\nAndross Guile had once used a euphemism, calling a woman’s quim the\nJade Gate. Kip had thought it embarrassing. Of course, talking with your\ngrandfather about lovemaking was bound to be embarrassing, but why did\nall the euphemisms have to sound either dirty or childish?\nNow he felt as if he were bringing a battering ram to the Jade Gate. The\ngate was winning.\nTisis began crying, tears streaking silently down her cheeks, making her\ncosmetics run, and still not giving up. She was hurting Kip, and she was\ndefinitely hurting herself.\n“Tisis. Stop. Tisis!” Kip whispered.\nShe didn’t listen to him.\nHe grabbed her hips and held her still. “You’re hurting me.”\n“I can do this,” she hissed.\nMuch as he’d tried to avoid the common areas in the public baths, Kip\nhad been around enough to know that his horn wasn’t freakishly huge. It\nwasn’t that; he doubted he could fit his littlest finger inside Tisis. She said it\nwasn’t her hymen, either. That had broken when she was young. This was\npure muscle, and it was clenched so tight that if he’d been inside her when\nit clamped down, he’d have been left with a jerky stick.\n“Tisis, stop.”\nShe released her hand’s death grip and sat on him, defeated. “What do"

She lay down on him\nand rested her head on his chest. She tried to speak, but then dissolved in\ntears.\nKip figured it was better than her sleeping with her back to him silently\nas she had for the first three nights. Maybe it was his own fault. With the\nshock of the battle and their flight and Goss’s death at the Chromeria and\nTremblefist’s likely death at the cannon tower and Kip’s declaration that he\nwouldn’t be going with Tisis to Rath, they hadn’t even tried to make love\nthe first night.\nThe second night, she’d found out that he really did plan to take the\nMighty to war, instead of going to Rath with her. She’d been furious with\nhim, and he’d been mortified at the idea of having to strip naked and expose\nhis body and his scars in front of a woman whose beauty would make a\ngoddess cringe. She’d blown out the lamp, handed him the olive oil, and\ngotten in bed, legs spread, silent, her whole demeanor saying, ‘Just get it\nover with, you animal.’\nDespite a lack of personal experience, Kip hadn’t been completely\nclueless—he’d thought. Tisis had gotten spitting mad with his fumbling,\nfinally taking charge herself. And… nothing. He’d found nowhere to go\nwhen he was on top, not because he was an idiot; he’d found nowhere to go\nbecause there was nowhere to go. They’d pretended to sleep, back to back.\nThe crew’s jokes the next morning had been unbearable. And that was\nwhen Kip had missed his opportunity. He should have confessed to…\nwhom? One of the Mighty? None of them had even hinted that something\nlike this was possible. The randy captain? Ugh. Someone, anyway, that\nthings weren’t going well. Or going at all.\nBut how stupid could you look? What kind of mockery did that invite? I\ntook a beautiful woman to bed, and I didn’t know what to do?\nThe third night had been better and worse. Tisis hadn’t told any of her\nslaves, either, apparently as ashamed as Kip was. She’d failed her family\ntoo many times, she’d said. She wasn’t going to fail again. But she’d\ndecided she wasn’t going to take it out on Kip, and then she’d begged his\npardon.\nThey’d made some perfunctory moves at kissing and caressing—and\ntried and failed again. She’d been furious, but not at Kip.\nI should have made love with Teia when I had the chance.\nThe one thing Kip had thought he’d definitely be getting when he’d\nagreed to marry Tisis, he was being denied.\nMaybe he should let the marriage be annulled.\nBut Andross had assigned Kip to this task.

She had been a hostage of the Chromeria, a\nguarantor of the end of the Blood Wars between Ruthgar and Blood Forest.\nShe could leave Big Jasper legally after she was married, but leaving before\nthat without permission was a breach of the articles of peace—something\ndamn near akin to an act of war.\nIn normal times the Ruthgari hostage leaving without permission would\nbe a diplomatic gaffe understood between friends. During a war in which\nthe loyalty of Ruthgar was in question, it would be far worse. If Eirene\nMalargos actually was on the brink of siding with the Color Prince,\nregaining her beloved sister would give her freedom to join him if she\nwished it. If the Chromeria handled the gaffe poorly, though, threatening\nher, it might actually push her into the Color Prince’s camp. Annulling their\nmarriage could mean breaking an alliance.\nTisis’s sobs had quieted, and she shifted as if to get more comfortable to\nsleep on Kip. Which was actually really nice. Way better than frigid silence.\nBut the motion made her leg brush Kip’s horn. Great. Here for a moment\nhe’d nearly forgotten about it. She froze.\nShe sat up. Her makeup had run, and her eyes were puffy, and there was\nclear snot under her nose. “I should at least take care of you,” she said, her\nvoice sniffly, right on the verge of crying again.\nIt was not a thought that hadn’t occurred to Kip in the last four nights.\nKip the Lip was back, already speaking: “In the history of the world,\nthere have been five great unromantic invitations to romance, but this… this\noutshone them all.”\nShe pounded a fist on his chest. “Kip! Not funny!”\n“You’re smiling.”\n“I am not.” But of course she was. Her face was a war of humor and\nfrustration and despair and tears. “It’s either smile or cry, and I hate crying.”\n“I have an idea,” Kip said.\n“What?”\n“Not a good idea, mind you.”\n“What is it?”\n“All I can promise is that it’s a little better than crying.”\nChapter 8\nIf this had been any other time in his life, Gavin could have taken the shock,\nabsorbed it silently, and gone on to the next appointment of an overfull day.\nIn every down moment, he would have chewed through the surprise. He\nwould have lain it down for six or ten hours, not thinking about it at all.\nAnd then, passionless, he would pick up that shock late in the day and\nrationally decide what to do about it.\nBut in this gray hell, there was nowhere to go. Nothing to do. Nothing\nelse to think of. Little to see except the expectant face of Marissia, like a\nloyal hound expecting a beating.\nExcept not loyal.\nNor a hound."

Little to see except the expectant face of Marissia, like a\nloyal hound expecting a beating.\nExcept not loyal.\nNor a hound.\n“Not a slave?” Gavin asked. “You clipped your own ears? Who would\ndo such a thing?”\n“I was eighteen years old when I came to serve you,” Marissia said.\n“But I had been deeply in love with you for three years already. Though\nyou’d never seen my face. From as early as I could remember, I’d heard\ntales from my friends, from my mother, and my grandmother. Everyone\nknew about the perfect Guile brothers.”\nGavin wondered sometimes if he’d been so stupid when he was young\nthat he hadn’t seen how different his life was from everyone else’s. He and\nhis brother had taken the affection and attention as their natural due, and his\nmother had muted people’s more exuberant gestures skillfully. In many\nways, he’d had no idea that not everyone grew up as cherished as he did.\nShe went on. “I didn’t pay much attention to the False Prism’s War. It\nwas so far away from Blood Forest. I knew there was some horrible girl\nwho was to blame for everything, and that the fighting was awful. I thought\nyou must be very brave. And then the war was over, settled in some distant\nland, and almost immediately, the Blood War started up again.”\n“Tell me. Tell me everything. Give me it all.” Maybe he could regain his\nequilibrium if he didn’t have to speak for a while.\nShe still couldn’t meet his eye. “My experience of the war was almost\nanticlimactic. My family was wiped out by pieces, and each time, I was\nsupposed to be at the places the raiders hit, and I simply… wasn’t. For me,\nit was like my family disappeared slowly, every time I turned my back. I\nnever saw their bodies. I never felt the heat of the burning fields, or touched\nthe broken gates. I never smelled the forbidden magic still steaming in the\nair. A cousin would bring in a confirmation: he’d seen the bodies himself,\nthere would be no ransom, there was no mistaking my sister’s death, then\nmy father’s, then later my mother’s. There was no false hope, but also never\na chance to grieve. The land that had been taken from us was being held by\nenemies. There would be no visits to graves, no remembrance wreaths, no\ndirges or holy fires against Long Night.\n“I was brought quietly to the Jaspers—and found out that after I’d left,\nmy cousins had been killed, too. I decided I had been spared for a purpose.\nMy grandmother Orea was more distraught than I’d ever seen her. And then\nyou came back from Rath. You’d just ended the Blood War, which had been\nsimmering for centuries. You simply ended it, with a fatal wave of your\nhand.\n“I think my grandmother had been about to move against you, before\nthat. But that changed her.\n“She found a peace again.

One day, my grandmother spoke privately to your mother; Felia\nsaid you were dissatisfied with your current room slave, and she herself was\nunhappy because the woman was spying on you. So Orea asked your\nmother if she might procure a girl for her. She said she’d give you an\nexcellent room slave as a gift to make up for past friction. I was\neavesdropping, and as your mother gave her the description of what she\nwanted for you, I realized it fit me perfectly.”\n“But to become a slave…” It was the greatest fear for every family in\npower. Losing a war didn’t mean becoming a tradesman: nobles were either\nat the top, or reduced to death or the most onerous servitude possible.\n“I’d lost everything, Gavin. My family. Our fortune, which wasn’t large\nto begin with. The Pullawrs’ power had dwindled since Ulbear Rathcore\ndied. My grandmother refused to use the power of her office to help us\nunfairly. Her integrity was the slow ruin of us. Your father had some grudge\nagainst Ulbear, and I think he orchestrated much of our downfall. The\nSeaborns had bled to seize our lands, so there was no way they were going\nto simply give them back to anyone, certainly not to an eighteen-year-old\ngirl with no army or fortune.”\n“The Seaborns?!”\n“Yes. And yes, Brádach Seaborn did recognize me. He shouldn’t have.\nWe’d never met. But he’d known my sister, and the resemblance was\nstrong. Strong enough, apparently. I don’t know if he killed her himself, or\nif he merely allowed her murder. But I goaded him into hitting me. I knew\nyour vengeance would be swift and terrible. I thought you loved me. It was\nthe first and last time I manipulated you. I’m sorry. It was the only way I\ncould see to get vengeance for my family. I had no idea how far things\nwould go.”\nGavin had killed Brádach Seaborn for beating Marissia and put his head\non a pike. The Seaborns had eventually sided with pirates to get vengeance\non the Guiles for that. Almost all of them had ended up hanged, and their\nlands seized.\nAll from one slave’s lie.\nHaving known Marissia always as his own property, Gavin had trusted\nher to act in good faith, which to him had meant in his interests. After she’d\npassed his trials of her faithfulness against the White, Marissia had become,\nin Gavin’s view, an extension of his own will.\nInstead her own secrets had led to lies, and lies to death.\nIt wasn’t as if she were the only one. He’d made his own choices, and\nthe Seaborns had, too. What did it matter now?\n“But Marissia, a slave?” He couldn’t get past that.\n“My grandmother couldn’t intervene for me in the satrapies’ politics. Or\nwouldn’t. The White is supposed to be above politics, and things were so\ntenuous here. My prospects were limited. I’d been trained to run a large\nhousehold, to manage slaves and servants, to see the proper protocols were\nobserved, to check the books but not to keep them myself, to see that\nanimals were properly tended but not to do the tending, to check that the"

I was useful as a chatelaine, but\nuseless for all else.\n“Of course, I was a fool for thinking that. One who can learn so much by\neighteen can easily learn more. But I knew I would never have my dream. I\nwould never be that high lady with six or eight children embracing her,\nwhich had been all I ever wanted. So I volunteered.\n“I knew I had been saved for some great purpose, and what could be\nhigher than serving the greatest Prism of all time, Gavin Guile? They told\nme that if you accepted me, I would be with you for years. Maybe many\nyears, if I did well. It was almost a marriage, to a desperate foolish heart\nlike mine.”\nIndeed, anyone who married a Prism would know her marriage would\nlikely last only seven years. Gavin had been with Marissia for more than\nten.\n“My grandmother was desperate, and I solved so many problems for her.\nBut she never forgave herself for letting the blacksmith clip my ears.\nBecause the moment he cut, our course was set.”\nHere Gavin thought he’d tried the most insane gambit possible to save\nhimself in the fallout of the civil war. He felt numb. Marissia. A Pullawr.\n“It wasn’t a bad life,” she said.\n“What?”\n“I served the Seven Satrapies. I got to see my grandmother, whom I had\nalways loved dearly, almost daily. I wouldn’t have seen her ever if I’d had\nmy old dream. She would have been here, and I would have been off\nsomewhere, paired with some fool or other who wasn’t half my equal.\nThat’s what grandmother said, when she was trying to look on the light\nside. And I got to be with you. And you loved me after your way, didn’t\nyou? Not quite in the way I thought you did early on, but you cared for\nme.”\nThere was something plaintive in how she said it, as if she couldn’t bear\nto make it a question, but wanted to know the answer more than anything.\nNot stupid, Marissia. Of course she’d seen through that lie, eventually.\nShe, who was closer to him than anyone, had eventually realized what\nbeing a slave meant.\nHe wanted to break down in horror for what he’d done, for who he’d\nbecome, but if he did, the orange in him knew she would come comfort\nhim. He, who had hurt her, would take from her even comfort.\nGavin had once thought his father a fool because the old man had been\nso close to Gavin and had never seen him for what he was. He himself had\nbeen closer still to Marissia and had never seen her at all. It was a bitter\nmirror to hold.\n“Marissia, I did—”\nBut his pause, the very pause he’d taken because he had been trying to\nbe fair to her, was too long. She took it as a negative. She swallowed, and\ninterrupted, “My lord, it was an honor to serve you. But not one I would\nrepeat, given the choice.”"

But not one I would\nrepeat, given the choice.”\nHe squeezed his eyes tight shut—and pain lanced through his left eye.\n“Marissia, please…”\n“Don’t lie to me now, my lord.”\n“I loved you as a master loves his best slave. I was well pleased, but I\ntook it as my due. I never saw you, Marissia.” And that says nothing about\nyou, and everything about me.\nShe took it like a slap in the face, but after a moment, she breathed.\n“Truth, from Gavin Guile. I should thank you for that.”\nHe was not exactly Gavin Guile, either. But that was a confession too far\nafield.\n“Marissia… Marissia. You did more for me than anyone. I owe you\nmore than I can ever repay. But I have nothing to give you for all you’ve\nsacrificed for me.”\n“Then see me now.”\nHe looked at her, unsure what she meant.\n“Talk to me. Talk to me like I’m a free woman. Like I’m your friend.\nLike I’m here.”\nAnd so they talked. They talked of people they had known. They talked\nof Marissia’s childhood, and her family, and of her grandmother. Marissia\nshared stories Gavin had never heard of the old woman, and not just of her.\nMarissia told him of intrigues in the Chromeria he had never even guessed\nat. She told him about times he’d almost caught her spying for her\ngrandmother.\nSomething tight in Gavin’s chest loosened.\nDespite their situation, they laughed.\nFor once, Gavin imitated his mother rather than his father, and asked\nquestions rather than giving commands. As Marissia spoke, and Gavin\nlistened, she became more animated than he had seen her in years. She\nglowed beautifully, unmissable. Yet Gavin had missed her.\nHe saw her now.\nAnd though time had no meaning down here, and the gray light never\nvaried, they spoke what must have been long into the night. Finally she\nstood and stripped off her slave’s dress, leaving only her shift. She crawled\nup onto his narrow convalescent’s palanquin. He had a bad feeling, but she\nmerely draped her dress over the two of them as a makeshift blanket. There\nwas no way he could deny her the comfort of his arms, and he needed the\nwarmth. She snuggled against him, and soon fell asleep.\nHis left arm was around her, with its two lopped-off fingers. His left eye\nwas toward her, blind and seeping. He was a cripple, in the prison he\nhimself had constructed, and he was holding the wrong woman.\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered to this woman who had lived and would die\nfor him. “I’m so, so sorry.” But for this cold night, he cuddled close to her\nand thought of his wife.\nKarris, will I ever see you again?\nChapter 9\nThis wasn’t shit creek.

This was\nI can’t even see land.\nIn the three days since Sun Day, Teia hadn’t had a single moment when\nshe could go see Karris. Every waking hour had been filled. Double shifts\nwith the Blackguard, guarding Carver Black and other members of the\nSpectrum as they’d investigated what exactly had happened in the city,\nsometimes being debriefed herself about what she knew, and then clearing\nrubble and scraping floors with the other nunks on the top floor of the\nPrism’s Tower. The nunks weren’t even excused from lectures, so Teia had\nonly had a few hours’ sleep each night—and no time at all to sneak away\nand meet Karris, even if the woman had left a response to Teia’s signal that\nthey needed to meet.\nTeia had wanted to report to Karris before she’d talked to the Old Man.\nNow it was absolutely necessary—and utterly impossible. Teia was being\nfollowed. If she met with Karris and was seen, it would mean the death of\nboth of them.\nBut Teia had a superpower that no one had counted on: she was\ncompletely paranoid. She had thought she was being followed a hundred\ntimes since she’d started working for the Order, so she’d figured out a thing\nor two.\nOne, she was a paranoid mess.\nTwo, she was pretty good at it.\nShe knew all the places where she could lose a tail. Whether in the\nChromeria itself or on Big Jasper, she knew some good tricks, and she was\nalways adding to her list.\nSo. No time to sit here gulping like a beached fish. Find the tail, lose the\ntail, and then report. She could worry about everything else after that.\nShe started walking, quickly, heading back to the barracks and the\nmaster cloak. The first thing to do was to figure out how many people were\nfollowing her, and who they were.\nIf you were being followed by a team of professionals, it was well nigh\nimpossible to tell. The front-follows, the handoffs, the disguise switches—if\na squad had three or four people of medium height and build in any area\nwith decent traffic, there was no way you could figure it out.\nBut Teia didn’t think she was being followed by a team. Whoever was\nfollowing her had to be able to see paryl.\nOf course, if the Old Man really had paryl-viewing spectacles, he could\nsimply lend them to anyone.\nBut would he let such a priceless treasure out of his own hands? No. If\nthe Old Man was half as paranoid as Teia was, he wouldn’t dare let his only\ndefense against the shimmercloaks out of his sight.\nThere weren’t many paryl drafters in the entire world, so the odds that\nTeia was being followed by a team of them was low—though of course, the\nOld Man would be the one person in the world who would have access to\nan entire team of paryl drafters—\nAgh! That way madness lies.\nTeia had to make her guesses and jump. So: she was most likely being\nfollowed by a single paryl drafter. That might be wrong, but there was no\nsitting still in this war of shadows until she could find out for sure. She had"

If she didn’t mark\nsomeone, she would undermine her own pretense of being a peevish,\nvindictive woman eager to inflict her rage upon the world. Losing her\ndisguise among the Order wouldn’t be dangerous, it would be fatal.\nPut simply, if she didn’t pick someone else to die, she would.\nIt wasn’t a call she wanted to make herself. Teia was no assassin.\nI’m not a killer. I’m a soldier. A secret soldier, but a soldier under\nauthority, a rightful and good authority, Karris. Karris would know what to\ndo.\nIt’s different from being a slave, when you choose it.\nBut time was running out. Her deadline for tagging someone was\ntomorrow morning, and Teia couldn’t talk to Karris while she was being\nfollowed.\nAt the barracks, she shed her regular cloak, picking at an imaginary stain\nbefore tossing it in the laundry basket for the slaves to clean. She looked\naround, and her paranoia was piqued again. Was someone in this room\nsecretly a paryl drafter, ready to follow her, or ready to report to those who\nalready were? Which of the men and women here were traitors?\nWith her squad, the Mighty, she’d never needed to worry about that.\nNow she was so alone.\n“Teia,” Watch Captain Fisk said gruffly as she headed out, the master\ncloak folded over her arm.\nHe was standing at the door to Commander Ironfist’s office.\n“Teia, get in here.”\nSomething about seeing him there stirred fury in Teia’s soul. He didn’t\nbelong in that office. Didn’t deserve to even set foot there. She walked up to\nhim, but didn’t go inside.\nShe stood at attention. She wouldn’t have minded Trainer Fisk—it was\nhard not to think of him that way, even though he’d been promoted months\nago to watch captain. She’d liked him, even, for his gruff competence, until\nthey’d figured out he danced to Andross Guile’s secret tune. He’d allowed\nthe cheats that had nearly barred Kip from the Blackguard.\nAnd now he was her commander.\n“Yes, sir?” Teia asked stiffly. She didn’t want to be in an enclosed space\nwith him if she could help it.\n“What’s this?” Fisk demanded.\nHe had dark circles under his eyes, and his usual rigorous military\nbearing was slouched with fatigue. He was not tall, but he was a hard knot\nof muscle on muscle with a shaved head and short beard.\n“Just tired, I guess, sir.”\n“By order of the promachos, I’m acting commander of the Blackguard,\nTeia.”\nShe hesitated. “Congratulations on your… swift rise, sir.”\n“I don’t like it, either,” he snarled. “I’m the one who demanded it be\nonly ‘acting commander.’ He was my commander, too, nunk. And my\nfriend.”\n“Yes, sir.” Neutral, noncommittal. The flat acquiescence of a slave had\nits uses still."

The flat acquiescence of a slave had\nits uses still.\n“Who would you have put in before me?” he demanded.\nMaybe he’d been right. This wasn’t the kind of conversation they should\nbe having out in the open barracks. “Sir, I’m just a soldier, raised from a\nslave. I don’t question my betters.”\n“Watch Captain Blademan was found dead this morning in East Bay.\nSharks took too much out of him before his body could be recovered for us\nto even know how he died.”\nTeia swallowed hard. Would the Order have done this? But why?\nAndross? So he could place Fisk as commander? The Color Prince,\ndeliberately eliminating Blackguard leadership?\n“I’d have picked him to be commander before me, even with his\ntroubles,” Fisk said.\nThat was true. Teia was so accustomed to seeing plots everywhere that\nshe was discounting the simple explanations out of hand. Blademan could\nhave been killed in a tavern brawl. He’d been a man who ricocheted\nbetween long stretches of sobriety and short bouts of violent drunkenness—\nand when he got drunk, he’d earned his Blackguard name Blademan a\ndozen times over.\nTeia ducked her head. “I’m sorry, sir, I know he was a friend.”\n“And I’d have picked Karris before him, before all this. But none of us\ncan fill Ironfist’s shoes, and he shouldn’t have been relieved of command.”\n“I, I wasn’t saying—” Why was Fisk telling Teia this? They’d never\nbeen close. “Sir, can we talk about this later? I’m on my way—”\n“You think I’m a traitor. We need to talk,” Fisk said. He moved out of\nthe way of the office door. “Now.”\nIt was a gut punch. Teia’s expression and silence must have spoken for\nher. Might as well admit it and see where this went.\nShe stepped inside, and he closed the door after her.\nShe swallowed hard. When you’re short and light and not that strong,\nbeing penned in was the last thing you wanted if it came to a fight. “Not a\ntraitor, sir. But compromised.”\n“Why?”\nIn for a den, in for a danar. “You called Breaker ‘Kip the Lip.’ Only his\ngrandfather called him that. And only privately. And then you rigged the\nrules.”\nFisk took a deep breath. He rubbed the bridge of his nose as if he had a\nheadache. “Not much rigging required.”\nTeia couldn’t speak. Out of all the things she might have expected, a\nstraight admission of guilt wasn’t on the list.\nFisk looked down. “I had… a relationship with another Blackguard. He\nfound out.”\n“He? Andross Guile?”\n“Who else?”\n“So Andross blackmailed you. For how long?”\n“Just that one thing against Kip. Although he told me my failure at it\nmeant I still owed him.

The promachos may be a horrible person, but he’s\nnot irrational.”\n“So is he still blackmailing you now? Is he blackmailing your lover?”\n“No, and he can’t. I confessed everything to the White after…”\n“After?”\n“After Lytos died.”\nTeia twitched. Lytos? Fisk’s relationship had been with a eunuch? How\ndid that even work…?\nOf course she knew of slaveholders forcing their eunuchs to serve them\nsexually, but otherwise a eunuch was assumed to be asexual. That was the\npoint, wasn’t it? That a free eunuch might want a sexual relationship hadn’t\neven occurred to her—and it had to be a sexual relationship because\nBlackguards weren’t forbidden other relations, so they couldn’t be\nblackmailed with anything else. What sort of satisfaction would a eunuch\nget out of…\nThen again, she didn’t have to understand the mechanics of the thing.\nShe could see the emotion of it. “I’m… so sorry for your loss.”\nThe tightness around his eyes eased a little: he’d been worried she\nwould mock him or think him a pervert for falling in love with a eunuch.\n“Anyway, none of that matters,” he said. “I stopped serving Andross after\nLytos died and—”\n“Lytos didn’t just die, though,” Teia objected. Winsen, peerless archer\nthat he was, had feathered Lytos’s heart as Lytos had helped Buskin try to\nassassinate Kip. “Andross Guile tried to make you stop Breaker from\njoining the Blackguard. You failed. Did Andross send Lytos afterwards to\nkill Kip, to stop him once and for all?”\nFisk shook his head. “I don’t—I don’t think so. When I confronted the\npromachos, he said he not only hadn’t blackmailed Lytos, he’d never even\ntalked to him. Andross Guile said that for him to ruin a eunuch’s\nrelationship would be like an emperor stealing a gold ring from a beggar.\nSuch a theft changed nothing for the emperor, but by whatever improbable\nmeans that beggar had gotten that gold ring, he’d never get another one in\nhis life. Andross said it would show a meanness of spirit to ruin such\nhappiness, no matter how puzzling he found it. The promachos is not a\ngood man, Teia, but I believed him. I still do. He is ruthless, but he’s not\ncruel for its own sake. At the same time, I can certainly believe that\nsomeone else found out our secret and used it to blackmail Lytos into\ndoing… what he almost did. Neither of us could have lived with having\nbeen expelled from the Blackguard.”\n“Why are you telling me this?” Teia asked.\n“Because you know what it is to love someone forbidden you.”\nTeia went cold. Fisk? Fisk had been able to see how Teia felt—before\nshe knew it herself? She moved to object, but he spoke over her.\n“I’m telling you because you’re utterly loyal to Breaker, and you stayed"

Cruxer believed Breaker was the\nLightbringer with the fervor of a prophet. She thought so, too, but she\nwasn’t worried about being part of history or something grand like that. She\nfollowed Kip because he was both great and good. That was enough for her.\nAnd it had to be enough now, because more wasn’t an option now that\nTeats Tisis was scabbarding his sword.

Sure, but they were\ndumb kids. Kids believed stupid stuff all the time, right?\nThis was different. Dour Trainer Fisk believing it?\n“Why would you—” she started.\n“We’ve all heard the stories. It’s just that some people don’t want to\nbelieve them. ‘He shall rise from green’ doesn’t have to mean coming from\nthe Blood Forest or Ruthgar. It could mean he starts out drafting green. One\nof the first glimmers of Breaker’s magical genius showed when he went\ngreen golem in the Battle of Garriston—he’d never even heard of going\ngreen golem. He intuited it on the spot. His will was so strong, he drafted a\ngreen that stopped musket balls, Teia. ‘He shall kill gods and kings’? He’s\nalready done both. ‘He’ll be an outsider’? How much more outsider can\nyou be than a mixed-blood bastard from Tyrea? Each of those things offend\nthe luxiats, and all of them together make their blood boil—as it makes\nthem furious that a Lightbringer would be necessary to put their worship\nright—but hasn’t Orholam’s work always offended those in power? I won’t\nput myself on the wrong side of Orholam. ‘In the darkest hour, when the\nabominations come to the shores of Big Jasper, when Hope himself has\ndied, then shall he bring the holy light and banish darkness.’ ‘Hope\nhimself,’ Teia. That’s Gavin Guile. He’s dead. Our darkest hour is coming.\nWe have to pick a side.”\nTeia’d heard it translated as ‘hope itself,’ but that was maybe beside the\npoint.

For some reason, Teia hadn’t thought through what it would mean for\nthe world if Kip really was the Lightbringer.\nIf he was the Lightbringer, he would shake the pillars of the earth. At the\nLightbringer’s coming, the pious, the desperate, the poor, the naïve, the\nfools, the idealistic, the young—all those would flock not to the\nLightbringer, but to their hope of what the Lightbringer would do for them.\nTo those who had nothing, he could be everything.\nWhat had happened to those first tribal warriors who spilled out of Paria\nwith Lucidonius? They’d become Names. They’d ruled satrapies. Men and\nwomen who’d been thralls and stonecutters and foresters and mercenaries\nand brewers had become luminaries and generals and High Luxiats.\nAt the same time, to everyone who had power now, he would be\nterrifying. He would bring rebellion even in the best of times. But now? At\nthe very time the Chromeria needed a united front against the Color Prince,\nKip might splinter it from within—without even intending it.\nFor purely utilitarian reasons, the Chromeria itself might want to kill\nKip, who’d never shown disloyalty for a moment.\nBut those who kill their friends for the trouble they might cause don’t\ndeserve friends.\n‘Deserve’? Am I still thinking about power as if morality belongs in the\nsame conversation with it?\nTeia said, “He didn’t leave me here to spy. I decided my work with the\nBlackguard was what I was called to. But we are still friends. I don’t deny\nthat. That friendship doesn’t abrogate my loyalty to my oaths, sir.”\n“Not yet.”\nTeia licked her lips and admitted, “It won’t. Ever. Orholam forbid that\nsuch choices ever face us.”\n“But if it did…?”\n“This is like you’re asking a mother if they had to sacrifice one of their\nchildren, which one they’d choose. It’s a cruel question and it won’t\nhappen.” She prayed.\n“And if it does?” he asked.\n“I’ll do the right thing, sir.”\n“Ha! Best answer I could imagine. Anyway, I wanted to let you know\nwhere I stand before I raise you to full Blackguard.”\n“Sir?!”\n“You stand vigil tonight in the Prism’s chapel. At dawn you take the oath\nwith a few of your brothers and sisters. Your first shift as full Guard will be\non the White’s detail tomorrow at noon. We’re putting some traitors up on\nOrholam’s Glare. I recommend you get some sleep now. It’s gonna be a\nlong couple days.”\nTeia was thunderstruck. Full Blackguard? So soon? Was Commander\nFisk so pressed for new bodies to fill the details, or was he trying to use his\ntime as commander to pack as many good people into the Blackguard as\npossible? She mumbled a thanks and opened the door to leave.\n“He hesitated, you know. Lytos,” Commander Fisk said quietly, looking\naway from Teia. “At the end. Breaker didn’t tell your squad about it, but he"

Lytos changed his mind, turned away from his treason.\nHe was moving to attack Buskin to stop him when Winsen killed him. It\nwasn’t Winsen’s fault, so Kip didn’t tell him. Lytos shouldn’t have been\nthere in the first place, so Breaker kept the burden of that knowledge on his\nown shoulders. But he wanted the White to know. When you’re a leader,\nyou protect the living first, but you honor the dead as you can. It’s the kind\nof grace I’d expect from the Lightbringer. And… and Orholam saw to it that\nword of Lytos’s ultimate faithfulness got to me, the one person to whom it\nwould matter most, so I wouldn’t have to remember him as a traitor. That’s\nOrholam’s mercy, isn’t it?”\nChapter 10\nTime is the only prison from which prison frees us. Gavin woke with a new\nsense of vigor. Of course, the light was still the same, so he had no idea how\nlong he’d slept. He accepted his ignorance as a gift. He’d slept until he was\nno longer tired.\nAnd he felt better. Stronger than last night, the pain faded from his eye\nto a dull throb. He felt almost his old self. Or, he thought as he stretched\nand became aware of it, maybe that was just his erection.\nSomehow, despite the narrowness of the palanquin, neither of them had\nfallen off it in the night, and Marissia’s form was plastered to his. The curve\nof her butt was holding down what was straining to be up.\nHis twitch seemed to waken her. He couldn’t shift away. He’d been\nimprisoned nude, and with Marissia only in her light shift, she could hardly\nhelp but notice his state if he moved. Marissia knew his body like no one\nelse in the world.\nBut then she made his stillness moot by shifting her own position. She\nhesitated, and gave a luxurious moue. She’d always loved morning sex. “Is\nthat for me?” she asked.\nIt wasn’t, but it seemed rude to say so. He cleared his throat as she rolled\nover with impressive dexterity, anchoring a leg on his hip and looking into\nhis face. She pulled her body close.\n“You’re feeling better, aren’t you?” she asked.\n“Much.”\nA cloud passed over her face. “Then your father will take me away\nsoon.”\nAnd like every freedom, the freedom from time offered by this prison\nwas revealed to be a lie. Gavin said, “I can pretend to be sicker than I am.”\n“But we can’t know when he’s watching, so that’s hopeless, isn’t it?”\nGavin hesitated, then said, “Yes.”\nShe looked into his eyes with a serenity that defied sense. “He’ll kill\nme.”\nGavin nodded, throat thick. She was a loose end.\n“Will you do me a favor?” she asked.\n“Anything.”\n“Make love to me.” Her fingernails brushed lightly down his back in the"

She was a loose end.\n“Will you do me a favor?” she asked.\n“Anything.”\n“Make love to me.” Her fingernails brushed lightly down his back in the\nway he liked. But having really seen her for the first time just last night,\nhow could he now ignore her deep currents and see only the surface?\nEasily. Oh so easily.\nHer eyes were hot, intense, full of longing and grief and fear. “One last\ntime, please. Show me I meant something to you.”\nOrholam have mercy. Gavin remembered the last time he’d made love\nwith Marissia, just before he’d left the Chromeria, how he’d felt as if he\nwere somehow cheating on Karris, though that was before they’d married.\nHe’d rejected the guilt then: every lord kept a room slave. Most kept more\nthan one. Gavin was downright abstemious by comparison with others, and\ncertainly compared to others in his class.\nThat day Marissia had made love to him like fire, all longing and hidden\nrage and despair.\nNo wonder.\nAnd she felt all that again now, and worse. She said, ‘Show me I meant\nsomething to you,’ but she meant, ‘Let’s blot out feeling and fear. Let’s do\nwhat we’ve always done.’ She would make love as if it would make him\nlove her.\nMarissia pulled her shift away from between them, and her body was hot\nagainst him. And not for the first time in his life, Gavin split. His body said\nwhat his will did not. Marissia’s ears had been clipped. She had been sold,\neven if she’d chosen it. She had been a slave, hadn’t she? She’d been\ntreated as a slave, so that made her one, didn’t it? And slaves weren’t quite\ncovered by wedding oaths, were they?\nHe owed her this. She’d made love to him many times when she\nprobably hadn’t really wanted to. Didn’t he owe her this once?\nAnd he did want to.\nBut Karris. Karris, his wife.\nShe would never find out. If she found out, she would understand. If she\nunderstood, she would forgive him, as she had forgiven him so many other\nthings.\nBut what another will forgive is shitty ethical measurement, isn’t it?\nKarris would understand that she’d married a faithless piece of shit. Karris\nwould understand that you don’t blame shit for being shit. It’s your own\nfault for thinking you could polish shit and find gold.\nI’m tired of being shit. Of being a liar. Of being an oathbreaker.\nThis wasn’t about Karris. It was about Gavin and what kind of man he\nwas.\nGavin the Liar. Gavin Get Along, who wanted everyone to love him…\nand quietly cheated in the background. Gavin the Gray.\nGavin’s hunger was a trumpet, blaring in his own ear. His body wanted\nsatisfaction. It knew the pleasures of Marissia’s body. He deserved this,\ndidn’t he? He should take what small comfort he could. Some sweetness.\nAfter all he’d been through.\nIf Marissia had made the slightest move to please him, had rocked her\nhips against him, had brought his hands to her breasts, had kissed his cold"

She knew him that well. More than that, her self-control\ntold him that she loved him that much.\n“Marissia,” he said, pained.\n“Karris,” she said. It was defeat. It was heartbreak. She scooted back,\nunhooked her leg from over his. Her face fell.\nShe deserved so much more.\n“My oaths, Marissia. They’ve been worth nothing for my whole life.\nThis is my last chance.”\nShe got off the palanquin and swallowed. “Am I always to be cast off\nand second best, my lord? Here at my end, is there nothing left for me?”\nAnd then she wept. There were no corners in the spherical cell, but she\nhuddled as far away from him as possible, knees to her chest, hiding her\nface. She’d wasted her whole life on him.\nWhere was his golden tongue now? Gavin sat up with effort, and pain\nlanced through his burnt eye again, leaving him breathless for a long\nmoment.\nThere had to be something to say that was honest and true and\ncomforting, but Gavin wasn’t a master of words like that.\n“So you live.”\nGavin nearly got whiplash looking for the source of that oddly\ndisappointed voice. A panel had opened in the wall, and something stung\nGavin’s chest.\nHis one good eye took in his father in a split second. He wanted to lunge\nand kill that old bastard—\nBut he looked down. A dart was stuck in his chest, and it felt warm. So\nwarm.\n“Marissia,” Gavin said. But he wasn’t sure what he wanted to tell her,\nnow. His thoughts were thick, gooey. This was it. The end.\n“Put these on, caleen,” Andross Guile said. He stood powerful, as if he’d\ndropped twenty years, and packed on a few sevs of muscle. He tossed a pair\nof manacles over to her, utterly certain she would obey. He didn’t even see\nher.\nAndross stared at Gavin, an intensity in his deep eyes, but he said no\nmore.\n“You can’t. I need her,” Gavin said.\n“Need her?” There was an edge of dark amusement in his voice.\n“Please. Please don’t kill her. I’ll go mad without her.”\n“Go mad? You’re worried about going mad?” Andross said. He laughed,\na free and open sound in the cell, and turned away, dismissive.\nGavin swung his legs over the side of the palanquin. He stood, wobbled,\nbraced himself on the palanquin. The warmth had spread everywhere.\nHe blinked, suddenly on the floor, drool dribbling down his cheek. The\ndart in his chest was gone. The palanquin was gone. Carried out by Marissia\nand Andross? He tried to speak, but couldn’t make words.\nBut Marissia and Andross hadn’t left, not yet."

He tried to speak, but couldn’t make words.\nBut Marissia and Andross hadn’t left, not yet.\nThe last thing Gavin saw was Marissia’s tear-streaked face as she was\npulled out of the prison, hopeless, broken, looking back at him for what he\ncouldn’t give.\nAnd then she was swallowed by the darkness.\nChapter 11\n“Are we being bad?” Tisis asked.\n“We’re being naughty. There’s a difference,” Kip said. The morning sun\nangled in through poorly sealed cracks in the walls of the captain’s cabin,\nemphasizing how little privacy they had. “Are you ready?”\n“I better be,” she said. “She’ll be along any minute now. Take off your\ntunic.”\nThey’d been up half the night talking. But plotting was one thing,\ncarrying it out was another.\n“Oh, I just had another idea,” Tisis said, keeping her voice low. She sat\nup in the narrow bed and swung her slender legs over the side. She’d put\nher lingerie on again after their little disaster last night, adding a light robe\nto her camisole and underwear. “Tunic, Kip,” she said, throwing off her\nrobe and tossing it into a corner.\nHe’d seen her in beautiful underthings several times now, and she’d\nbeen nude during his very first interaction with her at his Threshing, but Kip\nwasn’t even close to being accustomed to seeing Tisis’s body. Before he’d\nknown her, he’d actually kind of hated her for being so flawless. He’d\nthought at the time that she’d tried to kill him, and she had made him fail\nthe Threshing. But still. Hating someone for being beautiful was kind of\nperverse, wasn’t it?\nAnd he was really the last person who should hate anyone for what\nshe’d inherited. Kip had somehow gone from the whore’s boy to the\npolychrome husband of the richest heiress in the Seven Satrapies—all\nbecause of his father. Of course, that he had been a hypocrite to hate her\ndidn’t make it easier.\nIt wouldn’t be so bad if she were just beautiful. Even just among the\nsquad, the young men had different preferences. Cruxer was a sucker for a\npretty face and dark kinky hair like Lucia had had. Ferkudi waxed poetic\nabout a bottom that could shake your house like an earthquake. Big Leo had\nwanted a petite girl, and when Teia had made fun of the obvious size\ndifferential that would create, Leo had said, ‘Yeah, petite, like you, Teia, but\nyou know, with breasts.’\nLater, in training, she’d accidentally kicked Leo in the stones. Twice.\nThe problem with Tisis was that she was exactly the type of beautiful\nKip liked most. Skin light and exotic to a boy from the hinterlands of Tyrea,\nthe vanishingly rare true blond hair, a huge smile, radiant hazel eyes, a\nheart-shaped face, and that body. Those breasts.\nKip tried not to think about those.\nWhich wasn’t easy, with them straining the silk of her camisole with its\ntiny straps and its deep cut into her cleavage.\nKip loved Teia, but Tisis.

Woman, you are the reason some\nugly smart guy invented language—simply so he could have some chance\nagainst better-looking men to woo you.\nIn typical Kiply fashion, though, he’d realized he loved Teia and then\nmarried Tisis not half an hour later.\n‘With my body, I thee worship,’ part of their archaic wedding oath went.\nWell, that part was going to be easy.\nShe stepped close enough that she pressed that worshipped body against\nhim. “This’ll put the cream in the kopi,” she said.\nKip was familiar with the bitter drink, and at first he thought it was\nsexual innuendo. He was about to say something about her skin being\nlighter than his, so what they were actually trying to do was put kopi in\ncream.\nUnless by cream, she meant his—\nThen he realized she meant, ‘This will be the finishing touch.’ Not an\ninnuendo.\nRight. Excuse me for going there.\n“Tear my camisole,” she said.\n“Nrg?”\nShe grabbed his hands. “Like we were so passionate you ripped it open\nlast night.” Her eyes sparkled as she put his hands on her chest, clearly\nloving the game.\nThe second night they’d actually tried to make love, Kip had nervously\ndeferred to Tisis to lead things. She’d said she was only technically a virgin,\nso Kip figured even that made her way more experienced than he was.\nShe’d gone quickly from tearing off clothes to attempting penetration, and\nafter that hadn’t happened and she’d been left fuming and trying to blame\nhim, it had seemed like too much to ask to say, ‘Hey, do you mind if I just\nplay with your body a bit? I like it.’\nOn the fourth night of their marriage, with the addition of olive oil and a\nsingular focus on breaching the Jade Gate lest their marriage be annulled\nand they start a war that no one could win and that would kill tens of\nthousands of innocents and be remembered ignominiously for all time, Kip\nhadn’t gotten a chance for his playfully wandering hands to wander much at\nall, playfully or any other way.\n“Kip?”\n“Mmm?”\n“The camisole?”\n“Mm-hmm?” he said, lost in the gloriousness under his hands. “Oh!”\nHe cleared his throat and tugged gently on the deep neckline of her\ncamisole, trying to ignore that a camisole of this material, with this much\nlace, and dyed this color, might cost more than all the villagers in Rekton\nwould have seen in a year. Inside, Kip was still the poor boy, and he\nwondered if he always would be.\n“Oh, for Orholam’s…” She grabbed his hands in hers and helped him\ntear the neckline down to her navel, but then she held his hands there. They\nboth hesitated. She did some kind of undulating feline movement into him\nthat did all sorts of wonderful things. “I never did take care of you, did I?”\nshe asked.\n“It wouldn’t take long, I promise,” Kip said.\nShe looked at the door and grimaced. “Verity’ll be here any—”"

Why? Why do I want to be naughty with you when I can’t, but when\nit’s perfectly acceptable and I have all night, then I can’t? Dammit!” She\nground her hips against him angrily, kissed him, and bit his bottom lip.\nThen she pushed away from him.\nNever breaking eye contact, she shimmied out of her underthings and\npeeled off her camisole, throwing each to a separate corner of the room. She\ntousled her long blonde hair. She scooted into the narrow bed and pulled the\ncovers only over her legs, as if she were totally comfortable being nude in\nfront of her husband. Which, of course, was what Verity needed to believe.\n“Ah! Idea!” Tisis said. “Love bites. We’ll have to do that tomorrow.\nTunic, Kip. Off. Then get over here and give me some whisker burn on my\nneck. Quickly.”\nKip’s mother had once said that if he pulled a funny face for too long it\nwould get stuck. Could the same happen if your horn was up for too long?\nWhat if it got stuck? Orholam, let it not be so. The Blackguard blacks that\nthe Mighty had been allowed to take were a nice camouflaging black, but\nthey were also tight.\nThere was a knock at the door, and Kip realized suddenly that somehow\nthe plan had always been that he answer the door naked. And then he had to\npretend to be comfortable with that. Like he was the kind of man who\nwould answer the door naked because wow, after a night like last night,\nwho could think about clothes?\nThat hadn’t been his addition to the plan, he was sure of it. Even if Kip\nwere slow-cooked in a stew of sexual satiety until he fell to pieces, he\ndidn’t think he’d ever not want to cover himself.\n“My lady, my lord? Breakfast,” Verity said from outside.\n“My lord husband, would you get the door, please, and then come right\nback to bed. It’s so cold without you,” Tisis said loudly. She grinned at him.\nKip shucked off his tunic, acutely aware of Tisis’s eyes on him. Part of\nhim knew that his modesty was ridiculous at this point. Though he’d kept\nhis tunic on during their abortive attempts at intercourse, she knew how he\nlooked by now. Still, it was one thing to know he was fat, another to see it.\nHe held his tunic in front of him in one hand casually, covering as much\nof belly and groin as possible, and popped the door open. Even with that,\nbeyond Verity, he saw a sailor try to get a glimpse beyond Kip at the nymph\nthey all knew lay within.\nKip just gave the man a self-satisfied smile, and closed the door after\nVerity came in, balancing a silver tray in one hand and a steaming bucket of\nwater in her other."

She yawned and\nstretched luxuriously, uncovered.\nKip forgot about the plan. He dropped his tunic from nerveless fingers.\nHe snatched it off the floor, almost colliding with the slave through his\nsudden lurch in the tiny cabin.\n“Perhaps milady would prefer to bathe and dress first?” Verity asked.\nKip tried to slip around behind her just as she bent over suddenly to put\ndown the bucket. His groin brushed against a bottom so large and wide that\nFerkudi would faint.\nMercifully, his fist and the wadded tunic ran interference in the split\nsecond before Kip could twist, taking the contact on his hip rather than his\nhorn. He made it past her, but his motion jostled her as she set down the\nbucket, slopping water on the floor.\nVerity stood slowly, leaving the bucket on the floor. With the air of one\nextremely put out, she sighed, looking at the mess. Then she glared\njudgment at Kip, naked as he was. Kip swallowed.\n“Does my lord need something?” Verity asked.\nKip had picked up on the very subtle cues that Verity didn’t approve of\nTisis’s marrying without her sister Eirene’s consent. She had extended that\ndisapproval to Kip himself.\n“Sorry,” Kip said.\nShe sniffed and turned to Tisis, muttering none too quietly, “A proper\nlord would know not to apologize to slaves.” She raised and brightened her\nvoice: “Milady?”\n“Only a sponge bath?” Tisis asked, disappointed.\n“I fought the captain long and hard, milady. He avers fresh water is too\nprecious on a voyage to be used for bathing.”\nVerity took a folding screen and set it up to block Tisis from view,\nthough the logic of that escaped Kip. Verity spoke aloud, too, as if the\nscreen were a real barrier. “I see that your lord husband has mussed your\nbraids. I suppose we shall have to set aside a few hours to fix them this\nmorning. I think you should also speak to him about procuring a room\nslave.”\n“What?” Kip interrupted. “Why would I need a room slave? We have\nyou.”\n“I’m not that kind of room slave, my lord. You’ll need to get your own\nfor that.”\nTisis started laughing immediately, but Kip didn’t understand.\n“My lord doesn’t need that kind of room slave, Verity,” Tisis said. “I’m\nkeeping him quite contented.”\n“Many a lord tells his wife that while seeking additional pleasures on the\nside. But a lord who strays must have the decency to do so safely, so as not\nto bring disease and dishonor to his house.”\n“Verity!” Tisis said. “I’ll not have you speak so.”"

First, he wanted to laugh incredulously.\nVerity was worried he wanted to take her to bed? And then all the rest\ncrystallized as dirty whispers, not quite directed at him, but definitely\ndirected at him.\nHe had long felt like a bumpkin lost in the tightly circumscribed\nmanners of the nobility, and the customs of slaveholding were the most\nopaque to him, and made him more reticent than anything else.\nIt was baffling to him that when he made mistakes, if anything erred on\nthe side of being too nice—giving a gratuity or looking a slave in the eye or\napologizing—slaves resented those slips most. It was as if they were saying,\n‘Don’t break the rules. They’re all we have.’\nThey knew how to deal with abuse, or with being ignored or taken for\ngranted, but making them remember all the privileges of freedom was too\nhard.\n“Hmph,” Verity said. “You’re a woman married now, Mistress, and it’s\ntime you face facts. Your duty in the bed chamber is to provide my lord\nwith children. It is his to satisfy your carnal desires fully. But you have no\nreciprocal duties on that count. If he desires activities you don’t enjoy or\neven ones you do more frequently than you wish to indulge him, he has a\nroom slave for that. Of course, as the lady running the household, it is your\nduty to procure a room slave pleasing to your lord husband.”\n“Orholam have mercy,” Tisis said.\n“It is his mercy,” Verity said. “What else are slaves for, but to ease the\nburdens on my lady?”\nThe old Kip would have shrunk back, would have accepted the slave’s\nsly insinuations.\nKip swept the folding screen crashing aside. Verity was dunking a cube\nof soap into her bucket. Kip hauled her up and pinned her against the wall,\nhis fire-scarred left hand around her throat.\n“You listen to me,” Kip growled. “I keep my oaths—all of them,\nincluding my wedding oaths—and if you impugn my honor again, I swear\nto Orholam, I’ll throw you overboard for the sharks.”\n“My lord, I wasn’t—”\n“We both know you were.”\nShe’d gone limp. Just another slave being abused by another master.\n“Look at me. Look at me!” he shouted.\nShe looked at him with the cold impassivity of a woman who didn’t\nvalue her life much. Or perhaps the cold terror of a woman who thought she\nwas going to die.\n“You can hate me, but you will not pour poison in my wife’s ears about\nme. Not while I’m here. Not while I’m gone. Do I make myself\nunderstood?”\n“Perfectly, my lord.”\nHe released her. “If you can’t stand to serve us loyally, we’ll sell you\nimmediately. I’ll even let you choose which offer for you we accept.

I won’t\nsend you somewhere terrible as a punishment, but I also won’t have you\nhere.”\n“Yes, my lord,” she said quietly.\n“Now take the laundry and get out. I’ll have your answer by tonight.”\nShe moved around the cabin more nimbly than Kip would have\nimagined possible, gathering Tisis’s cast-off clothing and noticing but\nmaking no comment on the tears. She mopped up the spilled water, and Kip\nrealized then that he was still naked. Tisis was staring at him, but there was\nno teasing now. She was holding a cloth up in front of herself, and she\nlooked a little scared.\nOh hells. Did I just jump the wrong way?\n“My lord?” Verity asked. “Do you wish me to launder your tunic as\nwell?”\nHe was holding it in his hand still. “Uh… yes? Yes,” he said. It did\nactually need laundering. He’d been training on deck daily with the squad,\nand though he washed himself daily, he hadn’t gotten around to cleaning his\nclothing. At the Chromeria, you put your dirty clothes in a basket and they\nmagically appeared the next day, clean and folded on your bed.\nBut he didn’t hand over the tunic.\nVerity handed him a towel. “For your sponge bath, milord,” she said. It\nwas big enough that he could hold it in front of himself while he handed her\nthe tunic.\nShe walked to the door with her pile of laundry. “Oh, milord? Just in\ncase my lady is too delicate to speak of such things, and since you’ll be\nwashing yourself. Do make sure to clean well under your foreskin. A lady’s\nperfumed garden ought to be fragrant, but a gentleman’s oak should smell\nonly of soap.”\nKip was so aghast that he couldn’t say anything. Tisis snorted. Kip just\nshook his head, acknowledging that she’d scored a point.\nHer mouth pressed to a line briefly to avoid smiling, Verity walked out\nthe door. “I’ll return in due time to dress milady and take the dishes. My\nlord. My lady.”\nIt was only as she closed the door behind herself that Kip realized the\nparting tease had been a test, too: Was Kip the kind of master who would\nhurt her at any provocation, or had her adultery insinuation crossed one of a\nrelatively small number of important lines? It was the kind of thing a slave\nwould want to know.\nHe sat down on the bed, not knowing whether he’d passed or failed, or\nwhat either meant about him.\nTisis had pulled the screen back into place, and she was continuing her\nsponge bath. “You scared me, but it was a good distraction.”\n“Huh?” Kip asked, coming out of his reverie.\n“Distracting her like that so I could wash myself. She told me yesterday\nI didn’t smell like sex.”\n“As if I’m that smart.” Kip only realized he’d said it aloud afterward,\nbut Tisis said nothing from behind her screen.

Kip pulled on his\nunderclothes and his clean blacks.\nWhen Tisis emerged dressed in her moss-green tunic and breeches with\na leather belt that emphasized her slender waist, she had an odd look in her\neye. “So you knocked down the screen because you were actually angry?”\n“Yes?” Kip said. Was this a trick question? “Am I a bully?”\n“You’re a lord,” Tisis said as if it were a strange question. “The gentry\nknow your titles, but they also know what you were before you came to the\nChromeria. We’ll devour you if you let us, Kip. Even our slaves. That’s\nwhat we do when we’re threatened.”\n“Is it always to be battles and contests, even with my own side?” Kip\nasked.\n“Only if you lose the important ones,” she said. She saw he didn’t\nunderstand. “Kip, in Lucidonius’s time, Karris Shadowblinder was a theatre\ngirl. It was considered the next thing to a prostitute by polite society. No\none talks about her as a theatre girl now. She became a Name. There is no\nmiddle path for people like you and her. You’re suddenly elevated greatly,\nand everyone wants to know if you deserve it. Me? I can be some lady born\nto a great family with one or two excellences, but little else worthy of\ncomment. That path is closed to you. You come in suddenly at the top, and\neveryone else feels like they’ve been knocked down a notch. You have to\nprove yourself.”\n“Even to slaves?”\n“Slaves take not only orders but also cues from their masters. Verity was\nEirene’s governess. Eirene sending her to serve me? You think that wasn’t a\nlittle dig? My sister was implying that I was acting like a child. But it’s also\nbecause she trusts Verity.”\n“If I’d known that, maybe I wouldn’t have threatened her with death,”\nKip said, grimacing.\n“About that. Were you angry because it was true, or because you wanted\nher to think it was?”\nSomething about her intensity drove all thoughts out of Kip’s mind.\n“Because what was true?” Kip asked.\n“That you keep your oaths.”\nSo of course Kip thought immediately of the oaths he hadn’t kept: one to\nhis mother, to avenge her rape by his father—a story that had all been\nnonsense from an addict. And then he’d sworn to Gavin that he would\ndestroy Klytos Blue. He’d been doing his best to investigate the Color\nthrough the forbidden libraries, but he’d never found anything damning\nthere, and had broken that oath, too. He said, “Maybe I was so furious\nbecause I’ve failed oaths before.”\nAnd he told her about them, without too many specifics. She was still a\nMalargos, after all.\n“But you consider your wedding oaths binding, and plan to do all in\nyour strength to keep them?” she asked.\n“Yes! Absolutely,” he said.\n“But you love her.”\nHer. Teia. It was a gut punch. So Tisis wasn’t oblivious. Kip hadn’t said\na word about Teia. Tisis had picked that up from what? A few glances?\nDo I lie?"

A few glances?\nDo I lie?\nAfter a pause this long, a lie would be pointless, wouldn’t it?\n“Yes. I think so. I don’t know. I’ve been infatuated with like four girls in\nthe last two years. Always the impossible ones. Maybe that’s why you’re\nterrifying. You aren’t just not impossible; you’re not just possible; you’re\nactual, and the rejection will hurt that much more when it comes, won’t it?”\nHe’d meant to use the technique his grandfather had taught him: use his\nblunderbuss of a mouth to his own advantage and see how the other person\nreacted to whatever outrageous truth he’d fired at them.\nExcept that Tisis didn’t respond at all. She merely looked at him.\nWell, now Kip felt naked in a new way that was nearly as uncomfortable\nas the first.\nThen she said, “When you wouldn’t take off your tunic, were you hiding\nyour scars, or your… stomach?”\n“You can say fat,” he said.\n“I will not.” She said no more, and he couldn’t help but be impressed by\nher quiet dignity.\n“Did they teach that in lady school?”\nHe didn’t mean to say it out loud. But she didn’t respond. Again.\n“Sorry,” he said.\n“How did you get those?” she asked, as if he were being a willful child.\nWhich was sort of fair.\n“Too much pie.”\n“The scars,” she said, missing his attempt at humor, though he couldn’t\ntell whether it was on purpose or not.\n“I lost a bet,” he said. He was taking the totally wrong tack here, sailing\nstraight into the storm instead of quartering the waves.\n“With some kind of animal?” she said angrily. “Kip, there was a part of\nour vows that said, ‘Let there be no darkness between us.’ Why are you\nlying to me about stupid stuff?”\nIt was supposed to be the setup for a joke:\nA bet?\nI bet dinner that I could get out of a locked closet. The rats bet I\ncouldn’t. I was dinner.\nNo one had ever really laughed at that joke, but he thought that was\nmaybe in the delivery.\nRight as he was about to explain and apologize, she said, “About those\nvows. If she showed up, and she became possible, and I would never\nknow…”\n“I’m not adding ‘cheater’ to the list,” Kip said.\n“The list?”\nDamn. Caught out. And no joke was possible now, not after the ass he’d\nalready been. “The list of things I, uh, dislike about myself.” Loathe.\n“That decides it,” she said.\n“Decides what?” Kip asked.\n“Reeny is going to be so furious,” Tisis said. She squared her shoulders\nand straightened her back. Reeny? Oh, her sister Eirene. “But if you can’t\nrun away with your husband, who can you run away with?”\n“What?” WHAT?!\n“I’m not going home, Kip. I’m going with you.

Try to stop me and our deal’s off.”\n“Empty threat?” After all that talk of failing family…\n“How about this one, then?” She stepped close and grabbed his crotch\nthrough his clothes. “This stays with me. If you choose to leave my\npresence, you’ll go without it.”\n“Oh, come on, it just finally went to sleep.”\n“You find threats of me tearing it off arousing?”\n“Not when you put it like that.”\n“So it’s settled. I’m going,” she said triumphantly.\nHe pushed her back. “Tisis. This isn’t a game. We’re going to war.\nYou’re no fighter.”\n“And you’re no noble,” she said. “But we’ll teach each other.”\n“Tisis, it’s different. Nobles won’t kill you—”\n“If you believe that, you’re a fool.”\nWell, shit. Kip’s very pause was an admission of defeat.\nTisis said, “You don’t know it yet, but you need me as much as I need\nyou.”\nShe smiled coyly, but at least she didn’t rub in the victory.\n“The squad’s not going to like it,” Kip said.\nShe pointed at him. “Haha! I beat a Guile!”\nHe hoped his face was a study in Nonplussed Kip. But she only smiled\nbeatifically for a moment, thawing him more than he would admit.\nThen her mouth pursed in quick disapproval. “Also, did you really put\nclean clothes on your dirty body?”\n“Yes?”\nShe clucked in mock horror. “My lord husband, surely you must know, a\nlady’s perfumed garden ought to be fragrant, but a lord’s—”\n“Ah! Fine! I’ll wash!”\nChapter 12\nTeia climbed down the tower using the servants’ stairs. Just a little screw\nyou to her tail. The stairs themselves were clogged enough with servants\nand slaves and discipulae that there wasn’t much purpose to it other than\ninconveniencing him and giving herself time to think.\nShe went to the main floor and across to the other stairs, and went down\nfarther still. Commander Fisk had given her an idea.\nIn a few minutes, she was at the dungeon. Few people were kept here\nexcept a couple of drafters immediately before Sun Day. Those who’d\nbroken the halo would be put in rooms of colors safe to them, or blackened\nrooms for polychromes. With Sun Day just passed, there should be no one\nhere—except whoever was going to be executed tomorrow.\nTwo of Carver Black’s tower soldiers were stationed in front of a heavy\noaken door. As Teia approached, they stood respectfully. The tower soldiers\nhad always had reasonably good relationships with the Blackguards, but\nwith the influx of Andross Guile’s Lightguards, whom they hated, they now\ntreated the Blackguards like dear friends.\n“You’re holding the accused for execution tomorrow?” Teia asked.\n“Yes, sir,” the elder tower soldier said. He was long past his prime, stiff\nknees and lots of experience."

        "text": "“You’re holding the accused for execution tomorrow?” Teia asked.\n“Yes, sir,” the elder tower soldier said. He was long past his prime, stiff\nknees and lots of experience.\nHe wasn’t being rude at the sight of a petite young girl who—to another\ntower soldier—might look like the epitome of how far the Blackguard’s\nstandards had fallen. Quite the opposite, in fact.\nThrough a quirk of protocol, tower soldiers always addressed\nBlackguards as ‘sir,’ regardless of gender. Apparently it had originated with\nsome gaffe or deliberate insult involving a particularly manly Archer. The\nBlackguards had turned it back on the tower soldiers, demanding that every\none of them be called sir—when Teia had complained to Quentin that\nlanguage was weird, he had speculated that it was perhaps analogous to\nhow all magisters were called magisters regardless of gender, rather than\nmagistri and magistrae, while the declensions of the nouns for their pupils\nwere retained as ‘discipula,’ ‘discipulus,’ ‘discipulae,’ and ‘discipuli,’ while\na mixed group of girls and boys went by the feminine plural ‘discipulae.’\nAs Quentin had explained to Teia, “Language isn’t weird. People are\nweird. Language makes sense until people get their phoneme pukers on it.”\nTeia had no idea what that meant, but she got the gist.\nThe younger man looked at his officer, obviously unaware of the\nprotocol. “Uh…”\n“Later,” the older man said. “How can we help you?”\n“I need to interview them,” Teia said.\nThey looked ready to say no.\n“I’m on the execution detail tomorrow, and they’re not telling us\nanything,” Teia said. “I’ve got to… ascertain in what respects they may\npresent dangers… to the assemblage.”\nWith soldiers, if you spoke bureaucratese, they’d assume you’d been\nassigned to do it. All the bullshit orders come dressed in jargon. If you just\nsaid what you wanted, they knew it was your own idea.\nShe switched back to her own tone. “You know what happens if\nsomething goes wrong during the execution—it’s on us. With all that’s gone\non recently, the Blackguard ain’t takin’ another hit.”\nThe older soldier looked as if she were asking the impossible and he\nhated to say no.\n“Look,” Teia said. “I’m not even a full Blackguard. I’m doing my vigil\ntonight. I’ve just been on duty, and after holding vigil all night, my first\nofficial detail is watching what everyone tells me is a horrific way to die.\nOrholam’s Glare is the death they scare drafters with from the moment we\nfirst learn we can draft. The Blackguard’s stretched thin to breaking, and it’s\nall made worse by those Lightguard assholes running my friends off as if\nthey’re traitors. I know this isn’t the normal way of doing things—but\nwhat’s been normal about anything recently? You can take all my weapons,\ndo whatever you need. I just need to talk to them so someone can check it\noff a list. And I’m not going to have my first official act be lying to my\ncommander by telling him I did it if I didn’t. But I don’t want to start my\nservice by failing a simple assignment, either. Can you cut me some slack?”"

Can you cut me some slack?”\nMomentarily, Teia was kind of impressed with her own lying.\n“Not many Blackguards would let us take their weapons. Your lot tend\nto hold that privilege pretty fierce,” the older man said. It was a singular\nright: Blackguards were allowed weapons in the presence of satraps and\ndiplomats and Colors and the Prism himself. It set them apart from\neveryone else, not least the tower guards like these men.\nTeia quirked a grin. “Eh, if you ask me tomorrow when I’m a real\nBlackguard, I might not give them up so easy!”\nThey laughed together, and Teia put her weapons on the table.\nThe old man moved to unlock the door. “I’d not get in arm’s reach of\nthat false prophet. I know you have training and all, but madness gives ’em\nstrength. The young luxiat mostly sits there and cries. But madness… You\nnever know. Last one’s the drafter, watch them vipers. No offense. Oh.\nShoes.”\n“Shoes?” she asked.\n“You have to take off your boots. Put on these.”\nTeia hadn’t noticed, but there were slippers of various sizes on a mat.\nShe stepped into the appropriately sized pair.\nThe door opened onto the strangest prison Teia had ever imagined. All\nthe surfaces were lined with mirror. Orange lux torches provided a single\ndim spectrum of soft light.\nThe older soldier accompanied her down the shimmery hall. Even the\nfloor was mirrored, the slippers polishing the pounded silver with every\nstep. They approached the first door and the soldier handed Teia a mirror\nmounted on a handle. He demonstrated how she should use the mirror to\npeek around the corner to see any threat. Then, after she’d put the\nspectacles on, he handed her a tiny knife with an oversize handle. The blade\nwasn’t even as long as her little finger was wide.\n“Hellstone,” he said to her puzzled look. “If they somehow draft. Drains\nout their luxin without killing ’em. Works on you, too, though, so don’t let\n’em take it from you. Oh, and if they capture you, our orders are to go in\nwith muskets firing. We don’t try to recover hostages. They know it. It’s not\na bluff. We’ve done it before.”\n“Great. Thanks.”\nHe left and she heard the door being barred behind her.\nShe opened the window inset in the door of the first cell. She extended\nthe mirror, and was surprised that she knew the man therein. She closed the\nwindow. It was the Color Prince’s prophet, the spy handler she and the\nMighty had surveilled months ago. He’d tried to kill Big Leo. It wouldn’t\nbother her to see him executed or to leave a paryl tag on him for\nassassination. Good option, maybe.\nShe walked down the mirrored hall farther, little slippers scuffing a floor\nthat really should have been cleaner. Men.

No, sir.\nTeia opened the next cell’s window, peered in with the little angled\nmirror, and paused. The young man inside had his head down, ignoring the\nsound of the opening window. He was a disheveled mess, but there was\nsomething familiar about him, too.\nOrholam have mercy.\n“Quentin?” Teia asked.\nHe froze up, and it was an admission of guilt. A moment later, his head\nsnapped up. “No,” he said. “No, no.”\n“Quentin, what are you doing here?” Teia asked. She unlocked his door\nand stepped inside. Teia was petite, though stronger than many would\nguess, now. But if there was one man from whom she had nothing to fear, it\nwas Quentin. He was skinny to the point that it was painful to look at him.\nHe so often forgot to eat while studying, he probably weighed less than she\ndid. He was a brilliant mind, though, a polymath who mastered subjects\nwithin months that took others a full career. He read scrolls and books\nwithin hours, and remembered nearly everything he read.\nHis was the kind of scholarly mind that came along once in a generation,\nif it was a great generation.\n“Quentin, what’s going on?” she asked. His cell was a cube with mirror\nwalls and floor and a luminous orange ceiling that gave a sickly hue to the\nboy’s skin.\nHe looked at her with such shame that she thought he was going to\nthrow up. “They found me,” he said. “They never gave up.”\n“Who? What?” she asked.\n“I didn’t even know her name when I did it,” he said.\n“What?”\n“It was supposed to be Kip,” he said. “I didn’t know him or any of you\nthen. It was before I’d met you.”\n“Quentin, what the hell are you talking about?”\n“But I knew. When he gave me the orders to do it, I knew it was wrong.”\n“What did you do, Quentin?”\nHe looked up at her as if he couldn’t believe she didn’t already know. “I\ntried to kill Kip. Lucia stepped in the line of fire. I didn’t mean to hit her…\nBut I did try to murder him, so it doesn’t really count as an accident, does\nit?”\n“No,” Teia said, aghast. Quentin had become their friend. Twitchy,\nnervous, and scared a lot, but they’d written that off to his having the\nlopsided brain of a genius.\n“It was why I swore an oath to Kip that I’d never lie to him. I was\nhoping he’d ask, one day. But he never did, and then he left, and I thought\n—I thought maybe Orholam had forgiven me. But then the Blackguards\ncame. They’d never given up on finding who’d killed her. I was hoping they\nwouldn’t take me alive.”\n“You? You shot Lucia?” Teia had barely seen the hooded figure raise the\nmusket.

Some assassin whose bullet had been intercepted\nthrough Orholam’s will alone. Not a scared kid. Never Quentin.\n“It was pathetic how easily they turned me. A little bit of threatening, a\nlittle bit of bribery. That’s all it took. I knew it was wrong, Teia. They’re\ngoing to execute me, and I deserve it.”\n“Who sent you?” The orange light in here was making Teia feel as\nslippery as the Old Man of the Desert himself.\n“High Luxiat Tawleb. I told the White as much. But he’s sworn it’s a lie,\nof course. And what is my word against his? I’ve no evidence.”\nIt was true; Teia could tell. There was no guile in Quentin’s voice or\ngaze.\nTeia hadn’t been friends with Lucia. She could tell early on that Lucia\nwasn’t going to make the cut to become a Blackguard. Why make friends\nwith someone who wasn’t going to be around long?\nIt was practical, but also somehow heartless.\n“Quentin, I came down here hoping to find a solution for a dilemma.\nSeems I have.”\nShe tagged Quentin with a paryl marker for the assassin.\n“What dilemma?” Quentin asked. “What do you mean?”\nBut this murderer wasn’t entitled to an explanation.\nTeia left.\nChapter 13\nKip stood in the captain’s cabin, trying to put on his Breaker face before he\nheaded out to face the squad.\nThey were going to be rightly livid with him. After all their training, the\nMighty had reached a rough equivalency with each other, a working\nstrength. Adding Tisis to the Mighty’s war party would be like adding a fifth\nleg to a dog. They couldn’t help but trip over her, have to compensate, slow\ndown, and get tentative as they had to protect her.\nBut here he was.\nHe opened the door to a bright shining noon, good wind and few clouds.\nHe acted nonchalant, as a young groom would be after a wild night of\nconnubial exertion. Just a twinge of smugness as he walked astern toward\nwhere the Mighty were working to create a skimmer.\nThe captain, a black-haired, fair-skinned Blood Forester with long\nmustache and beard like a lamprey attached to his face, grinned at him as he\nwalked past.\n“Finally found the pearl button, huh?” he asked, slapping Kip on the\nback and laughing.\nThe what? But Kip just blushed ruefully, accepting the teasing as if he\ndidn’t think the man was an asshole.\n“Day five!” the captain said. “Ha! We had bets going. You won me two\ndanars. Seems like a smart lad, I said, and that’s one eager lass he’s got\nthere if I don’t miss my guess. Won’t take him a whole week, I said. I was\ndrunk.

Four times, lying side by side, throwing their\nbodies around to make the bunk squeak and Tisis crying out while Kip\ngrunted and groaned and then they tried to muffle the sounds of their\nlaughter.\n‘Four times?’ Kip had asked Tisis. ‘Isn’t that a lot?’\n‘Not really. I mean sometimes when I…’\nIn sub-red, Kip could see the heat of her blush spread through her face\ndespite the darkness. ‘When you…?’ he’d asked.\n‘Uh, when I’ve heard people talk about lovemaking,’ she’d said.\nEven though he’d had the impression that wasn’t what she was talking\nabout, he said, ‘I always thought those were exaggerations, bragging,\nbecause then I’d hear the older Blackguards joke about not being that young\nanymore.’\n‘But we are young,’ Tisis had said.\nYoung enough that neither of us knows how many climaxes in a night is\nbelievable, Kip had thought. So they’d faked four for her and three for him,\nand laughed and plotted until the early hours. He’d had as much fun in bed\nas you could have without having as much fun as you want to have.\nApparently they’d hit the correct number to be believable for their age,\nthough, because the captain raised his hands in quick surrender. “Didn’t\nmean no disrespect.” He grinned. “Quite the opposite. Good day, my young\nlord.”\nPearl button?\nThe Mighty were deep in discussion at the stern, where they were\nbuilding the skimmer. All wore their blacks, with the insignia of the Mighty\nat the collar: a powerful figure with arms outspread, radiating power, but his\nhead downcast as if in prayer or concentration or grief. No matter how\nmany times Kip saw it, something about that figure stirred something\ndeeper than memory in Kip. How had Andross Guile picked this emblem?\nSurely that scorpion had a soul insensitive to art.\n“Breaker!” Cruxer called out. The Mighty’s leader was tall and slender,\nconfident and handsome. A blue by nature as well as by the thin luxin\nstreaks in his brown eyes, he was serious but not humorless. He always did\nthe right thing, and he always did it quickly. It made him a great leader.\nBelieving the best of others, he somehow brought it out. “Breaker, would\nyou get over here and tell Ben-hadad that he’s not as smart as he thinks he\nis?”\nKip had expected some gibes about ‘sleeping in,’ but, of course, that\nhe’d dodged gibes for the moment didn’t mean they wouldn’t come later.\nBut when the squad teased him, it didn’t bother him. They’d given up\neverything to be here with him and with each other.\n“What are you destroying now?” Kip asked, joining the circle between\nmuscle mountain Big Leo and Ben-hadad, who’d had to hop around on a\ncrutch with one knee bound in a splint since his injury during their escape\nfrom the Lightguards at the Chromeria.\nBen-hadad said, “I’m destroying suddenly obsolete methods of"

I’m destroying old strategies of naval\ncombat.” Struggling to handle his crutch, he took off his yellow-and-blue\nhinged spectacles and alternated between gesturing with them and rubbing\nthe lines they left above his ears from how tight he wore them.\n“Breaker, he destroyed the skimmer,” Big Leo said. “Literally.”\n“Wait? What?” Kip asked. “I thought it was—” He peered over the side\ninto the water, where he’d expected to see the skimmer they’d been building\nfor five days. There was nothing there.\n“Look! Look!” Ben-hadad said, half-apologetic, half give-me-a-chance-\nto-explain. “It took me a few days to intuit the principles of\nhydrodynamics.”\n“Hyd-what?” Ferkudi asked. Not quite an idiot, nor quite a savant,\nFerkudi was the guy you could count on to snort fire pepper paste on a dare.\nHe was the guy who’d be openly picking his nose for the next six weeks,\nhappy to have the excuse. He was also the guy who’d throw his dopey bulk\nin the line of fire for you without a second thought. With an affable\nroundness only accentuated by his shaven head, he was their best grappler,\na blue and green drafter, and solid in every sense of the word.\n“The way water moves, Ferk,” Kip said.\n“Duh, it moves downhill. You smart guys sometimes…” Ferkudi shook\nhis head.\nBen-hadad ignored him. “It’s not an original design, it’s just I didn’t\nunderstand how—”\n“It’s not a design at all!” Big Leo said. “You destroyed our skimmer!”\n“I meant the next one. And that skimmer was garbage!” Ben-hadad said.\n“You designed it! You said it was the best skimmer ever built. And I\nhelped build it. Probably drafted two years off my life,” Big Leo said,\npointing to the red rising like floodwaters a quarter of the way up his dark\nirises. “I worked my ass off on that thing!”\n“Still got a way to go before you’re assless,” Winsen said quietly, giving\na significant glance at Big Leo’s haunches. Whereas Big Leo was by far the\nbiggest of the elite athletes, Winsen was by far the smallest. Slight and\nunremarkable except for the bars of yellow luxin staining his cold blue\neyes, he was the only member of the Mighty one might not be afraid of if\none met him in a dark alley.\nAnd that would be precisely the wrong reaction. Not only was Winsen\nthe slipperiest killer of them all, Winsen simply didn’t care. With his\nlongbow, he took shots that none of them could make, and he took shots\nthat none of them would make, because they’d be worried about the\nconsequences of hitting civilians or friends. Winsen seemed incapable of\nworrying about consequences.\n“True! And I was right,” Ben-hadad said, soothing Big Leo. “But"

And I was right,” Ben-hadad said, soothing Big Leo. “But\nskimmers are a new invention. Gavin Guile just discovered them. That’s\nwhat makes them—look, trust me! Look. I’ll do all the drafting myself.”\n“No, I forbid it,” Cruxer said, speaking up. He usually let them sort\nthings out themselves, so when he intervened they instantly shut up. “We\ntrust you, Ben-hadad. But you’re not drafting it alone. You can’t burn\nyourself out. We share the burden of making the new one. But next time,\nyou ask me before you destroy what belongs to the squad, understood?”\n“It was my design—”\n“And the squad’s work,” Cruxer interrupted. “We all throw all of what\nwe have into the pot. For some of us, that may be just muscle—”\n“That would be me,” Ferkudi volunteered. Unnecessarily.\n“—on a particular project, but we all give our all. Right?”\nA brief moment passed, and Kip wanted to rush in and try to make\nthings better. Cruxer and Ben-hadad butted heads constantly. Cruxer saw\neverything in black and white, and Ben-hadad saw relentless shades of gray\npossibility.\nFor Ben-hadad, his life and honor were the Mighty’s, but his creations\nwere his own. He valued himself for his brilliant inventions, and that—that\none thing—he didn’t want to share, and he didn’t see keeping that little bit\nas being too much to ask of a squad he gave everything else.\nFor Cruxer, you were either in or out.\nBut Kip didn’t try to fix it. Later, maybe, each would be more receptive\nto reason, more flexible. Not in front of everyone, though.\nBen-hadad was trying to keep his temper, saying tightly, “I’ll make the\nbest skimmer I can so the squad can be safe—”\n“Cap’n! Captain! Sir!” the lookout cried out from above.\nAt the alarm in his voice, the squad reacted immediately. Low stances,\nspectacles flipped on, team fanning out, looking for threats, hands to\nweapons. That most of the calamities that might come upon them at sea\nwould be impossible to oppose didn’t matter; this was instinct.\nThe galley had no proper crow’s nest, so the lookout merely stood atop\nthe main yard, balancing himself with one hand on the rigging. Above the\nfull-bellied sails, the man was pointing north.\n“Fore!” Kip said.\nThey turned and looked but saw nothing.\n“Go,” Cruxer ordered.\nSo they ran toward the prow, sliding or jumping down the steep stair-\nladder from the rear castle, dodging cursing sailors, and dashing up onto the\nlow forecastle as the captain bellowed at his sailors. The captain might be\nan ass, but he seemed a capable one. When they reached the prow, the\nMighty spread out, each of them having drawn in his color, except Kip, who\nwas slower. Kip was still swapping spectacles in and out of his hip case,\nstealing glances at the dirty white sails to soak up each color in turn.\n“What is that?” Cruxer asked."

At first, it looked like the sun on the\nhorizon, but blinding yellow like the risen sun, not red as the sun on the\nhorizon ought to. And as it rose, the orb deformed, elongated, like the\nlongest finger of a great hand, then simply the first burgeoning cloud of a\nvast cloud bank rolling into view.\n“Storm!” the lookout bellowed.\nThe sailors sprang into action. A storm they knew how to handle. Only\nthe Mighty were frozen. They knew this was no normal storm.\nThis was a luxin storm, ravager of cities, slayer of armies, Orholam’s\nwrath, the gods’ lash. And it was coming straight for them.\nAs the luminous cloud bank filled the horizon, the sea reflected the sky\nwith an unnatural clarity. Tiny bright needles flashed between sea and sky,\nas if knitting them together with light.\nThis was the consequence of the Seven Satrapies’ not having a Prism to\nbalance the colors. Drafters inevitably caused imbalances, and these storms\nbroke out spontaneously. No one understood yet why they happened where\nthey did, what exactly sparked them, or why they ended.\n“Breaker, Winsen,” Cruxer said. “How tight is that yellow?”\nWinsen licked his lips. “Hard to tell from this distance, but uh… I think\nit’s better than I can do.”\nKip flipped on his yellow spectacles. “It’s all over the yellow spectrum.\nBut some of it, yes, some of it’s solid.”\n“Is it raining? Anyone?” Cruxer asked, though he had the best eyes of\nthe Mighty.\nThey’d heard stories of a crystal storm in a little village in Atash. Blue\nluxin crystals the size of fists and sharp as razors had fallen from the sky\nand shredded everything within a day’s walk, but no farther. No one had\nknown whether the tale was true. Solid yellow would be worse.\nAn odd wind started blowing at their backs, blowing them toward the\nstorm front. It was like no wind Kip had ever felt. It was utterly constant.\nNo gusts, no variation in its strength at all, just a simple constant hard push.\nThe distant seas in front of the storm fell flat in an expanding circle. No\nchop, no whitecaps, no variation at all. The sea became a perfect mirror for\nthe bright clouds above. The great luminous clouds running straight against\nthe wind seemed to crash into it as if it were a wall, and then the clouds\nflipped over that wall in a mass like pancake batter spreading on a griddle in\nconcentric rings.\nBut everywhere the clouds folded over, the bright needles flashed again.\nAs they got closer, they were mere needles no more, but tree trunks,\nmassive pillars from the sea to the heavens.\nAt each point, the flat sea pulsed, throbbed yellow, gathering like a"

Yellow\nluxin shimmered into light, but each pillar was also wreathed in chasing\nfires, spiraling into the sky.\nEach pillar pulsed light for several heartbeats, then blew apart, falling\ninto water and light onto seas now crisscrossed with tremendous waves\nexpanding in rings from the luxin-lightning strikes.\n“Orholam have mercy,” someone said.\n“This is impossible,” Ben-hadad said.\n“It’s happening,” Ferkudi pointed out helpfully.\n“No, this is impossible,” Ben-hadad said.\n“You smart guys,” Ferkudi said.\nThe wind died, and the sea abruptly went still and flat as the front edge\nof the light-storm passed over them.\n“What do we do?!” the captain bellowed at them.\nKip tore his eyes away from the storm. Everything that could be secured\non the ship had been. The sailors had reefed the sails, trying to give the ship\nenough propulsion to quarter the waves, but not so much resistance to the\nwind that the masts broke.\nThen Kip saw that everyone was looking at him. As if he had the\nanswers.\n“Turtle,” Cruxer said.\nAt first, Kip thought Cruxer was talking to him, the turtle-bear, the\nridiculous beast that he’d come up with as his own avatar and that had\nended up somehow tattooed on his forearm, invisible except when he\ndrafted. But the rest of the squad understood. They drew together around\nKip, and the green and blue drafters among them began putting luxin\nshields up around them to protect all of them from the scything rain.\nGoing below would have been safer, but Cruxer thought Kip was going\nto figure this out.\nWe’re facing a force of nature, and they expect me to fix it. Orholam’s\nballs.\n“Why’s it impossible, Ben?” Kip asked.\n“Because it’s yellow.” He stopped, as if that were enough to explain the\ndread on his face.\n“And?!” Cruxer demanded.\n“The storms come from imbalances. Yellow is the center of the\nspectrum. It’s the fulcrum. It shouldn’t be possible for the center to be out\nof balance. So if it is, we are truly—”\nBut the rest of whatever he said was lost as the sailors screamed out. The\ncaptain shouted, “Secure yourselves to—”\nA few hundred paces directly ahead, the sea was cratering. Lightning\nbolts raced low on the water toward the crater, and were sucked in.\nWith a concussion that shook the galley and knocked down most\neveryone standing on deck, the sea exploded upward. Fire spiraled around\nthe pillar of light, discharging into bright clouds above.\nDischarging.\nKip clambered to his feet.

It flashed into light as it hit the deck,\nblinding but not killing anyone. Whether they would be lucky enough to be\nhit only by liquid yellow or whether there were solid razors of yellow yet to\ncome, Kip had no idea.\nDischarging. Because it was out of balance.\nKip left the turtle, rushing to the prow just in time to feel it rise as the\ngalley climbed a mountainous wave.\n“Breaker, get back—” Cruxer shouted.\nBut the wave was too massive, too fast for the galley to climb. The prow\ndug into it instead, slowing the ship as suddenly as if it had hit a wall.\nWinsen was thrown off his feet. Kip snatched his wrist as he tumbled and\nwas drafting before he knew it. He manacled one of his own wrists to a line\nconnecting the prow and mainmast and the other to Winsen’s wrist.\nThen water hit them like the slap of a sea demon’s tail.\nKip and Winsen were blasted back, and then up the line, into the air,\nhalfway up to the mainmast. Blinded, and with lungs half-full of water, they\nwere dropped, zipping down the line back to the deck as the wave crest\npassed and the prow suddenly dove, racing down the back side of the wave.\nThe rest of the Mighty were still crouched, clinging to the deck in a low,\nluxin-imbued circle like a tick burrowed into the ship’s skin.\nAs soon as Kip’s feet hit the deck, he was running. He threw Winsen\ntoward the squad, not even aware of releasing the solid yellow luxin he’d\ndrafted—solid yellow? That fast?\nHe leapt over the forecastle rail out onto the beakhead as the ship\nbottomed out between the waves, and lashed himself down with yellow\nluxin as the ship began its climb again.\nA deep breath, and the beakhead plunged into the next wave, the waters\npouring over him, scouring at him as if he were an offensive stain.\nBut then air. This second wave was smaller than the first had been.\nKip popped to his feet, reaching for the lens holster on his left hip. If\nyellow was out of balance, that meant… If the center of the spectrum was\nout of balance, it could be out of balance only with the ends of the\nspectrum. Kip’s lens holster had seven pairs of spectacles, ending at sub-red\nand superviolet, which balanced each other.\nBut there was one color beyond sub-red: Teia’s color, paryl. In legend,\nthere was another in the opposite direction, beyond superviolet: chi. Kip\nhad no idea how he’d draft chi. Hell, all he knew about drafting paryl was\nthat Teia’s eyes went so wide open the black of her pupils took over the\nentire eye. Lashing one hand onto the line that held the foreyard to the\nfigurehead, Kip moved forward as far as he could.\nThere was no third wave. A bit of luck, finally.\n“Breaker! Whatever you’re going to do, do it fast!” Cruxer yelled.\nThe sea had gone still, again. An unnatural flatness that defied reason"

An unnatural flatness that defied reason\nafter the titanic waves that had just passed.\nLightning passed low over the waves to sizzle against the galley’s hull.\nFor the first time Kip could recall, he saw fear in Cruxer’s eyes as they both\nrealized that the next pillar of fire and light was going to spring up directly\nbeneath the galley.\nThere was no way the ship or anyone in it would survive.\nKip turned to the waves. He stared straight down and widened his eyes,\nwider, despite the pain, despite the brightness. Into sub-red, and then\nbeyond. It was like opening his mouth too wide, discomfort turned to pain,\nand the light stabbed daggers into his face.\nAnd wider.\nAnd wider still.\nHe almost gagged—and then paryl snapped into focus as if it had been\nwaiting for him.\nParyl was racing below the waves, like clouds blowing through a storm-\nswept sky, and Kip’s awareness was pulled along with the gale to its center,\nwhere it swirled beneath the galley. A hard knot of paryl and something else\n—chi?—was forming, buzzing like the lightning-catcher atop each of the\nChromeria’s seven towers. Kip could feel the charge building, building.\nOh hells.\nThe paryl and that other color were just touching, and slowly twisting\ntogether, like partners coming together to dance. Kip could feel the\npressures massing behind each.\nAnd they twisted together hard, spinning together, lightning crackling—\nKip flung them apart with all his will.\nThe seas exploded, and his paryl-wide eyes were blinded. Everything\nwas lost in the twin roaring to his left and right, and great jets of water\nstreaming skyward pressed in on him. He could feel the jets twining\ntogether in the sky above the ship like wire and discharging the imbalanced\nyellow.\nThe paryl and chi wanted to snap together, wanted to crush Kip in their\nembrace. Kip stood, hands extended, arms extended, shoulders knotted with\neffort, his screams lost in the cacophony. He wept in agony, tear water\nblending with seawater and brightwater, salt to salt, deep to deep, magic to\nmagic.\nNothing but magic.\nKip barely dared blink, though the world was a wash of undifferentiated\nlight stabbing him. He couldn’t lose the colors. His head lolled, chin down,\narms out, shaking, exhausted, defiant. It didn’t matter where he looked with\nhis blind eyes: the magic was everywhere. Magic was all.\nAnd it was crushing him. It was like holding apart two rams who wanted\nto butt heads to show their dominance, each side lurching and twisting, ever\nlunging in.\nKip’s arms were stone. He dropped to his knees, still holding the paryl\nand chi streams apart.\nHis arms sagged, halfway to his sides, his will almost extinguished.\nHe wanted to drop dead, drop into the sea, and be no more.\nBut before his arms fell, he felt a presence behind him, embracing him,"

Who…\n“Help me!” Tisis shouted.\nAnd Kip felt another pair of hands on him. “Breaker, you can do this!”\nCruxer said, pulling him to his feet.\nKip was weeping. Oh, Orholam, it hurt. Stabs of pain shot through his\neyes, down his spine. His arms were gelatinous. His will was dust.\n“Another ten count, Breaker,” Cruxer said. “Give me just another ten.”\nMumbling through his tears, Kip counted with Cruxer.\n“Captain, tell me when we’re through!” Cruxer shouted over his\nshoulder. “Eight, nine, and—keep going, Breaker, I know you, you’ve got\nfive more—”\nBut Kip is gone.\n“You’ve got five more, I know you, Andross Guile. Plans within plans,” the\nyoung woman says. Katalina’s the kind of awkward girl whose beauty has\nunfurled with a crack like a sail suddenly filling with wind: luminous dark\nskin, rare blue eyes, and a shy smile. It’s Andross’s luck that he’s the first\nsuitor to come pluck this flower—it’s a good bit of luck, too, because he\nwould have had to woo her regardless of her beauty or lack thereof: she has\nwhat he needs.\nHe waggles his eyebrows at her, and she laughs and puts another pile of\nscrolls on the desk. But she holds two back. “But I can’t possibly show you\nthese two. If anyone learned, I’d lose my position here and shame my\nfamily and the entire Tiru tribe. I’m the youngest under-librarian in Paria.”\n“‘If anyone learned,’ huh?” Andross smiles recklessly. “Oh, what could I\npossibly do to convince you of my discretion?”\nShe feigns a frown, and that feigned frown hits Kip like a slap in the\nface. He didn’t recognize the smile. He didn’t recognize those clear eyes.\nHe didn’t recognize the beauty. But he knows that frown.\nKip gasped.\nHe was weeping, blind, and hands were lifting him, carrying him. “You\ndid it! Kip, you did it! Orholam’s mercy, you saved us,” she said.\nIt’s not her speaking. No, it’s Tisis. Tisis was the one who’d come to\nhim, caught him. Saved him.\nHe was weeping, and he was ashamed of his weeping.\n“What’s wrong with his eyes? One is—and the other—”\n“Cover his eyes! He’s staring at the sun, you fools!” the captain shouted.\nAnd people were shouting orders and suggestions back and forth. Kip\nheard a door bang open, and he was bustled inside. His knees hit what had\nto be his own bed, and he sat, gentle hands guiding him.\n“We should strip him out of—” a concerned woman said.\n“Just let him breathe, Verity,” Tisis said."

Kip\nhad no idea how an emotion could have color, but for some reason it\nseemed natural.\n“The enemy steered that storm toward you, so this much healing is\nallowed me. You won’t be blinded, not today,” she said, and she extended\nher hand as if making the sign of the three on him, her thumb to one eye,\nmiddle finger to the other, and her forefinger touching his forehead where\nthe eye of the mind was.

After a night of prayer atop the Prism’s\nTower, the chosen initiate would take his or her final Blackguard oaths as\nthe sun rose. Teia had always believed in Orholam, but she was usually too\nbusy to pray or attend more than the mandatory chapels. Orholam was the\nemperor of the universe, but she paid him scant tribute.\nShe’d looked forward to her vigil, though, thinking it would finally give\nher time to pray and focus. Perhaps—it being a vigil that would shape the\ncourse of her entire life—Orholam would take special notice of her. Speak\nto her, even.\nInstead she’d barely been able to prop her eyelids open through the\nnight. She’d mumbled some prayers, sung a few traditional songs, and\nwondered if she’d made a huge mistake by staying on the Jaspers instead of\ngoing with Kip.\nAnd from the twinges in her belly, her moon blood was going to start\nsoon.

Even if it meant\nfailing her mission.\nShe stood and opened the door. A Blackguard named Presser was\nguarding her vigil, but he said nothing. A Blackguard’s vigil was her own. If\nshe left, she left.\nTaking a deep breath, Teia walked out past the Blackguards at Karris’s\ndoor, and to the Blackguard station guarding the steps and the lift. It was the\nmiddle of the night, but Commander Fisk was apparently checking in with\nhis people, chatting quietly in the orangey light of their torches—the usual\nluxin lighting here hadn’t yet been repaired.\n“You’re leaving?” Fisk demanded. “You abandon your vigil, you’re out.\nYou know that.” He was taking it unusually personally, she could tell.\nAh, he’d probably taken some criticism for raising her to full\nBlackguard so early. Her failing reflected poorly on him, and just as he\nbegan his tenure as commander, too.\nTeia would have usually bulled right at conflict, but the orange gave her\nan idea. “Not abandoning my vigil, sir. Fulfilling it. Orholam told me\nthere’s something I need to do. I’ve committed a transgression against my\nbrother. I need to make it right before final vows.”\nTleros, a Blackguard Archer as skinny as the spear she carried, said,\n“You’re supposed to take care of that kind of thing before your vigil.”\n“I didn’t know I was going to be keeping my vigil until today. Which is\nbetter, delayed obedience or disobedience? Should I honor our traditions\nand stay all night with a guilty conscience, or should I honor Orholam and\nobey him now?” It was the best way she could think of not to blame Fisk\nfor not giving her enough time.\nBut he got the message. Commander Fisk grimaced. “You’re right.\nAllowances must be made. Back before dawn, nunk, otherwise you’ve\nbroken your vigil.”\n“Are you serious?” Tleros asked. She hesitated. “Err, Commander.”\n“Yes,” Commander Fisk said, “and why don’t you meditate a bit on\nwhat your tone should be when you speak to your commander?”\n“Yes, sir,” Tleros said. She hesitated again. “Perhaps a shift in the\nscullery would help focus my mind?”\nCommander Fisk merely glowered at her.\n“Two?” Tleros asked.\n“Whatever you think is necessary,” Fisk said.\nTleros’s shoulders sagged. “Yessir.”\nTeia took the lift down, stopped a story above the main floor, took the\nstairs down, and down, and found the same men on duty at the mirror\nprison still.

The last remnants of her paryl marker still clung to his head. She\nthought about not waking him. She didn’t want to talk to him. She hadn’t\nkilled him, wasn’t that enough?\n“Quentin,” she said before she could think too much about it.\nHe woke easily, but not guiltily as he used to. “Is it time?” he asked\nbefore he even turned to the door.\n“No, it’s still late. You’ve got six or seven hours yet.”\n“Teia.”\n“Quentin, I hate what you did, but I don’t hate you.

I believe one of the\nother High Luxiats may have been involved, but they told me nothing to\ngive me evidence of that. It’s purely speculation. But I know the High\nLuxiats fear the Guiles have grown too powerful.”\nTheir fear would be greater now, Teia realized. But that at least one of\nthem had been willing to kill to keep the balance of power? Luxiats?\nKilling? Much less High Luxiats. What was the world coming to?\n“Do you need anything?” she asked.\nHis calm composure cracked for an instant. “My shriving wasn’t the\nbest. They couldn’t allow any luxiats to visit me, lest they be spies or\nassassins. The Prism-elect Zymun came instead. He was, um, not terribly\ninterested in… much.”\n“Zymun’s an asshole.”\nQuentin suppressed a quick grin, then grew somber. “I suppose I deserve\nno better. Indeed, worse.”\n“Surely there’s something I can do for you.”\nHe swallowed. “There is… one thing.” He cleared his throat. “My, uh,\nmy mother. I was forbidden writing instruments. For good reason, I\nsuppose. I wonder if you could send her a message. You can put it in your\nown words. Given that I’m a traitor, the authorities fear I’d be sending code.\nTell her the truth, Teia. She lost everything in the False Prism’s War, and\nshe wanted me to stay with her more than anything.

My mother sacrificed me for—” He cut off,\nblowing air, puffing his cheeks out to keep from crying. “For Orholam. And\nI… did this. Became a murderer. Because High Luxiat Tawleb promised\nthat I could be a High Luxiat myself. I told myself that I obeyed him\nbecause I wanted her to be proud of me, but it wasn’t for her. It was for me.\nFor my pride.”\n“Fuck, Quentin,” Teia said again.\n“Goodbye, Teia. Thank you for being a friend to me, though I didn’t\ndeserve it. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll spend the rest of the night in\nprayer.”\n“Me, too,” she said. “It’s my vigil night. I’m to become a Blackguard at\ndawn.”\n“Congratulations!” he said, and he seemed to have real joy for her. But\nthen his face darkened once more. “Will you… if you have time… will you\npray that I’m brave? I’m not naturally courageous, and I don’t want to\nshame myself.” There was a hitch in his voice, and his cheeks were wet.\n“Further.”\n“I swear it. I’ll…” She cleared her throat. It was hard to speak. “I’ll be\non the White’s detail tomorrow. If you need strength, you just look at me,\nQuentin. I’ll stand for you.”\nChapter 15\nThe Emperor of the Seven Satrapies sat upon his luxin throne impassive.\nLegs folded, hands draped over his knees. He shat and didn’t even move.\nHe stopped eating, and soon he didn’t even need to shit.\nHe sat at the center of all things, moving only to stretch and lick at the\ntrickle of water that tracked down the wall, around the curve of his cell, and\ndown into the waste chute over which he sat.\nHis bread fell out of the chute above and tumbled to him. He picked it\nup with his left hand, and promptly dropped it because of his missing\nfingers. Carefully he picked up the bread again and put it in the semicircle\nin front of himself. It was a torture to have the bread always before him, but\nthere was a purpose to this, to being seen to starve.\nI am Guile.\nEverywhere he looked, he saw only himself reflected in the walls of the\ncell. Had it not always been thus? Had he ever seen anyone else, ever?\nShe was dead. He’d killed her. For her good service, he’d rewarded\nMarissia with death.\nHe had loved her, he saw now.

His breath\nwas foul, his skin greasy, muscles weak, eyes intermittently blurry.\nAll normal stages of fasting, though he wasn’t sure how much his body\ncould stand. He hadn’t started healthy.\nThe pain of hunger was deserved. The torture of having the means to\nease it within reach had been more than earned.\nBut more than simply deserved, the pain was necessary. One doesn’t\nfool Andross Guile on the cheap.\nAnd when the time came, he dreamed of Marissia, dreamed of throwing\nher off a balcony when Karris found her in his bed.\nHe dreamed and he woke, and he found he couldn’t much tell the\ndifference. Fewer leg cramps in the dreams, perhaps. Karris. This was for\nKarris.\nThe dreams were redolent of déjà vu. He’d dreamed of this cell when his\nbrother had suffered down here. For sixteen years, he’d dreamed of this\nsoothing blue hell, the facets of the blue luxin crystalline walls shimmering\nlike sun on the sea.\nIdly, Gavin wondered how his father had repaired the damage of the real\nGavin’s escaping. Andross couldn’t draft blue, so he must have had help.\nBut any help would have had to be taken care of afterward. If Andross had\nbeen careful enough to bring Marissia down here alone, it meant he was\nkeeping all knowledge of these cells to himself.\nIt would have been a lot of murder if he’d had to fix each of the cells\nthat the real Gavin had escaped from.\nBut of course Andross Guile wasn’t as wasteful as his second son when\nit came to drafting. There was no way he would bother to maintain\nnumerous functioning cells. He would have only two. One to hold Gavin,\nthe other as a backup. If Gavin broke out of one, Andross would let him\nstay in the second until he repaired the first and fixed its weakness, and then\nhe would move Gavin back into the first cell again. Efficient and cold.\nAs Gavin should have been.\nHe could still hear the muskets echoing in the cramped space as he’d\nblown his brother’s head apart.\nWhat had Andross thought when he found the corpse?\nKarris! Are you looking for me? Surely, surely she must be. She’d\nrescued him from the Nuqaba herself. She wouldn’t abandon him now. But\nhow could she find him?\nFunny. Funny how he’d obsessed over keeping this prison secret for so\nlong, and now his only hope was that someone would find it soon.\nGavin hadn’t buried his brother. Hadn’t done anything for him. Just left\nhim there to rot. Literally to rot.\nWho did that?\nHe remembered Gavin laughing when they were children. Some prank\nhe’d played on one of the White Oak boys. They’d put honey down the\nsleeping boy’s underclothes. The boy, Tavos, somehow hadn’t noticed until\nthe next day, hours after waking, when he was already out in Sapphire Bay\non a fishing trip with his father.

Dazen had to have\nkilled, personally, perhaps more people than anyone in history.\nHe was not a man, he was an epidemic. He moved across the land\nsnuffing out drafters young and old, broken halos traded for blood. He had\nspilled a river of blood—and in that river of blood, all he saw was his own\nreflection.\nHe was not a good man, Dazen Guile. He didn’t deserve to escape. But\nhe was going to. Not for himself. She deserved to have a husband, and\nshe’d been cursed to love Dazen.\nThe least he could do was be there.\nThe bread beckoned him to give up this farce of a suicide attempt, but he\ndidn’t touch it.\nOne doesn’t fool Andross Guile on the cheap. He scrubbed his face with\nhis crippled hand.\nIn the gleaming gray wall, he saw a dead man. One eyed, smiling back\nat him, the dead man winked.\nChapter 16\nKip was blind for three days. He had never been more afraid in his life.\nWhat was a drafter without his eyes? How could he let everyone down by\nleaving the fight before they’d even really begun?\nHe didn’t put it in words. Who would understand?\nDespite the darkness, or perhaps because of it, the Nine Kings cards\nhe’d absorbed kept triggering in his head. He lived as men who’d lost\nlimbs. As a heretic woman who’d had her eyes put out. As a broken warrior\nlashing out at those who loved him.\nIt wasn’t exactly a comfort.\nComfort. That was the name of a pistol, wasn’t it? Abaddon, the King\nof… Locusts?\nBut that thought, that memory—was it even his own memory?—slipped\naway from him like all the others.\nTisis shared the bed with him, snuggled up against him, but she didn’t\nseem to know how to bridge the gap. He held her close, but without his eyes\nto judge her expressions, he didn’t trust himself not to make a fool of\nhimself or hurt her by doing the wrong thing. They slept only.\nOn the third day, he sat up in bed and took off his bandages. He could\nsee perfectly. His eyes felt well.\nBut those who broke the halo usually felt well. Part of the madness was\nbelieving that you weren’t mad.\nVerity nearly dropped her tray when she came in and found him up.\n“My lord,” she said.\n“My apologies, caleen.”\n“Please, my lord, call me Verity.”\n“With pleasure. Verity, will you look at my eyes and tell me what you\nsee?” Best to know how bad it was immediately.\n“Is that safe?”\nKip nodded, and she pulled back some heavy drapes they’d put up on\nthe walls.

Can you, uh, tell me what happened out there?” Kip asked.\n“How much do you remember?”\n“Right up to where the water tornado thing was going to explode under\nthe galley.”\n“That was the exciting part,” Cruxer said. He cleared his throat. “Well, it\ndid explode—half on each side of the galley, and it kept trying to twist back\ntogether. Two enormous spinning waterspouts. And… somehow… you held\nthem apart until the galley sailed through. The light storm passed as fast as\nit came. All’s been well since then. You saved the ship and everyone on it.”\nHe cleared his throat again. “A, um, a couple of the sailors tried to worship\nyou.”\n“Ha!” Kip said. “Funny.”\nCruxer didn’t share his amusement. “I was serious. They were, too.” He\nchewed on his lip. “Breaker, I saw you sink the Gargantua. This was…\nBreaker, I froze up. I’ve never frozen up in the face of danger before. Tisis\nwas the one who saved you. Shamed all of us.”\n“Because she’s a girl?”\n“Maybe a little. But mostly because we’re Blackguards. We’re supposed\nto be there for you first. We failed you.”\n“You got there in time,” Kip protested. He remembered that much now.\nThe hands on him, the yelling.\n“We got there second.”\n“You got there soon enough.”\n“It could have—you almost fell in the—”\n“What did Commander Ironfist say about past mistakes?” Kip asked.\nCruxer grimaced. “Look at your mistakes long enough to learn from\nthem, then put them behind you.”\nKip lifted his eyebrows.\n“Oh, shut up,” Cruxer grumbled. He picked at a fingernail for a bit.\n“Tisis is saying some things that have the squad uncomfortable, Breaker.”\n“What’s that?”\n“I guess you told her we’re leaving? She’s been insisting that she’s\ngoing with us. She says you told her she could.”\n“I did.”\n“But you told me we were leaving her.”\n“And then I changed my mind.

I had to.”\nCruxer’s displeasure had an almost physical weight to it. “Breaker,\nwe’ve got to figure something out right now. I know I said that you’d be in\ncharge when it made sense for you to be in charge, and I’d be in charge the\nrest of the time, but that isn’t working. I can’t handle the uncertainty.”\n“Uncertainty is part of—”\n“Uncertainty is part of your world. Not mine. When I give orders, I have\nto know they’re going to be followed. Or when someone tells me\nsomething, I have to know it’s the truth.”\nThat stung.\n“It’s not a lie when someone tells you what they think is the truth and is\nwrong. Plans change. Anyway, heck, call her an honorary member of the\nMighty now. She did save me,” Kip said. “There, see? The Mighty didn’t\nfail now. She was just the fastest of us to react.”\nCruxer grimaced. It was, Kip thought, a fairly nice dodge to save face.\nBut Cruxer wasn’t interested in dodges. Regardless, he let it go. “It’s not\nabout that. It’s not only about that, anyway. Breaker, I propose we use a\ndifferent template for our squad.”\n“And what’s that?”\n“I say we mirror how the Prism and the commander of the Blackguard\ninteract. It’s close to what we have now. As above, so below, right? You\ndecide where we go—though I give input and register any disagreements—\nand I keep you alive when we go there. You’re the boss, but we don’t keep\neach other from doing our work.”\nAs above, so below. But for Kip to step into that place, that low mirror\nof the Prism, was highly suggestive of something else. “I’ve never claimed\nto be the Lightbringer, Crux.”\n“That uncertainty I can live with.”\n“I want you to know, I think Tisis can help us, Cruxer. I wouldn’t ask to\nbring her along if she couldn’t.”\n“I’m not convinced. And if we get her killed, her sister goes from a very\ntenuous ally to a mortal enemy. But you don’t need to convince me. You\ndon’t need to ask to bring her along at all. Simply give the order… my\nlord.”\nChapter 17\nBiggest day of my life, and all I can think about is how I have to pee.\nWhen the complement of full Blackguards had joined Teia and the other\nnunks in their vigils before dawn, the one-handed new Blackguard trainer\nSamite had thoughtfully brought Teia and a few other Archers-to-be cups of\nkopi, still steaming from the kitchens. Teia had only sipped the stimulant\nbefore, and hadn’t liked the taste, so she’d never had a full cup.\nThis morning, she’d drained it with gusto.\nNow she had to pee, and she felt jittery. With the burden of Quentin’s\nlife and death off her shoulders, she’d then had something quite like the\nvigil she’d always hoped to have: she’d wept and then sworn at Orholam\nfor all her problems, then beseeched him for forgiveness, then begged him"

She’d had a sense,\nfor some fragile tender minutes, that she wasn’t alone, that she wasn’t\nforsaken, that she had purpose, that he knew her. He saw her. He cared. He\nsaved. It had been a night overfull.\nLike my bladder.\nOrholam, let me not wet my new blacks.\nFifty Blackguards had gathered to stand in rows with her and five other\nnunks on the roof of the Prism’s Tower, saluting the sun as it rose.\nCommander Fisk turned as soon as the sun had barely cleared the horizon.\nIt was going to be a busy day for all of them, so the ceremony would be\nabbreviated at best. Not that Teia was complaining.\n“Adrasteia Gallaea’s daughter,” Commander Fisk said, after greeting\neach of the others. Teia hadn’t heard her mother’s name since the day she’d\nbeen signed over to Blackguard training. She didn’t want to think of herself\nas that creature’s daughter, though slaves were traditionally known by their\nmatronymic. “The Blackguard is an ancient order, heavy with honor. We\nwere born out of fealty and failure, out of the honor of Lucidonius’s thirty\nmighty men and the shame of the satrapies failing to protect his widow and\nour second Prism, Karris Shadowblinder. Upon her death, those who\nremained of the thirty organized this guard to protect the Prism, and, in the\nlast extremity, to protect the Seven Satrapies from a Prism.”\nA quiet descended, the full Blackguards contemplative, the newest ones\nconfused. Protect the satrapies from the Prism?\nThen a crack like a musket shot rang out. Fifty pairs of hands went to\nweapons. Fifty pairs of eyes were covered with colored spectacles.\nBut it was only the propped-up replacement door falling to the ground as\nsomeone came up to the roof.\nKarris Guile, Karris White Oak, now Karris White, stood in the opening\nfor a moment to let her former brethren relax, then stepped outside. She\nwore the white dress of her station, but one newly made, cut to her slim,\nmuscular figure. The points of her high collar were sharpened, reminiscent\nof swords, and all her accents were bright silver, not gold. The dress itself\nwas lean cut, and if Teia didn’t miss her guess, infused with luxin, as were\nthe Blackguards’ blacks. As much as a dress could be, it was one in which\nthe former Blackguard could move. It was steel femininity, and Teia\nimmediately recalled that just days ago, when they’d tried to throw her off\nthe testing platform, this woman had kicked two big men to their deaths\nwithout hesitation, remorse, or much effort.\nThe Blackguard Karris White Oak had been small, fast, and fierce.\nThe only thing small about Karris White was her frame.\nAs the Blackguards saluted her and her attending Blackguards fanned\nout onto the roof, she said, “If I may, Commander?”\n“It’s an honor, High Lady,” Fisk said. “Please do.”"

Some of them.\nOthers can’t handle what the Freeing demands of them. Others, when the\nend of their term comes, and they know they’re going to die, try to escape.”\nTeia had never heard of that. She saw some of the others were rattled by\nit, too. Who could imagine being called upon to kill a Gavin Guile?\nThen she realized she hadn’t heard of it because the Blackguard was that\ncompetent. Prisms who shamed themselves by breaking their oaths and\ntrying to flee were always quietly killed. Word never got out. Who could\nescape the Blackguard?\nTeia asked, “But how do they know that they’re going to die? If Gavin\nGuile made it to his third term, how would another Prism not know if they\nmight not have a second or a third term themselves? Or is that it? They\ndon’t know, so they flee?”\n“They know. Somehow they know.” But Karris looked troubled, as if\nthere were parts of this she didn’t understand, either.\nOrholam have mercy, had that been in the papers Teia had helped steal?\n“Do we know, too?” another asked. “Is there some warning?”\nCommander Fisk said, “The Colors and the Magisterium will tell you\nwhen it’s likely. But it’s always possible. None of the Blackguard now\nserving have ever had to hunt a Prism, and we pray we never do, but ours is\nthe long watch. Do you have any other questions before we continue?”\nTeia shook her head.\nKarris said, “Your duty is hard, but this I promise you: you shan’t be\nasked to betray your honor.”\nIt was an answer to the question Teia couldn’t ask with all the others\nthere: will my attempted infiltration of the Order of the Broken Eye\ncompromise my oaths?\nBut it wasn’t an exact answer, was it?\nI won’t have to betray my honor, but I may have to break—or appear to\nbreak—my oaths. Would Karris thread so narrow a needle’s eye with her\nwords?\nKarris White Oak wouldn’t have. Would Karris White?\nWhy had Karris come up here? To bond the Blackguards further to her,\nto wish a former pupil well, or to make sure that Teia did take the oaths?\nAll of the above, no doubt. We are warriors, and this is our lot.\n“Commander,” Karris said, “may I continue with you?”\n“We would be honored, High Lady. Though one may be called to other\nduties, one never ceases being a Blackguard,” he said, and then he turned to\nTeia and the others. “The Blackguard forms an unbroken chain extending\nback to the time of Lucidonius himself.

At the end, we each name a Blackguard who inspires us, a\npatron whose qualities will help us become the best Blackguard we can be.\nHigh Lady White, will you start for us?”\n“I remember Karris Shadowblinder, Lucidonius’s wife and widow, and a\nPrism. Though our order wasn’t established until after her death, it was built\non the foundation she laid. Dancer, poet, theatre mummer, and, when times\ndemanded it, finally a warrior-drafter of unmatched ferocity, she swore an\noath to marry no man who couldn’t beat her in will, wit, and weapons.\nLucidonius failed twelve times, on twelve successive months, until she\nadmitted he at least equaled her in will. He cheated at the contest of wits,\ndrugging her beforehand, which she agreed showed a wit of its own. And\nlast, with weapons, she lost—though some argue that was intentional.\n“Karris Shadowblinder would later save Lucidonius’s life three times,\nand fail on the fourth. Karris is precious to me because the heart of the\nBlackguard is love. Love for the Seven Satrapies, love for this brotherhood,\nand in the best of times love for the leader we protect. Karris\nShadowblinder reminds me that in this mortal realm, even if we love\nperfectly, we may fail still.”\nThe White stepped back.\nA tall, shaven-headed Blackguard named Asif stepped forward. “I\nremember Finer. He was a Blackguard during the time of Prisms Leonidas\nAtropos and Fiona Rathcore. He struck down the Bandit King in the Battle\nof Ghost Flats. Handsome, funny, and loved by everyone, it was widely\nexpected that he would one day be the commander of the Blackguard.\nInstead he went wight and fled. He killed four of his brothers before he\ncould be put down. Finer reminds me of the importance of duty, and that all\nfame and renown count for nothing if we don’t uphold our oaths.”\nHis cousin, Alif, stepped forward next. “I remember Commander Ayrad,\nwho sat quiet, judging until the time came to act. In his testing fights, he\nplaced each time last. Forty-ninth at the end of the first week, then thirty-\nfifth at the end of the second, then twenty-eighth, then fourteenth, and on\nthe last week, he fought from place fourteen to thirteen, thirteen to twelve,\ntwelve to eleven, then to ten, to nine, to eight, to seven, to six, five, four,\nthree, two, one. Never in our history has man or woman fought so many\ntimes or won so authoritatively. Because of his intelligence, Ayrad didn’t\nfight harder, he isolated the weakness of each opponent, and took him or her\nout efficiently. Later in life, that intelligence would raise him to commander\nof this hallowed body, and it would save the lives of four Prisms.\n“And yet,” Alif said, “yet Commander Ayrad himself would fall to\npoison.

I learn from him that we can never, never be off\nour guard.” He took a step back.\nTlatig, an Archer, stepped forward. She was not a handsome person. Her\nmouth turned down, eyes squinted, skin blemished, body with fewer curves\nthan the seven towers, only when she picked up a bow did a grace came\nupon her. She was then a wonder as is a swallow in flight. Surreal,\nprescient, a walking miracle with a bow. On the training field, Tlatig wore a\ntiny chemise, tied tight, to show off the knotted muscles of her shoulders\nand the V of her back.\n“I remember Commander Dauntless. She gave up her noble connections\nand her family’s aspirations in order to serve the Seven Satrapies. She had\ntwo dreams, to be a Blackguard and to be a mother, and she sacrificed the\nlatter to be the former. When she retired after a long and storied career—\nwhose details I would tell you had not Commander Fisk asked us to be brief\ntoday—she tried to have a family, and, that late in life, she could not. She\nreminds me of the heavy price of duty, and that our forebears paid it, and\nlived in honor. Commander Dauntless lived in duty, and died with honor,\nthough it cost her grievously. I remember her, and strive to meet her\nstandard.”\nTeia looked at Tlatig with new eyes. Tlatig wanted a family? That was\nher greatest longing, and the price she was willing to pay for this family?\nTlatig had never seemed like the mothering type. On the other hand, from\nTlatig’s slightly embarrassed look, Teia could tell that she felt exposed from\nhaving shared so much—but that she shared anyway, when sharing made\nher feel so awkward, told Teia that she was being given something precious.\nAnother Archer, Piper, stepped forward. She wore her hair pulled into a\nknot at the back of her head, and had the straining halos and lined face of a\nwoman on her last year before Freeing. “I remember Massensen, and Ikkin,\nand Gwafa, and Mennad. Massensen defeated three great-horned iron bulls\non the Melos Plain in the Jadmar Rebellion. Ikkin Dancing Spear killed the\nJadmar’s war chief, the giant Amazul. Gwafa demolished the Nekril, the\nwill-casting coven that laid siege to Aghbalu. Mennad gave his life saving\nthe Prism in Pericol when he was there to sign the Ilytian Papers. All these\nheroes were one man. Massensen took a new name every time he performed\nanother act that would make any other man a legend. Where others would\ntake a name that celebrated their heroic act to remind people of it forever,\nMassensen did the opposite. He took a new, plainer name each time, and\nrefused to become even a watch captain. He believed that all glory should\nbe reflected to Orholam, and that his own fame should be shared with his\ncompanions and his Prism. He was simply a Blackguard, and any\nBlackguard was his equal.\n“Massensen reminds me that we wear black that we may serve in"

We wear black that the light may shine the brighter. Massensen\nreminds me of duty with excellence.”\nFor some reason, it was only as Piper spoke that Teia finally stopped\nthinking about her bladder and was pulled into the words. These were some\nof the greatest heroes in history. These were people who had altered the\ncourse of satrapies, crushed kingdoms, saved Prisms and Colors, and fought\nmonsters out of legends. This was the company she was being invited into.\nAs an equal.\nThis was what she’d wanted since she could remember. All the\nmisgivings and questions about herself faded. They would call her a slave,\nbut she is not a slave who chooses to serve.\nAs she thought, heart swelling, a tear cold in the wind on her cheeks, the\nnormally quiet Nerra had stepped forward. She smiled shyly. “I remember\nThiyya Tafsut. She served all her days quietly, and was to retire at Sun Day\non her fortieth year. She sought and received permission to become\npregnant, as there was little light left for her. Pregnant, on the day before\nSun Day, she hurled herself at a wight attempting the murder her Prism. She\nwas killed, and she did not kill the wight in turn, but she slowed it enough\nthat others did. Others in those circumstances would have hesitated, saved\nthemselves, saved their baby. She did not. She reminds me that even those\nwho are not great themselves can, through great sacrifice, change history.”\nAnd that was the cost to join this company. What made them fearsome\nwas the totality of their dedication, their readiness to pay all one could pay.\nBut in return, they bought a life that mattered.\nEven a slave girl from the far reaches of the empire could matter.\nYes, her soul breathed, yes.\nIt was not that these heroes hadn’t failed; it was that they had: all of\nthem, sooner or later, in public or private. They were heroes despite their\nfailures, for they had striven with their whole hearts toward the light. The\nBlackguard was strong because it didn’t feel threatened by those failures.\nThis was a company that would live in the light.\nAnd by some grace, Teia didn’t think how she would be a spy. She\nsoaked up the light of the dawn, and the light of clear purpose and bedrock\ndevotion. She only wished Kip and the rest of the squad could share this\nwith her.\nGavin Greyling had stepped forward to be the seventh and final speaker.\n“I remember Gavin Guile.”\n“Gavin Guile was never a Blackguard,” Fisk snapped. “Great though he\nwas. Is, High Lady. My apologies. Pick another, Greyling.”\n“I beg to differ, Commander,” Gavin Greyling said. “Respectfully. Just\nbefore the Battle of Ru, when he sank the great ship Gargantua, Gavin\nGuile was given a Blackguard name by Commander Ironfist himself.\nAmong us, Gavin is known as Promachos.”\n“Neither you nor even Commander Ironfist had the authority to name a\npromachos,” Fisk said. “And though our esteemed emperor held that"

You’re\nembarrassing—”\n“Your pardon, sir, but it was not meant as a title, but instead as a\nBlackguard name that, in accordance with our best traditions, reflects the\nessence of the man. Earned hard and given true, it is not our way to strip a\nBlackguard—even an honorary one—of his name if he hasn’t forfeited the\nright to it by acting dishonorably. Are you suggesting Gavin Guile acted\ndishonorably?” Gavin Greyling was pushing it, but he did so with such glee\nit was hard to be mad at him.\n“Watch your tongue, son.” Even for Commander Fisk, apparently.\n“Yessir.”\nCommander Fisk hesitated, looked around, and pursed his lips. “No one\nspeaks of this. This circle is closed,” he barked. “Go.”\nWith no small amount of swagger, Gavin Greyling said, “I remember\nGavin fucking Guile, who won the False Prism’s War, who outwitted the\nThorn Conspirators and ended the Red Cliff Uprising. Gavin Guile, who\nbrought low pirate kings and bandit lords, who ended the Blood Wars with\nhis wits and one deadly wave of his hand, who brought justice to the Seven\nSatrapies. Gavin Guile, who hunted wights and criminals, who built\nBrightwater Wall in less than a week, who aborted the births of gods,\ndestroyed at least two bane, and killed a god full fledged at Ruic Head.\nGavin Guile, who faced a sea demon and lived, saving all the people of\nGarriston and the Blackguard, too. Gavin Guile, who sank Pash Vecchio’s\ngreat ship Gargantua with a rat. Gavin Guile, who armed us for war and\ngave the Blackguard the seas entire with our sea chariots and hull wreckers.\nGavin Guile, heart of our heart, our Promachos, the one who goes before us\nin war, who came and conquered and will come again.”\nThe Blackguards couldn’t help it; they cheered.\nThey’d already been out looking for him on the skimmers, Teia’d heard.\nSometimes on duty, sometimes off. And they would never give up. “For\nsuch a man, I would die twice,” Gavin Greyling said.\n“Hear, hear!” a number of voices called out.\nBut Teia was looking at Karris. Her head was bowed, and Teia saw her\nswallow once, hard. But when Karris opened her eyes, her face was clear,\nwith no hint of crying there. She nodded regally to the Blackguards.\n“Thank you,” Karris said.\nCommander Fisk said, brusquely, “We’ve all got duties awaiting us this\nday, nunks. We are a storied company, but we are also slaves, nunks, though\nsome of us are slaves with ears unshorn. We serve a term, almost like\nindentured servants, but our term may be extended at will by our\ncommander, and our eventual retirement may be requested, but granting"

We serve a term, almost like\nindentured servants, but our term may be extended at will by our\ncommander, and our eventual retirement may be requested, but granting\nthat is the commander’s decision alone. Even if you save the money to buy\nout your papers, your commander need not accept them. We are honored\nslaves, but slaves. For warrior-drafters as we all are, there is no higher\ncalling, no greater service, no possibility to rise higher than this shining\ncompany. But our lives are short and hard and lived at the direction of\nothers.\n“Teia, having taken vigil to reflect on your life and this calling, have you\nselected a patron to whose example you would aspire?”\n“Yes,” Teia said. “I choose Commander Ironfist, who alone silenced the\nartillery at the Battle of Garriston, saving countless lives, who led this\ncompany with honor and bravery, and in the end was expelled for no good\nreason whatsoever. Ironfist reminds me that we join the Blackguard to\nserve, not for our own gain. He reminds me to be as vigilant of those who\nwield orders as those who wield swords.”\nThere was some quiet muttering in response to that. Teia thought it was\nin agreement—no one liked how Ironfist had been discarded and had then\ndisappeared, though that was surely the only safe thing for him to do—but\nfrankly, Teia didn’t care what they thought of her choice.\nAfter a moment, Commander Fisk nodded, letting it go. “Well, then, if\nyou would bind yourself and your honor to this lauded company, repeat\nafter me.” And Teia followed him, echoing phrase for phrase: “I, Adrasteia\nGallaea’s daughter.”\n“I, Adrasteia Gallaea’s daughter.”\n“Do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to High Lady\nKarris White and her successors, according to the law.”\n“Do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to High Lady\nKarris White—” Terror, shambles! Teia forgot the words!\nBut Fisk prompted her gently, “And her successors, according to the\nlaw.”\n“And her successors, according to the law.” Whew.\n“I will protect the Prism with my life, and in the last extremity…”\n“I will protect the Prism with my life, and in the last extremity…”\n“I will protect the Seven Satrapies from him or his successors.”\n“I will protect the Seven Satrapies from him or his successors.”\n“So help me,” he hesitated to give proper reverence, “God.”\n“So help me God.”\nThen, as if Teia’s life hadn’t just changed forever, Commander Fisk\ncontinued on down the line.\nChapter 18\nButtoned tight, tall, rapier lean, and hawk eyed, Cruxer stood before the\nsquad to give orders. He said, “I’m going to explain this to you in terms you\ncan understand: shut up.”\nThe Mighty were gathered on the deck, greeting Ben-hadad with his\nflip-down spectacles and goofy Ferkudi, who’d just successfully tested\nBen’s newest skimmer.

But he said no more.\n“Oh. Come. On,” Winsen said.\n“No,” Cruxer said. “You have your orders. You don’t like them. Fine.\nDon’t like ’em. And shut it. Since when did soldiers like the orders they\ngot?”\n“We’re not exactly just soldiers,” Big Leo pointed out. When he folded\nhis arms like that, his biceps bulged out like sides of beef.\nCruxer said, “We are in this way: we get a task, we have to carry it out.\nHaving to like it is nowhere in the description.”\n“I’m not asking for blind obedience,” Kip said.\n“He shouldn’t have to,” Cruxer said. “We’ve pledged our lives and\nhonor to him. Stop acting like children and start acting like warriors.\nThere’ve been lots of women in the Blackguard.”\n“Every last woman in the Blackguard is a special case, and you know\nit,” Big Leo said, his voice low and large.\n“Every last person in the Blackguard is a special case,” Cruxer said.\n“None of that matters,” Winsen said. “We make our own rules. We\naren’t Blackguards.”\nIt hurt all of them to be reminded. Only Ferkudi seemed unmoved. He\nsaid, “Well, I don’t want to make rules that get us killed.”\n“I think us getting killed was pretty much assured as soon as we decided\nto go with Breaker,” Ben-hadad said. “No offense, Breaker.”\n“None taken,” Kip said. Because it’s wonderful that my closest friends\nassume I’m going to get them killed.\nSomehow, none of them noticed Tisis approach. With her blonde hair\ntucked up under a floppy petasos, scruffy trousers and tunic, and a belt full\nof weapons slung low and loose on her hips, she nearly fit in with the ship’s\ncrew. “You should take me,” she said. “There’s only six of you. I’ll be lucky\nnumber seven.”\n“I’m not superstitious,” Big Leo grumbled.\n“I am!” Ferkudi said. “Ever since this one time, I talked to this old witch\nlady, and she said, ‘Son—’”\n“Ferkudi!” Cruxer said.\n“No, she said ‘son,’ she didn’t know my name. It was already creepy\nenough that—”\n“Ferk!” Cruxer said.\n“Oh! Oh. Right.”\nTisis said, “There are things I can do that none of you big, terrifyingly\nstrong men can do.”\n“Like what?” Big Leo asked.\nFerkudi looked pleased to be called a big, terrifyingly strong man. He\nflexed his pectorals in a little dance. “She gets my vote.”\n“Shut up, Ferk. Like what?” Big Leo asked.\n“I can talk to strangers without scaring the hell out of them.”\n“Funny,” Big Leo said. “But we’re trying to have a serious—”\n“I was serious,” Tisis said. “I know you all look at Ferkudi and think of"

Like that.”\n“O’s saggies,” Winsen said. “I get it.”\n“Get what?” Cruxer asked, clearly irritated that he wasn’t understanding.\n“Look at all of you,” Tisis said. “You’ve known each other for years\nnow. Some of you since you were barely walking. Look what happened to\nyou while you weren’t paying attention. You’re not six boys traipsing\nthrough a foreign satrapy, looking for adventure. What do you look like?”\nKip knew what she was talking about, but he was captured by another\nthought. These young warriors had been cutting her off, telling her how she\ncouldn’t come with them, disrespecting her because of her beauty. Now\nthey were listening to her quietly. She’d turned them already, and they\nhadn’t noticed it yet.\nExcept maybe Winsen. He seemed unaffected by her charm, grimly\namused by the whole thing.\n“You look fuckin’ scary,” Kip murmured.\nIt was true, and Kip saw it crash down on Cruxer most of all for some\nreason. Perhaps because he was the commander. Somehow he’d seen\nhimself as a junior officer—a leader whose command would surely be taken\nfrom him, who would be shuffled back under the leadership of someone\nolder. A leader of boys. He had always known he would have to start at the\nbottom when he went out into the real world.\nBut now here he was. He’d been proud that the Mighty were the best\nsquad among the Blackguard trainees, but he hadn’t realized that now they\nwere among the best in the world.\nThey would be feared, because they were fearsome. Big, grinning,\nchummy Ferkudi might have a permanent layer of softness around his big,\nround frame, but he could tear off a man’s arm with the power in those big,\nround shoulders. Add man-mountain Big Leo, quietly menacing Winsen,\ngraceful Cruxer with his calcified shins, sinewy and double-spectacled Ben-\nhadad, and Kip, and not many people would block their way in a dark alley.\n“I meant you, too, Kip,” Tisis said.\nHe snorted, and they looked at him as if he were crazy. “What?” he\nasked.\n“They’re calling you the Splitter of Storms,” Tisis said.\n“Storm Breaker, now, actually,” Ben-hadad said. “My suggestion.”\n“Oh, hey, that’s clever!” Ferkudi said.\nBen-hadad said, “Sometimes praise from you doesn’t have the intended\neffect.”\nBut Kip wasn’t listening.

Ergo ‘Breaker.’ ‘Storm Breaker’ fit the mold, but that\nhad been… a fluke. Irreproducible. Luck. If he even tried to draft paryl or\nchi again right now, he’d only hurt himself.\nBut Tisis was still staring at him, as if he were a half-wit for doubting\nhimself.\nTisis was looking at him like that? Tisis? Who’d seen his embarrassing\nnudity? Who’d seen the shameful scars of a man who hadn’t been able to\nfend off small rodents?\n‘A couple of the sailors tried to worship you,’ Cruxer had said.\nIt was as if all the faces around him were trying to tell him he was a\ndifferent man than he knew he was.\nSome men like the feel of wool over their eyes, I suppose.\nThat was a fine dismissal for the sailors, but his wife? His friends, who\nknew him far better than she did?\nThey had a blind spot for him, born of their love and forgiveness. Their\nkindly view of him was more a reflection of their characters than his.\n“Right,” he said easily. “It’s beside the point. All of us, going into Blood\nForest, all armed, all with the stained eyes of drafters, all with the dark skin\nof foreigners? We’ll look like invaders or brigands.”\nCruxer sighed, and Kip could feel frustration emanating from him.\nCruxer was the best of them, and the blindest. Kip loved him for it.\n“She’ll slow us down,” Big Leo protested, but he’d already lost.\n“Any more than I will?” Ben-hadad asked, gesturing to his knee. “Or do\nyou want to leave me behind, too?”\n“That’s not what I meant,” Big Leo said.\nBut Kip was diverted by another problem now. Verity was walking\nacross the deck, laden with baggage, taking up a place at the periphery of\nthe conversation, head downcast, just a slave, invisible, thanks.\n“Uh-uh,” Kip said. He grabbed his own bag from her and checked it\nbriefly: soap, spare clothes, sundries, a pot, a plate, deck box, and coin\nsticks—with the correct number of coins on them. “You’re not coming.”\n“I’ll be most useful, my lord. Cooking, cleaning, mending, things you’ve\ngotten used to having a slave around for. I can ease your life on the trail in a\nhundred ways.”\n“I have no doubt of it,” Kip said. He looked dubiously at the other bags\nshe was carrying. How many of those were for her, and how many for\nTisis?\n“Uh, Breaker, someone to cook for us?” Ferkudi said. “Have you ever\ntried to eat Cruxer’s squirrel stew?”\n“I never was good at laundry,” Winsen said.\n“Is this about my former… insouciance, my lord?” Verity asked.\n“Because I can promise—”\nKip held up a hand. “It’s not about that.

It was a yes.\n“So have I.”\nShe took a deep breath, then bowed her head, accepting.\nWhen Kip turned back, Winsen and Ferkudi were looking at him.\nFerkudi looked glum, like a child denied a cake. Winsen, though, looked\npeeved. Kip realized that when he’d held up his hand for Verity to stop\nspeaking, they’d taken it as an order for them, too.\n“Have to admit, I liked it better when you were just one of us,” Winsen\nsaid. “If I may be excused, my lord?” He sketched a mock bow.\n“No, actually,” Kip said. “Before we go, we have to sort one more thing\nout. Not just for us, but for Eirene Malargos.”\n“What’s that?” Winsen asked, lemon faced. He and the others glanced\nover at Verity, who was suddenly trying to look very nonthreatening.\n“Just what the hell we plan to accomplish,” Kip said.\n“I say we go fuck up the Color Prince,” Big Leo said.\n“I don’t think we’re in the audience participation portion of the show,”\nBen-hadad said.\n“What?” Big Leo asked.\n“Shut it, both of you,” Cruxer said.\nKip took a deep breath. “The strength of the Seven Satrapies has always\nbeen its trade. As much as our religion and politics bind us, we’ve partly\nbeen strong because of the trade winds and the trade circuit and the\nintermingling of blood and culture and goods that’s allowed us. Ilyta\nproduces the best firearms even though they’re as far as possible from the\nbest sources of gunpowder, in Ru. Parian iron is shipped everywhere.\nRuthgari crops feed all the satrapies. That’s meant even a farmer in Abornea\ncan afford to buy fresh Tyrean oranges on occasion. But there are\ndownsides to this, too. No one in other satrapies tries to mine silver on the\nscale they do at Laurion in Atash. Everyone knows the best and most salt\ncomes from the Ruthgar coast.

It wasn’t\nthat much of an economic blow when the other satrapies lost Tyrean\noranges and Tyrean hardwoods. But now we’ve lost the guano mines of Ru\nfor gunpowder and all the silver of Laurion—silver the Color Prince’s\nBlood Robes can use to hire mercenaries and pirates.\n“At the Battle of Ruic Head, we lost our navy. It’s being rebuilt, but that\ntakes time and treasure, neither of which we have in excess. But if the\npagans take Blood Forest, they take away cheap, plentiful lumber that’s\nclose to our shipyards.\n“That sets off a death spiral for us: If we can’t get lumber, we can’t build\nships. If we can’t build ships, we can’t defend the shipyards. If they take the\nshipyards, they take the Cerulean Sea. If they take the Cerulean Sea, they\nwon’t need to win a single battle against us. Big Jasper and Little Jasper are\nislands, and they’re nowhere near self-sustaining. A simple naval blockade\nwould mean everyone there starves.”\n“Our skimmers can sink any ship they throw against us,” Cruxer\nprotested.\n“True, absolutely,” Kip said. “But skimmers can’t haul in food, or\ngunpowder, or salt, or lumber, or iron, or all the tens of thousands of things\nBig Jasper needs every single day. And the fact is, the secret of the\nskimmers won’t be a secret forever. How long will that be our advantage? A\nyear? It’ll take the Blood Robes a year or more to build the navy they need.\nWhat will the Chromeria do if they show up with a vast navy and\nskimmers?”\n“They’ll die,” Winsen said.\n“Make this simple for us, Breaker,” Ben-hadad said. “What do we need\nto do?”\n“I’m certain—and Lady Eirene Malargos needs to know this,” he said,\nlooking over at Verity, “that if we lose Blood Forest, we lose the war. There\nwas one battle already at Ox Ford, and our side lost. Grievously. Ruthgar\nlost thirty-five thousand men there. That, followed by Raven Rock and the\nworthless victory at Two Mills Junction? Ruthgar’s sick of taking the brunt\nof every battle. Sick of sending men to die. I think everyone on our side has\nwritten off the Foresters. They’re too far away, and too expensive and too\nhard to defend. A better line, they think, is the Great River. I think the\nsatrapahs and the Colors will never say this out loud, but they’ll send token\nforces to make a guerrilla war in the Forest to buy themselves time to build\ntheir own defenses, but no one’s going to send tens of thousands of soldiers\nto die again. In short, the Seven Satrapies have already fallen. They simply\ndon’t have the will to do what needs to be done to win.”\nA silence fell over them.\n“Worst fight speech, ever,” Winsen said.\n“But…” Kip said, grinning suddenly. “We have a few advantages.

He\nthrew off odious bonds and tore up bad treaties. He freed slaves. He\npromised wealth and a return to ancestral gods. A certain slice of the people\nloved him. That’s not true in Blood Forest. The people here care deeply\nabout nature, and they see wights as profoundly unnatural, defying the order\nof the seasons themselves by which life yields to death. Moreover, the\nColor Prince lost his temper here. He wiped out whole towns, and let his\nmen ravage and rape others. This is the satrapy just across from the border\ntown where two hundred young women jumped to their deaths off the walls\nof Raven Rock with their children in their arms. The people here are\nscattered, but they’re tough and they know the land intimately. They’re\nhunters and trappers and guides and lumbermen and river captains. In some\nareas, they’ve never much recognized the Chromeria, but they will\nrecognize someone who comes in and fights a hated invader with them. We\ngather everyone who’s willing and has something to offer, and we show the\nColor Prince why it’s called the Blood Forest. Tisis grew up there. She\nknows the people and their customs. With her help, we’re going to go to the\nDeep Forest, we’re gonna raise a small army, and we’re going to save the\nsatrapy.”\n“In other words,” Big Leo said, “we’re going go fuck up the Color\nPrince. Like I said.”\nKip punched the big man in his good shoulder. It was like hitting a side\nof beef. “Exactly. I just had to use more words to explain it for the slow\nones.”\n“Don’t you guys look at me!” Ferkudi said.\nAnd so, nearly in sight of the capital of Ruthgar, they boarded the odd\nnew skimmer that Ben-hadad had dubbed the Mighty Thruster.\nKip had shaken his head. Tisis had muttered, “Boys.” Ferkudi had\nguffawed. Winsen had grinned. Cruxer had blushed and said, “You can’t\ncall it that.”\n“We’re the Mighty,” Ben-hadad said. “The propulsion units are\nthrusters, that’s all.” The damn liar.\n“I guess you’ll be the first man to ride the Mighty Thruster?” Tisis\nasked.\nHis brow wrinkled. “That makes it sound…”\n“Make sure you take a good wide stance, legs far apart, or he’ll throw\nyou.”\n“He?

But motionless, barely breathing, seated with his legs\ncrossed, his fingers splayed in the sign of the three in an attitude of prayer,\nhe was habituated to his own little noises. It was only natural that, too long\ndeprived of sensations, he would start hallucinating.\nHow did you make it so long, brother?\nHis brother had gone mad down here, but slowly. So slowly. Sixteen\nyears in this monochromatic hell, and for how long had he been sane? Ten\nyears?\nGavin didn’t think he could make it two months.\nOdd.\nHe’d barely moved since Marissia had been taken away. He had control\nof nothing but his own body.\nSeven days. Seven days he’d eaten nothing. In the natural progression of\nfasting, he hadn’t even been hungry since the wretched third day.\nOn the seventh day, water had cascaded down the umbilicus above him.\nFirst, the rush of soapy water. When Gavin had created this prison, he’d\nthought it was a measure of his kindness to give such a luxury. Plus, he\ndidn’t know how long a man could live in filth without getting some sort of\ninfection, sickening, and dying. The Prisms’ War had seen plenty of filth,\nbut it had been a war measured in months. Even then, nearly as many men\nhad died of disease as from battle.\nBut when he’d designed the prison, he’d forgotten about heating the\nwater. A rush of cold, soapy water to a naked man with no means to heat\nhimself was no kindness.\nEven my attempt at kindness was cruelty.\nBut Gavin endured the torrent. He rubbed some water over his wounds,\nbut made no move to clean his beard or skin. He merely sat near the cloaca\non the floor and watched as his bread was soaked sodden and sucked away.\nThe lime, to defend against scurvy, came next. (There were no oranges\nnow, with the loss of Tyrea.) Gavin couldn’t tell, of course, if his father had\ndyed it blue as he himself always had dyed the oranges he’d sent his\nbrother.\nBut Gavin didn’t scramble to grab the lime.\nThe clean water flowed next, rinsing away the soapy water and the lime.\nGavin sat, impassive, his face in his hands.\nIn the new cleanness of the cell, he could somehow smell afresh his own\nstench—deliberate, this time—and the slight chalk aroma of blue luxin. He\nglanced up at his reflection, pinched to inhumanly narrow proportions by\nthe curving of the reflective wall, shimmering slightly with the crystalline\nfacets of so much blue luxin. It looked disgusted with him.\nThe gaunt figure said, “Starving yourself? You think that’s an acceptable\nway for a Guile to go? Grow a spine.”\n“I control what I can,” Gavin said.\n“I didn’t peg you for a coward.”"

I’m unhinged, he\nthought.\n“Make up your mind. You still have teeth, don’t you? You want to live,\nbite the bread. You want to die, bite your wrist. Bleed out.”\nMaybe it wasn’t his imagination.\nGavin could imagine taunting himself, but this wasn’t how he would\nhave done it.\nWith his hands in front of his face, Gavin couldn’t see if the reflection’s\nmouth moved in time with his own or not. Was his sanity so tenuous?\n“What am I doing?” Gavin asked aloud. Talking to oneself was one\nthing, talking as if one were really two different people was something else.\nThen he felt a chill down his spine. He could have sworn this time the\nreflection didn’t move quite correctly.\nHe tilted his head. Squinted. Sniffed. The reflection wasn’t quite moving\nin time with him.\n“You don’t remember?” the reflection asked. This time, Gavin was sure\nits mouth moved, whereas his hadn’t. But the voice was all in his head.\n“Where’s your perfect memory, Gavin Guile?” it asked.\n“Dazen.”\n“Doesn’t matter now, does it? After what you did. Filicide.”\nNo. It didn’t matter. “What are you?” Gavin asked. “I don’t feel mad.\nNor fevered. I’ve not been fasting so long that I should see apparitions.”\n“You really don’t remember. I’m appalled. Gavin Guile, the man so near\nto being a god, has forgotten his own creation? But some part of you does\nremember, doesn’t it? Else why are you talking in your sleep?”\n“What are you talking about? What are you?” And then it hit him.\n“Orholam have mercy, you’re the dead man.” The name itself was a distant\necho. Something his brother had ranted about once, years before, perhaps?\n“You still don’t understand how cruel you really are, do you?”\n“I wasn’t cruel,” Gavin said. “I did what I had to. I couldn’t kill him,\nand I couldn’t let him go. This was the only way. It was only supposed to be\nuntil I established my rule. Things escaped me. There was never a time I\ncould release him safely. I thought there would be, someday. I never did\nanything to be cruel, though. It was never that.”\nThe apparition grinned, unconvinced. Like Gavin was pathetic.\n“The black didn’t take that much from you,” the dead man said. “I know\nyou wanted it to. You fed the black every obscenity you’d committed, every\ncrime and horror. Black luxin is forgetting and madness and oblivion so it\nmostly worked. But one thing it is not. It isn’t clean. It never works exactly\nas you hope, does it? You forget the wrong things, and it sticks like tar on\nthe fingers of your mind.”\nFor years, Gavin hadn’t even remembered that drafting black was\npossible. He must have fed even his knowledge of how to draft black into\nthe black. For years, he hadn’t been able to remember what he’d done."

For years, he hadn’t been able to remember what he’d done.\nCertainly not how. Hellishly, now—too late—it was coming back to him in\nbits and pieces, black stones turned over in the light, cutting memories best\nleft on the banks of the river Regret. “What are you?” he asked.\n“You created these prisons, the first one in a single month, the rest over\nthe course of the first year. It was a mammoth undertaking. A brilliant\ndemonstration of your gifts, and of your monomania and your fear. But you\nknew. You knew he’d be down here for a long time, and you knew he would\nhave nothing to do but figure out how to undo what you had done. And\ndestruction is ever so much easier than creation, isn’t it?\n“But then you realized that wasn’t true only of things, but also of men.\nDestruction is easier than creation. So you made me. A reflection of\nyourself. A distraction. A dissuasion. You knew that eventually Gavin would\nfigure out an escape, unless you could keep him from turning his mind to\nthe puzzle fully. So you made me, to destroy him first, so he could never\ndestroy your prison.”\n“No,” Gavin said. It was too plausible, too smart.\n“You had been exploring the forbidden arts of will-casting, and so you\nwill-cast a portion of yourself into this prison. I am indeed a reflection of\nyou, Dazen. I am all the hatred you had for your older, stronger, more\nassured big brother, with his natural air of superiority, with his total\nownership of father’s affection and father’s pride, with his easy mastery of\nall that came to hand. With his casual contempt for you. You only needed\nme to be a distraction, but you decided to go far beyond that. You made me\nto be an instrument of torture. Your brother lived alone, with only your\nhatred to keep him company for sixteen years.”\n“I would never…”\n“You are a crueler man than you know. Of course, then you used the\nblack to obliterate the memory of what you had done, even from yourself.\nAs if sin forgotten is sin forgiven.”\nGavin swallowed.\n“But all magic fades, scoured slowly by the sands of passing years, and\nyou’re starting to remember, aren’t you?”\nIt couldn’t be true. But it fit. He had recently dreamed about his first\nFreeing as the Prism, and that dream had ended with his using black luxin.\nOn purpose, to blot out memory.\nIt had worked. He had lost his memory of that night—and how many\nothers?—for more than seventeen years.\nWith how much evil he could remember that he’d done, how much\nworse must the memories be that the old him had decided needed to be fed\nto the black?\n“You can get out of here, you know,” the dead man said through heavy-\nlidded eyes.\n“How?” Gavin asked.\n“You know how.”\nDraft black. One last time.\n“Any idea that starts with the words ‘one last time’ is a bad idea,” Gavin\nmuttered.\n“What?” the dead man asked.\n“Something father used to say.”"

More in control of yourself and your magic. You\ncould do it safely.”\n“I have no magic.”\n“You can have the black again.”\n“No. It is madness and poison and murder and death. It’s what got me\nhere.”\n“Yes, here, alive,” the dead man said. “How much do you remember\nabout Sundered Rock?”\n“Everything,” Gavin said.\n“Liar.”\n“I remember enough.”\n“Really? I doubt that. How much truth are you ready for, ‘Gavin’\nGuile?”\n“I have no illusions left.”\nThe dead man barked a laugh. “Odd indeed that I am the fragment of\nyou, when you are the one who is so thin and hollow. Gavin, Gavin. Do you\nremember meeting the Mirror Janus Borig when you were a child?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do you remember what she said?”\nVaguely. “Yes. What does it matter? Mirrors don’t see everything.”\n“You don’t remember.”\n“No,” Gavin admitted. “And I don’t want to talk about it.”\n“Oh, that is fortunate. Because I was not created to torment your brother,\nno. Sadly, you created me to torment a prisoner. Which now is you!”\nGleeful, irritating little ass. Had Gavin ever been like that? Oh yes, he had.\nHe’d honed his skills against his big brother when they were children.\n“And,” the dead man said, “I’ve got nothing but time, and you have\nnowhere to go.”\n“Make your point and be done with it,” Gavin said. But his stomach\nturned. How long could he last with a twin self mocking himself in his hell?\nThis apparition would know all of his weaknesses, all his secret self-\nloathings. The dead man would be a better tormentor for Dazen himself\nthan he could possibly have been for the real Gavin.\n“Janus Borig told you, Dazen. She told you that you could draft black.”\n“Yes, so what?” Gavin had recovered the memories of that much.\n“She told you that you could only draft black. You were a black\nmonochrome, Dazen. You told your brother. You, who had been powerless,\nthe one son in a powerful family who couldn’t draft. You could feel father’s\nembarrassment, his keenness that no one else know, his hope that he could\nfix you eventually. So when you heard that you had black, you bragged\nabout it, and Gavin feared you. Rightly. When you began to evince your\npowers, your brother knew how you were doing it, because you told him.\nAnd gradually, Gavin came to understand that he had to stop you.”\n“No, this isn’t true.”\n“Do you remember why you went to the White Oak estate, to face\nKarris’s brothers?”\n“I went there to see her. We were going to elope.”\n“No, you knew she was already gone. You cared for her, somewhat, at\nleast enough you didn’t want her to die. But you never planned to marry\nher. You yourself leaked that you were coming to take her away.”\n“No.”"

You yourself leaked that you were coming to take her away.”\n“No.”\nBut the dead man went on, heedless. “So if you knew she was gone, why\ndid you go to the White Oak estate? Why would you knowingly face seven\nbrothers, seven drafters?”\n“I wouldn’t. That’s not how it happened.” But it was so long ago now.\nSo foggy.\n“You went for the same reason that you’ve hunted down wights\nyourself. Why would a Prism himself hunt wights? When Orea Pullawr\ntried to stop you, it should have been a small fight—Gavin, you’ll get\nyourself killed, she said. But you fought for the right to hunt wights as if\nyour very life depended on it. Why would a Prism do such a thing?”\n“I could hunt them safely. There was no reason for other men to die. So\nmany had died already. It wasn’t dangerous for me.”\n“No, those are the lies you’ve told others to make yourself look good.\nThe truth, Gavin, was that it was dangerous for you not to.”\n“What does this have to do with the White Oaks?” Gavin demanded.\n“Because between them, her brothers included drafters of every color.\nBecause black is emptiness, but emptiness can be filled. Darkness may be\nfilled with light. Black can hold every color. You went to the White Oak\nestate to murder those young men, to steal their powers. Because that’s\nwhat black drafters do.”\n“No.” But it came out a whisper.\n“And that’s why you had to hunt wights. You’ve been running out of\npower from the very first day, and it had to be replenished with the blood of\ndrafters. In her weakness and her love, your mother denied it. Your father\nand brother knew the truth. They held off as long as they could, but when\nyou murdered all those people at the White Oak estate, they knew you were\na monster. They knew you had to be stopped. You, Dazen, are the Black\nPrism.”\nDazen had crafted his Gavin persona like a goblet of blown glass.\nMolten glass given shape with hot air, hardening to a fine, beautiful, brittle\nfinish. Seeing the gold leaf twining down the delicate stem and the rich\nimperial purples of the wine, and hearing the melodious chime of fine\ncrystal, the world had been blinded to the palsied hands cupping the bowl.\nNow, wine sipped down to the lees, the glass slipped from drunken\nfingers, spun from control, and shattered—an explosion of lies, glimmering\nnow in the light, sharp, dangerous. He stooped to pick them up, ashamed.\nHe picked up the shards with tremulous fingers, and they cut him. Gifted\ningrate. Liar. Impostor. Murderer. Thief. Filicide. Betrayer. Villain. Blood\nand wine were watered with tears on the broken flagstones of his mind.\nFalse teacher, false prophet, false king. Bloody-minded, benighted, black\nhearted, black drafter, black Prism.

        "text": "Chapter 20\n“So, uh, Your Ladyship, what’s this town called?” Winsen asked.\nThe Mighty were skimming up the Great River as they had been for\nmore than a week. Winsen had been peppering Tisis with seemingly\ninnocuous questions since they’d shot past the harbormasters at Rath.\n“I don’t know what this one’s called, but we should be getting to a town\ncalled Verit soon. It’s right at the base of Thundering Falls,” she said. “It’s\nwhere the Great River and the Akomi Nero come together—or, well, for us\n—split as we go upriver beyond the falls. The Akomi Nero originates in the\nRuthgari Highlands.”\n“Huge landmark, huh?” Winsen said.\n“Huge,” she said. She was trying to play it off like Winsen’s questions\ndidn’t bother her, but it was obvious to Kip that they did.\n“Good to know our guide knows the big landmarks at least, I guess,” he\nsaid, not quite under his breath.\nShe flushed, her pale skin doing her no favors as she seethed. But she\nnever said a rude word. Kip had asked her, awkwardly, if he was supposed\nto do something to defend his wife from his own friends, and she’d said no,\nthat she had to win certain battles on her own.\nBut he wasn’t entirely sure she meant it, and Winsen usually managed to\nwalk right on the line where he wasn’t rude, but he was calling her value\ninto question.\n“I mean, you have been down this river a few times, right?” Winsen\nasked.\n“Winsen,” Cruxer interrupted. “Are you being an asshole?”\nThe smaller young man said, “No, sir. It is my specific intent not to be\nan asshole.”\n“Is it also your specific intent to come as close to the line as possible?”\nCruxer asked.\nWinsen hesitated. One didn’t lie to Cruxer. Winsen had been\ninsubordinate once early on. Cruxer threw him off the skimmer. He’d swum\nashore—through waters where alligators were known to live—and had to\nwalk through the afternoon and night to catch up with the skimmer.\nWhen he’d arrived, only an hour before they had to depart, Cruxer had\nchastised him for being late for his shift on watch. He’d stayed up, and\ntaken his turn on the reeds, too.\n“Yes, sir, it was,” Winsen said. “Did I miscalculate, sir?”\n“Oh, I don’t know if you were right up to the line or over it, Win.\nOrholam judges the heart, and so do I. Keep your mouth shut until we make\ncamp, why don’t you?”\nWinsen saluted—silently—and that was that. For now.\nIt didn’t help that Tisis hadn’t really been able to answer any of his\nquestions. She’d told him she didn’t know the lower river. He’d said, ‘But\nsurely you know it better than the rest of us, who’ve never been here,\nright?’\nSeeing that they wouldn’t make it to the top of Thundering Falls that\nnight, they made camp early to avoid staying in Verit or any of the outlying\ntowns."

This would have been most of\na day’s journey if they’d traveled conventionally.\nThey’d not only passed the authorities easily, but also avoided river\npirates, easily glided over snags that would have otherwise required a pilot\nwith current charts, and been able to hunt from the deck as well.\nThey’d slowed their pace after getting stuck in sandbars half a dozen\ntimes, though. With drafting and a lot of muscle, they were always able to\nescape, but they lost hours every time. Ben-hadad had already been working\non a design for the next Blue Falcon, and he added a shallower draft,\ncamouflage, and a depth gauge to his designs.\nThat night, as he had several times before, Kip went with Tisis to a\nnearby village to get the news. Even this far from the fighting, Ruthgari and\nForester villagers knew a lot about the world. The Great River was by far\nthe largest arterial for goods and news between Green Haven, the Floating\nCity of Dúnbheo, and Rath—and thence to the rest of the satrapies. Tisis\nusually learned whatever they knew.\nThough she used aliases, the villagers always accepted her as a Forester.\nIn the simplicity of his Tyrean village, Kip had always thought blonde hair\nand light skin must be pure Ruthgari traits, but the Great River made those\nwho lived on its banks nearly as diverse as any people on the Cerulean\nSea’s coastlines.\nTonight they stopped at a beaten-down farm with children’s playthings\nin the yard but no garden. As ever, they brought game with them, a sure\nway to find welcome at the subsistence farms they visited, and they called a\nhello a good distance away to announce themselves unthreateningly.\nThere was no lady of the house here, only a veteran of the Blood Wars\nand his twelve-year-old son who seemed less than well mentally, staring\ninto the cookfire and laughing at odd moments, squawking or shrieking\nsuddenly and then giggling, and talking nonsense, sometimes loudly.\nTisis showed no fear of the boy, though, and ended up holding one of his\nhands in hers, and not minding when he sniffed her hair.\nWhen the veteran saw they wouldn’t have any cruel words regardless of\nhow his boy acted, he warmed to them. He gave them a concise analysis of\nthe military disposition of the upper river cities, and the venues of attack the\nWhite King would likely take, given what they knew of his forces.\nIt was the first time Kip had heard the term.\nApparently ‘the White King’ was what the Color Prince was calling\nhimself now.\nBy the end of the evening, Kip had asked the man to join them, but\nDeoradhán Wood shook his head. “You seen my boy. His mother weren’t\nwell, neither. Different than him, but not well. In the head. Or perhaps the\nheart. She walked into the river two years back. You understand? Walked\ninto the river. Didn’t even leave me a body to bury, a grave to visit. Damn\nnear killed me, too, when she done that. I live for my boy now.”"

I live for my boy now.”\nThe man was suffering, but Kip couldn’t help but feel that it was\nneedless. “You’ve got a clear mind and a strong back still. I’d have a place\nfor you. A place of honor and a purpose. Is there none who can take care of\nthe boy for a time? Six months? A year, maybe? We have gold to help, if\nfeeding him and all is a burden.”\n“Nah, he’s worth his grub. Good helper,” Deoradhán Wood said. “But I\ncan’t go. My lot ain’t easy, but it’s good. I’ll carry this load until the\nHighest frees me of it one way or th’other.”\n“If someone doesn’t stop the White King,” Kip said, “no one will be\nable to sit on their farm and live quietly, doing right.”\n“I’m no coward, son. No tired old man. But big causes and crowds of\nstrangers? What kinda man sacrifices his own son for that? Besides,” he\ncontinued, “I gave my word that I would never leave him, no matter what.\nA foolish oath, perhaps, but better men have abided by worse. Orholam\nlight your paths and guide your arrows, young warriors.”\nWhen they got back to camp, everything was set up and a fire cheerily\nburning. They ate and shared what they’d learned. It wasn’t much, but it\nwas enough to help them make the next decision.\nAt Thundering Falls, they had to decide whether to pay to use the great\nlocks to raise the boat to the level of the river above the falls, to pay for\nporters, to attempt to port the Blue Falcon themselves, to sell it, or to sink it\nand build a new one.\nThey had enough money to pay for portage or the locks, but Cruxer\nthought they might need the coin later, and porters would be able to inspect\nthe boat closely—the first step to the Chromeria’s losing its secret\nadvantage. The Blue Falcon was too heavy for them to carry easily,\nespecially because the porters were known to sabotage those who eschewed\ntheir services, loosening steps and rearranging signs to point hikers up\ndead-end paths constructed to take them to places where it was impossible\nto turn around.\nIt was the kind of near banditry that the Chromeria had never stamped\nout, and probably never would. It still pissed Kip off.\nBut what the old veteran turned farmer had told them let them know\nthey’d be moving up the river a lot. It was worth it to build yet another\nskimmer. It broke their hearts a little to unseal the luxins and let the boat\ndissolve into dust, but such a military secret wasn’t something to simply\nhand over to anyone who had the coin for it.\nThey made the climb easily and quickly. The porters even seemed\nfriendly. Perhaps Big Leo’s permanent glower encouraged their deference.\nWhen they reached the top of the falls, they hiked on another couple of\nleagues until they found a nice secluded spot. Ben-hadad was excited to\nbuild a new ship, even if working with so much luxin meant hastening them\nall to the end of their halos."

But they\nare more citizens of the Seven Satrapies than they are Foresters. Here, up\nwhere it isn’t easy for foreigners to come, the land is wild. There are\npockets of civilization here, even the two great cities, but they’re lamps in\nthe forest’s night. You may see people with forked ears or a blue cast to\ntheir skin. Say nothing. They are the last of the pygmy blood, less than half-\nbloods. Quarters. Eighths. Don’t inquire.”\n“Why not?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“It’s never a happy story,” Tisis said.\n“How so?” Winsen pressed. “We’re less likely to blunder if we know\nwhat the blunder would be.”\n“You’re asking me like you think I don’t know,” she said calmly.\n“You’re damn right,” he said.\n“Winsen,” Cruxer said, “are you—”\n“No, sir. Not at all this time. I’m just trying to get an honest take on\nwhat our strengths are here. Does our guide really know anything more than\nwhat you’d read out of a book in the Chromeria’s libraries, because see\nhere, I realized something the other day.”\nHe waited.\n“Oh, please, do go on,” Ben-hadad said sarcastically. “We’re on\ntenterhooks.”\n“You said you grew up among these people. But… you’re Ruthgari, not\na Forester. And you’ve been a hostage of the Chromeria as long as I’ve\nknown you or known of you. I mean, I don’t mind that you’re just here to\nentertain Lord Guile at night, but if that’s all you are, I’d rather we all not\npretend you’re anything other than the royal sword swallower.”\nKip was halfway across the circle before anyone could blink, but he was\nintercepted before he could lay out Winsen by none other than Tisis herself,\nwho threw herself bodily against him.\n“No!” she said. “No. Let me handle this.”\nKip looked around at his friends, and saw she was right. Dubious\nglances met his.\n“Hey,” Ben-hadad said, shrugging. “Leadership should come with some\nperquisites, but Winsen’s not all wrong. We deserve to know what she\nbrings to the table—and if it’s only our leader’s happiness, great! But\nmaybe if that’s it, then she shouldn’t be leading us…?

He’d not\nspoken of her too kindly before he married her, granted. Orholam’s balls,\nthis would make it a hundred times worse if they found out that the one\nthing they thought she was good for was actually not working out at all, at\nall.\n“After Gavin Guile ended the Blood Wars,” Tisis said, “by his decree all\nthe leading families of both sides had to surrender certain lands, and were\ngiven equal lands on the other side of the river. I was raised on the new\nMalargos lands deep inside Blood Forest. It was my assignment from the\nvery beginning to become one of the Foresters, so that my family might\nhold that land, and inspire loyalty. At ten I was selected to be a hostage of\nthe Chromeria—”\n“Ten years old!” Winsen said.\n“But four months of the year I’ve been allowed to rotate back into my\nown lands while my cousin Antonius took my place as hostage. I’ve spent\nthe bulk of those months in the Forest, and some part in Rath, and yes, Win,\nI’ve spent a lot of my time at the Chromeria learning about the home I’ve\nadopted.\n“So yes, I’m useless in a fight. I’ve never pretended otherwise. I can\nload and fire a musket, but that’s about the extent of my martial skills. But I\nknow lots of arcane history that even most Foresters might not. Like—as\nyou asked when you were trying to prove me a pretender, why you\nshouldn’t ask pygmies their lineage. The answer is that it implies that you\nthink they have human blood.”\n“And that’s bad why?” Kip asked.\n“Because pygmy women can take a man’s seed, but they couldn’t bear\nhis children.

I didn’t mean it like that! And not me! I’m not—I meant no\npregnancies, right?”\n“No, no,” Tisis said. “What I meant was, they can get pregnant by men,\nbut they die in childbirth. Every time. Of course, pygmy men could breed\nhuman women no problem. But in the next generation, any half-blooded\ndaughters had the same problem. Even two half-bloods marrying often\nended in the woman’s death, if not on the first child, then often on the\nsecond. Even a half-blood marrying a pygmy ran a risk.

So the half- or quarter-bloods you\nsee now are either the children of taboo love or the product of something\nmy dear, lovely, may-he-burn-in-the-fires-of-all-nine-hells ancestor Broin\nthe Cruel called ‘retributive rape.’\n“Now, male and female alike, mixed bloods are welcomed to\ncommunities—some even think they’re good luck, as they’ve obviously\ndodged death—but they’re utterly shunned in marriage and romance, for\nwho would willingly pass a death curse onto their children? Even naturally\ntall pygmy men and women find it difficult to find partners, as everyone\nsuspects they might have falsified their genealogies.”\n“I lost you back at ‘retributive rape.’ What the hell?” Kip asked.\n“Broin the Cruel lost a horse race and claimed the pygmy’s jockey—a\nchild—didn’t weigh enough, and was thereby cheating. He started a war\nover it. He said the only way to purge the pygmies of their deceitful nature\nwas rape. Only from virtuous blood—his and his men’s, of course—could\ncome virtuous seed, to bear virtuous fruit in befouled soil—the pygmy\nwomen. Thus he tried to make a sacrament of rape. It wasn’t for his men’s\npleasure, you see, by his perverse doctrine, rape was for the pygmies’\nsalvation. So they gelded the men and raped the women and condemned\nhalf the next generation—the daughters—to death as well. To say that the\neffects of that murderous asshole have been far reaching would be an\nunderstatement. It was partly to escape his legacy that my own ancestors\nleft the Forest and went to Ruthgar. And now you understand why we\ndecided to work doubly hard to fit in as Foresters again.”\nBig Leo breathed a curse. “My parents traveled the Forest for ten years,\nand they never spoke of such a thing.”\n“It’s not really something we speak of,” Tisis said. “Many of the\npygmies withdrew to the Deep Forest after that. Some hundred years ago\nnow. It’s said free tribes of them still exist, and where we’re going, we may\nfind them. They wear a permanent smile, part of the bone structure of their\nfaces. But they’ll tear your throat out if you insult them, and it’s said their\nwill magic can turn the forest itself against their enemies. So if we meet\nany, Winsen, you watch your sloppy undisciplined leaky anus of a mouth\nfor once, or your short bitter life may come to a violent end and none of us\nare going to start a war over it.

The other Blackguards on the roof\nwere standing at ease, laughing and telling jokes, but Teia snapped to\nattention, only a little late.\nOpting out of anything would be a terrible way to start. The new person\nwas always considered useless until he or she proved otherwise. Regardless\nof how she’d done in training, this was a fresh start. Which was great if\ntraining hadn’t gone well and you needed to show you belonged. But it was\nterrible if what you wanted was to take all the goodwill you’d earned in\ntraining and for once, just this one time, for Orholam’s sake, by all that was\nholy, you really needed to go to bed, cry for approximately ten seconds, and\nthen fall asleep.\n“Got a special assignment for you, Teia,” Commander Fisk said. “You\nand I rose together, didn’t we? I was your trainer when you were a scrub.\nI’ve seen you. And I know a shirker when I see one.”\nAh hells. It was so unfair. She never did less than anyone!\nT. Now’s the time to opt out, quick. If you wait until he says what the\nduty is, you’ll really look bad.\nBut she said nothing.\n“And you’re no shirker,” he said. He glanced over at squat, one-handed\nSamite, the new trainer. Teia wondered what the significance was in that\nlook. “In fact, I’ve never seen anyone jump into their duties quite so fast, no\nmatter what they are.”\nWhat?! A compliment?\n“You got your squad off this island alive because you were that loyal to\nthem, and then you left them, because you’re that loyal to us.”\nTeia swallowed and nodded. She understood that he was shaping the\nstory. There would be gossip among the Blackguards and questions about\nher loyalty, both in fighting for her squad and then in abandoning her squad.\nThe Mighty weren’t technically deserters—they’d left with the permission\nof the promachos and before they swore the final oaths—but they’d left\nright when the Blackguard really needed more people. And they’d been the\nAleph squad, the best of the Blackguard recruits. Their loss weakened the\nBlackguard, and that had led to sore feelings that could spill over onto Teia.\nThe commander was putting the best face possible on Teia’s split\nloyalty.\n“I figured you’d be here this morning,” Commander Fisk said. “We\nalways lose some Guards right at the end, but I know you. I knew you’d\nstay. It’s a big moment, for any of us, so I went and talked to some scholars\nlast night. I asked what Adrasteia means. Do you know what they told me?”\n“No, sir.” Teia thought her parents had liked it because they thought it\nsounded pretty.\n“Funny thing. Sometimes you wonder if a name shapes a thing. But if\nyou didn’t know it… Adrasteia means ‘not inclined to run away.’ And\napparently, you’re not. Anyway, you look like hell. And you’ve got\nexecution detail at noon.” He grimaced. “Until then, you’ve got inspection\nduty.”\n“Sir?”"

Do it quickly, shouldn’t take you more than four or five hours.”\nA bunk? Inspecting a bunk for five hours—\nOh, that was her bunk!\nShe snapped a salute and walked toward the stairs to go inside.\n“She runs toward duty, and when it comes time to leave, she walks,”\nCommander Fisk said. “Get a move on, Walker! Before I change my mind!”\nShe started to protest, but it didn’t matter. If she’d gone fast, he would\nhave made a crack about how she was not inclined to run away unless her\nbunk was at the other end. This was what it was to be the newest\nBlackguard.\nIt felt… awesome.\nInspecting her bunk for five hours felt awesome.\nWaking up didn’t. She swore she’d been asleep only minutes when she\nwas awakened by the Greyling twins.\n“Teia, it’s time. We let you sleep as long as we could. We have to go.\nNow.”\nShe sat up.\nBut Gavin’s eyes widened.\nGill glanced at his younger brother and cleared his throat.\nTeia hadn’t realized that she’d stripped off her tunic before lying down,\nand her camisole had gotten all twisted in however she’d thrashed in her\nsleep, so she exposed half a breast as she sat up. Half of little being\npractically nothing.\n“Gav!” Gill scolded as Teia hiked things back in place. He smacked his\nbrother’s shin with the haft of his spear.\n“Ow! What was that—”\n“You know what it was for, you ape. Glance, don’t gape.”\nGavin winced. “I know, I know. Look, don’t linger. Sorry. Sorry.”\n“Not to me,” Gill said.\n“What?” Gavin asked.\n“Don’t say it to me.”\n“Well, I was tryin’ not to stare again—” Gavin started. “I have a hard\ntime controlling my eyes when, you know?”\n“Trouble controlling your eyes? And you’re a drafter?” Teia said. “And\nyou’re the veterans I’m supposed to be looking up to?” She stood up and\nreached for the hem of her camisole. “It’s not battlefield rules, is it?”\n“Huh?” Gavin asked. “Oh.”\nThey turned away, and she stripped and dressed in fresh clothes quickly.\n“I didn’t mean to… I, uh, I polished your boots and belt so you could\nsleep a little longer,” Gavin said.\nOh no. First, Teia didn’t want anyone going through her things. Second,\nhe was a little too eager to please.\nTeia said, “Well, since you’re so helpful and so interested in my personal\nbusiness, take these,” she put a wad of garments in his hands, “and put them\nin the bin for dirty menstrual rags.”\nGavin dropped the clothes from limp hands as if he’d been pithed.\nGill guffawed."

I\nalmost did that once, and I’ve no interest in doing it again. The rules are\nthere for a reason, and I’m going to obey them. Nothing personal.”\nHe didn’t look as if he understood, but she went past him and washed up\nin the Archers’ toilets as quickly as possible. Curse cramps, anyway. Maybe\nhis big brother would explain it to him while she was gone.\nWhen she came back, he’d put the rest of her clothes in the basket for\nthe slaves. She was glad that she’d remembered to change the master\ncloak’s disguise so it looked like a Blackguard cloak now. After you were\nelevated, your nunk clothes were taken by the slaves, laundered, patched,\nand given to the next cohort. Teia didn’t even want to think about what\nshe’d have had to go through if she’d let the master cloak get mixed with\nevery other nunk cloak at the Chromeria.\nBut she hadn’t loused up, this time.\nShe threw on the cloak. She felt resplendent, proud.\n“You look good,” Gill said. “You look like a Blackguard.”\nThey let her check her own weapons—a Blackguard always checked his\nown weapons.\n“I didn’t mean anything like that,” Gavin said, awkwardly. “I was just\ntrying to give you some more time to sleep.”\nHis face cleared. Rejection was hard for any man. Rejection and a loss\nof face together were too much for most.\n“Oh, my mistake, then. I’m just so excited about finally being a\nBlackguard, I’ve got a hair trigger about anything that would make me mess\nup, I guess. Forgive me, brother?” she asked.\nWhy was it on a woman to tiptoe around the feelings of men…?\n“Of course, sister,” he said, and all was well.\nAt least men usually made up for projecting their stupidity by being\neasily maneuvered.\nThey had to jog to make it to their posts on time, forming up outside the\nWhite’s apartments, and Watch Captain Tempus grimaced at them for\ncutting it close on this day of days.

He had deep-black skin and intense blue eyes compounded with blue\nhalos.\n“On time is five minutes early,” he said.\n“My fault, sir,” Gill said.\nGavin and Teia both looked at him. Gill really was a big brother. He\nwould gibe Gavin constantly, but when it came time to take care of things,\nGill was there every time.\nWatch Captain Tempus handed Teia a velvet baggie no larger than a coin\npurse. “Dark eye caps,” he said. “So you don’t go blind using paryl out in\nthe full sun.”\nThe hallway was crowded, not only with Blackguards, but also with\nslaves scrubbing at the stains on the floors and ceilings from the smoke, fire,"

        "text": "the full sun.”\nThe hallway was crowded, not only with Blackguards, but also with\nslaves scrubbing at the stains on the floors and ceilings from the smoke, fire,\nbullets, and blood. Stonemasons and carpenters were making their own\nmeasurements and estimates with their own journeymen and apprentices\nand slaves, and the Chromeria’s slaves were trying to work among all that.\nCleaning and repairing the highest floor of the Prism’s Tower wasn’t\nsomething that would be allowed to proceed at a slower but more efficient\npace. Half a dozen Blackguards stood watching the workers at all times.\nThe violation of this area, the White’s very sanctum, the Blackguard’s\nhome, had been taken as a personal affront. Teia was sure that she would be\nanswering more questions about that in the near future, too.\nWatch Captain Tempus led them past the Guards at the door. A knot of\ndiplomats, room slaves, an anxious luxiat, and one-handed Trainer Samite\nstood around the White’s desk. As Teia’s squad came in, Karris declared,\n“Everything else will have to wait.” Her voice rose over the people crowded\naround her, though with her diminutive height, she did not.\n“Tell Carver Black I’ll meet him in two hours, and to have as many of\nthose reports as possible. Tell the Ruthgari ambassador I won’t see her until\ndinner. Assure her that I’m not putting her off on purpose. Have her seated\nwith me to placate her. Clear everything out of the first two hours after\nnoon, we’ll have some urgent demands for a meeting from the High Luxiats\nafter the executions. Are we ready?”\nThe luxiat attending her blanched. “Surely you’re not presiding over the\nexecution in that?”\nTeia still couldn’t see Karris, so she didn’t see what he was talking about\nfor a moment, but the room went absolutely still at his reproof of the White.\nAs the diplomats nervously shrank back to let Teia’s squad come\nforward, Teia saw what Karris was wearing, and she almost laughed aloud.\nWhoever was shocked by Karris’s choice of clothing had no idea who they\nwere dealing with. She wore an outfit much like what she’d worn to Teia’s\nswearing in. White Blackguard blacks, tight fit around her athlete’s body,\ninfused with luxin, and decorated with silver thread. She had even—\nwhimsically?—denoted her rank on her left shoulder. A Parian zero, the\nstylized circle looking something like an eye.\nGiven that her clothes were white, the outfit did reveal her curves far\nmore than identically cut blacks would have, but to Teia’s and the\nBlackguard’s eyes, it mostly revealed that Karris hadn’t let herself grow fat\nwhen she’d left her official Blackguard duties. Neither modest nor\nimmodest, it was amodest, clothing indifferent to any man’s or woman’s\nsexual interpretation of it. Here was the body as power, as an implement of\nwar sharp honed with use. Her clothing said, ‘Remember who I am and\nwhere I came from and how I intend to rule.’\nIt would take a soft, lustful man like a luxiat to see this body in harness\nfor war first as a receptacle for his illicit desire."

But that thing was not what I’m choosing to wear. If you’re such\na fool that you use your eyes when you ought to be using your ears, you’re\ntoo much a fool to advise me. You may dare correct the White, but do it for\nthe right thing. Tell your superiors that I wish never to see your face again,\nand if I do, there will be consequences. For them. And for you. There are\nmany souls beyond the Everdark Gates who crave a luxiat’s wisdom.”\n“High Lady, I didn’t—” Sweat stood out instantly on his face.\nKarris said, “In another time, I should delight in giving you a second\nchance. Lust, after all, is a sin of the body. But you have gone beyond lust\nall the way to the depths of pride in giving reproof to another for your own\nsin. Thus does the weakness of your body cloud the eye of your mind.\nOrholam shall forgive you if you repent truly, but I have no time for you\nwhile there are still holy men and women in the Magisterium with\nunclouded sight who might give me true counsel. Begone.”\nHe looked at her for only a moment, seeing iron there. Then he looked to\nthe Blackguards, who hadn’t even stepped forward, but their eyes were\nwalls against him. He looked to the other courtiers, and saw no aid from\nany of them. Some, doubtless, he had worked with for years.\nHe turned on his heel, back straight, and strode from the room, huffing.\nKarris obviously dismissed him from her mind before he got to the door.\nShe gestured for the courtiers to leave.\nShe walked toward the slaves’ nook and sat in a chair there, allowing her\nslaves to work on her hair while she spoke. “My brothers and sisters—my\nformer brothers and sisters,” she said to the Blackguards. “I hope you will\nnot find me impertinent in borrowing a semblance of your garb. I should\nhave asked first. I recently fought in a dress, and it nearly cost me my life.\nWe are at war, and I will not be helpless. I trust you to defend me, but in\nturn, you can trust me to be as little of a burden as possible.” A grin stole\nover her face. “Plus, it’s impossible to find anything else nearly as\ncomfortable as the blacks.”\nThey shared her grin.\n“I think offense is the last thing we feel, High Lady…” Tempus paused.\nIt was within protocol to address the White as ‘High Lady,’ but he’d\nobviously meant to append her name, and his wits failed him. ‘High Lady\nKarris’ because of their Blackguard friendship, or was that too informal?\n‘High Lady Guile’ because of her long-hoped-for marriage? But that had\nbeen so brief and so painful, and did that seem to ignore all she had\naccomplished under her own name? ‘High Lady White Oak’? But did that\nseem to ignore her marriage?"

I am\nthose other names as well, but for the time Orholam has given me in this\noffice, I am the White before all else. Caleen?”\nHer slaves had finished putting the pins in her hair, and now they set a\nlarge wig and headdress on Karris’s head. Luminous sea demon ivory had\nbeen carved into a seven-pointed crown. Suspended above the central point\nwas a single winking diamond, smaller than one would expect. Platinum-\nwhite hair cascaded down around Karris’s shoulders, but each tip had been\ndyed one of the seven colors where it swept back up to entwine with the\nivory crown.\nHer only nod to her origins as a green and red drafter was a single\nearring in each ear, a ruby and an emerald. She waved away any powders.\n“I’m pale enough,” she said. “And I care not if they see me sweat.” Even\nwhile the slaves worked, another held up a series of parchments for her to\nperuse. The White would nod every so often, and the slave would turn the\npages. The woman was illiterate, and once Karris had to motion for her to\nturn the page right side up.\nThe White was practicing her speech, Teia realized.\n“I take it back,” Karris said. “Give me some powder.”\nCaptain Tempus cleared his throat. “On most days, the White being late\nwould be expected, High Lady White. But noon waits for no one.”\n“Thank you, Captain,” Karris said, peeved. Then she sighed. “I’m sorry.\nIn the unexpected absence of my chief room slave, it is kind of you to\nremind me. I am well aware of the pressures of time today. Please don’t act\ndifferently. I’m not accustomed to… all of this. Any of it. Orea made it look\nso easy.”\n“She’d been doing it ten years by the time you knew her,” Samite said.\n“Your first time in the sparring circle, you don’t try to win; you try to\nsurvive.”\n“Doesn’t seem like an ideal time to be learning as I go, does it?” Karris\nasked.\nTell me about it, Teia thought.\nKarris stood, her makeup finished. “Shall we?” she asked.\nSamite said, “You aren’t… I mean I understand dismissing some\nslobbering luxiats, but you aren’t actually going out there like… Or do I\nneed to find a new job?”\nKarris grinned. “Ha! I was just playing with you. I wondered how far\nyou’d let me go. All things may be permissible, but not all are fruitful.”\nShe beckoned, and two slave women came from the closet, carrying a\ndress between them. It opened like a clamshell, sideways. Karris stepped\ninto the sleeves as if into a jacket, and the rest was buckled tight around her.\n“How did the tailor take my instructions?” Karris asked the younger of\nthe slaves.\n“I believe ‘apoplexy’ is the word. But obedience, too.”"

So if\nI need to fight—or, more likely, if I’m injured and you need to carry me\naway from danger or see how bad a wound is, you can cut the dress off in a\nmatter of moments.” She turned to the slave. “Shorter sleeves next time.”\n“He said if you asked for shorter sleeves to tell you to look for another\ntailor, because he’ll be jumping off each of the seven towers until one of\nthem finally agrees to release him from this hell you’ve confined him in.”\nKarris laughed. “Is it a universal rule that the more talented the artist, the\nmore of a pain in the ass?”\n“We’re all pains in the ass if we can get away with it,” Samite said.\n“Great artists are just allowed to get away with it more.”\nWaving away the slaves now just fluffing her skirts, Karris asked, “How\ndo I look? Never mind. Don’t answer that. It’s too late to change. Noon\nwaits for no one.”\nShe stopped at the door, though.\n“Some of you know already, but some of you are too young to know me.\nI don’t look forward to this. I’ve killed wights and men, and I don’t even\nlike killing wights. There is a time to agonize, and there is a time to act.\nToday we do what must be done, and we don’t shrink from the truth or from\nour duty. Trainer Samite, you remember Ithiel Greyling?”\n“Of course. Those Blue-Eyed Demon mercs put a dung-smeared arrow\nthrough his hand,” Samite said. “May Orholam send them to a lower hell.”\n“Ithiel knew those arrows. You try to treat them, and you get gangrene.\nYou die, always. The chirurgeon said he could just take the hand at the\nwrist, but you’d still risk death. If he’d done that, maybe Ithiel could have\nbeen a trainer, like you. But Ithiel had two boys. He didn’t want to give up\nfighting, didn’t want to give up the Blackguard he loved. His wife had\nalready done that in order to marry him. But he loved his family, too, and\nwanted to be there for them. So we took off his arm at the elbow. Instantly.”\n“Bravest thing I ever saw,” Samite said.\n“To realize in an instant that you aren’t going to have the life you’d\nhoped for, but not waste a moment complaining, instead acting instantly to\nsave what good you can? That’s more guts than I’d have had,” Karris said.\nOrholam have mercy, Karris hadn’t been thinking of Gavin until the very\nmoment she said the words. She pushed it away, tried to get back on track.\n“He lived until just a couple years ago, didn’t he?”\n“Indeed. And raised two damn fine sons,” said Watch Captain Tempus.\nNo one was looking at Gavin and Gill Greyling, but Teia saw tears\nstreaking down both their faces to see their father honored so."

It\nhad, over the years, worn a slight gutter in the blue luxin. He plugged that\ngutter with the two remaining fingers of his left hand, watched the water\nback up and spill out of the gutter and finally course around his fingers and\ninto oblivion.\nDeath always finds a way.\nStop what gaps you may;\nScream defiance that you live,\nLife leaks through the mortal sieve.\nWhen he’d constructed these cells, he’d thought that there were two\nmain problems with any prison: what comes in, and what goes out.

The problem with a prison isn’t what\ncomes and goes; it’s what stays.\nWhen he shat—rarely now, it had been so long since he’d eaten, but it\nhad been a problem from the beginning—he had to wipe with his left hand\nlike the barbarians of old in the Broken Lands. There was no way to wash\nhis hand adequately after.

What that\nprofound something was, he wasn’t sure, which definitely proved\nsomething about himself.\nAt the very least, the shit eating and his sick fear afterward had made the\nfasting more palatable.\nAfter the first days, the hunger had passed. He almost missed it, insane\nas that was, for it had been a constant distraction. A blessed distraction from\nwhat that demon in the glass, his own tormenting reflection, had said. ‘You,\nDazen, are the Black Prism.’\nHe had convinced himself, somehow, that he hated Sun Day. That he\nhated ritually murdering all those drafters. He’d convinced himself that he\nwas being noble when he hunted down wights personally. He was saving\npeople’s lives! He’d convinced himself that he had gone to the White Oak\nestate that fateful day for love.\nAs if a Guile knew anything of love.\nHe knew what love was, surely. He knew what it would look like, smell\nlike, act like. Though never wise, he was smart enough to know the real\nthing. He just could never feel it. He was Guile, and that meant corruption.\nOrholam forgive him. Every small thing he’d done right had been feeble\natonement for the murder of thousands. He could barely remember his knife\nstrokes on all those Sun Days now, the insincere words offered to comfort\nthose condemned to die. He’d corrupted the holiest day of the year into just\nanother long day of labor.\nI have to work so hard, he’d thought, as he slew the best and brightest\nand most dedicated men and women of the satrapies.\nAnd added to his power with every death.\nHe had convinced himself, recently, for a time, perhaps… that his\nbrother had been the villain after all. His brother must have been a\nmurderer, a cheat, a rapist, a monster. And his father! Worse, worse still.\nBut Gavin—nay, Dazen. Dazen False-Face. Dazen the Impostor—Dazen\nhimself was the monster here.\nHe himself had been the tyrant, the lone beast who would be a god. He\njust hadn’t been very successful. He had let his father remain in power. He\nhad let the White oppose him. He had been less competent than he could\nbelieve.\nAnd that stung worse than the idea that he was evil.\nHe was evil and he wasn’t even good at it.\nBut.\nBut. He survived. He was here. Maimed and bent. Eye burnt out. Fingers\ncut off. They’d broken everything but his will.\nAs long as he had that, he could overcome. And he would.\nHe was the bad guy? So be it.\nHe was a monster? He would be the best. He would emerge. He would\ncomfort Karris, and he would avenge himself on his enemies.\nShe would be better off without him. He saw that now. But she didn’t\nsee it.

He’d kept\nup a pretense of goodness for seventeen years. He could do five more for\nher sake.\nI will be sweetness and light to her eyes, and bitter gall and hellfire to\nmy enemies.\nGoddammit, father! Come down here already!\n“Want to talk?” the dead man asked.\nGavin said nothing. You don’t respond to a torturer who has only words\nas his rack.\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, his father came.\nGavin was awakened by the slight tremor that he knew signaled the\ncell’s being lifted. He’d thought when he built the cell that it would be\nimperceptible. After his time here, though, the small change felt like an\nearthquake. He woke instantly and sat over his hole, placid, meditative.\nWhen the slot in the wall opened from the apparently seamless blue, it\nwasn’t where Gavin had guessed it would be. Top-quality workmanship\nthere, hiding its location. His own workmanship.\nBut almost as soon as the slot opened, something slid into the gap. When\nDazen had come to visit the real Gavin down here, he’d left only open air\nbetween them. Andross Guile was not so confident, or so cocky, perhaps.\nAndross Guile set a window between them, sparkling, crystalline,\ntranslucent but not fully transparent—thus, likely blue luxin. He was\nilluminated with an icy light.\nGavin stood on wobbly legs and faced his father. The elder Guile was\nvisible only through Gavin’s own reflection. And Andross was a perverse\nmirror of him. He looked hale. He looked better than he had in twenty\nyears.\nIn contrast, Gavin himself looked like hell. It was as if his father had\nstolen away all his youth. His skin was bronzed where Gavin’s was pallid.\nThe fat of all his sedentary years had now melted into his sharp Guile jaw\nand broad Guile shoulders. Gloves gone, spectacles gone, he didn’t look\nanything like the invalid he had so recently been—or perhaps had merely\npretended to be.\nA dozen quiet expressions ran over Andross Guile’s face at the speed of\nhis thoughts. Finally, all he said was, “Son.”\nIt was a kidney punch.\nIt shouldn’t have done any such thing, but it sent Gavin spinning. For no\nreason at all, he thought of his own son. Though not by birth, by adoption\nKip was his, and Gavin loved him fiercely. He’d warmed to the boy only\nslowly, true. Only seen and loved the Guile in him by degrees. Gavin hadn’t\nbeen much of a father to him, but he’d done some things right. He’d gotten\nhim into the Blackguard. He’d given Kip time amid those good people to\nhelp him grow straight and tall rather than crooked, as the other nobles’\npampered sons and daughters would have turned him.\nAnd he’d saved Kip’s life, the once.\nIt wasn’t much, but it had been solely for Kip’s benefit, not his own.

Once.\nWhat had Andross Guile done for his sons, with all the time in the\nworld? With all the wealth he’d accrued, and all the power he’d\naccumulated, with all the leisure he could want and limitless years, when\nhad Andross Guile ever taken his eyes off himself and simply been a father?\n“When I was a boy, why did I never go to you when I needed a father so\ndesperately?” Gavin asked. “You were there. But where were you? What\nkind of man abandons his son to this? Never mind. Putting your kin in this\nhell is the least of your sins.” He waved at his father-reflection dismissively.\n“You call me son? No. This man-shaped grotesque is nothing to me. You\nare no father of mine.”\nGavin started crying, and he couldn’t help but shut his eyes. Tears\ngetting into his eye hurt so much it blinded him. He saw only a single\nexpression on his father’s face before he heard the scrape and snap of the\nslot’s slamming shut.\nHe staggered over to the wall, and leaned against it, whispering, “Damn\nyou. Damn you for all you were and all you could have been. Damn you for\nall you should have been and were born to be, but never were.” And\nbecause the wall was fully reflective now, he whispered to that blue mirror\nwhere his sire might not be, and where his own reflection was, “Damn you\nto the hell you’ve built for yourself, Guile.”\nChapter 23\n“Something ain’t right,” Big Leo said. “What is it that isn’t right about this?\nAnyone?”\n“No oars,” Cruxer said. “How the hell did all of us forget oars?”\nThe Blue Falcon II had no oars; it was almost dark, and this was a\nproblem for a luxin-propelled ship in a river with a current pulling them\ntoward what might be enemies.\nStanding at the prow of the skimmer, Big Leo said, “Not that this. That\nthis. That. Something ain’t right about that.” He pointed toward the\nstrangers waiting for them with his chin.\n“It’s my fault,” Ben-hadad said, still looking at the Blue Falcon. “My\ndesign. My work.” He brightened. “But… hey, I think I already know how\nto fix it. Orholam’s shining smile, boys, it’ll be beautiful.”\n“Can you fix it now?” Cruxer asked, looking nervously toward the\narmed men waiting for them on shore.\n“No, no, no, but on Blue Falcon III,” Ben-hadad said. “If we give the\noars a convex shape and modify the hull a bit, we can have them fold\nseamlessly and interlock into the gunwales here. See? They’ll nest into each\nother. And if we make them of brightwater, they’d double as armor!\nBreaker, you think you can do that much solid yellow?”\n“Ben,” Big Leo said, his voice rumbling deep in warning.\nBen-hadad clicked his lenses up. “Hmm?”"

Someone tell me what’s wrong with this. With them. My gut’s\ngoing crazy.”\n“Could be fear,” Ferkudi offered.\nBig Leo leveled a gaze on him like a hammer falling on an errant thumb.\n“Not fear,” Ferkudi amended. “Definitely not fear.”\nNo one else answered Big Leo. The skimmer drifted slowly downstream\nin the late-evening water. No sunlight meant no luxin, no luxin meant no\nmotion. No oars meant no options. So they stared at the figures on the\nriverbank, and the figures stared back at them.\nThey could crack their lux torches for a source, but those were precious\nand they had precious few of them. No one wanted to waste their lux\ntorches because they were scared of a few villagers.\n“The current is pushing us right to them,” Tisis said. “And the wind isn’t\nhelping.”\nAn improbably large bare-chested man and a child stood at the shore,\nbut another dozen men and women sat around a cheery fire higher up the\nbank, cooking dinner and talking quietly.\n“We’re too interesting for only two of them to be at the shore,” Kip said.\n“If you do say so yourself,” Winsen said.\nKip let it go, though he was this close to punching Winsen in the nose.\n“We’re too dangerous looking,” Kip said. “That’s what’s wrong, Leo.”\n“They’re trying not to spook us,” Tisis said, getting it.\n“Who tries not to scare six armed men in uniform?” Kip asked.\n“People who are scary themselves, that’s who,” Ferkudi said.\n“Quiet, all of you,” Cruxer said. He was holding the waxed leather bag\nthat carried the Mighty’s remaining mag torches. “Winsen, I count fourteen\non the beach. Are there any others in the trees?”\n“They’re Deep Foresters,” Tisis said. “If there’s more hiding in the trees,\nyou’ll never see them.”\n“None in the trees,” Winsen said, ignoring Tisis.\nCruxer handed out the precious mag torches. “No one crack one unless I\ngive the order. Or unless I die, I suppose. That is one big, hairy, freckly\nguy.”\nThere was something feral about the man standing at the water’s edge.\nHe wore a brown linen shirt, but it hung fully open, unlaced to show off a\npelt of red chest hair and muscles, the tails of the shirt tucked into his belt,\nsleeves rolled up short to show bands of polished copper around his\nenormous biceps. Everywhere he was covered with thick, curly red hair\nover freckles: chest and arms and stomach. A beard like a burning bush\nhung halfway down his chest, contrasting with the bald dome of his head.\nAnd though Big Leo had a full head’s height on him, this warrior was\nchiseled from stone.

And scars, as if from wild animals?\nTisis gasped, and at first Kip was needled that she was appreciating the\nincredible virility of that wild man, but when he turned to her, she said,\n“Look at her!”\nThe child wasn’t a child, but a pygmy.\nHer appearance rattled something loose. A memory or—\nI’m lying facedown, motionless, in the jungle underbrush in the lee of a\ndowned tree. Loathsome things move under my belly and scuttle over my\nbare hands. Most of them harmless, I hope. A bird spider perches on a\nbough within arm’s reach above. Spiders terrify me beyond all measure, but\nI don’t move. Don’t dare to. Rustling through the underbrush and trees not\ntwenty paces away is the war party.\nThe war-blue pygmies carry lances and flails, but the greater danger is\nthe great tygre wolves they ride. Standing tall enough that they look eye to\neye with a tall man, they’re almost too big for the pygmies to ride. They\nhave long jaws more akin to an alligator’s than a dog’s, and their riders\ndon’t control them so much as direct their viciousness. Tygre wolves aren’t\ntrained mounts like a horse, they’re more like an arrowhead you strap into.\nBarely controlled, and that only by will magic; if a rider falls off, he can\nexpect to be eaten first. Sight hunters, so their sense of smell isn’t as acute\nas a dog’s, but it is far better than a man’s.\nThe chi I drafted should have killed the scent of my body—give it that,\nthe vile stuff—but there’s nothing to do about my breath. I don’t have it in\nme to draft chi again, not now. I can practically feel the tumors growing\nevery time I do.\nOne of the tygre wolves comes toward me now, big wide paws silent on\nthe greenery beneath. It growls.\nMy bowels turn to water, and I couldn’t move if I wanted to. The tygre\nwolf lunges—and snaps its fangs shut on the huge bird spider above me,\ndrool from its slavering jaws splattering across my forehead.\nIts rider curses and pulls at one of its ears, and it obeys her, chomping\nhappily. Before they turn, I see the rider well, her gaze keen, teeth bared.\nShe is—\nNot the same woman. Very alike. Maybe an ancestor. But that woman was\nnot this one. Or perhaps Kip’s very unfamiliarity with the pygmies made\nthem all look alike to him: sharp elfin features, imperial-purple hair, and the\npermanently upturned mouth and cheek depressions like smiles and dimples\nthat had so often confounded men, who repeatedly mistook their\nexpressions and motives, coming to call them smiling devils.\nFor a moment, Kip was suspended between the card’s knowledge and\nhis own.\nAnd then, in the blinking of an eye, he was out of that time-that-is-not-\ntime.\nAnd then the skimmer skritched onto the pebbles of the riverbank.\n“Greetings,” Kip said. “We’ve come to fight.”\nThat came out wrong."

You\nwouldn’t happen to be fighting for the White King, are you? That would be\nawkward.”\n“Good old Kip Silvertongue,” Winsen whispered.\n“We know why you’ve come,” the pygmy woman said, her voice high\npitched. “We’ve been sent to welcome you. Kip Guile? And you, Tisis\nGuile, born Malargos? And the Mighty, we presume?”\n“That’s… right,” Kip said. She knew about Tisis and his marriage? How\ncould she know that?\n“I am Sibéal Siofra. This is Conn Ruadhán Arthur. We are of Shady\nGrove.”\n“Shady Grove?” Tisis said. “You are far from home indeed.”\nA cloud passed over Sibéal’s face. “There is no home now. Not for us.\nThe White King has driven out everyone before him. First we in Shady\nGrove welcomed refugees, then to our shame and against our traditions we\nturned aside refugees, then we became refugees in turn. We have lost homes\nand tribe and spouses and children and land and faith. We have only a thirst\nfor vengeance. Lead us, Luíseach, and we will go anywhere, so long as you\nlead us against that abomination.”\n“Lee shock?” Kip asked, butchering the accent, though terminology\nprobably shouldn’t have been foremost on his mind.\n“Bringer of Light,” Tisis said.\n“Oh, great. That again.” He turned to Sibéal and Conn Arthur. “Gather\nyour people.”\n“They’re not ours to command,” Conn Arthur said. “We here are all\nclanless, masterless, free.”\nKip had never heard anyone say ‘free’ with such a mix of loathing and\ndespair. Though he’d already had long talks with Tisis about the Foresters,\napparently he was going to need to have more of them.\nHe waved to people at their fires, almost all of them now looking\ncuriously toward him and the Mighty. “I have things to say. If you want to\nhear me out, come here,” Kip shouted.\nMore than the twelve people at the fire came. The woods emptied, and\nover a hundred men and women and teens came from the trees.\nTisis raised an eyebrow at Winsen. “No people in the woods, huh?”\nHe cursed under his breath.\nAnd as they gathered around Kip, these people, shoeless, hopeless,\nbereft, eyes glazed with shock and loss, jaws set with pitiless rage, Kip\nrealized he was slipping into the Guile role: he would use his words to sway\nthe wills of men. It was the Guile talent more powerful than their magic.\nMagic requires will, but words shape will, turn it, direct it, reflect it from\none target to another.\nHe’d seen it done. He’d marveled at it. Envied it. Been in awe of his\nfather’s profound, bedrock conviction that people would do what he wanted\nthem to do."

He was nothing\nto these people, a stranger, an interloper.\nHow dare he come to them with promises? Much less promises he could\nnever keep.\nWhen they were gathered, he said, “I am Kip Guile. If you’ve heard of\nmy family, perhaps you know it is their way to sway others to their will.\nSometimes for good. Sometimes not.” He shook his head. “I’m not here to\nbe your lord. I’m not here to turn you to my will, to manipulate you or\nmake you my vassals or anyone else’s. I’m here to fight. I’m a full-spectrum\npolychrome, and I’ve been taught to fight by the best in the world. With\nothers—not alone—I killed King Rask Garadul of Tyrea, and with the\nBlackguards and Gavin and Karris Guile, I killed Atirat at the Battle of Ru\njust as he was attempting to assume godhood. I know how to fight, and the\nMighty with me are better than I am. But we don’t know this country the\nway you do.\n“I’m going to hit the Color Prince, this pretender White King. I’m going\nto hit him hard, and where he doesn’t expect it. I’m going to keep hitting\nhim until one or the other of us dies. I can do a lot of damage with the\nMighty alone. But alone, I don’t think we can stop him. We can do more\nand better and live longer if you join us, if we teach each other. If you come\nwith me, we’re going to move fast and work hard for long hours and sleep\nlittle. We’re going to fight and kill and die. That’s it. That’s all we offer. My\ngoal is to expel the White King from Blood Forest altogether. If we can kill\nevery last damned wight while we do it, so much the better. I don’t\nguarantee victory, but I do think victory’s possible if we fight together. So\nno big speech. Join us or don’t. Let me know what you’ve decided in the\nmorning.”\nThey looked at him as if they couldn’t quite believe that was all he was\ngoing to say, but as he got to work setting up tents with the Mighty, the\ncrowd slowly dispersed.\n“Well, that went…,” Winsen said. “But I guess they aren’t trying to kill\nus, so that’s something.”\n“Shut up, Winsen,” Tisis said. “Kip, that was perfect.”\n“I wasn’t trying to be perfect. I was trying to be honest.”\n“That’s exactly what they need.”\n“You said you were sent?” Cruxer asked Sibéal and Conn Arthur, who\nhad remained with them. “By whom?”\nSibéal smiled, and Kip was certain it was a smile. “By a prophet you\nknow as the Third Eye, and her husband, Corvan Danavis. Allies.”\n“Damn,” Big Leo said behind Kip. “You telling me we got a Seer on our\nside? We might have a chance in this war after all.”"

He measured three\nhands over and two hands up. He licked his finger and marked a spot.\nIt had all been for this: the days of misery and starvation, the carefully\ncalibrated fight with his father.\nThis was where the luxin was sealed. He’d needed the open slot in order\nto locate the seal. And he’d needed to make his father angry enough that he\nwouldn’t soon return; otherwise Gavin might start his attempt and have his\nfather interrupt it before he could bring it to fruition.\nBut now came another bad part. He ate as much bread as still remained\nin the cell. Eating would be misery for a while after this.\nFacing his father had been the worst, but Dazen had made this prison\nwell, and blue luxin is harder than fingernail. Harder than a fist.\n“What are you doing?” the dead man asked. He hadn’t spoken in some\ntime.\nGavin said nothing, taking deep breaths, bracing himself. He measured\ncarefully. With a pinky, he stretched his lip back, and before he could think\nmore, he slammed his face against the wall.\nHe shook his head. His lip was bloody and swollen.\nThe dead man was baffled. “I told you if you want to kill yourself…”\nGavin slammed his face against the wall again.\nIt took five more attempts to loosen his dogtooth. He wobbled it back\nand forth, back and forth, his eyes streaming tears, and finally ripped it out\nwith a cry.\nIt slipped from spit-and-blood-slick fingers. It bounced on the blue\nluxin, and with his depth perception ruined by having only a single eye,\nGavin swiped frantically—\nAnd caught it from the air before it could plunge down the waste hole.\nHe stood strong, bloodied, body broken, but determined, defiant.\nBlue luxin is stronger than fingernails or fists, but enamel is stronger\nstill, and spirit supreme. Gavin took the dogtooth between bloody fingers,\nand, like the lone, mad beast he was, he started chewing at the wall.\nChapter 25\nKip and Tisis were given their own tent. The idea of having some real\nprivacy was exciting right until Cruxer said, “I’ll be right outside, taking\nfirst watch.”\nHe met Kip’s exasperated gaze with one of his own. “I’m like the\ncommander, you’re like the Prism, right?” Cruxer asked.\n“But it’s a tent,” Kip said.\n“Thus, not even as safe as a ship’s cabin,” Cruxer said.\n“But it’s a… tent,” Kip said.\n“We know what you’ll be doing in there.

I’m sorry.”\nHe slipped into the tent. It was small, barely big enough for them to sit\nup; they did plan to carry everything on their backs, after all.\nTisis already had the fresh-scrubbed look of a person who’d just bathed.\nShe passed him a clean cloth and pointed to the small tub of water. “Sleep\nclean, and we won’t have to launder our blankets as often,” she said.\n“If only we’d brought a slave along to worry about such things for us,”\nKip grumbled.\nShe grinned. “I don’t hold it against you, Kip.”\n“I do.”\n“You’re funny,” she said. “You do the right thing, often the brilliant\nthing, and then you pretend you didn’t want to do it. What is that?”\n“I dunno. I’ve got a whole lotta stupid inside, fighting to get out. And,\nuh, thanks.”\n“For what?”\n“For the ‘brilliant’ thing.”\n“For calling you brilliant? It’s not a compliment. It’s just the truth. I\ndon’t think you got that armpit well enough.”\nHe scowled. Trying to sponge bathe yourself while sitting and not slop\nsoap water on your stuff was a pain.\n“Hey, I have to sleep with you!” she said. She was teasing, but some part\nof it pierced Kip.\nHe looked away and put the cloth in the soapy water again, tried to lose\nhimself in the mechanics of bathing.\n“Wait, wait, wait. What was that?” she asked. “Ah hells, Kip, what did I\nsay?”\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know you didn’t ask for any of this.”\n“Stop that! Stop that.

I mean, I’m sorry. Really sorry.”\n“Good night, Kip.”\n“Some people like angry sex.”\n“Not me. Good. Night.”\nDamn.\nKip thought of lying down, but he wasn’t tired. He’d just fret. He\nthought about how he’d viewed that card briefly and unintentionally this\nafternoon. He had another deck of Janus Borig original cards in his pack,\nuntouched since he’d put them there.\nThere had been two decks—one Andross had owned that Gavin had\nstolen from him at some point, and then the ones Kip had saved from the\nfire at Janus Borig’s when she’d been murdered. That had been the deck\nresponsible for this afternoon’s vision. It had been the deck that had nearly\nkilled him.\nHe really hadn’t wanted to touch any cards ever again after that. But the\nvision changed things. He was here, totally out of his depth among a new\npeople. He should at least look at the cards to see if there were any that\nmight help him. He didn’t need to view any of them, but he’d be a fool if he\ndidn’t use such a potent tool.\nScrounging in his pack, he found the deck box readily. Pulled out the\ncards.\nThey weren’t the same cards. Disbelieving, he fanned the deck on the\nblankets on his lap. It was a standard deck, no unusual cards, certainly no\noriginals. As if someone had swapped it so the deck box would have the\ncorrect weight. Verity?\nBut there was a slip of paper among the cards.\n“Please let me know how long it took you to discover the swap. I\nthought within the first three days. Grinwoody bet me five danars it would\nbe closer to two weeks.” There was no doubt whom it was from, and it\nwasn’t Verity.\nAndross had known Kip was leaving with Tisis.\nAndross had known which boat Tisis was taking.\nAndross had put a man on the boat.\nIt had taken Kip more than two weeks.\nTotally defeated by this dung-smear of a day, Kip flopped back onto his\nblankets, defeated. He landed across Tisis’s long hair, tugging it painfully.\n“Ow!” she said. “What’d you do that for?”\nThere wasn’t a big enough sigh in the world.\nChapter 26\n~Gunner~\n“It’s not for sale,” I says.\n“Who said anything about a sale?” the wrapped man asks.\n“It’s a holly trust.”\nThat one was apurpose, and he don’t correct me, so he knows about\nCap’n Gunner.

He’s all swattled like a babe, like\nhe’s got the skin-sloughing disease maybe, but I think he’s well after all.\nHe’s accosted me here, outside Lee Lee’s watering hole, my favorite tavern\non the swollen teat that is Big Jasper. He was waiting for me, and I’m\nfeeling a bit too boozy for this.\n“I don’t believe in holy or unholy,” says he. “I believe in having the\nbest.”\n“What’s that to me?” I asks.\n“I want to show you a ship. Best girl on the Cerulean Sea or any other.”\n“Every captain or owner selling a ship says the same,” I says.\n“Everyone says it. Some of them believe it. But one of them’s right.”\n“The odds that one is you are blinky indeed,” I say, but I can’t help\nbeing intrigued.\n“Take a look for yourself,” he says. “I’ll let you come aboard armed as\nyou will, and you can examine it as you will.”\n“What’s the hook?” I asks.\n“No hook. A game. I’ll tell you more after you decide if she’s worth\nyour time. Though there’s not been a sailor worth his salt yet who’s scorned\nthe Golden Mean.”\nThere’s his bait. I’ve heard of this boat. The breathless wonder and\nslobbering are enough to turn a man’s stomach. And his eyes.\n“I’ll take a looksie.” I wouldn’t mind being the man to disprove the\nsilliness and lies about what a wonder she is.\nIt’s not long to her place at the dock. She’s a new Ilytian galleass, but I\nsee the stories were true. She’s bone white, but with a golden sheen to her\nskin, like a pale Blood Forester lady riding your hips sweaty at sunset.\n“Abornean teak?” I ask.\n“Lightweight and stronger than any other wood known to man.”\n“Too porous for decking. Your ship is shite. She’ll warp and sink ’fore\nLong Night.”\nBut I don’t leave, and he don’t defend her.\n“She’s really imbibed with brightwater?” I asks.\n“Just enough to fill the pores in the wood, and just on the hull. No need\nto add weight where it’s unnecessary. The yellow luxin imbuing the wood is\nsegmented, though, so the wood can still flex. I’ll warn you, it does mean\nyou have to hire a brightwater drafter every ten years. A good one. They\ntold me twenty years, but shipwrights…”\n“Would swear their own mother was a virgin, before selling her to be a\npoxy cap’n’s buttboy,” I agree.\nHe says, “I’m untrusting myself, so I hired my own yellow drafter to\nlook her over. She estimated ten years. Bonus is that with the yellow luxin\ncoating, barnacles won’t grow on the hull, which makes it faster still.”\n“Eh. Means you can’t keelhaul a man.” Of course, you still could, but\nwith no barnacles, he might actually live through it. Which has its own\nadvantages.\nHe says nothing again."

I can see he’s almost\nas night-skinned as me. Older man, though, from how he moves at times.\nSkinny. “You’re familiar with the work of Phineas Vecchini?”\nHere’s where his lies are gonna get his lines wrapped round his legs. I\nknow Phin well. “Some,” I says. “This from his workshop, or stamped by\nhis hand?”\n“Master Vecchini has quit working,” the man says. “He let his daughters\ntake over his shop.”\nEveryone knows that. Guess that’s not the lie to trip him, then. “They’re\ngood, but others are their equals,” I grumble. “Maybe one day the youngest\nwill be her father’s rival. Maybe. Guns from his daughters ain’t quite the\nbraggery you’d like to claim, though.”\nHe adjusts his wrappings patiently. “I’m not bragging of guns from his\ndaughters. I convinced Phin to go back to work, one last time. The girls\ndidn’t want him to, said he’d ruin his health, and he may well have done so.\nHe spent a year on this.”\n“Pah. How’d you do that? I heard he swore to that harpy he wedded he’d\nnever—”\n“His wife passed on two years back. His daughters were as adamant he\nnot take the work, but then I offered him something he couldn’t resist.”\n“And what’s that?” I ask. “That old goat rogerer weren’t swayed by\nneither women, wealth, nor wine. What could you offer him?”\nLike the insidious stench of wine shits after shore leave, a smug aura\nsurrounds the bandaged man. “I told him the cannons were for you.”\nPhin had spent a year, with all his forgers and smiths and cast-iron men\nand engravers and potboys and apprentices, his workshop belching smoke\nday and night? For me?\nIt knocks my knees a bit weak, to be forthright.\nIt’s one thing to shout at the world that you’re the best. I been doin’ that\nsince it warn’t true. It’s a whole ’nother fish for the best in the world to\nacknowledge you as the best, too.\nIt’s like finding another barrel a’ brandy in the hold two days after you\nrun dry and got the shakes.\n“How many?”\n“Forty guns. Various sizes. Some with parts my cannon caster and\ngunner together couldn’t even make sense of. Phin laughed and said you’d\nknow what they were for, or figure it out, or—if, after all I’d promised, if\nthe guns weren’t actually for you, that we could go… sodomize ourselves.”\nI’m not sure what that means, but he’s a shipowner.

I was given to understand that\nsmugglers and pirates like to hire their own crews. And given that I may be\nhanding this ship over to you, I wasn’t planning on paying for a crew in the\nmeantime.”\nHanding it over? So he doesn’t mean to pay me to captain her on some\nerrand. “I told you before, it ain’t for sale. Nor trade neither. Cap’n Gunner\nis intergated. Integrated? Has integrated? That ain’t right.” Damns, though.\nA sword for a boat? I got little use for one, and many for the other, no\nmatter what that nattering Orholam said.\n“Has integrity. Yes, you’re known for that.”\nThere’s a twinkle in his eye that I don’t like. Like I amuse him, poncy\nlittle buttboy. I oughta jam my thumbs through them eyes. “The answer’s\nno, then, and you know it, and I know it…” But I don’t move.\nHe doesn’t, either.\n“A look isn’t going to harm anything. At least would let you know if I\nwas telling you the truth about those cannons.”\nA long moment, then I say, “I owe it to that old goat, I s’pose. Just a\nlooksie.”\n“Of course.”\nCaptain Gunner is renowned for his shooting, of course, but he ain’t no\nfool about a ship, neither. This ship is all first-rate. The last crew got a bit\nsloppy about some things if you look in the corners for grime, and Gunner’s\nnever allowed that hard crease to be folded on the edge of the furled sail:\nlooks nice ashore, but gives the cloth a weak place that will eventually rip.\nMost of her, though, is simply astonishing. Master Creepy gives me a\nlantern and stays topside. No interest in seeing it again, he says, and he\ndon’t want me nervous with him behind me.\nGunner inspects her for half an hour. She’s a dream.\nAnd then Gunner goes to the gun deck. The cannons are inmistakably\nPhin’s work. But instead of on wheels, these cannons are on tracks. There\nare knobs and dials and articulated sights.\nI intuitively understand some of it. It’s made so one gunner—the best\nGunner—can walk up and down a full row for a broadside, and make sure\nthat every cannon is aimed exactly as he wishes, and fire each exactly when\nhe wishes, separately or all at wunst.\nIn the old days, I could train my crew for it, but I could only aim one\ncannon perfectly myself.

But…” I can see the man’s mask tug at the corners of his face as he\ngrins beneath it. “Even God plays dice.”\nChapter 27\nBefore dawn, Kip woke to an empty tent and the fear that when he emerged,\nhe would find no one there. They’d finally wised up. He’d tried to be bold.\nHe’d tried to take the lead, but he hadn’t done it the way his father would\nhave. And then he’d also infuriated his wife. Good old Kip Leaden Tongue.\nChest tight, he pulled on his clothes. Took a few deep breaths. It was\nquiet out there. None of the usual sounds of people moving about camp.\nNot even the early-morning sounds of someone going to relieve themselves.\nHe tried to pat and finger comb his hair into some sort of relative order, and\nthen went to face reality.\nThere were a lot of people standing there. Silent. Armed. Not just a lot\nof people. More than a hundred.\nEveryone.\nAnd the Mighty were, most unhelpfully, standing way back.\nEveryone was staring at him.\n“So what’s it going to be?” Kip asked. When you’ve put all your coin on\nthe table, you can’t blink. “This mean you’re coming with me, or do I need\nto prove myself to you? You want me to wrestle a bear or something?”\nOh hells. Kip didn’t know why he’d picked a bear. It must have been\nrattling around in his head because Tisis had told him last night that in their\nold tongue, Arthur meant ‘bear.’ Ruadhán meant ‘little red.’ Ergo, the giant\nchieftain was Little Red Bear."

I am\ndumber than words.\nConn Arthur looked troubled, as if he wasn’t sure if Kip was challenging\nhim. Oh, please, no. But the man looked toward Sibéal Siofra, who shook\nher head slightly.\nMercifully, the conn said nothing.\nThe pygmy woman stepped forward. “The Third Eye told us impossible\nthings, but she never told us as much as we would like.”\n“Prophets,” Kip said. “They’re like that.”\n“She told us to come this far to meet you, but that if we wanted any hope\nof defeating the White King, we would have to do battle with one of his\ncaptains at Deora Neamh… in two days.”\n“And…,” Kip said.\n“It’s a waterfall,” Tisis said, coming out of nowhere. “It’s a hundred\nleagues from here.”\n“Ah,” Kip said. Given a marching speed through the forest of maybe ten\nleagues a day, or poling or rowing upriver at maybe fifteen leagues a day,\nthat would seem impossible indeed. “How many drafters do you have?”\nConn Ruadhán Arthur cocked his head to the side, puzzled.\n“Your pardon, Lord Guile,” Sibéal Siofra said. “We thought you knew.\nWe’re all drafters.”\nKip looked around. Without exception, these people were pale skinned.\nOnly a few had any luxin staining visible on their arms at all, even the older\nones. That was odd. A few were so freckled it might cover up orange or red\nstaining, but most were not.\nThere were many blue-eyed people among them and a number of\npygmies, and the light eyes should have made drafters doubly obvious. But\nhe’d not noticed iris shading in any of them.\n“Oooh,” Tisis said as if something was dawning on her. She looked\ntoward Kip as if she wanted to say more, but instead she said, “You’re not\njust from the town of Shady Grove.”\n“No,” Conn Arthur said. “We’re Ghosts. Look on us and tremble,” he\nsaid sarcastically. “Is that going to be a problem?”\n“Can many of you draft solid luxins?” Tisis asked.\n“Yes,” Sibéal said, seeming relieved. “We just… don’t get much\npractice.”\nDrafters who intentionally didn’t draft? What was the point? “One\nmoment,” Kip said, and he pulled Tisis aside. Quietly he asked, “Ghosts?”\n“It’s a school for drafters that’s not under the authority of the Chromeria.\nA long time ago, when the Chromeria was consolidating control of all\ndrafters, they declared everyone at such schools to be heretics. Those who\nstayed were often declared dead by their families, either to disown them or\nto escape Chromeria punishment for that family member’s apostasy. Thus,\nShady Grove–trained drafters became referred to as Shades, or Ghosts."

Thus,\nShady Grove–trained drafters became referred to as Shades, or Ghosts.\nSince they also tend to keep a low profile lest the Chromeria renew its hunt\nfor them, the name stuck.”\n“The Chromeria hunted them?” Kip asked.\n“The Magisterium, actually. Luxors.”\nKip turned back to Sibéal and Conn Arthur. “You like blunt speaking,\nright?”\n“It’s usually faster,” Conn Arthur said. “Isn’t it?”\nAll right, Kip Blunderbuss. Come out and play. “They branded you\nheretics. Are you?”\nThe conn took a displeased moment to digest that, but then said, “We\nlove Orholam and follow him.”\n“Not to elide a painful history and many hard feelings,” Sibéal Siofra\ninterjected. “We do have some doctrinal differences, and don’t submit to the\nMagisterial assertion of primacy.”\nOrholam’s crooked little toe, that permanent smile of hers was hard to\nget past. Kip thought her true expression was an uncertain, placating smile.\nHe sighed.\n“Good old Chromeria. Never failing to make its friends fearful and its\nenemies bold,” Kip said. “Well, then. This is war, not an admissions test on\ndoctrine for the Magisterium. Let’s get to work.”\nHe broke them up into teams to start building skimmers for everyone.\nHe organized the correct numbers of drafters of each color needed and put\nBen-hadad in charge of overseeing the creation of the skimmers themselves,\nletting the young genius figure out the most efficient number and\ncomposition of skimmers given the number of people they had to move and\nthe skill or lack thereof of the drafters available.\nKip went to work learning the disposition of his new forces. Most of the\nGhosts here were those who had no homes anymore. Either they’d made\nShady Grove their home, or their families’ homes were in areas that the\nWhite King had already captured.\nWith Cruxer and Conn Arthur, Kip went over a map that Tisis was able\nto draw of Deora Neamh and its environs. She’d never visited, but she’d\nstudied Blood Forest geography extensively, and she could draw. They\nshowed the map to all the Ghosts who’d ever visited the town, and amended\nit as necessary.\nKip stared at the map. The problem with it was that the land was hilly—\nit was home to a tall waterfall—but the map itself did a poor job of showing\nthe elevation changes. “What do they want from this town?” Kip asked.\n“Slaves. Loot. The regular, I suppose,” Conn Arthur said.\n“No,” Cruxer said. “There’s a water mill here, below the base of the\nfalls. Where do farmers keep their grain before and after it’s been milled?”\nThey found someone who’d visited the town. He sketched a warehouse\na ways down the rocky river, at the first place where the river was navigable\nfor larger boats and barges. There was a good road between the mill and the\ndocks. He hadn’t even thought to add it in when shown the map before,\nbecause it was outside the scope of the paper.\nKip didn’t know how long he stared at the map. They had no idea how"

If it really was a foraging\nparty, it would contain a small force of fighters meant to cow the populace,\nbut be made up mainly of laborers and camp followers pressed into service\nto haul the grain back to the main camp.\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said. It was almost noon, and Kip was still turning\nthings over in his mind, visualizing the terrain. “Ben-hadad says they’re\nfinished. He’s launching the skimmers now.”\nKip didn’t move. “The thing about prototypes?”\n“Milord?”\n“They fail.”\n“Well, these aren’t the first skimmers that Ben’s built.”\n“They’re the first ones he’s watched inept drafters build for him, with so\nmany going at once that he can’t watch every step.”\nJust then a spate of curses rang out from the water’s edge. They turned\nand saw an entire section of hull had disintegrated and a skimmer was\nsinking rapidly.\nKip grinned at Cruxer.\n“Well, you don’t have to be smug about it,” he said. “If we don’t get\nthere in time, we might lose our new allies, you know.”\n“Eh, the prophecy says we can get there on time; therefore we will,\nright?”\nCruxer grimaced. “I don’t think it works like that. And maybe the Third\nEye was lying to us just to get us to try. She could even be working for the\nColor Prince for all we know, and we’re going to our destruction.”\n“Corvan Danavis wouldn’t let that happen,” Kip said.\n“Well, maybe these Ghosts are lying about what Corvan and the Seer\nsaid.”\n“How would they know such a lie would work on us?” Kip asked.\nCruxer just frowned.\n“Why so dour, Crux? It’s not like you.”\nThe young commander rubbed his face. “Didn’t sleep well last night.”\nWell, Tisis and I didn’t do anything to keep you awake, that’s for sure.\n“That’s not so rare. Doesn’t usually leave you grumpy.”\nCruxer pursed his lips. But then he spoke. “I had this terrible nightmare\nabout Commander Ironfist. It felt like a premonition. We were both\nwounded from fighting wights or something. But then we turned on each\nother. We killed each other, Breaker.” He shook his head. “It felt so real.”\n“If it’s any consolation,” Kip said, “I don’t believe you could kill\nIronfist.”\n“I know, I can’t imagine anything that would turn us against each other.”\n“No, I mean the man could kick your ass while sipping kopi and reading\nthe day’s briefings and never spill a drop.”\nAn unwilling grin broke over Cruxer’s face. “You’re a real flesh\nprotuberance, you know that, right?”\n“I got your back,” Kip said, patting his friend’s shoulder. “But if you\nfight Ironfist, I’ll have it from way, way back.”"

I\nwish he were leading us, not me. I mean, no offense to you, Breaker. But\nyou know what I mean, right? I’m not making sense, I’m too tired. Sorry.”\n“I know what you mean.

In a few minutes he had a pretty good luxin model of the map\nthey’d created.\nCruxer had immediately summoned the people who’d helped with the\nmap earlier, and Kip held the luxin open so they could make the model\naccurate together.\nThe leadership had gathered by the time Kip expanded the model to\ninclude the surrounding countryside for several leagues.\n“Avoid battle, seek victory,” Kip said. He remembered that from one of\nMaster Danavis’s books. “They’re here for grain. Conn Arthur, you mount\nan attack on the warehouse. You come straight from the forest here.”\n“I can do it, but why do we want to go after grain? You plan to keep it?\nIf we undermine support from the people…”\n“To win, the Blood Robes need that grain, so if we threaten it, they have\nto defend it. Try not to actually set the warehouses on fire, though. You\ndecide how many people you need to make the attack credible, but it must\nfail. Fall back and regroup—probably here—within sight of them, giving\nthem time to call for reinforcements.”\n“And… what?” Conn Arthur said. “There’s no way to get around them\nin this valley without being seen.”\n“We don’t attack them at all. This isn’t a battle; it’s an attack.”\n“I don’t…” Cruxer said.\nKip asked, “What’s the trouble with moving huge amounts of grain?”\n“It’s heavy, bulky,” Cruxer said.\n“Right. Their goal is to transport the grain, so they may hope to take the\nvillage’s barges to send the grain down the river and then back up the river\nto their own tributary. But I can’t imagine that the villagers would be that\ndumb—if you’re sitting on a fortune in grain, the last thing you do when\nyou see an army coming is to leave your barges in places to make your stuff\neasier to steal. Naturally, if you do see barges, sink them. Thus…”\nKip looked around. Everyone was giving him their total attention, not\neven trying to interject. Even Cruxer looked impressed. As Tisis had said,\nthey were turning to him. He was becoming a leader in their eyes, if not his\nown. What did that say?\nHe went on. “Thus, the Blood Robes either have their own wagons up\nhere above the falls, or they have more barges even farther back.

With the\nskimmers, the Mighty can get in place without being noticed.”\nConn Arthur said, “Why are we looking at the same thing and I see a\nproblem, but you don’t? Like you said, their barges or wagons are up a\ncompletely different tributary above the falls. If we split our forces to attack\nin two places at once, how do we possibly coordinate an attack? We don’t\nhave any idea how many soldiers, drafters, and wights they might have. We\ncould get massacred.”\n“The tributaries end up pinching close at Deora Neamh. When the battle\nstarts at the warehouse, we’ll be able to hear the musket fire.”\n“Over the noise of the waterfall?” Cruxer asked.\n“Good thought,” Kip said.\n“It’s not that big,” someone who’d visited the town said. “You’d hear a\nmusket over it.” Others agreed.\n“What if something goes wrong?” Conn Arthur asked.\n“Oh, something will go wrong,” Kip said. “Even if it doesn’t, we use\nluxin flares to communicate.”\n“That gives away our position if we use them,” Cruxer said. “And if\nthese, uh, Ghosts use them, the enemy will see that they’re using flares and\nsuspect a trap.”\n“No. They won’t see them at all, because we’ll use superviolet flares,”\nKip said. “Conn Arthur, tell me you’ve got at least one superviolet drafter.”\n“Three or four.”\nKip went on. “And before you point out that this means we have to have\ntwo people watching the sky constantly in the superviolet spectrum, we\nspecify times instead. We each get a sand clock or a water clock—whatever\nBen-hadad can make—and we check the sky at set times. Even if this\ncaptain has superviolet drafters, they won’t know to be looking at all or\nwhen to look if they do, so they’ll miss whatever we signal. Remember,\nvictory for us isn’t wiping them out. It isn’t even fighting them at all. It’s\nstopping them from getting food. Saving the village, saving the grain, and\nkilling lots of Blood Robes—all nice, but very much secondary. If we sink\nthe barges or burn the wagons and scatter their horses and they still get the\ngrain and decide to carry it back to the main army, we’ll have plenty more\nchances to wipe them out in the forest.”\nThey all thought about it for a moment. It was the best Kip could do\nwithout scouts or any real idea of the enemy forces.\n“Well, it sounds great,” Conn Arthur said. “Of course, plans usually do.”\nChapter 28\n“How did the High Luxiats take it?” Andross asked, pitching his voice low\nand quiet. Teia was walking beside Karris White as they crossed the delicate\ngreen bridge between Little Jasper and Big Jasper toward the execution\nplatform, so she couldn’t help but overhear.\n“As well as we expected they would,” the White said.\n“But they’ll not rebel?” he insisted.\n“We’ll find out presently, won’t we?” Karris said.\nTeia was glad she’d already applied the dark eye caps. Karris was\nworking with Andross Guile?"

Karris was\nworking with Andross Guile?\nOf course she has to work with him, T. She’s the White, and he’s the\npromachos. But this sounded like more, like they were on the same side.\nAndross Guile was an open sewer. He was the human embodiment of evil.\nTeia didn’t want Karris any closer to him than was absolutely necessary.\nBut the promachos was already taking his leave. “I despise not knowing\nbeforehand exactly how others are going to react.”\n“And imagine,” Karris said drily, “some of us always live that way.”\n“The horror,” Andross said, but Teia thought he seemed secretly pleased\nthat his daughter-in-law was making fun of him.\nUgh. Teia didn’t like it when the old man acted human.\nAs the Blackguards emerged from the tunnel that was the Lily’s Stem,\nTeia saw the crowd for the first time. The muffled roar of their murmuring\nwashed over her as if she had suddenly slipped into a full bathtub of their\nspeculation. Though she was second in the line of Blackguards, it felt as if\nevery eye were upon her.\nThe entire Embassies District was packed from building to building with\nbodies. The large execution platform had been built against the wall,\nbeneath the great mirrors that were known as Orholam’s Glare. Nearest to\nthe platform in the plaza were Chromeria officials, nobles, soldiers,\nLightguards, and Blackguards, but as Teia mounted the steps, she saw an\nocean of humanity.\nTeia had thought that there would be a big crowd. She hadn’t guessed\nthe half of it. Nearly every man, woman, and child living on Big Jasper had\nturned out for this event. Slave, free, Parian, or Tyrean, it didn’t matter. A\nbobbing mass of humanity filled the plaza and the great avenue and every\nstreet that converged here throughout the Embassies District. Balconies of\nmansions and embassies and roofs of shops were filled to bursting with\nonlookers.\nEveryone wanted to see what would happen. Everyone wanted to hear\nwhat the Chromeria had to say. With the death of the old White, the\nascension and near murder of the new White, the unveiling of the secret\nescape lines from the Chromeria, and the explosion of the cannon tower, it\nseemed the Big and Little Jasper Islanders’ veil of safety had been torn\naway. Everyone had heard the reading of the lists of the dead. They’d heard\nabout the battles. But all this, plus the arrest of traitors, here?\nSuddenly the reality of war had come home.\nThe Chromeria hadn’t played off the explosion of the cannon tower as a\nmistake. It hadn’t lied, exactly. It had merely said, ‘It wasn’t an accident.’\nEveryone assumed that the Color Prince had attacked.\nBelieving themselves to have been attacked, the people wanted\nassurances. Many wanted blood. That the people to be executed today had\nnothing to do with the attack seemed not to matter. This was the people’s\nchance to hear the new White and judge her, to be soothed or to be inflamed\n—or to be disheartened."

This was the people’s\nchance to hear the new White and judge her, to be soothed or to be inflamed\n—or to be disheartened.\nNo wonder Karris was nervous.\nThe Blackguards spread out across the platform. Teia and Stump, being\nthe shortest, would flank Karris so as not to make her appear smaller than\nnecessary. The commander would stand among the Colors and High Luxiats\nbehind Karris.\nThe crowd fell silent as Carver Black stepped forward to introduce\nKarris as the new White. Teia didn’t pay attention; it was all titles and trivia.\nShe was doing what she was here for: scanning the crowd for dangers,\nalternately in paryl and in the visible spectrum. She had already looked\nthrough the clothes of everyone on the platform. With paryl she could see\nthrough cloth but not skin, and the very bodies of the men and women\nalready in place could conceal weapons.\nIt was a discomfiting thing, being able to see through people’s clothes.\nMost people, she decided, looked better with their clothes on. She now\nknew things about the High Luxiats that probably no one else knew.\nFrom the fresh cuts and welts on his back atop old scars, High Luxiat\nAmazzal obviously practiced self-flagellation. It was a practice frowned on,\nthough not explicitly forbidden unless it impeded the penitent’s\nperformance of his or her duties. High Luxiat Mohana had the stretch marks\nof at least one pregnancy, which might or might not be scandalous. Certain\norders of luxiats were allowed to marry, but generally not those who wished\nto progress high into the Magisterium. Perhaps Mohana had lost her child\nand joined the luxiats late? Or switched orders at some point?\nSecrets, secrets everywhere, and Teia didn’t want to know most of them,\nand couldn’t use others that lay open to her eyes.\nIt seemed unfair. Godlike. How did she have this power? This power to\nsee, and to kill? How did she have the right?\nAnd a year ago, I was whining that my color was useless.\nSuddenly everyone was bowing, and Teia flinched. She hadn’t even\nnoticed that Carver Black was finishing his introduction. Throughout the\nplaza, everyone bowed or curtsied as deeply as possible.\nStanding in front of those tens of thousands, Karris waited until\neveryone had risen. Then waited some more. Then more, until it was\npainful. Had she frozen up? Did someone need to do something?\nJust when Teia was sure one of the Colors was going to move to rescue\nher, Karris began speaking in a strong, clear voice that carried well. “War is\nhere. Would it were not so. Too many of us have thought of this war as\nsomething far away. The proclamations have meant nothing to us, for our\nown people are near. Our loved ones have been safe. So we have turned\ndeaf ears to the widows keening at the lists. We have turned hard hearts to\nthe weeping mothers of boys and girls who will never come back.

But\nan orange is a luxury, surely we can let that go. Then, cotton is expensive,\ntoo, from the loss of Atash, is it not? And wool, as the Ilytian traders have\nreconsidered the journey. But so what? What is this war to us? Perhaps\nmore patches on our clothes, and our children having to make do with\ntunics and dresses they’ve outgrown. Builders, have you not seen the price\nof lumber double? Why? Because our brothers in the Blood Forest have laid\ndown their saws to pick up swords, or turned their axes from hewing wood\nto hacking wights. So what? What is this distant war to us? The rest of us\nwill put off those repairs our homes need until next year. You builders will\nhave to charge the rich double, and pray they will pay so you can feed your\nfamilies. You shipowners and fishermen, you’ll be paying double for wood\nfor the repairs without which your ships will sink, so you’ll have to charge\ndouble for your goods, for your fish. But what is this distant war to us? We\nwill pay in coin, lest we have to pay in blood. For those with money, that\nsounds like an acceptable trade.\n“But we’ll notice that a certain kind of cargo comes to our island more\nfrequently, not less. Slavers. Starving mothers will think, better my starving\ndaughter live as a slave than die howling here. Better that I eat from the\ncoin of her misery than die and leave all my children orphans to fend for\nthemselves. Tell that mother she’s paying in coin, and not in blood. But\nwhat is this distant war to us?”\nShe paused, head bowed. And no one said anything. It was not like any\nrallying speech Teia had ever heard.\nKarris said, “My friends, beloved under the light, war is here, and would\nit were not so, but we are not innocent in its genesis. After the False Prism’s\nWar, our sisters and brothers in Tyrea begged us for the eye of mercy, and\nwe delivered only justice instead. We took the holy command to ‘Love\nmercy and do justice, and walk humbly before the Lord of Light,’ and we\nignored the parts we didn’t like. We took our own vengeance. When we\ntake a command and obey only the parts that profit us, that’s not obedience.\n“We have thought that because Orholam has blessed us, that his love and\nblessings belong to us, regardless of what we do. We have treated our lord\nas a slave to our desires. Where is the walking humbly in that? We, your\nleaders, are guilty.”\nThere was some uneasy shifting among the Colors and the High Luxiats.\nKarris, newly risen to her exalted position, hadn’t been among the ‘we’ she\nwas so pointedly impugning now. They, on the other hand, all had been.\nAnd from the rapt attention on their faces, they didn’t know what she was\nplanning to say next, either.\nExcept for Andross Guile, who was a cipher, as always."

I\ninvite those of you who are able to do so to join us, to pray for us, and ask\nOrholam’s blessing and wisdom in our endeavors. For though we have\nerred, there is yet work to be done. We may repent, but the consequences of\nour sin remain. Would it were not so, but war is here.\n“We cannot fight and take it for granted that Orholam is on our side. We\nmust fight to make sure that we are on Orholam’s side. And that means\ncleaning our own house first.\n“Don’t misunderstand. There’s no time to lose in proclaiming new\nfestivals and holy days of repentance. If we hesitate, we shall lose all of\nBlood Forest and Ruthgar, too. As we cleanse ourselves, we shall also\nprepare our armies. Those who pray will pray, and those who fight will\nfight, but those who lead will do both.\n“So let us turn to the work before us today. The first is a symptom of our\nemptiness. An emptiness that has reached even into the Magisterium itself.\nWhere there is a vacuum of true worship, it will be filled by our own\nvenality, our lusts, our cupidity, and our pride. It is a stain upon the\nChromeria and the Magisterium itself.” She slowed down. “It must be…\npurged. And one way or another, it will be purged.”\nThat word, used twice, used so deliberately, sent a shiver through the\nranks of luxiats. When they were commissioned, the luxors always began\ntheir purges among the luxiats first. Any luxiat with heterodox beliefs or\npersonal failings would have much to fear if the Office of Discipline was\ncommissioned and empowered again.\n“And indeed,” Karris said, “to my great horror, our first guilty party\ntoday hails from the Magisterium itself.” The crowd booed and hissed, and\nKarris seemed taken aback for a moment. Teia felt the same. It wasn’t easy\nto distinguish boos and hisses directed at you from those directed at your\nsubject.\nBut then she forged ahead. “Quentin Naheed distinguished himself early.\nAmong the many brilliant scholars in the Chromeria, from his earliest days\nhere, he stood out consistently as one of the brightest. Barely one year since\ntaking his vows and donning the black robe, he is already acknowledged as\nan exemplary scholar, a gifted historian, hagiographer, and translator. His\nexcellences are many, and his mind is peerless. However, Brother Quentin\nNaheed is also a murderer.”\nShe beckoned, and Quentin was brought forward by the tower soldiers.\nHe had been stripped to his underclothes, and he resembled a small bird\ndrenched and shaken from its time in a cat’s mouth, feathers limp, dignity\ntaken.\nTeia’s heart dropped.

And the glue holding\nthe caps on didn’t reattach well, so she couldn’t take them off and put them\nback on.\nBut an oath is an oath. She tore them away.\nOne of the High Luxiats, Brother Tawleb, was shifting peevishly. He\nmurmured something to High Luxiat Selene next to him, but she said\nnothing.\n“Brother Quentin Naheed,” Karris said. “Are you guilty of murder?”\n“Yes, High Lady,” he said, wretched. “Murder and attempted murder,\nand violating my oaths before the faith and Orholam himself in so doing.”\n“Has this confession been compelled from you? Have you been beaten,\nor threats made against your family?”\n“No,” he said, puzzled.\n“Louder, please,” she said.\nHigh Luxiat Tawleb shifted again, clearly agitated, but not wanting to\ncause a scene.\n“No, I wasn’t beaten. In fact, when the soldiers showed up, I was\nterrified, but I was also relieved.”\nKarris turned to the crowd. “In my time, I’ve hunted unrepentant wights\nand fought rebels. You hardly seem the normal criminal. Are you giving\nyour confession in a bid for clemency?”\nAgain, the shock on Quentin’s face couldn’t have been feigned.\n“Clemency? I shot a girl in the throat while I was trying to murder your\nstepson, High Lady. If I seem resolute in the face of my death, it’s only so I\ndon’t weep and shame myself further.”\n“High Lady,” High Luxiat Tawleb interjected, “many pardons, please.\nBut did we not agree that it’s a terrible idea to let this traitor, this, this\nloathsome pagan heretic, spread his lies to the people here who might be\nvulnerable or misled? A platform is exactly what these traitors hope to get.\nLook, even now, this—this posturing, as if the man who shot a young girl\nso she could die on the street like a dog is somehow heroic. As if there were\nanything noble about him. Let us put an end to this.”\n“I understand why you want him silenced,” Karris said, loudly.\nHe blanched, but shot back quickly, “Yes, because he was once dear to\nme, and I’m furious that my own discipulus would turn out to be a traitor. It\nis a stain to my honor, and my judgment, and, yes, an embarrassment that\n—”\n“No, Brother Tawleb,” Karris said. She shook her head sadly.\nBut his words rode right over hers. “—that anyone so near to me should\nharbor such bile in his heart, and I not notice it. But if you’re going to try to\nsay that—”\n“Enough!” She held up a hand, and he finally stopped.\nWhat was happening?

Watch Captain\nBlunt looked at her and threw his eyebrows up.\nOh shit. With paryl, despite the pain of widening her eyes so far in this\nbright noon light, Teia double-checked Tawleb for a weapon.\nOh many shits. She’d missed it earlier. He had a dagger, held tight under\nhis armpit with cloth, so no straps had stood out to her. Why would a High\nLuxiat arm himself? Should she do something now? Do you tackle a High\nLuxiat for being armed? He’d made no move with it.\nShe made the hand sign for ‘knife’ and tapped her armpit. The watch\ncaptain and the commander and Stump caught it.\nTeia missed some bit of Karris’s saying this wasn’t a court, but that the\nHigh Magisterium had met and discussed some kind of evidence. Karris\nproduced some papers, asking Tawleb to explain them.\nHe stepped close to examine the papers. This would be the moment he\nwould attack, if he was going to. Teia saw the commander tensing, about to\ngive the order to take him down regardless rather than risk it, but then\nKarris gave a very subtle wave-off.\nOf course she knew the Blackguard hand signs, and she’d caught them\ngoing around even as she spoke. She knew.\nThe commander gestured a stop.\n“These are worthless!” High Luxiat Tawleb said, and Teia knew then\nthat he wasn’t going to attack. “Forgeries. You’re trying to become a tyrant,\nKarris Guile. You’re putting the Spectrum above the Magisterium. You’re a\nheretic, an apostate, a pagan whore.”\nGasps went though the crowd. Murmurs, a frisson of danger. What did\nhe say? Did he really just—\nKarris held her hand up as—of all people—Carver Black moved\nforward to strike High Luxiat Tawleb to silence him. She said, “No, please,\nHigh Lord Black, I’ll strike him myself if need be. And I will, if, on this day\nof truth, he tells one more lie—”\n“A lie?! Which?! That you’re a heretic or that you’re a whore—”\nTeia had seen Karris train. She had fought with her and against her. The\nspeed with which Karris moved shouldn’t have been surprising.\nIt was.\nDespite her huge amazing dress, she kicked—kicked—Tawleb. Not in\nthe knee, or the gut. She kicked this man who towered over her in the side\nof the head. He went down instantly, and by the time everyone’s gaze had\nbounced from the blur that was Karris to the big man bouncing off the wood\nat her feet, Karris was composed again, standing calmly, straightening her\ndress, as if nothing had happened.\nBalls! Guarding this woman is either going to be really, really easy, or\nreally, really hard.\n“Brother Tawleb,” Karris said, “stand forth and accept Orholam’s\njudgment. The High Magisterium has voted, and the Spectrum has\nadjudicated the penalty. You are guilty of treason. Your penalty is death.”"

If not, the time is—”\nHe spat on her. Or tried.\nFast as a serpent strike, Karris blocked his spit with a gloved palm.\n“I have no master! I did it for all of us! All of you! You ignoramuses! I\ndid it to save you from the Guiles’ tyranny and apostasy!” He turned to\nQuentin. “You incompetent! You failed me! I was going to give you\neverything!”\nKarris gave a signal that the Blackguard was on duty to defend her once\nmore, and a bare moment later, Tawleb scrambled to draw his dagger. It was\ntucked too deep for him to draw it quickly enough, especially given that\nthey knew it was there.\nThe others had him down practically before Teia moved. She’d been\ntrying to enervate his joints with paryl as Murder Sharp had done so often\nto her, but she was too slow, and she ended up doing nothing—standing still\nwhile her brothers worked. Dammit!\nThey hauled him away and bound his hands and feet, and blindfolded\nhim.\nThe great metal legs of a frame had been folded out of the wall itself. A\ngreat mirror as tall as a man, like those at the tops of the seven towers,\ndangled from chains between them, resting for the moment on the platform.\nBut this mirror also had shackles, themselves mirrored, and a head brace.\nFighting weakly, High Luxiat Tawleb was dragged toward the mirror.\nHis palms were pierced briefly with hellstone to make sure he hadn’t\npacked any luxin—though the man wasn’t a drafter, it was customary.\nTeia had been briefed on what would happen, and what to do. And she\nstill didn’t want to think of it.\nHigh Luxiats Selene and Amazzal went to Tawleb, who was held on his\nknees. Selene spoke quiet words, expelling him from the Magisterium and\nexcommunicating him from the faith. She was followed by an equally\nsorrowful Amazzal, who offered to shrive him and hear his repentance, if he\ndesired.\nTawleb spat at him.\nThe tower soldiers bound him to the mirror, his head held immobile, still\nblindfolded and gagged. Teia helped pull the chains to lift mirror and man\ninto place.\n“Orholam is merciful,” High Luxiat Selene announced to the crowd.\n“And his justice tarries, but it will not be held back forever. May we all\nwalk rightly, that we may stand before the Lord of Light unashamed and\nunafraid. Let us seek never to deserve the hard light of Orholam’s glare.”\nAcross the surface of the oceanic crowd, lights winked like the sun on\nthe waves of Sapphire Bay as everyone from the lowest slave cook to the\nHigh Luxiats drew forth mirrors.

Some Atashian\nnobles who’d lost lands and children in the war had bought hundreds of\nmirrors to hand out to those who couldn’t afford them: a voluntary war tax\nthey paid to support the execution of traitors and heretics and murderers and\nspies.\nAbove and around the platform, mirrors unfolded like the petals of\ndeadly flowers opening, answering the call of the sun above. In front of a\nnumber of the mirrors, white sheets unfurled, covering them, and in front of\nthe condemned, a black sheet unrolled, blocking him from view.\nTeia saw other Blackguards donning darkened spectacles. Things were\ngoing to get bright around here.\nIt wasn’t only the noonday sun, or the light reflected from ten thousand\nmirrors. In moments, the mirrors of each of the thousand star towers around\nBig Jasper would be focused here. The great banks of mirrors atop each of\nthe seven towers would likewise be uncovered.\nThe only small mercy here was Orholam’s. It was a clear day. The noon\nsun blazed with white-hot fury. Tawleb would die far more quickly than on\na cloudy day.\nNot that burning to death was an option Teia would choose.\nShe turned, checking her area with paryl light one last time before she\nwould have to narrow her eyes or be blinded. She caught sight of Quentin,\nstill on his knees between tower guards.\nHe looked more terrified than she had ever seen anyone look in her life.\nIt pierced her like a splinter in her soul.\nQuentin had murdered one of the Blackguard’s own, but Teia had\nnothing of vengeance in her now.\nSadah Superviolet had come forward, and she gave the final invocation:\n“Orholam, you are not deceived. Darkness is no cover from your eyes. No\nstain is hidden from you. We follow your gaze, O Father of Lights. Let what\nhas been hidden by man’s darkness be revealed by your light. We, your\npeople, cast our eyes and our light upon this stain.”\nAbove Sadah, Tawleb was shrouded from the audience and their\npinpricks of light by the heavy black cloth. As she finished speaking, she\nproduced her own mirror, and with one hand she turned it toward the man\nsuspended in the air above her.\nEveryone else did the same, turning their mirrors either directly toward\nthe figure hidden behind black cloth or—if they didn’t have a direct line of\nsight—toward one of the mirrors set up to collect their light.\nNot everyone in the crowd had perfect aim, of course, so it was suddenly\nblindingly bright on the platform. But Teia saw Sadah Superviolet’s other\nhand extend downward.\nNot being a superviolet, Teia didn’t know exactly how it worked, but\nthere was a superviolet control node here that connected all the Thousand\nStars and the Chromeria’s tower mirrors.\nSuddenly all the hundreds of huge, perfectly polished mirrors around the\nisland and the Chromeria flared as one, shooting beams of light in every"

At the last moment, a blade sheared the blindfold over\nTawleb’s eyes, though the black drop cloth was left in place.\nTeia had thought the light was blinding before. It had been a candle next\nto the sun.\nWhen she was a child, her parents had once taken her to the Eshed\nNotzetz, the tallest waterfall in the Seven Satrapies. Standing on the\nexecution platform so near the focal point of every mirror here was like\nstanding beside a very cataract of light. She’d never heard of light’s having\na sound, but the intensity of it seemed to make her heart stop, ears stop, skin\nregister nothing.\nA small whoosh as of something catching fire, and then a scream, and all\nTeia’s senses came rushing back. It was unbearably hot, the instant sweat\nevaporating off her skin and leaving it hotter than before. Heat so hot she\nactually didn’t want to tear off her blacks, because she thought her skin\nwould melt in the onslaught.\nThere was nothing but heat and screaming, and the screaming was worse\nas Tawleb roasted to death.\nTeia peeked through one scrunched eye and saw the man in outline\nagainst white, dancing like an egg on a hot buttered skillet, skin popping\nopen, juices hissing across the mirror he was bound to, turning to steam.\nAnd then it was done.\nIt couldn’t have been ten seconds.\nIt had been the longest ten seconds of Teia’s life.\nSadah Superviolet stopped first, the great mirrors swinging out and\naway, and the intensity of the light falling off dramatically. Then the people,\nsquinting, dazzled, turned their own mirrors away.\nAbove them, chained to his mirror, Tawleb had been turned into a\nblackened husk, half the size he had been before, burnt nearly beyond\nrecognition even as a man.\nFor one moment, there was total silence.\nThen, then the people—Orholam forgive them—the people suddenly\ncheered. Teia would have thought their horror would be greater. Not\nstanding in the light’s path themselves, they would have been able to see the\nwhole thing, if not hear it. They had watched a man cook in moments, skin\nsplitting like that of a sausage accidentally dropped onto the coals.\nAnd they cheered.\nKarris White strode to the front of the stage. The new White held up her\nhands, quieting the crowd.

Ergo, if one doesn’t want to\nfight, where we—the Mighty—are going, is not where you, who are not the\nMighty, should go.’\nThat seemed to set a kettle of rage boiling. So he kept talking.\nHe’d been a young man.\n‘You see,’ he said. ‘If I were not going specifically to fight, I would\nprobably choose someplace safer to be than, you know, the middle of a\nbattle. And since your place—’\n‘My place? My place?!’ And a more rapid boil than Kip had expected.\nHere he’d kept his eye on the pot the whole time and everything. ‘First\nthings first, Lord Guile! I am too a part of the Mighty. I’m one of you now,\nand don’t you dare take that away from me.’\n‘The Mighty obey my orders. I’m their—’\n‘You do not give orders to your wife!’\n‘If they’re in the Mighty I do!’\nHe knew he shouldn’t have said that.\nHe’d said it. He’d been young.\nThing had gone downhill from there.\nTisis had come along. With a healer. As a noblewoman, Tisis had\nalready had a basic education in battlefield medicine—or, as it was\notherwise known, how to stop your child’s bleeding if no slaves are around\nto help.\nShe’d agreed to stay with Evie Cairn, the healer.\nKip counted it a win.\nHe was no longer a young man.\nThe skimmer cut up the broad river in the moist evening air. As they’d\nslowly gained elevation over the past days, the jungles had yielded to\nevergreen forests.\n“Kip, you know, I can learn,” she said.\n“Learn to what?” he asked.\n“To fight.”\n“Of course you can. And we’ll brush up on your shooting and some\nbasic attacks with green. But you’ll never be a match for any of these guys.\nEven if you could, we don’t have ten years for you to train to get there. It\ndoesn’t make sense to even try—”\nBen-hadad cleared his throat and said under his breath, “I think you’re\nmissing the point, brother.”\nKip charged ahead. Fucking fuck. This was so simple. It wasn’t a matter\nof feelings. It was a matter of facts. “Look! I’ve been training with the best\nfor more than a year now. Every day we worked for hours to learn how to\nfight this way. Every day. We’ve been in numerous battles, and I’m still the\nweakest of us. I’m still a liability to the Mighty, Tisis, so—”\n“That’s really not correct,” Ferkudi said."

He was working one of the reeds.\n“Sure, in a fistfight any of us could take him,” Ferkudi went on, “but\nbattle’s not a fistfight. Breaker, you don’t need to be modest. I don’t think\nany of us would want to face you one-on-one on the field of battle.”\n“Orholam’s chapped nutsack, Ferkudi,” Big Leo said from the other\nreed. “You’re not wrong, but your timing is.”\n“My timing is what?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Wrong.”\n“Oh, I thought you were leaving me hanging there, like, ‘You’re not\nwrong, but your timing is…’”\n“Ferk,” Cruxer said in a tone of command that was a twin of\nCommander Ironfist’s.\n“Ah. Right, sir.”\n“You see?” Tisis said. “I need to do my part.”\n“I thought we’d already agreed what your part is!” Kip said, starting to\nget hot again.\nBen-hadad cleared his throat again, looking blithely at the sky and trees.\n“Missing the point,” he whispered again.\n“Fine!” Kip said, too loudly, turning to the young man. “What’s the\npoint, Ben?”\nBen-hadad abandoned his quiet tone, matching Kip’s frustration with his\nown. “She wants your respect, dumbass. You treat her like dead weight and\nit robs her of purpose. I understand how she feels.”\nHe gestured to his knee. Ben-hadad did little stretches every day to\nreclaim what movement he could, but the kneecap had been shattered, and\nevery move caused him terrible pain. He used one crutch most of the time,\nand two when he had to move at any decent speed. “But hell, add the\ncripple and the neophyte together, and you might get one warrior between\nus.” Bitterness roiled beneath the surface of his words like cream first\npoured into kopi, awaiting a single slight stir to stain every part.\n“We need two drafters on the reeds to keep the skimmer mobile if we\nhave to retreat,” Cruxer interjected. “It’s a necessary function. Plus Ben-\nhadad’s a helluva shot if it comes to it. Tisis, you stay with Ben.”\nTisis swallowed and nodded. “Okay.”\n“That’s ‘Yes, sir,’” Cruxer said, with a little smirk. “You’re one of the\nMighty now.”\nTisis lit up. “Yes, sir!” she said. “And sorry for being a jackass,\neveryone.”\n“Common malady ’round here,” Big Leo muttered.\nFerkudi stared over at him.\n“Universal malady?” Big Leo asked.\n“Huh?” Ferkudi asked. “I was just—you’ve got a booger.”\nBig Leo trailed off into cursing Ferkudi under his breath and trying to\ndig at his nostril discreetly while the others grinned.\n“Universal,” Kip said. “Definitely universal.” He turned to Cruxer with\ngratitude welling up in him.

Cruxer was so good at that. Many in power liked to\nassert their dominance. Cruxer liked to let people figure things out for\nthemselves, intervening only if there was a problem he could fix that they\ncouldn’t fix on their own. It was one of many traits that made him a good\nman to follow. “Thank you… Commander Cruxer.”\n“Commander?” Cruxer asked.\n“If we’re going to do this, let’s do it right, right?” Kip asked.\nCruxer stood up straight, as if donning a new cloak and feeling the\nweight of it settle on his shoulder. “Commander Cruxer,” he said. A big\nsmile spread over his face.\n“Commander Cruxer,” Winsen said, nodding to him, not even a hint of\nsarcasm in his tone.\n“Commander Cruxer,” Big Leo said in his basso profundo as if\nannouncing him in a stadium.\nAnd on they went, each adding their own little twist.\n“Commander Cruxer?” Ferkudi asked.\n“Commander Cruxer,” Ben-hadad said.\nTisis fluttered her eyelashes and clasped her hands like a swooning girl.\n“Oh, Commander Cruxer.”\nHe blushed and they laughed together.\nKip suddenly felt far, far away. After all they’d been through, and what\nhe knew he was taking them into, it was a honeyed moment that they could\nbe silly kids together. Like a spark flying upward, their youth was bright\nand fading fast.\n“It’s time,” Ben-hadad said, abruptly professional. He’d made water\nclocks for them, complaining about it. He’d not had time to make their\nglobes the correct size to correspond to hours or minutes. Instead he’d\nmerely made the two clocks exactly the same size, so although it took about\nseventy minutes for them to empty rather than an hour, they were still\nsynchronized with each other, which was all that mattered.\nKip drew his superviolet spectacles from his hip case, absorbed light,\nand shot a flare into the sky. It had taken them a while to figure out how to\nkeep the flare from disintegrating immediately, superviolet was so fragile.\nThere was no answering flare they could see, but in the river valley, with\ntrees draped over every shore, they hadn’t expected to.\n“Quiet from this point on,” Cruxer ordered.\nThey went silent, leaving only the whupping noise and burble of the\nreeds as luxin pushed water and trapped air into the water behind the boat.\nKip saw Ben-hadad looking annoyed at the noise—already designing a\nquieter propulusion unit for Blue Falcon III, no doubt.\nA few minutes later, they pulled the skimmer into the lee of a downed\ntree that would conceal it while letting the reeds remain in the water. They\nloaded the muskets and checked their other weapons.\nThe Blood Foresters had shown them how to camouflage themselves for\nthe woods, breaking up their silhouettes by binding twigs to their clothing,"

If they were spotted before the attack at\nthe warehouse pulled away the defenders, the whole ruse would be for\nnaught. On the other hand, they still didn’t even know if they were looking\nfor barges or wagons or even both. They didn’t know how many defenders\nthere would be. They were going in blind.\nThe element of surprise is no advantage if you’re surprised, too.\nBut the longer they took to attack, the more Ghosts were going to die\nbelow.\nSo, quietly, as they double- and triple-checked everything, Kip reviewed\ntheir rendezvous points if they got separated, the likely fallback areas if\nthey had to retreat, and so forth. There were only the seven of them, and\nKip wished again that he had Goss, Daelos, and Teia along.\nBest not to think about any of them, though. Especially Teia.\nDamn, but Teia’s cloak would have made scouting easy.\nThen they heard it, a single, distant musket shot.\n“Could still be a hunter,” Cruxer said.\n“Who hunts with a musket?” Winsen asked, as if every archer in the\nworld could reliably down a stag at two hundred paces with a single arrow\nthe way he could.\nThere was a rattle of another dozen shots.\n“Aha,” Big Leo said, breaking into a huge grin for the first time in\nseveral weeks. “That sounds like our song.”\nThey put on their spectacles and filled themselves with their colors,\nluxin curling like smoke under their skins.\nKip got ready to lead them out, only to see a reproachful look in\nFerkudi’s eyes. “What?” he asked.\n“You know, I’m not as smart as you, Breaker, but sometimes you’re just\nplain dumb.”\n“What?” he asked again.\n“The hell is wrong with you?” Big Leo said. “We’re going into battle.\nVastly outnumbered. May all die… and you’re not gonna give your wife a\nkiss goodbye?”\n“Oh!” Kip said. “Oh.”\nThey bickered, but in an overarching sense, Kip and Tisis were actually\nbecoming friends. And for all that they’d tried to consummate their\nmarriage any number of frustrating times, they hadn’t really… kissed much.\nThe Mighty think I’m being dumb because I’m leaving without patching\nup a fight, but I think I’m actually a lot dumber than that. He’d kissed her\nneck—she’d liked that a lot. He’d kissed her breasts—they’d both liked that\na lot. But the last girl—the only girl—he’d kissed on the lips had been Teia.\nHad he really never kissed Tisis on the lips?\nIt was as if without really realizing it he’d been holding on to that for\nTeia, holding back one intimacy because he’d given away so many others."

Give the woman this, even at fifty,\nshe’s got arms and shoulders to make many young warriors jealous. I’m just\nglad she hit me with an open hand.\nShe says, “Our houses and our nations need heirs to knit together the\nOakenshields and the Guiles, else this war will never die. We’ve talked this\nall through. We’ve agreed on this course. We had our chance, Darien, all\nthose years ago, and we missed it through our own pride. It’s a closed door.\nDon’t make us both pathetic by banging on it. You’ve married my daughter\nto give us an heir. None of us liked that choice, but we all made it. Now you\nact like a spoiled child, not willing to pay the price of your choice, and\nmaking everyone else miserable with you. Darien, if you give my daughter\na child but not your love, you’re treating her like a whore, a broodmare,\nnothing more than a receptacle for your seed. She’s my daughter, and I\nwon’t have you treat her like that. You will treat her like a lady, like your\nwife, like a woman making the best of a bad situation, like a woman\noffering you not just her body but also her heart. If you spurn that, you\nnever deserved my love in the first place.”\n“But I love you hopelessly, helplessly.”\n“The seeds of love may sprout where they will, but we choose whether\nto water them and give them light or to pluck them like weeds from the soil.\nWe always have a choice.”\n“This choice seems impossible.”\n“Seems,” she says, her back straight and eyes pitiless.\nAnd in the mirror of her eyes, I see how callow, how selfish, how self-\nabsorbed I’ve been. This marriage puts me in the arms of a young woman,\nwilling to give me children and love; it puts Selene with an older man who\nloves her not, and breaks her relationship with her mother at the same time;\nit puts Zee alone, with her daughter married to the man she herself loves. As\na lover, how can she wish her daughter happiness with the man she herself\nonce loved? As a mother, how can she not?\n“Is he having one of his fits?” Ferkudi asked.\n“No,” Kip said, coming back to the moment. “Just feeling ashamed for\nmy stupidity.” Darien Guile had been more than fifty years old, and he’d\nloved Zee Oakenshield for more than three decades. When they’d finally\nmade peace, she’d been too old to give him an heir, and he had no sons.\nHe’d had to marry her daughter Selene. Darien had had an excuse for being\nan idiot."

Always, he’d\npanted after the safely impossible.\nHe walked to Tisis and looked down into her questioning hazel eyes, her\nface more open than he deserved, more beautiful than he could imagine.\n“Forgive me?” he said.\n“Just this once,” she said, smiling.\nHe cupped her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the lips. She\nreacted like red luxin just waiting for a spark. Her body molded into his as\nif it had been made for it. Her lips were—\nBig Leo cleared his throat noisily.\n—her lips were, oh, Orholam, her lips were the best—\n“Hey! Newlyweds!”\n“You were the one who reminded him of impending death,” Winsen\nsaid.\n“‘Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,’ and all that,” Ferkudi said. “I mean,\nwe do need to let the trap develop a bit. Maybe they have time for a quick\nthrow behind those bushes over—”\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said.\n“‘Gather ye rosebuds,’ Ferkudi?” Ben-hadad said, incredulous. “You\nread poetry?”\n“I’m a gentle soul!” Ferkudi protested.\n“‘And lo! they saw that the ape could speak, and they were much\namazed,’” Big Leo said under his breath.\n“‘And sore afraid!’” Tisis said, finally pushing Kip back. It took him a\nmoment to realize she was finishing the quote. He hadn’t read either poem.\nAside from Master Danavis’s scrolls of military history and tactics and\ndrafting—boy, did some things about the general seem obvious in retrospect\n—there had been few books or scrolls in Rekton, and fewer people willing\nto let a fat kid with pie-sticky fingers handle their treasures. His mother had\nkept books for years, despite her addiction. Finally, most of those had been\nsold to fund her haze smoking and self-loathing.\n“You don’t look like a man who’s just been thoroughly kissed,” Tisis\nsaid.\n“Mmm. Just putting on a good show for the boys,” he said.\n“Come back,” she said. “And I’ll put on a good show just for you.”\n“Oh my.”\nThere was something cosmically wrong with being horny when you left\nyour wife to go to battle. There were traditions to follow, dammit: there was\nsupposed to be a night of passion first, then the husband left deeply\nsatisfied, carrying a nice memory of what awaited when he returned. It was\na nice incentive to live.\nOf course, unrelieved horniness with the promise of relief if he lived\nwas a nice incentive, too.\nYes, sir! Thank you, sir! I would prefer the other incentive, sir!\nChapter 30\nStand straight and tall.\nDone and done.\nMaintain the dignity of the White.\nThat was probably a lost cause, considering she’d just kicked a man in\nthe head in front of tens of thousands of people."

Don’t talk fast because you’re\nnervous.\nKarris took a deep breath. Say this for executing a man: it does rather\novershadow one’s fear of public speaking.\nShe looked out over the many thousands of faces staring at her and the\ncharred corpse of High Luxiat Tawleb and the huddled young luxiat\nQuentin at her feet. She had moved out from under the shadow of Tawleb’s\ncorpse. She had fought enough to know that even a roasted body can drip\nfluids. Not something she wanted to wear.\nBut coincidentally, her move had arrayed her so that she stood in the\ncenter as judge, and the dead man hung to her left, and now to her right\nhuddled the repentant young luxiat Quentin. It wasn’t an arrangement she\nhad planned—Gavin certainly would have thought of it, standing here like\nthe sign of the three, but then, he’d had a lot more practice with theatrics,\nand he was able to pull off symbolism effortlessly. Karris would simply\nhave to muddle through, and accept luck when it came knocking.\n“Luxiat Quentin Naheed,” she said loudly. “You have earned expulsion\nfrom the Magisterium for the violation of your vows. You deserve to be\nstripped of your title.”\nHe said nothing. He was already on his knees, and he simply slumped\nforward. Silent.\n“Quentin Naheed, you have earned being disowned by your family for\nthe shame you have brought upon them. You deserve to be stripped of your\nname. Quentin, you have earned exile from your satrapy for dishonoring the\ngift of your education. You deserve to be stripped of a home. And most of\nall… convict, you have earned death for the murder of Lucia Agnelli. You\ndeserve to be stripped of your life.”\nTwo Blackguards came forward and lifted Quentin to his feet. He wasn’t\nweeping, nor did he have the ten-league stare of the doomed. He was\nstaring toward Teia, who had pulled off her eye caps, and was meeting his\neyes, with a resolute, calm strength Karris hadn’t known the young woman\nhad. Almost too quietly for Karris to hear, Quentin was repeatedly\nwhispering a breath prayer: “Orholam, give me strength for the path you’ve\nlaid before me.”\nThey took his arms, and, as he stepped into place, offering no resistance,\nhe stepped on the foot of one of the Blackguards. “Pardon me, sir, I did not\nmean to do that,” he said.\n“Hold,” Karris commanded. She turned her gaze to the crowd, that\nrestive, hungry hound, eyeing her hands for its next treat. She glanced at\nQuentin, but his eyes were down. To the crowd, she announced, “We are\ncalled to do justice, but to love mercy. How do we do those things on any\nday? How do we do those things in war? We have not Orholam’s perfect\nsight. The traitor we spare today may return to the fight and kill our allies\ntomorrow. But…"

But…\n“But even a traitor may repent truly. And today I have seen a vast gulf\nbetween the attitudes of these two men doomed to die. Thus, today I will\nextend the hardest mercy I know. Quentin, you will not die for your\ncrimes.”\nThe young man stared at her as if she were speaking a foreign tongue.\n“We are at war,” Karris said, “and I will not cast aside a weapon that can\nbe used. Quentin, your sin was pride, a pride carefully banked in hot coals\nunder false humility. The body can die but once, pride can die every day.\nYou, Quentin, shall live a slave. You shall be my slave until you learn what\ntrue humility is. I expect it may take all the years of your life.\n“And why my slave? Because you are to be a lash for me. We are called\nto do justice and to love mercy—so I will extend the mercy of your life to\nyou. But we are also called to walk humbly in the light. And this is the\nlesson that too many of us have forgotten. A lesson that the Chromeria has\nignored. You, Quentin, will not be ignored. Despite what you deserve, you\nwill not be expelled from the Magisterium. You shall be a luxiat still. You\nwill be a badge of their shame, for failing Orholam, for allowing darkness\nto enter the temple of light. You will be dressed in gold, to remind them\nhow easy it is to love gold and to be led astray by a love for earthly\npleasures. You will be assigned to study beside and tutor luxiats, to turn\nyour brilliant mind to helping them in their work, and to helping us win this\nwar. You will be Orholam’s justice to them, you shall be a lash against their\npride, and the High Luxiats and I shall continue to talk about whether this is\npunishment enough to cleanse the stain they have allowed into the House of\nLight.”\nBefore Karris had climbed up onto the platform, Andross Guile had\nreminded her that this was no amphitheater. Whatever tricks they did to\nproject her voice, those at the back wouldn’t hear a word she said.\nNaturally, her words were being transcribed and would be published all\naround the Seven Satrapies, but what could be seen should be considered\nseparately from what could be heard. If she wasn’t careful, Karris would be\nseen doing nothing to a traitor. That would look like weakness. So\nQuentin’s enslavement had to be seen.\nSo Karris now walked over to the seated High Luxiat Amazzal. She\npulled out a large ceremonial dagger and handed it to him.\n“If you’ll do the honors of clipping his ear, High Luxiat?” she asked.\n“I prefer we handle such discipline privately,” he said.\n“Oh, I know what you prefer,” Karris said. “Orea Pullawr trusted you to\nhandle your own affairs faithfully, and you rewarded her trust by raising at\nleast one traitor to the High Magisterium itself. You have loved the darkness\nof your privacy. Now we banish darkness from the House of Light.”\nHe held her eye, jaw clenching."

Now we banish darkness from the House of Light.”\nHe held her eye, jaw clenching.\n“Don’t be a fool,” Andross said to High Luxiat Amazzal from his seat,\npitching his voice low so no one beyond the platform would hear him.\n“Every moment you hesitate you show the people that you are reluctant to\ngive either justice or mercy or both. Accept the loss, or change the game\nand fight.”\nHigh Luxiat Amazzal flushed, but he took the knife. He took the steps\ntoward the kneeling Quentin, and held a hand up in the sign of the three,\nmoving it through the four quadrants in the circle of blessing, but he wasn’t\npraying. He said, “You will pay for this.”\nHe wasn’t speaking to Quentin.\n“Happily,” Karris said. And she meant it. There was something\nrefreshing about the kind of man who would tell you he was angry at you.\nFrontal attacks were so much easier to defend against.\nBut something changed in his posture, and Karris’s old Blackguard\nsenses began tingling.\n“By the power vested in me as High Luxiat—” Amazzal declared to the\ncrowd.\n“One moment, High Luxiat,” a voice interjected. Andross Guile’s. Faster\nthan she would have expected he could move, Andross was already\nstanding beside the furious old man. “Let us show that we are united in this,\nthe promachos together with the White and the luxiats against the pagans\nand traitors. I will hold the boy.”\nAndross put his hands on Quentin’s shoulders, but then whispered to\nAmazzal, “You have to move faster than that if you wish to change the\ngame. Too late now.”\nToo late for what? For a moment, Karris didn’t understand.\nThen she did. The old man had intended to say Quentin had gone too far.\nHe’d intended to kill him, to assert Magisterial privilege over its own,\ndespite whatever the White wanted. He’d intended not to have the constant\nembarrassment of Karris’s slave’s being around, humiliating his luxiats.\nAnd Andross Guile had figured it out before perhaps even the old man\nhad. Certainly Karris would have been too late.\nThe vein in Amazzal’s forehead throbbed. “And if I—”\n“I swear to God I’ll put you up on the Glare next,” Andross said.\nAmazzal looked like a bully punched between the eyes, disbelieving.\nBut then he saw the look in Andross’s eyes—and believed.\nThe rage went out of the old High Luxiat in a whoosh. He spoke loudly\nagain. “By the power vest—vested in me… By the power vested in me,\nhere is the Chromeria’s justice and mercy, Luxiat Quentin Naheed. You are\nhereby enslaved.”\nHe sliced Quentin’s ear, blood spitting out onto the High Luxiat’s hands\nand his lambent white robes.\nAmazzal was not a bad man, nor a bad luxiat.

He cared for others deeply, and offered mercy wherever he went.\nBut mercy ceases to be a virtue when it enables further injustice.\nThe tower guards dragged Quentin away, and Karris ghosted through the\nnext speech, barely aware, condemning the traitor prophet to death on the\nGlare for fomenting rebellion, placing spies, and blasphemy.\nPheronike was the man who’d been confirmed to be a spy handler by the\nMighty in one of their training missions. Karris had gotten a spy close to\nhim through that operation, and just before she passed away, Orea Pullawr\nhad had her people scoop up the lot of them. Of them, only this man was a\ndrafter. He was a sub-red, but he’d not been Chromeria-educated, so he was\nprobably little danger, but despite that, he was kept in the special garb for\ncondemned drafters, which was woven with hellstones to disrupt any luxin\nhe tried to gather; he was also blindfolded to forbid him light, and subjected\nto a litany’s worth of other traditions that Karris didn’t even know about,\nmuch less comprehend the reasons for.\nBut despite the strangeness of the black garb and blindfold, it was only\nas they lifted Pheronike onto the mirror that Karris snapped back into focus\non the moment. She’d never seen a drafter executed on the Glare.\nIt was supposed to be the worst way for a drafter to die. Or the two\nworst ways, really, depending on whether you decided to draft or not. She’d\nheard it described as choosing whether to die of constipation or diarrhea.\nOn the other hand, how could it be worse than burning to death?\nThey moved into place, and Karris donned dark spectacles as he was\nlifted high. Again the people’s mirrors came out, and Sadah Superviolet\ncame forward. Again, it was only as Sadah swung the mirrors into focus\nthat a blade sliced the blindfold from the condemned’s face.\nThough Karris was prepared for it this time, it was still like standing in a\nthunderstorm of light. It was like going from the snowy slopes of Atan’s\nTeeth to the hottest desert of the Cracked Lands in an instant. The heat\nalone was a hammer. The light itself had a physical presence—a thickness,\na reality so heavy that it made all the material universe seem like a ghostly\nrealm in comparison. A concussive force pressed out Karris’s breath. She\nwanted to drop to her knees. She wanted to hide.\nIn that moment, Karris believed those who swore that Orholam himself\nwas within that beam of light, and she prayed only that he turn not his eye\nupon her.\nThe black drop cloth hiding the accused had already caught fire. The\ncloth was both symbolic and practical: intended to represent sin and\nattempting to hide from Orholam’s eye, and intended as a mercy, to keep\nthe people’s mirrors from burning the condemned and torturing him before\nall the mirrors could come into place.\nOrholam’s Glare was excruciating, but it was brief.\nAll the light in the world illumined the traitor, and he screamed.

He\nsoul-screamed a name.\nBut it was impossible to catch the disembodied syllables over the flame\nand the pain.\nThe air above Pheronike undulated as he let out a huge wave of sub-red\n—a beam into the sky. Unable to form luxin anywhere else because of the\nhellstone clothing pressing in on his skin, he tried to shed the excess heat\nfrom his face.\nIt was too much to handle, too much to draft artfully; it was a gush. It\nwas also why the condemned’s face on Orholam’s Glare was angled\nskyward, so he couldn’t attack the crowd around him.\nThe geyser of heat crackled and cracked like a flag in the wind, even\nflickering into flames. And it kept going.\nAs did Pheronike’s howl, a lone, long ululation of agony as skin burnt\nand cartilage burnt and bone burst forth, blackening.\nThen they stopped altogether, drafting and screaming both, cut off with a\nname: “Nabiros,” the prophet said, a soft life-sloughing sigh. A summons.\nFor one heartbeat, nothing happened. It was long enough that Karris\nrealized Pheronike’s body wasn’t burning.\nThen his skin burst apart in a spray of gore, his head tearing apart as his\nneck vomited out three dogs’ heads, black and red, growling and snapping.\nHis shoulders bulged, and muscles knotted in his skinny legs, splitting the\nskin like a bursting boil. But his limbs stayed bound, and in the next\nheartbeat, he sagged, deflated, defeated, and died.\nThe dog’s heads sizzled in Orholam’s obliterating light, and his whole\nbody burnt like any man’s—at least that of any man with three blackened\ndogs’ skulls attached to three necks.\nFor Karris, the moment stretched like a raindrop about to fall off a leaf,\nbulging, heavy with intent.\nNo one even breathed. The civilians had ducked back, cowering, and for\nthis precious instant they still disbelieved. The Blackguards had weapons\ndrawn—as did Karris herself, all unknowing, her other hand out to them,\nsignaling no.\nA collective gasp passed over the crowd in the next moment. It was\ndisbelief. Literal incredulity: Did I actually see that? Did you see that?\nBut it was undeniable. The skeletal remains had three heads.\nAnd then the collective question: What the hell was that?\nWhat the hell is that?\nKarris gave a signal, and finally the mirrors turned away.\nWhen the light faded, there reigned a baffled quiet. The audience held\nmirrors in nerveless fingers, forgetting to turn them away. Still no one\nspoke.\nAnd then children started weeping—and not only children, but men and\nwomen, too.\nKarris had always been fast. Not being big or strong, she’d taken to\nheart early the lesson her trainer had given: it’s often not who hits hardest\nwho wins, but who hits first. So she ignored the terror raging in her own\nstomach, the knee-weakening, bile-churning confusion."

Of course\nhe was the next fastest to move. Even he hadn’t expected this.\n“Orholam invictus!” Karris shouted. Orholam the invincible, the\nunconquered.\n“Orholam invictus!” the crowd roared.\nWhat they’d seen wasn’t a monster, Karris proclaimed.\nWhat they’d seen was a monster vanquished by Orholam’s light.\nThe crowd roared as Karris had never heard before, and the crisis was\naverted.\nAnd though nothing she had done had been intended to aggrandize\nherself, she saw the truth of what Orea Pullawr had once told her: a small\nwoman standing next to a great light casts a long shadow.\nFrom that day forth, the people no longer referred to Karris as Karris\nWhite Oak or Karris Guile, and only rarely as Karris White. She wasn’t the\nnew White, or the Blackguard’s White, or Gavin Guile’s widow, or the girl\nwho had caused the False Prism’s War.\nThe people loved her.\nThey called her the Iron White.\nChapter 31\nOn the sixth day, at the fourth hour after dawn, exactly 558,032 seconds\nsince she had first touched the superviolet seed crystal, Liv rose from the\nstones of the great promontory overlooking the Everdark Gates. She had\nonce been Aliviana Danavis, daughter of General Corvan Danavis, child of\nRekton in Tyrea, discipula of the Chromeria, later rebel and Blood Robe—\nnaïf entangled in the schemes of powerful men. Who she was now, she\nwasn’t sure.\nBut she’d decided she was about to become something different.\nSomething other.\nPhyros lay dead and rotting still where she’d killed him. He’d given her\nthe option of slavery or death. Do what I want or I’ll make you regret it,\nhe’d said, as had so many men in her life.\nShe’d been attracted to him, before he’d betrayed her. Now she felt\nnothing. The insistent wind here on the mountain blew away all his stench,\nand she had neither time nor strength to bury him or even drag him away.\nNot while she had to think.\nThe superviolet that people thought so cold and brutally rational was to\nher a warm blanket. Not least literally. She was here to think and not to\nmove until she decided which way of moving would be most efficient and\nwhich objectives would in turn attain at least a plurality of her desires, but\nshe was still embodied. A woman could freeze to death up here in the cold\nwind, even on a summer night.

She’d lost a fair amount of weight, and\nshe’d now reached the end of the provisions she and Phyros had brought.\nBut she hadn’t been wasting her time. The Color Prince had wanted her\nto be a god and his slave. The slave part was simple to figure out.\nThe necklace Phyros had tried to force her to wear was a fragment of\nliving black luxin, somehow controllable at a distance or imbued with will.\nAt his command or at her removal of the necklace, the stone would cut\nthrough her neck. Presumably it would also work on gods—unless it was a\nvery, very reckless bluff. She’d used a stick to put it in a bag, as if it were a\nserpent. She didn’t want it anywhere close to her until she understood it.\nThe god portion was harder to comprehend. She was, quite clearly, no\ngod.\nHolding the seed crystal helped her think more clearly, to notice when\nshe was going in circles mentally, and it let her see the superviolet light\naround her at all times without having to constrict her eyes. But that was all.\nThat wasn’t enough.\nFinally, she’d come to understand that the god portion was impossible\nfor her to comprehend in her present state. The seed crystal was incarnitive;\nto harness its full powers, she needed to integrate it with her body.\nTo do that, she had to break the halo.\nHer gut twisted again at the very thought. Growing up, she’d always\nthought breaking the halo was pretty much the same as dying. The two were\nalways inextricable. Breaking the halo on purpose was tantamount to\nsuicide.\nDespite all she’d learned of the Chromeria’s lies, those were still her\nfoundational truths, ruts in the streets of her mind. To be fair, even in the\nColor Prince’s camp, it was known to be very, very dangerous. Even the\nColor Prince had had to put down some drafters who attempted too much\ntoo soon.\nNot that she herself was so far from breaking the halo anyway. A few\nmore battles, or a couple of years without them. She’d used superviolet\nwantonly in her time with Zymun. It had stilled her terror, given her poise,\nand she had relied on it utterly.\nHad relied on it from her own weakness, truth be told.\nHer own weakness was the enemy now, and the only way to overcome\nthat was to become a goddess.\nThe Danavis motto was Fealty to One. Her father had lived by that, at\nleast for a while, and it had done him no good. Her uncles and grandparents\nbefore him had served some fool lord and lost everything. Fealty to One?\nMore like Fealty to None. There is only one to whom I will have fealty:\nmyself.\nSo she would become a goddess—for herself, not for them. The\nChromeria said that the sin associated with superviolet was pride. This\nwasn’t pride. This was power, and Liv chose power now with all her heart,\nmind, soul, and strength.\nWith the superviolet seed crystal in one hand, she streamed great gulps\nof alien, logical light and let it suffuse her body.

She became a waterfall, a\ncataract of the invisible and barely visible purplish light.\nShe felt her body reach its boundary. No one had talked to her about\nthis. Wasn’t that strange? When the price for stepping too far was death,\nthat no one in the Chromeria explained exactly how you could tell when\nyou’d reached the edge of the precipice?\nNo, those fearmongers were ignorant. More worried about paying\nhomage to their sky puppeteer than about paltry matters of life and death for\nhundreds of drafters every year.\nTo hell with them.\nShe would have said it was like giving birth—reaching a crisis and then\npushing through—except she had never given birth and never would. There\nwas a sense of building energy, building resistance, of moving with\nagonizing slowness suddenly, like what athletes called hitting the wall—\nAnd then.\nParts of her mind seemed to blow apart. She felt or heard something in\nher, and it felt as if her eyes were bleeding.\nIt was like when she’d first tried ratweed and smoked far, far too much\nto impress some so-called friends. First was the sense of having done\nsomething really, truly wrong to her body. Then came a rush of euphoria so\nstrong it threatened to carry her away. This felt like the way a deep draft of\nbrandy on an empty stomach set fire to your body, except this started from\nher head and rushed through her limbs, her eyes hot and cold, the drafting\nscars on her hands freezing, every pathway through her blood alive and\ntingling like a first kiss.\nShe gulped deep breaths and tamped the corners of her hot eyes.\nFor a long time, she didn’t dare move. Didn’t dare look to see if her\nhands had come away from her eyes bloodied or worse. She knew that\nwhen she started, everything would be different.\nNon serviam, she thought. I shall not serve.\nNor would she have to. She felt connected now, not a part of a greater\nwhole, but the mistress of it. A spider feeling vibrations in her web. And one\nsuch vibration was before her. A magical creature of some sort? Bound to\nher?\nShe couldn’t yet decipher all that her new feelings were telling her. It\nwas like stretching a new pair of arms, opening a new pair of eyes,\nsuddenly standing three times as tall and having to learn to run again. She\nopened her eyes slowly, feeling the qualities of the light streaming over her.\nShe looked first at her hand. It was unbloodied. Whatever had changed\nher hadn’t injured her. Then she saw him.\nHands clasped behind his back, a tiny man who came no higher than her\nchin stood before her. He had golden-etched skin that sparkled in the cold\nsun.\n“Who are you?” she asked.\n“Your humble slave, Mistress. How do you wish me to address you in\nyour magnificence?”\nBut she ignored the question. “I have duties for you,” Liv said.\n“Of course, Mistress.”\nChapter 32\nNot many archers were brazen enough to try a head shot on a sentry.

Too\nmany bones, too many angles that could deflect even a perfectly aimed\narrow. A man could turn his head fractionally even in the time it took an\narrow to fly. Most archers thought such a shot was foolish. Especially on a\nsentry wearing a helmet. Especially in the gathering dark of an evening.\nBut Winsen was different. Danger was an abstraction too alien for him\nto grasp. Sometimes it seemed he couldn’t even conceive of the possibility\nof his failing, much less the consequences of such a failure.\nHe had disappeared into the brush minutes ago, saying he’d take care of\nthe sentry. Kip could see where Winsen had to be, but with their camouflage\nin the dim woods, he couldn’t make him out at all.\nThe sentry was walking the deck of a light-hulled scout boat, which had\nbeen drawn up on the bank about fifty paces downstream from where two\nhuge barges floated in the river, tied to the bank with many ropes, with\ningenious walkways spiderwebbed out to them for loading grain.\nGiven how low the barges were sitting in the water, this was not the\nforaging party’s first stop; they were laden with some cargo already. If they\nwere sunk, it would be a more significant blow against the Color Prince\nthan Kip had originally thought.\nKip was hiding behind a mossy stone with Big Leo and Ferkudi. The air\nfelt humid and full. Cruxer had left to climb the ridge that separated this\nfork of the river from the waterfall and the village of Deora Neamh.\nCruxer crept back now, putting his back to the broad trunk of a pine tree.\n“Things aren’t quite going according to plan,” Cruxer told Kip. “Conn\nArthur seized the warehouse rather than attacking and falling back. Must\nhave been a weaker defense there than we expected. He set fire to two\nbarges identical to these at their docks. Saw three other barges burnt out,\ndifferent design, though, so the town already had burnt their own. White\nKing’s people brought barges with them.”\nWorse luck for them, now that the Conn Arthur had burnt them, but it\nalso meant this foraging party was larger than Kip had hoped.\n“Reinforcements?” Kip asked.\n“I saw maybe two hundred soldiers from up here headed down the trail.\nThey should be close enough to the waterfall by now that it will mask\nwhatever noise we make. But if they look back, they’ll be able to see any\nsmoke until they get to the base of the falls. Their main camp is farther\ndown in the valley, not up here. They have probably another two hundred\nsoldiers and only Orholam knows how many wights and drafters down\nthere. I don’t know if Conn Arthur has any idea how many people he’ll\nsoon be facing.”\n“He’s got his orders. We have to trust him to figure it out.” Besides, Kip\nwas the only superviolet drafter they had up here, and there was no time for\nhim to climb the ridge and signal.\nCruxer made the sign of the seven and muttered a quick prayer. Kip\nmimicked him. They’d need all the help they could get."

They’d need all the help they could get.\nThen Kip turned and peeked over the rock just in time to see a sentry’s\nhelmet fly into the air—off the head of a sentry Kip hadn’t even seen.\nBefore that helmet even landed, the other sentry dropped instantly, an arrow\nangled through the back of his neck up through his forehead.\nWinsen popped up from the ground—he’d been lying on his back to get\nthe right angle for the two shots, and he’d crawled into the very shadow of\nthe scout boat to do it.\nKip and the Mighty leapt over their mossy boulder and bolted toward\nthe boats. Before they even reached the scout boat, Winsen had scrambled\naboard with the dexterity of an acrobat. A third sentry, who had been seated\nbelow, rose to see why his comrades had disappeared, only to find Winsen’s\nknife rammed into his kidney and a hand over his mouth.\nLetting go of his knife for one moment while he still held the dying man\ntight against himself with his left hand, Winsen waved them on—no other\nopposition here—so they ran directly to where the barges were moored.\nA campfire was being lit not far from the planks leading to the barge,\nand half a dozen men were standing around or helping clean up camp, or\ncleaning muskets or repairing armor or preparing food.\nThey didn’t see the Mighty zigzagging toward them, breaking the sight\nline with what trees they could, but mostly closing the distance as quickly\nas possible. Cruxer easily outpaced the rest of them until he stopped\nsuddenly, tossing a small ball the size of his fist in a high arc. It landed just\nbeyond the fire with a sound like shattering glass as the blue luxin Kip had\ndrafted broke open. The men at the fire turned instinctively to see what it\nwas—and the flashbomb’s yellow luxin exploded into brilliant, blinding\nlight.\nKip was looking at the Mighty when the flashbomb geysered its light,\nand the light etched every one of them in his memory. Long-legged, supple\nCruxer was hurdling a fallen tree with the grace and ease of a stag while\ncarrying a long slender spear. Big Leo ran with all the stealth of an\navalanche, and just as much frightening speed. The man managed to sprint\nwhile carrying a tower shield, and his short black beard was split by his\nferocious, eager smile. Big, dopey Ferkudi sprinted with each hand\nstreaming luxin like smoke, green in his left, blue in his right. It was usually\na sign of poor drafting—all that luxin lost—but it was scary as hell.\nFerkudi’s face showed an expression closest to regret. Ferk wasn’t a born\nkiller.\nOr maybe it just pained him to be thinking so hard.\nAt twenty paces out, Kip threw his hands forward and hurled all his\nweight into shooting two brightwater missiles. He’d taken what he could\ndraft competently and brought it together. Namely, he could now make solid\nyellow into unbreakable blades, and he could shoot the Great Big Green"

Namely, he could now make solid\nyellow into unbreakable blades, and he could shoot the Great Big Green\nBouncy Balls of Doom, which were good for knocking people over, but not\nmuch else. On the other hand, throwing an orb of yellow blades or a ball of\nyellow spikes was pretty much impossible without cutting yourself to\npieces. So he encased yellow blades in a green ball and shot that from his\nright hand, and yellow spikes inside a green ball and shot that from his left.\nThey worked differently. The orb of spikes caught a man in the armpit as\nhe staggered, covering his blinded eyes. The green luxin bent and then\nbroke apart, and the spikes stuck into him, caving in his ribs and sticking.\nThe orb of blades hit another man in the face, the green luxin flexing in, a\nblade slashing a cheek, and then it bounced off him, caroming into the neck\nof another man, and then off into the woods.\nThe transference of momentum had brought Kip to a halt, so as he\nprepared his next attack, the Mighty thundered past him.\nCruxer went for two men on the periphery who hadn’t been blinded.\nOne was a blue wight, just beginning his transformation, who still had the\nface of a man but wore no tunic, his chest a rippling crystalline wonder\nbetter than skin, impervious to the elements.\nBut not impervious to steel.\nCruxer buried the spear through the wight’s chest and spun, instantly,\nsnapping off his dual-bladed spear at its blue luxin haft on purpose, like a\nbee leaving its stinger in its victim. The other leaf-blade of Cruxer’s spear\nslashed through a green wight’s arm and into his chest and out again, so\nlight and thin and fast it barely slowed. The spear spun up into a javeliner’s\nhold, flinging blood in a circle, and then Cruxer hurled it into the back of a\nman rushing for the camp’s cone-stack of muskets.\nAn arrow pierced the same man before he even hit the ground, and Kip\nsaw that Winsen had taken up an overwatch position behind them with his\nbow. Fifty or sixty paces was an easy shot for the little archer, and he was\npicking off anyone who seemed like they might be getting away or about to\nraise an alarm.\nBefore Kip, newly rearmed, could make it to the campfire to join\nFerkudi and Big Leo, the battle here was suddenly over. There was a splash\nfrom one of the barges and a yelp from the other.\nA man had fallen into the water at the nearest barge, and on the other, a\nsoldier was staring at Winsen’s arrow buried in his thigh. Another arrow\nstreaked through the air above him as he stooped to look at the curious\nmarvel. But Winsen’s next arrow dove through his stomach.\nBless Winsen, his distance had helped him not get the tunnel vision Kip\nhad.\nBut Ferkudi had never paused. Running across the web of planking and\nlines, Ferkudi got to the arrow-pierced man just after he fell out of sight\nbehind a low gunwale."

There\nwas nothing young or dopey in Ferkudi’s expression now. Two images were\nsuperimposed on his face. In rapid succession, it flickered between a scary,\nblooded warrior, the veteran he would be; and a big child, covered in wet\nmortality and scared of what he had done. That young Ferkudi looked like a\nchild caught stealing candy, his face saying this is wrong, and I’ve done it,\nand I’ve been caught doing it, and nothing can fix this.\nBut it wasn’t filched candy, it was the crushed skull of a man, and being\ncaught red-handed here was literal. Ferkudi closed his mouth as he looked\nat them, and his pink tongue darted out to clear his mouth, and then he\nblanched as he realized he was clearing his mouth of another man’s blood.\n“Tsst!” Kip hissed, waving.\nIt saved Ferkudi. He shook himself and got control. He looked around,\nsignaled—no one else was standing on the decks of either barge.\n“Perimeter,” Kip told Winsen, as all of them refilled themselves with\nluxins. “But finish any wounded first. I can’t believe we got this lucky.\nThere may be more.” He nodded to Big Leo, who was the other sub-red/red\ndrafter. “You take the far barge with Ferk. I’ll get the near one.” To Cruxer,\nhe said, “You collect Winsen’s arrows and our weapons as well as you can,\nI want this to be a clean raid, no hints. As soon as the White King knows\nwho he’s fighting, we lose an advantage. Then you come help me.”\n“That puts you alone on that barge,” Cruxer said. He had already\ncollected the point that had snapped off his spear. Drafting blue luxin even\nas he spoke, he locked it back into place with a twist. “We agreed that you\nwould have an—”\n“Then collect our weapons quick,” Kip said. “No time.”\nKip ran out down the walkways. He heard the distant rattle of muskets\nas another engagement started down in the valley. Good. He made it to the\nbarge with no trouble. Everything seemed to be going perfectly. Maybe they\nhad plenty of time. Maybe he should wait for Cruxer.\nThe Mighty was too small. They simply didn’t have enough bodies to do\na raid like this. They were getting lucky here. More people meant more\nnoise, more trouble with communication, more problems, but it also meant\nsomeone to watch your back.\nHell with it. You worked with what you had.

They were taught that the only way to regain initiative,\nhaving lost it to the enemy, was to attack. Immediately. Ferociously. This\nmeant you didn’t give yourself time to regroup or time to think—but you\ndidn’t give it to the enemy, either. They didn’t get a chance to enact phase\ntwo of their plan, because they were suddenly busy getting killed.\nAnd Kip’s training took. He charged the young woman just as she had\nturned her back and was trying to light another fuse. He chopped across her\narms as she reached out, but given his dazed state, cut deeply across only\none forearm.\nIt was enough to make her drop the linstock. She turned, baffled that he\nwas still alive, bleeding, and tried to draw the pistol tucked into her sash.\nHe rammed his yellow luxin sword through her belly, but immediately\ndropped it to grab her pistol as it cleared her sash.\nHe trapped it in his left hand and wrenched it aside. She wasn’t strong\nenough to stop him. And with her left arm wounded, she didn’t have a\nchance to stop his right uppercut to her jaw.\nShe fell to the ground, insensate, doing little more than groaning as she\nfell on the hilt of Kip’s yellow luxin sword, driving it deeper into her gut.\nKip rolled her over and pulled his sword free. No small amount of blood\nfollowed it. The woman couldn’t have been more than twenty years old, if\nthat. Atashian dark hair and eyes, poor clothes. Just a girl taking orders.\nHe should have felt something. She was unconscious, bleeding, certain\nto die slowly if not quickly. But he only heard Trainer Fisk’s voice: ‘Never\ntrust the dead. Men will faint from fear at the first charge and lie at your\nfeet, but find their courage again when you show them your back. The\nmortally wounded will rise to play hero one last time. You can’t always\npause to make sure a dying man’s incapacitated, but when you can, you\ndamn well better!’\nAfter Kip’s sword came free of her body, he slapped it back into the side\nof her neck with all the emotion he’d summon to sink a hatchet into a stump\nafter he was finished cutting firewood.\nSatisfied from the sword’s recoil in his hand that he had cut deep\nenough, he didn’t even look down; he was already peering deeper into the\ngloom of the barge’s hold.\nHe followed the fuse the young soldier had been trying to light. It went\nto a charge against the hull, and then another, and another.\nWhat the—?\nA boom shook the ship. Not an explosion here, but on the other barge.\nDammit!

But what cargo?\nKip had been flickering his vision between sub-red and normal vision to\npierce the darkness for any violent moves toward him, but now he held up a\ngreen orb, drafted to shimmer back to light.\nDespite the darkness, all the slaves wore blindfolds.\nKip ran back to the dead girl in her spreading pool of blood, and found a\nkey around her neck. He ran to a tall man on the first bench, his pale Blood\nForester arms permanently stained blue and green and yellow with luxin.\nKip pulled off his blindfold.\n“Who are you?” Kip demanded. He pointedly didn’t unlock the man’s\nmanacles.\n“I’m Derwyn. I’m Aleph of the Cwn y Wawr,” the man said quietly.\n“Repaid for our faithlessness here.”\n“What faithlessness? Quick!” The Cwn y Wawr, the Dogs of Dawn,\nwere Blood Forest’s hidden society of warrior-drafters.\nThe man’s stony sorrow said that he knew he was speaking his own\ndeath and he didn’t care. “We saw no path to victory, so to save our villages\nand families we tried to make a separate peace with the White King. He\nambushed us instead. Captured us. We’re being taken to him. We either give\nhim our fealty or he takes our eyes.”\n“Same on the next barge?” Kip asked.\n“Yes. There’s—there were two hundred thirty of us.”\n“You fucking traitors!” Kip exclaimed. He paused for only one moment\nmore. He couldn’t tarry here; his friends might be dying outside at the other\nbarge even now. He said, “Meet me at Fechín Island if you want to find\nyour honor again. Otherwise, fuck off and at least don’t fight for him.” He\nslammed the key against the man’s chest. “Scuttle the barge when you\nleave.”\nNo wonder the Blood Robes had set charges. A resource like two\nhundred thirty neutral warrior-drafters wasn’t to be scoffed at—and it\ncertainly wasn’t something you wanted to fall into the hands of your\nenemies.\nKip ran onto the deck in time to see the other barge list to one side, great\ngaping holes in the hull from the charges. Ferkudi and Big Leo were on the\nshore, bloodied. Kip couldn’t tell how badly they were injured. But there"

That barge was going down with more than a\nhundred semi-innocent men chained belowdecks.\nCruxer was shouting at Kip, telling him that the bridges connecting\nshore and ship were about to collapse—that it was too dangerous, too late.\nHe was right. Those men were going to die because of their own choices.\nTheir own cowardice had led them to their chains. It made no sense for Kip\nto risk himself and everything he could accomplish to try a hopeless rescue.\nA man who can’t swim shouldn’t attempt to save the drowning.\nBut Kip surged forward anyway and ran for the widening gap between\nthe sinking barge and the sloping planks.\nAh fuck me, he thought as the gap yawned wide. Why do I have to be so\ndumb?\nAnd then he leapt.\nChapter 33\nThe seal sat in his reflection at the height of his forehead. Before he got too\nexhausted to be amused, it amused him to be scratching out the dead man’s\nthird eye, or his own.\nIt took two sweaty desperate days of cramping hands and blood to hit\nthe seal.\nHe barely felt the nub when he finally reached it; his dogtooth skipped\nacross the uneven knot of luxin like a stone across water for only a few\nstrokes, and before he could stop, the seal broke suddenly.\nA section of the prison wall as wide as his own spread arms simply\ndisintegrated into chalky blue dust.\nFreedom whispered then, but she said, ‘I’m too far away. You’ll never\nsee me.’\n“It’s impossible,” the dead man said. “You built these prisons too well.\nYou’ll never get out.”\nThe sand was draining through the glass now that Gavin had broken the\ncell. If he’d been more aware of the seal, he would have slept, waited,\ngathered his strength before he broke through. As it was, there was no time.\nA small alarum was rigged to ring in the chambers above if the cell’s seal\nbroke.\nGavin hadn’t remade the alarum for this cell since his brother escaped,\nbut he couldn’t be sure that Andross hadn’t found it, hadn’t repaired it,\nhadn’t heard it. There was no way to tell what time of day it was, so there\nwas no way to guess when he could trigger the alarm without Andross’s\nbeing in his room to hear it. If a slave heard it while Andross was out, she\nlikely wouldn’t know what it was. Gavin couldn’t imagine his father’s\ntrusting anyone as much as he had trusted Marissia. Maybe his father\ntrusted Grinwoody that much.\nNo. Not even him.\nBut it didn’t matter. Gavin was committed.\nThe cell filled the entire space Gavin had carved out of the Chromeria’s\nrocky heart here. He had burnt through lux torch after lux torch for the light\nnecessary. Here there was only a small area to stand in, and then a single\ntunnel so low it was necessary to crawl through. A fortune’s worth of\nhellstone was mortared into the floor and the walls."

A fortune’s worth of\nhellstone was mortared into the floor and the walls.\nHis father, of course, had simply been able to take the vertical shaft\ndown to the blue cell. Unfortunately, the cell itself lifted into a new place,\nand the only way to trigger the controls to lift it was from above. There was\nno way for Gavin to reach the ceiling of his blue cell—much less break\nthrough it—to try to escape that way.\nHe had to go through his own tunnels and cells.\nIt seemed Andross hadn’t altered the tunnel from Gavin’s original\ndesign. It curved one way into darkness, and then would swoop back so that\nno blue light could leak through. If Gavin could still draft, the hellstone\nwould have been a huge problem: it would drain any blue luxin from him\nbefore he got to the next cell.\nA moot point now, but the razor-sharp hellstone would still shred skin\nand bone if he fell against it.\nBut he remembered the path: crawl like a bear here on hands and feet,\nrest a knee here, hand there, crawl again over to here. A singular way that\nhad to be recalled from memory once he made it past the first bend and he\nwas fully in darkness. He rested on a knee after the second bend and\nreached up. It took him several minutes to find the depression overhead, and\nthere, recessed, was another piece of hellstone, loose in its mortar’s grip.\nGavin pulled it free and tucked it in his mouth. It was no larger than a\ndogtooth, small enough to be missed. Small enough to be swallowed if\nnecessary, and maybe still not kill him coming out the other side. Gavin\ncontinued on.\nThe trapdoor was still where he remembered it.\nHis heart sank. Apparently Andross had found this tunnel, because the\ntrapdoor had been repaired. The latch was designed to break under the\npressure of a person’s weight. He’d wanted to be sure that his brother fell\nin, instead of triggering it and staying in the tunnel—which was a dead end\nanyway. But since the real Gavin fell in, it had been reset.\nGavin felt nauseated. He’d expected it, of course. His father wasn’t\nstupid, and he would have searched thoroughly, but Gavin had hoped\nagainst reason that his father wouldn’t find the other cells. If Andross had\nfound the other cells, then he’d found his eldest son’s rotting body.\nDear Orholam, forgive me.\nGavin put his full weight on the trapdoor and tumbled down into the\ngreen cell.\nHe stood to find that it, too, had been repaired. His brother had blown a\nhole in one wall, but there was no sign of that now, just perfect, slightly\nundulating, woody green luxin. Gray to Gavin’s eye.\nHe stood, slightly wobbly despite that he’d expected the fall. He was not\nwell.\n“Long time no see, Guile,” the dead man said. He looked somehow\ndifferent in the green wall. A worse reflection, of course, but some trick of\nGavin’s memory made even his voice different, as if, in a green wall, the\ndead man must have green characteristics. His voice husky, something wild\nin his leer."

He walked to the wall,\nand pulled out the hellstone shard he’d taken from the tunnel.\n“But time is different for us here.”\n“Uh-huh,” Gavin said.\n“Why don’t we talk about this?” the green dead man said. Was there an\nedge of fear in that voice?\n“I think we’ve talked quite enough,” Gavin said, and he set the hellstone\nagainst the dead man’s third eye and began scratching the wall.\n“You need your strength. Why don’t you draft some green?” the dead\nman said.\n“Funny,” Gavin said. He was certain now about the dead man’s moving\nindependently: the green reflection didn’t even bother to try to match his\nmovements precisely. He spoke, and his mouth moved when Gavin knew\nhis own wasn’t moving.\nPart of the traps he’d laid for his brother had been dependent on his\ndrafting. He’d thought the lure of drafting green would be too powerful for\nhis brother to resist, and thus he would act wildly. Trapped like an animal,\nhe would bite the bars of his cage, but never be able to gather the wits to do\nit mechanically. He had, unfortunately, underestimated how long the\noriginal Gavin would spend in blue, and how the blue would change him,\nmake him more rational and cool despite his baseline hot temper and\nrebelliousness.\nThis green cell had held his brother only for a few days.\n“So you’ve been lonely, huh?” Gavin asked, still scratching, scratching,\nscratching.\n“You’ll never get out,” the dead man said.\n“You really think I’d spend a year building a prison and never once stop\nto think how I’d get out if I were ever trapped in it myself?”\nOf course that was only half-true. He’d planned how to escape—that\nwas why he’d placed the hellstone chip for himself. But he’d not planned\nhow to get out without drafting.\nThe hellstone would get him out of green. Yellow… yellow was another\nquestion.\n“How much did Mot tell you?” the dead man asked.\n“Mot?” Gavin’s only interaction with the god had been when he’d sunk\nthe blue bane and run his skimmer over all the god’s foul wights, turning\nthe water red. “Not much. I never bothered to chat with him.”\nThe dead man looked at him for a long while quizzically, then burst out\nlaughing.\n“We don’t remember much at all, do we?” the dead man said. “How\nmany times did you—I mean I—use black luxin anyway? Do I remember?\nBecause once shouldn’t have done this much to… me.”\nOf course, Gavin was in green. Of course the dead man would try\nmadness here. Try to make Gavin think he was already mad, that he\nremembered things that weren’t true and didn’t remember things that were.\nOf course green would try to make Gavin wild and fearful and\nuncontrollable.\nWhen Dazen had made this prison, he must have figured that his brother\nwould be particularly susceptible to the wildness of green.

It was always dangerous, he knew that.\nUtterly forbidden for a lot of good reasons that Gavin had naturally decided\ndidn’t apply to him.\nHe’d been talking to the dead man here as if he were the same dead man\nin the blue cell. As if he were still Gavin, mocking himself.\nThe dead man was still a reflection of himself, of course, but Gavin\nsuddenly understood something about his own design. He hadn’t cast his\nwill into the prison as a whole—there was magic-killing hellstone\neverywhere down here. If he’d made the prison a seamless whole, a failure\nof part of it would be a failure of all of it.\nSo instead he’d imbued a bit of his will into each cell. This dead man\nwas utterly separate from the first.\nThat was why he’d made this dead man ask what the last one had asked\nGavin. He would have wanted to know how to torment his brother more\nsuccessfully. There were two facts he could glean from this: this dead man\ndidn’t remember anything he’d told the last one, and, more importantly, this\none might know things the last one hadn’t.\nDazen had made the blue cell in a month. He’d poured everything into\nthat, and he’d known that his brother was there and not making any\nprogress in getting out for a long while. But Dazen had taken much longer\ncreating the other cells, which meant he’d also crafted them later, when he\nknew more and different things.\nSo what did this bit of his will-cast self, this shadowy mirror of himself,\nknow that Gavin himself had forgotten?\nIt was almost worth exploring.\nTalk to a version of his old self that his old self had crafted purely to\ndrive a prisoner insane?\nWas he smarter back then, when he’d been cool and collected and\nhealthy and patient, or was he smarter now, with all his experience and the\nwisdom of years?\nHe thought about it as he scratched at the wall. Here there would be no\nluxin seal that he could so easily find. He’d intended his brother to waste a\nlot of time—years, even—looking for that seal. He hadn’t crafted this cell\nthat way. All the seals here were on the outside.\nHis brother had been ingenious and far more disciplined than Dazen had\nexpected. Carrying with him the blue bread from the first cell—and thus\ndefeating the hellstone draining out his blue luxin? That was brilliant,\nGavin. And drafting a tiny bit of the spectral bleed blue put off under green\nlight so he could draft in here?\nAmazing, brother.\nGavin had thought his elder brother would have been terribly frustrated\nin here.\nBut that real Gavin had escaped because he could draft and he’d had a\nsource and he’d had indomitable will.\nDazen had only the last.\nAfter many hours, his hand started cramping too much for him to keep\ngoing.\nThe next day he continued.

Perhaps that was\nhis wisdom, knowing that he couldn’t take much more, knowing that he was\nfragile.\nOn the third day—or after the second sleep, whichever—he’d broken\nthrough the green cell wall.\nThen he followed the natural grain of the woody luxin a distance\nsomewhat less than the span of his broad shoulders, and began again.\nFour days later, he cut through again.\nFive days later, he cut through one more time.\nAnd the last side of his escape box, with the wall weakened, he cut\nthrough in three days.\nBefore he’d left the blue cell, he’d gorged himself on all the bread he’d\naccumulated, but he hadn’t managed to bring much along with him to this\ncell. In the last twelve days of the fifteen he’d been here, he’d eaten\nnothing.\nThat was good in only one way: it meant Andross Guile hadn’t noticed\nGavin had escaped his first cell. Water flowed through each of the cells, so\nhe hadn’t died of thirst. It was, of course, terrible because it meant he hadn’t\neaten in twelve days.\nHis brother had done better.\nGavin spent hours etching lines between his holes to weaken the wall.\nAfter many kicks that threatened to break him before he broke the wall, the\npanel finally gave way.\nIt wasn’t large, but by wriggling his broad shoulders through the\nhypotenuse of that partial rectangle, he made it through and dropped into a\ndim gray-lit circular chamber.\nThe wall his brother had broken through had been repaired.\nWhat had his father been thinking? Why go to so much effort and not set\nup alarums to notify him if Gavin escaped? Andross couldn’t even draft\ngreen himself, which meant immense trouble in bringing a trusted green\nhere. But then, Andross had certainly cultivated total blind loyalty among\nenough monochromes to do his dirty work when necessary.\nUnless Andross knew, and was cruelly just watching every step?\nNo, that was paranoia. Andross had seen the broken pieces of this prison\nand had it repaired. He would do that first because he was cautious, just in\ncase.\nLater, when he had time, Andross would try to figure out every piece of\nGavin’s creation. But he would be busy in the interim, and he was an old,\nfeeble man, after all, wasn’t he?\nHow had he seemed so powerful and young when he’d come down to\nsee Gavin?\nIt was surely only a façade of youth.\nNo matter. Gavin had to get as far as quickly as he could. The green\nprison had cost him too much time already.\nHe searched the underside of the outer wall of the green orb that had just\nbeen his prison. Near the base, a section yielded.\nA hidden lever popped out of the granite wall.\nIt took him several minutes of gathering his starvation-sapped strength\nto pull it.\nThe secret door opened to Gavin’s old access tunnels.\nHe poked his head into the pitch-black tunnel.

That’s my own\nsardonic sanity speaking.\nGoddammit, Karris, I miss you. I need you.\nGavin blew out a breath. Then, still outside the entrance to the tunnel,\nGavin reached an arm in and found the yellow lux torch in its sconce. He\nhadn’t trapped that one. But Andross might have trapped it. He figured that\nhis older brother would be too paranoid to grab the first torch, and would\ngrab the second or the third. It was still there, of course.\nGavin yanked the torch from the wall and snatched it back around the\ncorner.\nNothing happened.\nHe expelled a slow breath, and examined the lux torch carefully. He\npeeled off the clay facing and was rewarded with soft yellow light. His own\nwork. He could shake the torch to increase the reactivity of the yellow and\nget brighter light, but he didn’t bother. That would make the torch burn out\nfaster.\nHe stepped into the tunnel.\nNothing.\nHe took his time working his way up through the spiraling tunnel,\nclimbing, slowly climbing, but watching every step.

It was maddening to even\nconsider it, but Gavin couldn’t hurry.\nSurely I’ve learned patience in suffering by now.\nHe approached his old work chamber slowly. It was ten paces wide and\nblessedly square after the hellish globes Gavin had been trapped in. A small\ncot came into view, then a table.\nTrap, I’m telling you, his sardonic self said. Trap.\nHe ignored the heckling, but he was careful where he aimed the light of\nhis lux torch lest he spring his own trap as the real Gavin had.\nHe moved slowly forward. He’d concealed a tiny portcullis in the\nceiling above the entrance to keep his brother from fleeing back down the\ntunnel. It was raised again, of course, reset.\nHe was so close. From this chamber, he could avoid the other cells, and\nescape. Food and wine were here.

Where was the table and the chair?\nThey’d been right there, last time.\nWhat was that sound?\nGavin quieted his own breathing, even as his heart pounded.\nWas there someone in the chamber? If so, he couldn’t fail to know that\nGavin was here, with Gavin waving the lux torch in the darkness.\nGavin was at every disadvantage. No night vision, no strength, no\nweapon, no drafting. He was paralyzed, helpless.\nBut just as he shook that off with his next breath, a light bloomed in the\nroom, full-spectrum, glorious light, almost blinding Gavin’s eye.\nGavin stabbed the lux torch into a gap to keep the portcullis from\nslamming shut behind him, and leapt into the chamber, rolling.\nIt was a pitiful effort. His emaciated muscles betrayed him and he fell\nrather than rolling to his feet.\nIn the far corner, sitting in the chair, was Andross Guile. He yawned,\nutterly relaxed, as if he’d been sleeping.\n“Son,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you.”\nChapter 34\n“Hey, beautiful,” Gav Greyling said as he came onto the training pitch\nbelow the Chromeria. “Wanna go a few rounds?

Not only could she never beat Gavin Greyling in hand-to-hand\ncombat, but she wasn’t going to wrestle him while he was being a jackass.\n“Rope spear,” she said.\nHe groaned. She practiced with a lead weight wrapped in leather rather\nthan a spear point, of course, but he still had quite a few bruises from their\nlast bout.\n“Awright,” he said. “But I’m using a sword-breaker this time.”\nWeeks had passed with no contact from the Order. Teia’s dread was only\ngrowing. Nor had Karris responded to the signals Teia had activated\nrequesting a meeting. She must be being watched very, very closely. That\ndidn’t help Teia’s anxiety.\nShe’d filled the time with work and training, both open and covert. It\nfilled the hours, but not the loneliness. Being abruptly finished with lectures\n—even if they’d been mostly inapplicable—and merely working? It was\ndiscomfiting. She felt displaced even when she trained with the Blackguard.\nShe’d thought that her goal had always been to be in the Blackguard, but\nnow she saw that everything she’d wanted here paled in comparison to what\nshe’d had in the Mighty.\nThe rope spear was turning out brilliantly for her. It looked like and\ncould be a distance weapon, which was excellent for a small woman. In\nreality, anyone who snagged the rope with a hand soon found it was also a\ngrappler’s weapon.\nSnag the rope, and you found Teia flipping another loop around your\nhand or head. Stagger back away from the entrapping loops, and you\ntightened the knot.\nThen Teia was on top of you, tripping you, throwing another loop\naround arm or leg, and then recovering the spear blade and ending you.\nThey got started amid all the other Blackguards and trainees who were\nalso practicing. This time Gav Greyling snagged the rope with his jagged\nsword-breaker—and threw it away from himself, a technique no one would\nusually try.\nHe rushed Teia, but her panicky jerk on the encumbered rope somehow\nworked, whipping the sword-breaker and spear point into Gav’s legs as he\ncharged.\nHe tried to jump over the blades as he stumbled, but Teia slid sideways\nand flipped a loop of the rope up, catching his foot. She pulled hard as he\nwas still in midair, and he crashed flat on his face.\nShe rolled onto him and jabbed the spear point lightly into his back.\nHe groaned, but didn’t curse. “Round to you,” he said, as other\nBlackguards training laughed.\nAs he lay on the ground with Teia’s elbow holding him down she said,\n“You know we can’t have a relationship, right?” Dammit, she’d said it too\nloud. Some of the others had overheard.\n“Nrg. Who said anything about a relationship?” he said, keenly aware of\nthe others.\nThey both knew how well that would go over with the commander.

If\nyou’re looking for a ride…”\n“Huh?” Gav said.\n“I can’t believe we’re related,” Gill said as the rest of them laughed.\nAfterward, though, Essel came to Teia, falling in beside her as she\ncooled down with some fighting forms. “He flirts with you because of how\nyou turn him down. You know that, right?”\n“Why would he—”\n“Because you’re safe, Teia. He would never dream of actually breaking\nhis Blackguard vows, and he knows you wouldn’t, either. So your rejections\ndon’t hurt, or not as much. It’s fun to flirt with someone you find attractive\nanyway. You’re practice for him to hone his confidence and his approaches\n—which, let’s be blunt, need practice. If you like the flirtation, fine. If you\ndon’t like it, just once, seriously, at some time when he’s not flirting with\nyou, tell him that you don’t appreciate it. He’ll stop. But don’t—don’t you\nfucking dare take him to bed. There are ways to break even that rule, if—”"

There are ways to break even that rule, if—”\n“The rule against sleeping with other Blackguards?”\n“Yes. But not with him, not for you. He’d fall in love with you head over\nheels, and that is what the rules are there to prevent. Last thing we need\nhere is tempestuous young love, and taking sides, and grand gestures, and\nburning resentments, and all that horse shit. That is what gets people\nkilled.”\n“Why is this my problem?” Teia asked. “I didn’t do anything.” She just\nwanted to be invisible when this sort of thing came up.\n“What do you want me to say, Teia? ‘You’re the woman. Can you\nimagine what kind of world it would be if we let men take the lead’?”\nTeia saw she was kidding but not kidding. “Fine. I’ll take care of it.”\n“No, listen, because you shouldn’t go do this with a chip on your\nshoulder. You know the Philosopher? His concept of the zoon politikon?”\nTeia shook her head. “I attended my mistress’s physical training, not her\ntutoring. My owners didn’t want a slave girl to think I might be an equal to\ntheir daughter.”\nEssel waved that away; it was a discussion for another time. “We’re\nsocial animals, Teia. All of us. Without a community, we can’t reach our\nproper end, our telos. We can’t become who we’re supposed to be when\nwe’re alone. Those without a community become monsters. We can get\nstuck looking for a freedom that doesn’t exist, because when you’re part of\nsomething, the weakness of others puts a burden on you. Maybe even an\nunfair burden. But you’ll put unfair burdens on your community, too. And\nlet me be blunt. You do. You’re inexperienced, you’re uneducated, you’re\ncolor-blind, you’re short, and you’re weak. So in this thing, you’re going to\nhelp Gav Greyling. Not because you’re the woman, but because you’re\nhuman. You’re a Blackguard. And our community, this precious little thing\nwe have, helps each other grow and become the best us we can be. And\nmaybe he’ll never help you back, but one of the rest of us will. Or maybe\nwe won’t, and you’ll go through life with your ledger slightly unbalanced.\nIf you’ve got complaints about things being unfair, take them to my friends\nwho died at Garriston in one fucking unlucky cannon shot.\n“It’s not fair. But so what? There was a scholar—more of a dramatist,\nreally—who said, ‘Hell is other people.’ He was right, and he was a fool.\nHeaven is other people, too.” She smiled apologetically. “Sorry. I kind of\ngave it to you right between the eyes there, didn’t I?”\nTeia said nothing, though she wasn’t offended. It felt good to be treated\nas an equal by a full Blackguard. Apparently she didn’t need to say\nanything, though, because Essel went on.\n“It’s uh, it’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot, duty. Obligation"

He was like my big brother and father\nand luxiat and the lover I could never have all wrapped up in one. Believe\nme, I spent more than a few nights with a lover with my eyes tight shut,\nimagining it was him on top of me, or under me. Mm. That sounds wrong\nbecause I started with the brother-and-father thing, doesn’t it?”\n“I, uh, knew what you meant,” Teia said.\n“I mean, he was our Prism from the time I was girl. I grew up on Gavin\nGuile. Most heroes get smaller the closer you get to them. But he’s gone.\nEven if we find him—and surely he would have surfaced by now, if he lived\n—I saw him, Teia. He was broken. Fingers cut off, eye gouged out, starved.\nHe can’t be Prism now. I don’t know if I’d want him to be, knowing what\nhe once was. And… you know, he’s married, too. That fantasy should have\ndied long ago, but it’s dead now. And I don’t think I want to be a\nBlackguard for this new Prism. You’ve heard the rumors.”\n“Um, no?” Ah shit. Apparently being in her own world so much had\nsome real drawbacks in the gossip circle.\n“That’s right, you’ve mostly pulled duty with the White. Well, by order\nof the commander, none of the Archers are allowed to attend Zymun alone.”\nShe tented her eyebrows at Teia, lips pursed as if it was a significant look.\nExcept Teia had no idea what it signified. “Huh? Why?”\nEssel sighed. “He gets grabby. Won’t take no for an answer. Samite\nnearly punched him in the face.”\n“He laid hands on Samite?” The stocky, one-handed trainer didn’t\nexactly seem like his type.\n“Oh hell no. Gloriana. From the cohort behind yours.”\n“Oh, sure, I was there at her swearing in.” It was odd to Teia to already\nnot be the newest, but they were inducting new Blackguards as fast as they\ncould.\n“If it weren’t wartime, we’d already have had a number of the Archers\nbuy out their commissions because of him. That’s actually what I’m\nthinking of doing. Not because of him, though. Or more that he’s not Gavin.\nI’m thirty-five years old, Teia. I love the Blackguard. But maybe it’s time\nfor me. I mean, after the war anyway, right? I want to get married. Not kids,\nyou know, but a husband? The same man every night used to sound too\nboring to me. Maybe it still does. But the same man every day? That\nsounds… I dunno. Warm. Safe. Nice.”\nShe scowled ruefully.\n“But listen to me go on.

I’m proud to call\nyou sister. Thanks. I feel a lot better.”\nTeia had said approximately two words. “Right,” she said. Three.\n“Anytime.” Four.\n“And take care of the Gav thing.”\nTeia winced. “Right away.”\nChapter 35\nThe goddam cards. Kip had absorbed scores of the damned things—and not\na one was triggered by a wall of fire or a sinking ship?\nThe Cwn y Wawr on the second, sinking barge weren’t taking their\nimpending deaths passively. It was the only reason they hadn’t already died\nof smoke inhalation. They were chained, so they couldn’t reach their own\nblindfolds, but they’d torn off each other’s.\nThe initial explosion had blown holes in the barge’s hull, but through\nthose holes, enough light had poured to give a few of them a source for\nmagic. Even as Kip had leapt through the air, they’d blown the upper deck\noff the barge, leaving most of the hold open to the evening sky.\nBut there was no key. It wasn’t on the big man who’d triggered the\nexplosions, so it had probably been carried by one of the sentries now dead\nat the bottom of the river. Nor could most of the drafters actually help.\nThere was a source for sub-red and red from the fire, some oranges, and a\nbit of weak green from the trees illuminated by the fire, but the sky was too\ndark for the blues to draft more than a trickle.\nThe oranges were warding off the fire with walls of their luxin, and the\nsub-reds were redirecting the heat as well as they could, but it was a losing\neffort. The barge was on fire in every place not in their direct lines of sight\n—and it was sinking.\nThe main lock holding the chains to the deck was already submerged. It\nwas one thing to try to pick a lock with luxin when you could see it, but\nholding your breath, trying to feel the lock through foul water and keep\ndrafting long enough to work the tumblers of a well-made, huge lock?\nKip had already failed thrice.\nHe surfaced with a gasp.\nTwo rows of men chained closest to the lock had already been pulled\nbeneath the water and fought no longer. A third row were still holding their\nbreath, eyes squeezed tight shut or rolling with terror. The men of the fourth\nrow were submerged to their throats. They tilted their chins up, sucking air,\nno longer screaming.\nOne drafter, three rows back, had drafted a large cone around his own\nneck. He was shouting at the others telling them to do the same, but\nbetween the cone muffling his voice and everyone else screaming, no one\nnoticed. Except Kip.\nThe cone would buy the man time when he was pulled under the waves.\nUntil the water reached above the top of his cone, he could still breathe."

Except Kip.\nThe cone would buy the man time when he was pulled under the waves.\nUntil the water reached above the top of his cone, he could still breathe.\nAlmost every one of the men chained here could have done the same, but\nthey hadn’t thought of it.\nKip could do it for them.\nBut that was a distraction, wasn’t it? He could save ten or twenty men so\nthey could have another minute or three of life—but only if he abandoned\nthe main problem: the damned sinking barge.\nIf ten more men had to die while he solved the problem, that was the\nprice he had to pay.\nWell, that they had to pay.\nCome on! Not one of the damned cards was going to help him?\n“Breaker!” Cruxer shouted from above, standing on a nonburning\nremnant of the upper deck. “Not much time!”\nSo he’d caught up. Kip looked at him and saw Cruxer had a coil of rope\nin his hand. The other end stretched out beyond him toward the shore.\nImmediately, dozens of voices cried out for him to save them. As if he\nweren’t trying. As if he could.\nKip looked through the water. It was up to his neck, too. The next row\nwent under.\nHe couldn’t save them.\nHe nodded his failure to Cruxer. He had to leave. They couldn’t be\nsaved.\nCruxer threw the rope toward Kip, but immediately dozens of hands\nreached up to catch it.\nA man grabbed it and tore the ends away from his neighbors. “Save me!\nFor the love of Orholam, please!”\nKip waded up the main aisle between the rowers’ benches, feeling a\npanic build in him. He was going to be trapped here. He not only wasn’t\ngoing to save them, he was going to die himself.\nBubbles came up in the water as a submerged man despaired of holding\nhis breath any longer.\n“Breaker!” Cruxer shouted. “I believe!”\nCruxer cracked open a mag torch, and it flared shocking green.\nKip couldn’t leave them. He had to do this. He was the only one who\ncould.\nHe made it to the man holding the rope. “Give me the rope. I can save\nyou.”\nBut the man was fear-frozen, desperate, beyond reason.\nKip clobbered him and took the rope. He pushed back into the deeper\nwater, took several deep breaths, and pushed under water.\nHe found the lock again. But the lock didn’t matter. The chain was too\nstrong to break. But the chain was just a bond, and a bond wasn’t evil. A\nchain could be a lifeline. What mattered was what you were bound to.\nBy touch in the cool, murky water, Kip found the enormous metal loop\nthat bolted the chain to the deck. He wound green luxin thick around the\nchain, pushing his will into that space until the green luxin filled it.\nHe called to mind then that boy he had been so long ago, trapped in that\ncloset with the rats, biting, scratching. It came back all too readily. But he\npushed past the remembered terror—that wasn’t what he needed now—and\nthere it was: the unspeakable thirst for freedom, the longing to break\nsomething, to get out."

The bolt hadn’t broken; one of the clinch nails that had\nbeen pounded through the deck and then bent aside had been pulled\nthrough.\nKip pushed the chain beneath the freed side, and then moved up the\nsubmerged rows by feel.\nThere were identical, much smaller loops holding the chains bolted to\nthe floor at every row.\nBut Kip had the process now. Attacking the clinch nails rather than the\nbolts, almost as quickly as he could push through the water, he tore out one\nafter another with an explosion of luxin and wood and breath.\nHe surfaced again, and waded forward. The men were shouting. They\ndidn’t understand because they couldn’t feel the slack in the chains until\ntheir own loops were broken.\nFinally Kip pulled the last one free, directly beneath Cruxer. He looped\nthe rope Cruxer had given him through the chain. “Pull!” he shouted.\nAnd suddenly help arrived as the Cwn y Wawr from the first boat freed\nthemselves one at a time. First a single man helped Cruxer lift men out of\nthe hold, pulling the chain in like a fishing line, the enslaved flopping about\nlike fish.\nThen another man jumped into the hold with Kip, giving the imprisoned\nmen a foot up to climb out. And then another came to help keep the chain\nfrom getting tangled. And others arrived, pulling the dead from the water.\nThe whole line was still bound together, so if any part was dragged\nunderwater, at least half the men would be pulled down with it.\nThere was a sharp crack, and water gushed into the boat, but the men\ndidn’t feel it, even as the deck bucked beneath their feet.\nThe healthy heaved on the chain, and the chained made it to shore.\nA few exhausted minutes later, Kip and everyone else had been dragged\nonto the bank. Nine men couldn’t be revived and several others had died in\nthe initial blasts or in their own escape attempts—at least two lay facedown\non the riverbank having cut off their own arms to escape their shackles,\nonly to bleed to death in cold freedom.\nThe pale Cwn y Wawr commander, the short, gap-toothed, black-haired\nman named Derwyn Aleph, had tried to use his barge’s key on the still-\nchained men’s locks. It hadn’t worked.\nHe looked at the corpses bound to his men, and he looked to the forest,\nfrom which reinforcements might come at any time. He turned to Kip, who\nwas seated on the riverbank, barely able to move.\n“By your traditions, you can’t defile the dead, nor can you leave them\nbehind,” Tisis said. Kip had no idea when she’d arrived. “But your men\ncan’t possibly carry them through the forest with the speed you need to\nmove if you’re to escape.”"

Kip had no idea when she’d arrived. “But your men\ncan’t possibly carry them through the forest with the speed you need to\nmove if you’re to escape.”\nThe man gave a stiff nod.\n“Tell your men to look away,” she said. “Ferkudi, Big Leo, if I’m to lead\nthese people, I can’t be ritually unclean in their eyes. Cut these men free of\nthe chains, and put their bodies on our skimmer.”\nShe walked around so the commander could look at her rather than\nseeing what Ferkudi and Big Leo did. And to their credit, the Mighty did it\nquickly and without question or complaint, quickly lopping off hands and\nfeet and freeing the dead from the chains that still bound them to the living.\nTo Kip, it was a sudden synecdoche of all that warriors do: the stomach-\nturning, soul-scarring butchery that society asks for the safety and\nsqueamishness of its soft souled.\nTisis said, “We’ll lay them out on Fechín Island at the Black River\nconfluence. Burial is yours, though.”\nDerwyn looked overwhelmed with gratitude. He pointed at Kip with his\nchin. “Who is he?”\n“Does it matter?” Tisis asked.\n“Only to spread the tales,” Derwyn said. “A hero’s due.”\n“Then he is Kip Guile, leader of these Mighty, who call him Breaker.\nPerhaps he is the Luíseach, perhaps he is the Diakoptês, though he claims\nneither. He is my husband. Even were he not, he is the man I would follow\nto the ends of the earth.”\nDerwyn looked into the wood, deep in thought or merely peering for\napproaching enemies, and then turned to Kip, who sat on a stump, wrung\nout and wet, feeling anything but heroic.\nKip’s thoughts were running in the opposite direction: Wow, that was\nreally dumb. I never should have done that. Why can’t I think before I do\nanything? Cruxer’s gonna kill me.\nAs his men sat or stood or stretched or bound up each other’s wounds,\nthey all watched, and the Forester said, “These names tell me that you are a\ngreat man. I have seen great men. The chains you lifted from my wrists tell\nme that you are a strong man. I have known strong men. But you didn’t\ndive into that water to save us so that we might be your weapons. You knew\nwe’d sought a coward’s peace. Most men would leave us to the hell we\ndeserve for our faithlessness. The lives you have saved this day will testify\nunto eternity that you are a good man. A man who risks his life to save\nstrangers testifies not to their worth but to his own. I have never seen or\nknown a man to be great and strong and good as well. I will see you in three\ndays with any who will join me. I care not what others call you; if you will\nhave me, I will call you lord.”\nUnable to quite process so much kindness at once, looking for some way\nto shrug it off and make a joke, Kip glanced over to find Cruxer glowering\nsomewhere."

Ben-hadad was had already processed\nwhatever he was feeling and was back to fixing something.\nLast Kip looked at Tisis, but even she didn’t give him some humorous\nout. Her eyes shone with tears of pride. It was as if all of them were\nreflecting back a different man than Kip had ever thought he was. What if\nthe story I’ve been telling myself about who I am has been wrong?\nAnd a chunk of his self-loathing broke and faded away. Kip straightened\nhis back. “I look forward to seeing you and whoever joins you at Fechín\nIsland,” he told Derwyn Aleph. No joke. No self-deprecatory smile.\nThen, having taken all the gear and weapons and provisions they could\ncarry from the first barge, they scuttled it. And far more readily than two\nhundred men carrying a hundred paces of heavy chain should have been\nable to, the Cwn y Wawr disappeared into the forest.\nChapter 36\n“You cannot go this long without seeing me. Not ever again. Understand? I\nforbid it. Forbid!”\nKarris had given in to the temptation to abuse her powers and decided\nthat she was entitled to the services of the Blackguard’s\nphysicker/masseuse, Rhoda. She’d decided it was acceptable as long as she\ndidn’t take either of them away from their duties. Unfortunately, that meant\nthey were meeting two hours before dawn.\nThe Chromeria was home to all sorts of strong personalities from all\nover the world, and with that came idiosyncratic styles of dress and\ncosmetics use, but even here, Rhoda stood out. Of Tyrean and Parian\nlineage, she had dusky skin and wavy hair that she wore in a topknot, the\nexplosion of hair above it woven with colored beads. When outside, she\nwore a broad-brimmed petasos with a hole cut in it for her topknot. Of slim\nbuild, except for a round soft belly that made her look perpetually pregnant,\nshe wore more, and more garish, face paint than anyone Karris had ever\nseen, but no perfume—“That’s for whores,” she said—but once she put her\nhands on your muscles, nothing else mattered.\nRhoda knew Karris’s body like no one else in the world. She started\nwith a quick examination of Karris’s body—checking the mobility of that\nleft ankle she’d sprained so long ago, testing how far and how evenly her\nlimbs moved. She clucked and pulled and tweaked. She found aches Karris\nhadn’t even been aware of, and old injuries Karris barely remembered.\nThen she went to work. She was a sub-red, and her hands radiated heat\ndeep into Karris’s left shoulder, still swollen from when she’d jumped off\nthe top of the hippodrome into the Great River.

At an old hamstring injury,\nshe pulled the heat away, as well as the heat from Karris’s own body, her\nhands becoming as ice.\n“And what is this?” Rhoda asked, her elbow working on a spot low in\nKarris’s back. Karris grunted. She wasn’t required to answer. “Too much\nsitting. Feel this?”\nKarris mumbled into her cushions, “I have to hold court, you know\nthat.”\n“Iron White can talk while standing, yes? Talk standing. Also this?”\nRhoda grabbed a double handful of Karris’s hair. She always ended with the\nscalp massage. It was Karris’s favorite part, the sweetest medicine of their\ntime together. But now she tapped at Karris’s hairline with one finger.\n“Gray. And not just one or two. At your age. You always dyed your hair for\nwhimsy. Now, not fun. More sleep. Is order.”\n“Too much to do,” Karris said. “Too many decisions to make.”\nIn fact, she should be going over her lists right now. There were so many\nitems now that she had to write down the nonsecret ones.\n“This is what happens when you stay away,” Rhoda said. “You forget\nhow this works. I tell you what you doing wrong. I tell you what price you\npaying for what you doing wrong. I tell you how fix. Then you ignore me.”\n“I’m sorry, Rhoda,” Karris said. She sighed.\n“Iron White, ha! Feel like Iron-Necked White to me.”\nShe was glad to hear Rhoda tease her about it, but it had had an odd\neffect on Karris, being called the Iron White, as if she were a Name. She\nhad recoiled from it at first: I’m not that.\nBut the more she thought about it, the more she realized rejecting it was\nfoolish as a practical matter. If she were ever to check off ‘Win the war,’ she\nhad to lead. She had not the animal presence or the huge charisma of her\nhusband. She was small. It meant something, that, even if it shouldn’t. But\nsomeone small could be known for being hard and quick—not just\nphysically, but mentally, too.\nThe people she led needed her to be strong. They needed her to be\nspecial if they were to follow her against gods and monsters.\nSo she’d made a new goal:\nBecome the woman they hope I am. Become the Iron White.\nRhoda was still chattering, and Karris loved her for it nearly as much as\nfor her amazing hands. “There is no part where you argue. Understand? I\nhave fired more important patients, thank you.”\n“Of course, Rhoda, I—wait, more important than the White?”\nRhoda grumbled. She put her hands around Karris’s neck as if to wring\nit. “Do not flag-wave bull in open field!” But she was amused. “My Iron\nWhite, here is what you should do: more sleep, less exercise so you can\nhave regular moons by the time husband is back, more standing, some\nriding if you can fit it in, less wine to relax and more use of your room\nslave.”"

Karris had promoted one of Marissia’s underslaves,\nan intelligent young woman named Aspasia, to be her room slave in\nMarissia’s absence, but the woman served as chief slave and messenger, she\nslept at the foot of Karris’s bed, not in it.\nKarris knew that in the absence of their husbands, it was not uncommon\nfor women to use their female room slaves as their husbands did, for relief.\nMany nobles didn’t consider it being unfaithful for a woman to use a female\nslave that way, though they believed using a male slave or even a eunuch\nwas. But Karris had never even considered it. As a Blackguard, she hadn’t\nhad a room slave. That just had never been part of her life, except for her\nhating Marissia, who’d served so ably as Gavin’s room slave. Apparently\nexcelling in all of a room slave’s duties and more.\nDamn you, Marissia. The searches had turned up nothing. No one had\nseen her leave. The Blackguards swore she’d yelled fire, but hadn’t run past\nthem or dangled a rope down the outside of the tower. She was just… gone.\nNor had Karris found any money trail. Turgal Onesto had confirmed that\nMarissia had access to at least one account he knew of—but it hadn’t been\ntouched. Nor had anyone seen her at the markets, at the docks… anywhere.\nIt was as if the woman had evaporated.\nRegretfully, Karris gave up on it. There were too many other things to\ndo to waste more time on that one.\nFind Marissia.\nSo when do I scratch off Gavin? Every criterion that justified crossing\noff Marissia applied to him. He’d disappeared exactly the same way and on\nthe same day. The searches for him said exactly the same thing—nothing.\nNothing. Nothing.\nFind Gavin.\nShe would never take that off the list. She would die first.\nKarris paid Rhoda—insisting on it, since the woman had woken with her\nand this was in addition to her normal duties—and then threw on a robe.\nShe hadn’t even noticed her own nudity as she’d walked across her room to\ngrab the coins. She was alone here with only her physicker and the two\nBlackguards at the door.\nAfter Rhoda left, Karris said, “Baya, what’s the problem?”\n“High Lady?” he asked, pained.\n“We’ve been in the field.

        "text": "Tried not to? But now that you’re holy, I… it makes me feel—”\nShe held up a hand. She needed to remember that when the White asked\nfor total honesty, she sometimes actually got it. Some people took her\norders as a religious obligation. “Just… pretend not to notice. That’s part of\nthe work. Do better. Now get out. I’m angry with you. I’ll be going over\npapers for the next couple hours until my day begins. Adrasteia can handle\nwatching an empty room and me until then.”\nBaya Niel, who’d faced the green god with her, unflinching as death\ncame for him, practically bolted from the room.\nKarris went to her desk and sat. She gave the Blackguard hand signal:\n‘Clear?’\nTeia nodded. “Lot of work, just to get your own Blackguard to report to\nyou.”\n“It seemed you had more to say after you gave your official report. I had\nsome more questions.” Days ago, Teia had finally given her report about\nhow the Mighty had been attacked and then how they’d escaped in the\npresence of Commander Fisk, but Karris was certain there had been more to\nthe story that she’d held back. It just hadn’t been the most important thing\nto find out about in the midst of all the crises she’d had to deal with every\nday for the last couple of weeks.\nBut Teia goggled. “Are you joking?”\n“Whatever do you mean?” Karris asked.\n“I set the emergency meeting signal twice! Even though Marissia told\nme I’m never supposed to set it more than once, in case I’m being watched.\nAnd you never came!”\nKarris’s heart dropped into her stomach. “Marissia never handed over\nthe list of emergency signals before she fled. That bitch!” What else had\nKarris missed?\nTeia paled. “Orholam have mercy. What if those were in that package? I\ncould be dead already if the Order was watching. And what do you mean\nshe’s a bitch?”\n“What?” Karris asked.\nKarris and Teia had seen each other almost every day in the last weeks,\nbut to keep their relationship as handler and spy secret neither of them had\nacted out of the ordinary. It must have been killing Teia.\n“Just, just report,” Karris said. “Quickly.”\nLuckily, Teia had obviously prepared herself for this in case she needed\nto report the essentials in only a few minutes. She told about the\nLightguards’ murdering Goss, and the flight down the stairs, the flight back\nup the lifts, and out onto the roof. She backtracked briefly with “—And you\nknow that Andross Guile had the White assassinated, right? He hired my\nmaster Murder Sharp to do it. I overheard him offer the contract myself.”\nKarris hadn’t known. It was a punch in the guts. They’d had a quiet\nfuneral for Orea Pullawr, according to her wishes—everything in her life\nhad been public for decades, and she’d long demanded her parting be\nprivate. How Karris had wept, and thanked the old woman for the privacy\nso she could do so freely.\nThat soulless piece of shit, Andross. Orea had been dying anyway. Why\nhadn’t Andross Guile simply let her go?"

Why\nhadn’t Andross Guile simply let her go?\nBecause that wouldn’t be a win over his old nemesis?\nNo, because he’d stacked the deck for who would become the next\nWhite, and he’d wanted to get his grandson approved as Prism-elect, and he\nfeared that Orea Pullawr was going to stop him. By killing her before Sun\nDay, he’d gotten both—except that Orea had seen it coming.\nShe’d taken care of Karris. Prepared her.\n“You said something about a package of letters?” she asked suddenly.\n“Wait… not bound with red ribbon?”\n“On Marissia’s desk, yes,” Teia said.\nOh no.\nTeia spun out the rest of the tale to Karris’s growing horror: The\ndiscovery of the escape lines, which Orea had given Kip a hint about. The\nflight to the docks. Kip’s hasty—Andross Guile–arranged—marriage to\nTisis Malargos. Karris had known Tisis was gone, but none of her spies had\nbeen able to tell her why or where yet. The girl was supposed to be a\nhostage for Ruthgar’s good behavior. Scratch that item off the list, and not\nthe way Karris had hoped.\nTeia then told about her own decision to stay, then backtracked to tell\nhow Tremblefist had been the one to blow up the cannon tower to save the\nMighty’s ship from being sunk.\nKarris had already learned about that one from other sources, but the\nloss was still fresh. Tremblefist had died for his young charges. Sacrificed\nhimself for Kip.\nThen Teia told her about kidnapping Marissia with Murder Sharp, and\nhow the woman had tried to get the bundle of papers to Karris—and failed.\nSo Marissia wasn’t a traitor. She was a martyr.\nThe woman Karris had been denouncing as a bitch, and whore, and\ndisloyal had been doing everything in her power to be Karris’s friend and\nfaithful servant.\nDamn me.\nBut why would Andross want Marissia? This Murder Sharp hadn’t\nknown that Marissia was a spymaster. But that meant only that the Order\ndidn’t know she was a spy. Andross had instructed Sharp to take her papers.\nMaybe he knew or suspected what she was. Maybe he’d just gotten\nlucky.\nKarris had felt as if she were drowning ever since she’d taken the white\nrobe and watched a roomful of nobles prostrate themselves before her. To\nhear that someone had tried to throw her a lifeline—only to have it snatched\naway—was almost too much to bear.\nI need to kill Andross.\nExcept he was untouchable. Too valuable. Too powerful. Irreplaceable.\n“High Lady, I’m sorry to rush, but I want to make sure I tell you\neverything.”\nKarris motioned she should go on, and then Teia told her about the\nOrder’s offering to kill whomever she’d wanted killed and how she’d\ntagged and then untagged Quentin.\nAnd there we got lucky, Karris thought.\n“Have they followed up with you about that?” Karris asked. “Will they"

People\ndidn’t just disappear from the safety of the Chromeria. That was Ilyta, the\nsatrapy of traitors and pirates and cutthroats and bad men. A young girl like\nTeia shouldn’t have to be a warrior. She should be overanalyzing what\nshe’d said to some boy who might reject her because of it, not analyzing\nwhat she’d said to some cultist who might murder her because of it.\nThis is the world we’ve both been thrust into now. Sink or swim, girl.\nAnd Orholam have mercy on my soul for throwing you in the water.\nThey talked a bit more, bringing each other up to speed and updating\ntheir dead drop and emergency drop procedures. Then, finally, Karris said,\n“We’re almost out of time. Any quick questions before I give you your new\norders?”\n“Yes. How’d you know that Quentin was telling the truth about High\nLuxiat Tawleb?”\nKarris sniffed, amused. “Orea Pullawr left me many tools. Not only eyes\nand ears; I have fingers and blades as well. My spies learned of Quentin’s\nguilt. When he confessed, I had no one in High Luxiat Tawleb’s house, but I\ndid have people in place to see if he would do what a guilty man would do\nwhen he hears a fellow conspirator has been seized. But Tawleb didn’t\nliquidate any of his goods or home, which either meant he was innocent or\njust intelligent. He did hire out an entire well-known smuggler’s ship,\nwithout telling the captain what he would carry.\n“Within the hour, we had that smuggler sail ‘on other quick business.’ If\nTawleb’s timing had been merely a coincidence, say, he was hiring a\nsmuggler for some other illicit cargo that we didn’t know about because\nwe’d never really examined him that closely, then he would have waited for\nhis favorite smuggler to return. He didn’t. He went to another instead. This\none we let stay. And then early the morning of the executions, one of my\nlight fingers returned to me with Tawleb’s diary.\n“Most clever men just can’t help but brag about their cleverness, even if\nonly to themselves. His wording was always vague enough that alone, it\ncould have meant anything. Combined with all the rest of the evidence,\nthough, it was damning.” She paused, a chastened grin stealing over her\nlips. “But perhaps I shouldn’t blame anyone for boasting of their cleverness,\nnow should I? I’ve just done it myself.”\n“I won’t tell. Promise,” Teia said, and she grinned for the first time.\n“It’s nice to see you smile, Teia,” Karris said. There was a quick rap on\nthe door, and five beats later, having given Teia just enough time to take up\na post against one wall, a stoic Baya Niel poked his head in. “Breakfast and\ncorrespondence, High Lady.”"

Nor way to ask without arousing suspicion.\nElse I would have done it, I promise. I care for both of them, too, you\nknow.”\nKarris did.

Orholam, please, this is the\nlast moment to let me know if I’m stepping out of your will with this.\nBut he said nothing, and she saw nothing except that it must be done.\n“Teia, I hoped that we could defang the Order. But serpents make poor\npets. They offered a murder to you, as a gift? And allowing one of their own\nto kidnap the Prism’s own room slave? These are not actions of a group that\ncan be brought back into Orholam’s goodness. Teia, what you’ve told me\nchanges what we need to do. Much as I wish we could concentrate our\nforces in one direction at a time, this war must be fought on two fronts\nsimultaneously. Are you familiar with the bull luxiatica Ad abolendam?”\n“Uh, something to do with the luxors?”\n“It’s a letter sealed with lead giving certain powers to an office or a\nperson. It’s too dangerous for you to carry anything like that, so if you are\nchallenged, yours will be hidden in my desk—in the secret compartment\nyou found. Please don’t give me occasion to have to produce it.” Dear\nOrholam, forgive me. Even as I denounce serpents, I’m creating one.\n“What are you talking about?” Teia said. “Why would I need such a\nthing?”\nWill they put me on Orholam’s Glare for this? Will I deserve it? Her\nface as still and hard as the Iron White she aspired to be, Karris said, “In\nsecret, I’m conferring upon you the title of Malleus Haereticorum.\n‘Hammer of Heretics.’ You are now named and empowered as a luxor, Teia.\nThe first named in my lifetime, and let us hope the last. Your mission is no\nlonger merely to infiltrate the Order of the Broken Eye. You are to destroy\nthem. Do whatever you have to do—up to and including murdering\ninnocents. The blessing and forgiveness of the Chromeria and the\nMagisterium entire rest upon you for every lie and sin you deem necessary\nto accomplish this task. This is war. Kill the Order, Teia.

The Mighty and the Ghosts would rendezvous in\nthe morning—the battles had concluded after sunset, so there was no way\nthe skimmers could cover all the leagues of river between them.\nSibéal had come alone overland, sneaking through the woods with the\nnatural ease of her people. Conn Arthur had known the Mighty would want\nto hear how things had gone as soon as possible.\nAnd Big Leo, bless the glowering lunk, had had the presence of mind to\ndecide that the most vital provision that must be stolen before they scuttled\nthe barge was wine. They passed several bulging skins around the fire,\nfeeling young and invincible.\nExcept for Ferkudi. He’d been selected to be the lookout, which meant\nsober. He was vocal about his martyrdom.\nThe distraction raid below the falls, Sibéal reported, had been a huge\nsuccess. She confirmed that the villagers had sunk their own barges before\nthe Blood Robes arrived, hoping to protect their stockpiled grains. The\nBlood Robes, however, had brought their barges. When the Ghosts of Shady\nGrove attacked, they’d overwhelmed the Blood Robes’ barges so quickly\nthey hadn’t needed to sink them. Instead, sparing only a few people, they’d\nstolen them and their nearly full load of flour.\nThe rest of the Ghosts had pressed on to the warehouses, seizing them as\nwell, because the resistance was so light that the conn thought the Blood\nRobes would smell a trap if he pulled back.\nHe’d wisely shored up his defenses at the warehouses, avoiding a\ndisaster when they discovered that there were over a thousand Blood Robes\ncamped less than a league away—and coming fast.\n“A thousand!” Cruxer exclaimed.\nInstead of engaging in a hopeless battle, the Ghosts set fire to the\nwarehouses and retreated before the reinforcements arrived.\nFinal tally: fifteen to twenty enemy killed. One dead and two wounded\namong the Ghosts. And all of the Blood Robes’ provisions either stolen or\ndestroyed.\nBut Big Leo was right: The White King’s men wouldn’t believe that the\nopposing force had simply materialized without local support. There would\nbe retribution. Conn Arthur had told the people to flee, but Sibéal said that\nsome wouldn’t listen. Some never listen.\n“We can’t let our fear of what they’ll do to retaliate dictate what we do,”\nKip said. “If we let that work, they’ll do it again and again until we can do\nnothing at all.”\n“On the other hand,” Ben-hadad said, “not to be coldhearted, but the\nmore brutal the Blood Robes’ retaliation, the more people will come to our\nbanners.”\n“Which brings both help and trouble,” Cruxer said, “in logistics and\nloyalty. With the skimmers and a small platoon of drafters? We’ll be\nunstoppable raiders. I’ve got nothing against munds, but they’ll slow us\ndown.”\nSibéal piped up, “Like people who haven’t trained to fight their whole\nlives slow you down?”\nCruxer looked at her flatly. “Yes. But your Ghosts have strengths that"

But your Ghosts have strengths that\nmore than balance out your weaknesses. I don’t think that will be the case\nwith… non-drafters.”\n“We’ll deal with that when it comes,” Kip said. “For now, know that I\nsee the problems coming. I don’t know what we should do about them yet,\nbut I’ve got them in mind.” These were things he would need to discuss\nwith Tisis first.\nThe Mighty needed to sink into this country. They needed to learn the\npeople and the land. They needed friends if they were going to stop the\nWhite King.\n“First thing we need to do,” Kip said, “is divide the loot.”\n“Loot? The flour?” Big Leo asked.\n“When you’re hungry in the forest and someone gives you gold to snack\non, I want you to think about that tone,” Tisis said.\n“The loot is ours,” Kip said. “We bled and died to take the White King’s\nflour—”\n“The White King’s flour?” Sibéal asked.\n“He stole it and the villagers had no way to get it back, did they? That\nsaid, after Conn Arthur makes clear that all of the flour and the barge itself\nis ours by the laws of war, he’s going to take only two sevs for each of us—\nlittle enough that each of us can add it to our pack without us having to add\nwagons, and enough that each of us can split our share with those who join\nus soon. Then the conn finds whoever is in charge from the village, makes\nclear what is ours, and then gives all the rest and the barge itself to the\nvillage. We want to bind the survivors to us, make them grateful. Make\nthem spread good stories about us. And for Orholam’s sake, make sure they\nhide the barges until the Blood Robes are long gone.”\nSibéal Siofra nodded her head. “Saving their lives means a lot. Saving\ntheir livelihoods may mean more in the coming days.”\nOrholam’s balls, Kip thought, they were going to need things like food\nand weapons and shoes and tents and cooks and everything else. Eight\npeople could live off the forest without its slowing them too much.\nEspecially with the skimmers. They wouldn’t be able to do that with the\nconn’s hundred and twenty added to that. And if even half the Cwn y Wawr\njoined? That put them at nearly two hundred and fifty souls. And two\nhundred and fifty mouths. Five hundred feet.\nAt that number, skimmers became a huge headache. With every new one\nthey built, the quality got worse, the speed of the whole group got slower,\nand the likelihood of either losing one into enemy hands or having a spy\nsteal their secrets magnified. That could have consequences for the whole\nwar, not just the Mighty’s raids here.\nThen again, what use was an advantage you were too afraid to use?\n“Things are going to change,” Kip said. “It’s already started. We’re\ngoing to grow, and we’re going to learn, and we’re going to fight. We’ll"

So tonight let’s tell stories about Trainer\nFisk, and Ironfist, and Goss and Daelos and Teia, and the battle we just\nfought, and how Ferkudi totally cheated in our placement fights—”\n“Yeah,” Ferkudi said. “Wait—what?”\n“And tomorrow, we go back to war.”\nSo they swapped stories and embellished a few, and were called out half\nthe time. And mostly Sibéal and Tisis were silent. They understood. It was a\nwake for the boys’ childhood, which had been dying for a long time.\nTisis told about Kip’s initiation and how she’d sabotaged him. Sibéal in\nparticular looked stunned, though Ferkudi did, too. How he’d missed that\nstory, Kip had no idea.\n“That’s how you met? And yet here you sit, together? Married?” Sibéal\nasked. “I can’t believe he would forgive you such a thing.”\n“Kip has a remarkable ability to see the difference between an adversary\nand an enemy,” Tisis said. She patted his arm, and her eyes were warm.\n“Oh, gag me,” Ben-hadad said.\n“With wine!” Cruxer called, tossing a sack at him.\nDeadpan, Kip said, “After I saw her naked, I’d forgive her for anything.”\nShe smacked his arm, her face bright in the firelight.\n“He does have a penchant for grabbing on to something and not letting\ngo, doesn’t he?” Cruxer said.\n“Tell me about it!” Kip said, showing off his burn-scarred left hand.\nThey laughed, and Cruxer said, “I was thinking about Aram, in our\nplacement fights, and how you grabbed him until he nearly broke your\nneck!”\nSo they segued into those stories: who had been better than expected,\nhow Teia had placed everyone before the fight, how Kip had bulled his way\nall the way to fifteenth place, and how Cruxer had crushed Aram’s knee to\ndisqualify him and get Kip into the final fourteen.\nAnd suddenly the fire was rainbows of color because of the tears\nswelling in Kip’s eyes. But he didn’t avert his face. He didn’t stand and go\nhide in the dark as he would have not so long ago.\n“Wine making you maudlin?” Big Leo asked, trying to let him play it\noff.\n“No,” Kip said, and the circle went silent, all of them looking at him. “I\nhad no friends growing up. I was the addict’s boy. The fat boy. Made fun of,\nbeat up, the butt of jokes. The best of the townsfolk merely pitied me. I was\ntaken on, but not taken in. I steeled myself to that.

For some reason, being called the Mighty’s heart was far\nmore meaningful than if Cruxer had called him the head. “I would have\ncalled you the heart, Cruxer. Maybe you’re the spine or the guts of us,\nthen.”\n“Well, if neither of you is the head, I guess I must be,” Ben-hadad said.\n“I’m obviously the left hand,” Winsen said. “I’ll come outta nowhere\nand slam ya.”\n“That makes me the right,” Big Leo said. “You might be on the lookout\nfor me, but that doesn’t mean you’re gonna stop me.”\n“Well, what’s that make me?” Ferkudi said. “A foot?”\nThe Mighty looked around the circle at each other, and then they all\nanswered in unison: “The ass.”\n“The ass?!” Ferkudi said.\n“So what’s Tisis?” Cruxer asked.\nOh shit.

Cruxer opened his mouth to apologize.\n“Well, obviously—” Winsen said.\n“—she’s the charisma,” Kip interjected.\n“And… Winsen gets to live,” Tisis said flatly.\nThey grinned. Crisis averted.\nMaybe the wine had gone to Kip’s head, but he wanted to say this: “I\ncame from all that. But now—” He choked up, but no one said a word. Tisis\nsqueezed his thigh, being a support. Kip said, “Now I have this? I’m risking\nmy life to do something that matters with people I love? This is the best\nnight of my life.” He spoke through the tears, and looked at them each in\nturn. A few eyes glimmered with tears in return. “Thank you. I love you\nall.”\nThen he shot a wink at Sibéal. “Except for you. I mean, I’m sure you’re\nnice, but I barely know you.”\nThey all laughed, and Kip looked down at his hands. “What the hell,\nwhy are my hands empty? Can’t any of you bastards share with a thirsty\nman?”\n“Hear hear,” Ferkudi said, reaching out an empty hand enthusiastically,\ntrying to grab a wineskin from Big Leo, who was pointedly guzzling it so as\nnot to share. Ben-hadad grabbed it away from Big Leo and handed the skin\nacross, ignoring Ferkudi, but Tisis intercepted the skin.\n“Uh-uh,” she said. “You come with me.

All mental. All awkward. All fear. It was all going to go\nsideways. Again. Another failure. He knew it.\nShe paused and looked up at him. But her gaze was patient, not\nfrustrated. “Let me do this.”\n“I want to, but…”\n“Let me do this,” she said firmly. “Not just for you. For us. We need\nthis.”\n“It doesn’t seem fair.”\n“Oh, my husband, you beautiful soul. It’s not fair, but that doesn’t mean\nit’s not good. A marriage breathes, and every exhalation is giving, and every\ninhalation is taking. It can’t live without both, Kip. So… just… breathe.”\nSo he did.\nBreathing, he decided pretty much immediately, felt amazing.\nChapter 38\n“I thought you’d humiliate me,” Gavin said. He didn’t move. He still\nthought it. He scanned the room. His father was leaning back in his chair,\nand the table was covered with food. Meat, dried fruits, sweetmeats,\ncheeses, bread, nuts, two flagons, two fine golden goblets. Gavin could\nhardly bear to look at it, and could hardly bear not to.\n“Humiliate you? By springing a trap on you? Like all your others? What\nwould that prove? That I could outthink a prisoner with no weapons, no\ntools, and only the light I’ve allowed him? That’s not exactly a challenge, is\nit?” He hesitated. “Or are you really still trying to prove how smart you are?\nIs that what all this is?”\nThere was no answer.\n“Come. Sit,” Andross said. “This wine shan’t stay chilled forever.”\nIndeed, there was condensation on one of the glasses.\nHe’d not been here long, he was saying. Just long enough to have plenty\nof time to wait for Gavin. He’d predicted him that perfectly.\nAndross tilted the goblet and inhaled the scent with relish.\n“Marvelous. Oh, wait. Was this the one I poisoned, or the other?” He\npicked up the other glass and drank. “Ah, that’s right, I poisoned neither.\nWhat trivial games you play, boy. How unworthy you are of my name.”\nGavin didn’t move. It didn’t make sense. His father had taken such\nprecautions last time. Why simply let Gavin step within striking range?\n“You fucker,” Gavin said."

And Gavin couldn’t draft. He had no power\nAndross need fear, neither martial nor magical nor mental.\nAndross grinned, as if pleased that Gavin had figured it out. “You know,\nI made a mistake with you.”\n“More than one,” Gavin said.\nAndross continued as if he’d not heard him. “I thought you’d found this\nprison. I had no idea you were so insane that you’d made it. I didn’t realize\nthe truth until you broke out of the blue cell. Then it became obvious. And\nof course you’d not have made a prison without designing ways for you\nyourself to escape.”\n“I am my mother’s son,” Gavin said. Orholam have mercy, that food.\nHis whole body ached for it. Not the hunger of the belly, but the deeper\nhunger felt in the throat like thirst.\nAndross’s face darkened, but he controlled himself. He said, “I propose\na trade.”\n“A trade?”\n“There is a dignity in making bargains, and you need all the dignity you\ncan get. You know I’ll abide by my word.”\nGavin said nothing. He was too hungry, too weak. His mind couldn’t\nrace as fast as Andross Guile’s in this moment.\n“You give me the tooth and that bit of hellstone, and you can eat your\nfill.”\nGavin’s heart had been an eagle, mounting on strong wings, as he’d seen\nthe chamber before him. His father’s appearance had torn out his flight\nfeathers. And now Andross plucked out his last hopes. Andross knew about\nthe hellstone. He knew about it all. Wearing nothing but rags, Gavin had\nhidden both secrets in his cheeks, like a khat-chewer. Gavin’s hopes\nplunged to earth, flapping wildly, helplessly, uselessly.\n“Then what?” Gavin asked.\n“Then you go back to a cell, of course.”\nGavin didn’t so much as glance back at the lux torch he’d stuck in the\nworks to keep the portcullis from falling. He was weak, but it could be used\nas a club.\nHis father did look at it, pointedly. “Too far away, don’t you think?”\nIt was.\n“Even were it closer, do you think it would be enough, against me, in\nyour present state?”\nAnd Gavin’s hopes plunged into the earth, ribs breaking, body smashed.\nThere was nothing left for him.\nAndross said, “Come now, sit sit sit. We have so much to talk about.”\nGavin hesitated for one moment more.\n“So disappointing,” Andross said. He sighed. “It used to be your\nparticular strength that you could see how a situation had changed and\nadapt to it instantly… Dazen.”\nIt was a horse stomping on a body already dead. Gavin had known his\nfather had to know by now, but to hear it, to have that sick, shameful truth\nspoken, was more than he could bear.\n“Three… two… one… and the offer’s expired,” Andross said.

This food was here for\nyou, and you had it. Almost.”\nAnd now Andross was desecrating the dead, mutilating the corpse.\nThe word had a resonance, here, in this chamber: ‘almost.’\nBut Gavin was already speaking, reacting, walking toward Andross. For\nmay not the desecrated dead rise as vengeful ghosts? “I want you to know,\nfather. I didn’t know if I could really go through with it and kill Gavin. But\nthen I realized I wasn’t murdering him, I was freeing him from the\nnightmare you’d pulled him into when he was just a child. You took him\naway from us and destroyed the boy he was. I was freeing him from your\ncorruption. It was a mercy killing.”\nRage washing over his face, Andross snapped his fingers and light flared\nfrom a wall back and to Gavin’s left.\nFiery letters appeared, spelling out ‘Almost’ in Gavin’s own hand. The\nvery sign he’d used to taunt his brother into his trap.\nBut how had Andross triggered it?\nGavin didn’t wait. He lunged toward the old man.\nAn egg of red luxin larger than his head hit him in the face and blew him\noff his feet.\nGavin fell flat on his back and pawed at the sticky pyrejelly covering his\nface, spitting, trying to breathe. He barely opened his eyes in time to see\nAndross standing over him, one hand aflame.\nWith the combustible goop on his face, if Andross brought that fire\nclose, Gavin would burn to death.\nBut his father checked himself, extinguished the flame, and merely hit\nhim with a right cross.\nGavin’s head bounced off the floor and his limbs went limp. He fought\nto recover.\nHe heard a clang as Andross used luxin to hurl aside Gavin’s lux torch\nfrom where it was blocking the portcullis. But there was no clatter of the\nportcullis dropping to the floor.\nAndross cursed and shot a flaming missile at the rope holding up the\nportcullis.\nIt fell, but the floor didn’t open beneath Gavin. Andross must not have\nreset the trap correctly.\nGavin pulled himself up to his knees, but his father saw him move and\nkicked. Gavin tried to block the kick, but he was too weak. Andross’s foot\nsmashed into his stomach, and another fist caught Gavin across the jaw.\nHe fell to the ground, and Andross stepped on his neck.\n“Some trap,” the old man said. Still holding Gavin down, Andross\nreached in front of him, where Gavin had spat out the hellstone fragment\nand the broken tooth he’d kept secreted in his mouth.\nGavin tried to scramble away, but Andross pinned him harder, exerting\nso much pressure Gavin thought his vertebrae would crack.

Gavin caught\nthe barest glimpse of Andross’s pinprick-tight pupils.\nHe was drafting. He threw out a hand, and sent something beyond\nnormal vision into Gavin’s old trap. Gavin said, “But you can’t draft\nsuperviolet.”\n“Can’t I? It seems you know as little about me as I once knew about\nyou.” With a light kick to Gavin’s temple to stun him once more, Andross\nsaid, “I think it’s time you learn something else you didn’t know. Take a\nlook at what’s waiting for you below.”\nHis brother’s rotting corpse was below. Orholam, no. Gavin had thought\nhis father would surely give his brother the burial he himself hadn’t.\n“No, please…”\nThe floor gave way, and Gavin tumbled into the yellow hell.\nChapter 39\nThe subtlety of the problem was its beauty. Kip sat in the soft light of the\nincipient dawn teasing slender threads of yellow light for his project. It\nwould be some time before the Ghosts had enough light to reach them, and\nwatching the river change as night pulled back its covers and shivered into\ndawn was precious to him as last night had been precious.\nHe looked at the yellow cords in his hands. Something about having the\npeaceful light before him and having something to occupy his hands left no\nspace for other thoughts, and sometimes thinking was the enemy.\nAfter Tisis had pleased him last night, he’d begun to learn the mysteries\nof her body in turn. Joyful discoveries for an attentive novitiate. But after\nseveral rounds of delight, Tisis had sworn her body was relaxed enough to\nattempt intromission again.\nHer Jade Gate was still firmly closed. Something in her wouldn’t allow\nhim inside, and a tiny part of him couldn’t help but wonder if her body was\nbetraying her words as lies that she really did want this marriage.\nMaybe that was unfair of him.\nIt had certainly been unwise to say it out loud.\nA magical, nearly perfect night had ended in tears and a turned back.\nEventually he’d pulled her to him, and she let him hold her against his\nbig form, but neither had said another word.\nThe problem in his hands this morning was ever so much simpler. When\nhe’d been lost and delirious the last time he’d been in Blood Forest, he’d\ndrafted a small length of chain from solid yellow. He’d begun by drafting\neach tiny link one at a time. It would have taken him several years to make\na mail coat that way.\nIf he lived long enough to finish it, it would make something lighter and\nmuch, much stronger than iron or steel. He still wasn’t sure if it would stop\na musket ball, though.\nThat uncertainty, and that he would have to spend weeks to draft a large-\nenough section of mail even to run an inconclusive test against a musket\nball, had made him lose interest.\nTisis had been up for a while. He could hear her moving around the tent,\ngetting dressed and ready for the day. She paused now, just inside.\nGathering her courage?

She stretched\nwith a pleased sound and made a quick sign of the seven to the sun as it first\npeeked over the horizon, illuminating the river and her blonde hair in its\nponytail. She met Kip’s eye and smiled.\nShe came over and sat next to him, her hip touching his.\nSo… not a fight. Thank Orholam.\n“What’re you working on?” Tisis asked, a smile in her voice.\n“Just something to keep my hands busy.”\n“Something to keep your hands busy?”\n“Little project. Was thinking of making a mail coat with it at first. But\nit’d take me six months at least. I’m not sure it makes sense to plan that\nlong term.”\nShe put her hand on his thigh and blew out a breath. “Kip, I wanted to\nsay sorry for last night. I was a brat.”\nI wish more people would be a brat that way! was probably not the right\nthing to say. But she wasn’t talking about the first part of the night and he\nknew it. “I’m sorry, too,” Kip said.\n“No, you’ve got nothing to be sorry for. Thanks for pulling me back to\nyou. I needed that,” she said.\nThe rest of the camp was stirring now, and not a few people were\nalready hard at work at morning chores, but, taking their cue from Winsen,\nwho stood guarding Kip and Tisis from a good distance, the others didn’t\napproach.\n“I know we didn’t exactly choose this,” Kip said. “I mean, we did, but it\nwas a pretty constrained choice. But we’re in this together. I had a great\ntime last night—the best time. You were, just, wow.”\n“But,” she said glumly.\n“Yeah. I want us to stop trying the other thing.”\n“The normal thing, you mean?” she asked bitterly.\nHe wondered how much they were being careful not to say it straight out\nbecause they were outside where someone might just overhear, and how\nmuch they were just embarrassed. Who fails at having sex?\n“Everything is great for us except that. Why can’t we just have fun and\nput that aside?” Kip said. “It’s just not—”\n“You know damn well why,” she said quietly. “The contract isn’t valid. I\nmean, at this point I’ve already lied to my sister, which has only worked\nbecause I haven’t had to see her face-to-face. She’ll know, Kip.”\n“We’re not going to see her,” he said. “Not until all this is over.”\n“Kip, political marriages get split up all the time. And that’s when\nthey’re valid in the first place. I’m not really safely in your family until I\nhave a baby and your grandfather decides it looks like a Guile. You think\nthat old man wouldn’t be happy to cast me off like a cheap whore again?”\nAgain.\nShe cursed under her breath. Neither of them wanted to remember Kip\nwalking in on her stroking Andross Guile under his covers. It had been a\nscene Andross had set up on purpose to humiliate both of them—and\nprecipitate this marriage, though Tisis still didn’t know that part."

No wonder she was tense, if she had to get past her memories\nof that every time she was with Kip.\n“Forget that,” Kip said. “Forget him. For now. Our vengeance on him is\nbeing happy with each other. We’ll figure something out about all that other\nstuff later. For now, we keep doing everything that brings us joy—and that’s\na lot!—and we stop doing the one thing that brings us misery.”\n“You want to give up,” she said.\n“Is it giving up when you stop doing something that hurts us?”\nShe scowled at first, but then squeezed his leg. “You said ‘us.’”\n“How many ways do I need to tell you we’re in this together?” Kip\nasked.\nShe put her head on his shoulder. “I want you to know it’s not just for\nthe contract and my sister, or for fear that you’ll drop me later. I want to\nmake love with you. You know that, right?”\n“I know,” Kip said. But he hadn’t, not really. Didn’t, still. She was being\nhonest, and he trusted her, but he still didn’t believe her, somehow. They\nweren’t just a boy and a girl, trying to figure something out. They never\nwould be.\nBut then, if they were just a boy and a girl, Kip never could have caught\nso much as the eye of a girl this beautiful, so he probably should never\ncomplain ever, ever again, so long as he lived.\nBut she’d said that word, that word that demands response. Though\nshe’d said only ‘make love,’ and that could be part of a phrase, meaningless.\nIt hadn’t been entirely meaningless. Had it? Was that a question? A test. It\nwas still there, prickly as a caltrop for him to step on: ‘love.’\nHe’d said, Let’s have fun.\nShe’d said, Let’s make love.\nShit.\n“You’re beautiful,” he said softly. “And gracious. I really appreciate\nyou, and I’m really coming to… care for you. Deeply.” Orholam, that\nsounded so lame. He shouldn’t have said anything at all. “I’m sorry,\nthat’s… all wrong.”\n“Teia?” she asked, and hurt echoed harsh and deep into a cave of\nlonging. “You still think of her.” It wasn’t quite a question.\n“Sometimes,” he said. “But I don’t dwell on it.”\nShe sat up and held his face in her hands. “You’re a man who feels\ndeeply. It’s one of your best qualities. I can’t hold that against you.”\n“But you do. A little,” he said.\n“A little,” she admitted. “I’m getting over that slowly, too.” She took a\ndeep breath, and Kip saw something flit through her eyes.\n“I wasn’t thinking about her last night while we were together,” he said.\n“Not at all. Not at all.”\nShe expelled her breath and relief washed over her. “I didn’t want to ask.\nThank you.”\nAnd she let him off the hook, just like that. She really was kinder than\nhe deserved."

She really was kinder than\nhe deserved.\n“So if you’re not making a mail coat, what’s this going to be?” she\nasked, pointing to the length of lambent yellow luxin chain.\n“Well, the chain is easy enough if I’m not hooking every link to three or\nfour others, so I thought I’d do something harder, more subtle.”\n“More subtle?” she asked.\n“I’m still going to have the chain as the core, but I’m trying to make,\nlike… an articulated rope around it. See, rope spears are awesome because\nyou can throw knots over your opponents’ hands and do grappling and all\nsorts of things, but the rope itself can obviously be cut by any blade if\nyou’re not careful. A chain spear can’t be cut, but it’s much harder to throw\nloops and knots and whatnot. So I’m trying to get the best of both worlds.”\n“But you never trained with a rope spear, have you?”\n“No, no, it’s just something to keep my hands busy.”\n“Right,” she said suddenly. “That’s great. Oh, look, it’s the Ghosts. I’d\nbetter go prepare.” But she’d stiffened, and she suddenly stood and walked\naway. And Kip had the distinct feeling he’d loused up again.\n“What’d I do?” Kip asked Winsen.\nWinsen was squinting against the dawn like someone with a serious\nhangover. “I am asking myself the same question. But my answer is drink\nway, way too much wine.”\nChapter 40\nAs she’d arranged, Karris was still at her dawn prayers when Promachos\nAndross Guile arrived. She lay prostrate before the open window facing the\nsun, and felt the faint stirring of the wind as the inner door opened behind\nher.\n“Orholam,” she pleaded aloud, “I could try to hide my ignorance, but I\nwon’t. I’m not going to act in darkness. Let it all stand before the light.\nOrholam, this is your empire; these are your people. You will have to fight\nfor us, or we shall perish. Will you let your name be defamed upon the\nearth?”\nShe stayed there prone for some time, praying. She’d arranged this, but\nthat didn’t mean it wasn’t real, too. She needed to look like a zealot in order\nto accomplish what needed doing. It was the zealots in the Magisterium\nwho could give her the most trouble if they allied against her. But by\ndisarming them, she could also make unnecessary the calls for luxors. She\nhad two luxors. She had no desire for there to be any more, by her hand or\nany other.\nBut as she said the words for Andross Guile’s benefit—let him think her\na little crazy, it might make him careful around her—she realized she meant\nthem, too. She wasn’t fighting for herself. She didn’t want power for its\nown sake; she wanted only to save the Chromeria and the people of the\nSeven Satrapies. After that was accomplished she would happily step down.\nSo it was only right that Orholam should take up his own fight. This war\nwas his problem."

Our prayers are surely for our own\nreflection more than for his instruction, no?”\n“A point for the luxiats to debate, no doubt. Tea?” He gestured to her\nslave to close the doors to the balcony.\nIt was a breach of etiquette for him to command her slaves, but a small\none. He obviously thought she deserved it for keeping him waiting.\n“We have much to discuss, but before we get started—” Karris said. She\nchewed on her lower lip, thinking. “A number of months ago, I was\nambushed on Big Jasper. I was beaten, efficiently and dispassionately. It\nwas clearly intended to teach me a lesson. Maybe a man would have taken\nsuch a beating as intended. Once he realized he wasn’t being beaten to\ndeath, he might simply endure it. Perhaps. But a woman made to feel utterly\nhelpless at the hands of half a dozen men?” She paused. “There are different\nfears. Lingering fears. Fears that can be crippling, if one doesn’t know her\nhistory.”\n“Perhaps that was the message instead? A beating is bad, but there are\nworse things possible?” Andross said innocently, as if just speculating,\ntrying to find the answer with her.\n“If so,” she said, “that message was beyond ill considered, and had the\nopposite effect to what was intended. No one likes to feel helpless; I have a\nparticular loathing for it. I made a foolish oath about what I would do when\nI found out who had done that to me. It involved flaying and honey and\ninsects and castration. Not a fitting oath for the White to take.”\n“But then, you weren’t the White at the time,” he said, still so damnably\ninnocent.\n“No indeed. Do you think a White is bound by oaths she made before\nshe was the White?”\n“Hmm. Yes?—unless they interfere with her duties as the White. That\noath and office supersedes all lower bonds,” Andross said.\n“I agree. It becomes tricky, though. You see, with all the intelligence\napparatus available to me as the White, I’ve uncovered who ordered my\nbeating.”\n“Indeed?” he asked. “A curious allocation of your resources, don’t you\nthink? Still. I wish I had thought to have my own people look into that for\nyou. What punishment may I help you inflict upon this malefactor?”\nShe took a breath and looked away. “None. I forgive you.”\n“Me?! Beg your pardon?” He didn’t even sound that outraged. He\nwasn’t even trying.\n“I’ll seek no vengeance against you. I consider the matter closed.”\nBaffle Andross Guile."

She and Dazen had fallen in love, but then the\nreal Gavin couldn’t bear to see his younger brother so happy. What had\nhappened next was Andross Guile’s fault more than anyone’s. And he\nblamed her? A fifteen-year-old girl at the time?\nShe wanted to scratch his damn eyes out. But she’d learned something in\nthe Archers about fighting those who were bigger and stronger. Things\nabout accounting for the trajectory of the superior force. You never try to\nstop it. You redirect it instead.\n“Yes. Please do forgive me,” she said without a hint of sarcasm.\nHe stopped, suddenly emotionless. He wasn’t often taken by surprise.\n“Oh, I don’t think I respected Orea enough,” he said finally.\nShe wasn’t sure which he meant: that Orea had been brilliant in\nappointing Karris who was so surprisingly capable, or that it had been nice\nto deal with Orea and he hadn’t noticed how nice until he had to deal with\nher inferior.\n“A mistake I’m sure you’ll not make with her successor,” Karris said.\nHe chuckled. “Oh, I already have. But not again, perhaps. I make many\nmistakes, but few of them twice.”\n“Well, now that we’ve gotten all that out of the way, the purpose of our\nmeeting,” Karris said.\n“Yes.

Are you in, or out?” And this was where it was important he\nsee her as a zealot.\n“In.” He said it with no hesitation.\n“Then start talking. What happened at the execution? What was that\nthing? Why haven’t I heard about any of this before?”\nKarris hadn’t slept well since the execution. She didn’t know if she’d\never sleep well again. Seeing that monster tear out of that spy’s skin had\nbeen the single most frightening experience of her life. In all her battles,\neven hunting down wights—those she’d fought had been men at core. This\nwas something else.\nFor the first time Karris had ever seen, Andross Guile looked somewhat\ndaunted, as if he didn’t know what to say, or perhaps where to start. “Have\nyou heard of the Thousand Worlds?”\nI’m not interested in fairy stories, Karris wanted to say. But Andross\nGuile rarely went on tangents without good reason. “The premise that there\nare many worlds like ours?”\n“Not exactly like ours,” Andross said. “The idea being that Orholam,\nbeing a creator, wouldn’t necessarily stop after making one world. Maybe\nhe’d make twenty, or a thousand or a million. Who knows? I was\nambivalent about the hypothesis. The unmasking of Nabiros has changed\nmy thinking.”\n“That thing. Delara Orange swore it wasn’t a will-casting or a hex.”\n“I believe her. Nabiros was real.” He rested his piercing eyes on her.\n“The Chromeria and the Magisterium don’t actually teach some of the\nthings that they believe, for fear that weaker souls will be led astray.\nRegardless, I’ve been piecing together truths and making leaps of intuition"

Will you cry heresy if\nI say things you don’t like?”\nIt wasn’t a real question. What it was, Karris saw, was a plea to have his\nefforts recognized. Doubtless Felia had always given him assurances of his\ngenius. But the old man’s wife was gone now, and he wanted someone to\nappreciate his intellectual heavy lifting.\nSo instead of mocking him as her heart desired, Karris chose\ncompassion: he’s lost his wife, for Orholam’s sake, be kind.\nBy the grace of Orholam alone, she painted rapt attention on her\nfeatures. “Caveats accepted. What have you learned?”\nHe stared hard at her, looking for mockery, and here she saw him as\nhuman again. With weaknesses. Seeking approval and praise. Not venally,\nbut simply as part of the normal human exchange—a person does\nsomething excellent and useful, and they wish it to be recognized.\nBut then he accepted her interest and took it as his due, the momentary\nchink in his arrogance covered again.\n“It was told to me as a creation story, transcribed from an old Tiru wise\nman in the Parian highlands, but I’ve no gift for stories. Mine is a mind that\ntears things asunder and examines the pieces. What matters for us is that\nbefore time, Orholam created six hundred immortals—or possibly six\nhundred legions, but let’s not complicate things. Two hundred of those\nrejected him and sought his throne. They lost, are losing, will lose. In the\nmeantime, they seek to ruin every joy Orholam might have of his creations,\nand taste every dark pleasure they may. If they may not rule all the celestial\nrealms, they desire to rule a world. They will possess the bodies of the\nwilling to taste what it is like to wear flesh. They will sire children. They\nwill murder, steal, crush, and rape. They will defile any goodness they find.\nThey will wage war and bring ruin wherever they can in their fury at losing\nthe home that was free to them and is now forbidden forever. For rage burns\nhottest against a punishment deserved.”\nThis was nothing new, except for the specificity of the numbers. What\nwas new was Andross’s treating it as real. Karris had to guess there was\nsome spin into heresy coming soon.\n“The salient fact, though, is that these immortals are neither omniscient\nnor omnipresent. Here.” He reached into his pockets and pulled out a\nnumber of short scrolls, one after the other. Karris could commiserate. They\nwere both always getting reports, and always on scrolls of uniform size,\nwhich made them stack better, but also led to the waste of having entire\nsheets of lambskin with only the words ‘Arrived safely’ or something\nsimilarly concise on them. Many of the reports were deemed too sensitive\nfor the parchments to be scraped and reused, too.\nHe unrolled half a dozen scrolls and laid them atop each other on\nKarris’s desk. “Imagine this scroll is the history of our world, beginning"

This one? Another world’s history. And another’s.”\nAndross stacked the papers and drew his belt knife. He laid the point\nagainst the skin.\n“We experience time like this.” He dragged the knife lightly forward.\n“An immortal, on the other hand, may enter any world of its choosing.”\nHe flipped a different scroll onto the top of the pile.\n“It may enter at any location it desires. Any kingdom, satrapy, or city.”\nHe moved the knife left and right.\n“But once it enters, it moves in time as we do, until it leaves.” He\nstabbed the knife all the way through all of the scrolls. “They aren’t\nomnipresent, so if they choose to be in Ru all Sun Day, they may not ever\nbe in Tyrea on the same day.” He grabbed a quill, dipped it, and crossed out\neverything to the left and right of the point where the knife had stabbed.\nThen he cut forward. Then he lifted the knife out of the skins. “So if our\nimmortal stays a year in Ru, say, being worshipped as the goddess Atirat,\nthat is a year denied her elsewhere.” With the quill, he crossed out all the\narea left and right of his cut.\n“But why the stack?” Karris asked.\n“Because there are many worlds, but only one time.” He flipped a\ndifferent scroll onto the top of the stack. He crossed out the entire area left\nand right of the cut there, too. “So Atirat is denied that time everywhere\nelse. An immortal has all eternity, but they have only a finite number of\nchances to interact with us mortals. Thus, paradoxically, with all eternity\navailable to them, a single day becomes incredibly precious to immortals.\nSo, were I immortal, I would only visit when my presence would matter\nmost. Perhaps on my holy days, or more likely in times of war, where I\nmight claim or lose an entire world.”\nKarris did not like where this was suddenly going. Tingles prickled\nalong her skin. “An immortal like Nabiros?”\nAndross looked at her and licked dry lips. She swore she saw a flicker of\nfear in his eyes. “We’ve entered a time that immortals find interesting\nenough to visit personally, and because of some fluke or perhaps some very\ncarefully prescribed and maintained traditions that neither you nor I were\naware of, we have just done exactly what we needed to do to kill one of\nthem. I think it would be an insane level of optimism not to expect the full\nfury of their vengeance.”\nIt was as if the floor had dropped out from under her. Karris’s problems\nhad looked daunting when they’d been human. She buried her face in her\nhands, and felt her gorge rising.\nIt was too much for her. She was the wrong person for all this. She was\ngoing to fail everyone, and now that failure wouldn’t just mean the\ndissolution of the kingdom.\nBreathe, Karris.\nShe pulled herself together and suddenly thought of something. “We"

This is Orholam’s fight. We didn’t kill Nabiros by sheer\nluck. Those traditions weren’t just stumbled upon. Someone taught our\nancestors those. And that we followed them well enough that they worked?\nThat wasn’t luck—it must have been Orholam’s immortals intervening on\nour side.” And suddenly she could breathe again. Things were harmoniously\nblue and orderly again. Orholam would take care of the immortals, and\nshe’d take care of her lists. That, that made sense.\nThen Andross shit all over her peace. As he did. “Let us not mistake\ntheir side and ours. This is one battlefield among a hundred thousand for\nthem. Perhaps their victory is complete now that one of the two hundred\nrebels is banished. Or perhaps by drawing the vengeance of his fellows,\nthey get a dozen of the rebels to waste days or even mere hours here that are\ncritically important to a battle on some other world that they believe is more\nimportant.”\n“You’re telling me we could just be a distraction?” Karris asked.\n“How did the old story put it? ‘When the king sends a ship of grain to\nhis ally, he worries not about the comfort of the rats in the hold.’ Our lives\nare nothing to the universe, High Lady.”\n“This is where your great intellect fails you for a lack of imagination and\nfaith, Andross Guile. You think that to be concerned with the great tides of\nhistory means that one must lose track of one little fish. Or that by caring\nfor one son, you can not care equally for another.”\n“You wish to compare how well we have loved our sons?” Andross\nasked.\n“I didn’t mean it like that,” she said, flushing. She didn’t want to talk\nabout Zymun. He made her uncomfortable, still. Though that was surely her\nown guilt speaking. But he was always touching her. Always wanting to be\nwith her. “I meant that Orholam sees and hears and cares and—”\n“And saves, yes, I know the old prayer. I’m simply not convinced by it.\nTell me, Karris, have you ever prayed for something that you thought you\nneeded more than breath itself?”\n“Gavin is still missing. How dare you ask me that?”\n“Ah, Gavin, yes. A man of singular gifts indeed. A man who would be of\nimmense help in this war of ours, wouldn’t he?”\nShe said nothing, certain some cruelty would come out of Andross\nGuile’s mouth next.\n“And where is he? And where is the Orholam who saves, who sees, who\ncares?”\nKarris had no answer.\n“We’re in a battle alone. And of the immortals, only one side has shown\nup, and it wasn’t Orholam’s.”\n“What would you have us do?” Karris said.\n“First, understand the stakes. We aren’t only fighting rebels now. We\nfight against the gods themselves. Should they win, this whole world will\nfall into their hands, perhaps until the end of time. We’ve killed one. In his\ntime, Lucidonius killed nine.

Depending on which translation is correct, that\nleaves us to face either twelve hundred thousand—minus ten—or a hundred\nand ninety. The good news or bad is that they come in ranks. Nabiros or\nCerberos is a low-ranking immortal.”\n“Naturally,” Karris said. Holy shit.\n“I don’t know what happens if the strongest ones come. It was said\nduring the reign of one particularly old and powerful Atirat that it was\nimpossible to draft green anywhere in Blood Forest without his permission.\nScholars since have interpreted that to mean drafting green in Blood Forest\nwas illegal. I think they really meant impossible.”\n“Like what we felt at Ru,” Karris said. At the end, greens there had lost\ncontrol of their bodies, been unable to move. “The greens felt the bane from\nmany leagues away, but it was only crippling within—what? A league or\ntwo? But how do they do it? And what determines their power?”\nAndross hesitated. “The point is—”\n“No, wait. What was that? You were just going to say something. Tell\nme.”\nAndross thought for a moment, studying her. “That—how they do what\nthey do and what determines their power—is what I sent Zymun to find out.\nIt’s why I ordered him to infiltrate the Color Prince’s ranks. He didn’t learn\nmuch, unfortunately, before he had to flee. He’d failed the Color Prince\ntwice—in assassinating Gavin, and in holding Ruic Head. Truth is, I’m not\nentirely certain he meant to fail at either.”\nBut Karris didn’t even hear the last biting words. Of course Andross\nwould try to soil her joy. Karris hadn’t been able to get straight answers out\nof Zymun about when he’d tried to ‘hurt’ Gavin, she’d said, couching it\ngently. No wonder! His grandfather was to blame for all that, and he was\ntrying to keep it secret because he was being loyal to Andross—the one\nperson in his family he’d known for years.\nAnd Andross, the cold bastard, had put Zymun in a place where he’d\nneeded to publicly fail at an assassination attempt—but appear to really be\ntrying—in order to obey his grandfather and keep his position near the\nColor Prince.\nConfront Zymun about trying to assassinate Gavin and kill\nKip.\nThank Orholam.\n“The point is,” Andross said, exasperated, “perhaps Orholam sees us as\nan acceptable sacrifice in a greater war. I do not. High Lady, I wish you to\npick up your knives. If we’re to survive this, we must be harder and smarter\nand stronger and crueler than the gods themselves.”\nHe regarded her for a long moment, and she shelved her sudden hope\nthat maybe now things would feel more natural with Zymun, now that those\nawful things were explained away.\nAndross said, “I ordered those men to beat you, because I saw what\nOrea was doing, how she was grooming you, giving you all these different\nassignments so you could learn her work. And I didn’t think you were equal\nto it. I remembered that sniveling girl you were, pretty and thoughtless. I"

I thought you were unwilling to\nfight back, or that when you did, you’d do it recklessly and stupidly. I was\nwrong about you then… and later, too.”\n“Later? You mean when you stacked the election to White against me?”\nAnd tried to have me killed?! she didn’t say aloud.\n“You will need all your strength for this fight,” he said. “And that streak\nof insanity or faith you show, whether it’s real or feigned.”\nTo say she was baffled would have been understating the matter. Had he\njust admitted to trying to have her killed? What was that? Why?\nPerhaps it was as close to an apology as he was capable of. He got up\nand walked to the door. She simply stared after him, speechless.\n“Oh,” he said, turning, “in case it wasn’t clear enough: Zymun is one of\nmy knives. Sharp and imbalanced, but very predictable once you\nunderstand what he is. In normal times, I should not… but these are not\nnormal times, are they? Let me offer you this: Guilt is a poor counselor.\nGuilt oft conspires to make two victims where there was only one. If it\ncomes to trusting your gut or trusting your son, make a wise choice, High\nLady.”\nChapter 41\nLiv walked through the abandoned orange groves silently, clouds of\nsuperviolet billowing from her with every step. Drafting was as easy as\nbreathing now, and the many-fingered clouds spread a hundred paces and\nmore from her in every direction. She patted the fallen statue of the Broken\nMan, remnant of the long-dead old Tyrean Empire.\nShe didn’t go to the burnt-out buildings and rubble of Rekton. She didn’t\ngo to her old home. She was here for something important.\nShe crossed the river, appearing to walk on water, small geysers of\nsuperviolet rising to support her feet at each step. She arrived at the old\nbattlefield, long overgrown with low plants, mostly brown this late in the\nsummer. Craters were still visible from artillery and magic both, eighteen\nyears on, but now rain lilies and haemanthus huddled in those shady,\nwatered places, beauty flourishing over ugliness, new life sprouting from\nrot.\nUncertain what her full powers might do here among the dead, she\nwithdrew most of them into herself. Sundered Rock beckoned her, and she\nclimbed it.\n“Beliol,” she summoned, and a moment later her ring sparkled. Her\nnameless servant hadn’t remained nameless for long after she had broken\nthe halo. He’d seemed surprised that she had known what his name meant.\nBeliol meant ‘yokeless,’ so different from Belial—‘worthless.’\n‘Yokeless?’ she’d asked. ‘And yet you serve me.’\n‘One needs no yoke to be compelled to serve when one believes in the\none whom one is serving.’ She’d been flattered, but of course, he’d meant it\nto be flattering."

Her full retinue was half a league\naway. They reached the base of the opposite side of the cracked dome that\nwas Sundered Rock, and she began to climb it alone.\nSamila Sayeh had been a hero of the Prisms’ War and later the lover of\nUsef Tep, her former enemy. They had come to Tyrea together to submit to\nthe Freeing.\nFinding war threatening once more, Samila had intended to die fighting\nagainst the Color Prince at Garriston. Usef Tep had done so, but she’d lived,\nand now she served the man responsible for her lover’s death. Funny how\nwar makes villains of heroes and slaves of the free.\nLiv had narrowly missed meeting the legend in Tyrea, but had later met\nher in Ru, when the mousy genius had figured out in moments a calibration\nproblem with the Great Mirror of Ru that had stumped Liv and others for\nhours.\nIf anyone was going to figure out what Liv was really doing, it was she.\nBut did Samila even remember what she’d done at the Great Mirror? Did\nshe remember those coordinates she’d translated in an instant?\nIn a few minutes, the middle-aged woman had climbed the opposite side\nof Sundered Rock, allowing the gulf to sit between them. The duolith itself,\nshaped like a cracked egg, lay partially submerged. It was hundreds of feet\ntall, and lay gray in the sun, with scorch marks faded by nearly two\ndecades’ passage but not gone. A few withered tufts of grass clung to its\noverhanging halves, and there was an opening below, as if the egg, broken\nin halves, had spilled its innards.\nExcept it was no egg, and not nearly an empty shell. Probably the rock\ndebris between the two halves had simply been cleared by looters certain\nthat here at the epicenter of the holocaustic finale of the Prisms’ War, there\nmust be treasure hidden.\nMaybe there had been, once. The Color Prince had gotten his black luxin\nfrom somewhere.\nOddly, Samila Sayeh had affected few of the usual traits of a wight,\nmuch less a god. Her skin wasn’t crystalline, except her left hand, as if she\nwere still running the experiment to see how blue luxin might function as\nskin in an application that required so much dexterity, sensitivity, and\nmotion. The rest of her looked severe and beautiful. The olive skin of an\nAtashian, but barely wrinkled even at forty-four years and seventeen days\nold, because she’d been a noble, and careful to protect her skin. She was\nslender and striking, her naturally blue eyes now solid cerulean, irises and\nsclera both.\nBut her dress was murex purple. A simple preference? A sign of her\nobscene wealth now? Of trying to find some common ground with Liv and\nher superviolet? Was it a sign of not caring to wear blue every day—‘Yes,"

Or… was\nthe color in honor of her Usef Tep, the Purple Bear?\nHow much of the old Samila Sayeh was left in the new Mot?\nRegardless, in Liv’s new sight, the older woman crackled with power. A\nthrobbing heartbeat of blue will scattered its near cousin superviolet with\nevery breath, and spectral bleed made her glow in superviolet like a sword\nplucked from the forge and held in the air for a few long moments: the color\ndulled quickly from white hot to angry red to a sullen gray, but you’d still\nbe a fool to touch it with your hand.\nThey were mirrors to each other: outsiders, logical women, cool and\nrational, both captured, both entwined, but Liv young and Samila older, Liv\nunproven and Samila renowned, Liv with all her tales before her, Samila\nwith her legends behind, and, most importantly, Liv free while Samila wore\nthe Color Prince’s black jewel at her throat. If she disobeyed him, or\nattempted to remove it, it would behead her.\n“Hail, Lady of Sorrows,” Samila said across the great gap between\nthem.\nLiv had never heard the term before. She was probably supposed to ask\nabout it. But she had no idea what games the Color Prince would be playing\nhere nor any interest in playing them. “Hello, Samila. Lady Mot, is it now?”\n“You’ve taken the seed crystal,” Samila said. “Without taking a slave\ncollar. Impressively done.” She turned to the side and said, “No, Meena, I\nthink it’s important to give credit where it’s due.”\nThere was no one there, though. Not even in superviolet. Not even as an\nafterimage of power.\nNow that was interesting. Was Meena Samila’s version of Beliol?\nLiv coughed, clearing her throat. “Can she see you?” Liv asked as she\ncovered her mouth.\n“No,” Beliol said. “Though she knows I’m here. You might find it in\nyour best interest to hold back as much information as possible.”\nThat they both had… invisible helpers attending them, but that those\nwere invisible even to other gods, meant something, but Liv wasn’t certain\nwhat. And had that been Samila slipping in letting her know about her own\nattendant, or had it been on purpose?\n“Beautiful ring,” Samila said. “Is that where you keep the seed crystal?”\n“Thank you, but no. A ring on the finger seems an awfully vulnerable\nplace to keep such power, doesn’t it? On the other hand—sorry, no pun\nintended—I did want a small physical reminder of my power to flash about\nwhen such things might prove helpful.”\nSamila Sayeh seemed to like the idea. It was a lie, though. The same lie\nLiv wanted Beliol to believe. She’d sent him to get her a suitable ring, and\nwhile he was gone, she’d turned her powers to making a gem that would\nsparkle and glow only when he was near.\nThen, because it glowed every time Beliol did appear, he simply thought"

It was lovely to\nhave such an obedient and powerful servant, but Liv had spent too much\ntime being bent to the will of others to actually trust him.\n“Where do you keep yours?” Liv asked, as if they were exchanging\nfashion tips.\n“Oh, incorporated with my body, of course. As you keep yours. I simply\nwanted to see if you’d try to mislead me, make me think you were ignorant\nwhere you are not.”\nAnd Liv, of course, had. Caught. Dammit. Liv had a brief flash of the\nsame rage she’d felt before at Samila when she’d humiliated her by figuring\nout the problems of the Great Mirror so easily. “You do serve the man who\ntried to enslave me,” Liv said, smiling at the bitch.\n“He enslaved me first.”\n“There are many ways one might react to that,” Liv pointed out.\n“There is no black luxin here,” Samila said, ignoring her.\n“Is there not?” Liv asked.\n“It was all carried away, long ago. You’re wasting your time if you came\nhere looking for it.”\n“Is that why I came here?” Liv asked.\n“You grew up in bloody Rekton, yonder,” Samila said. “I told the White\nKing you might be visiting there, to say goodbye. To mourn your dead. He\nthought the only reason you’d come would be for this battlefield.”\nNo, neither, actually. “The White King?” Liv asked.\nSamila Sayeh shrugged. “One who brings all the colors together,\nperchance? The opposite of a Prism?”\n“That’s not how prisms work,” Liv pointed out. “To bring light back\ntogether, you’d use another prism.”\n“We had two Prisms at the same time once. Before your time,” Samila\nSayeh said sarcastically. “It didn’t give us white.”\nYou old hag. “So Koios sent you to stop me from wasting my time?” Liv\nasked, amused. “So kind of him.”\n“He wants you to rejoin him,” Samila said. “You don’t wear his collar,\nbut our kind cannot hide from each other. He can find you anywhere in the\nworld. On the other hand, you will also be able to feel him or any of the rest\nof us coming for you. It would make for a tedious chase. Instead he offers\nyou a kingdom. Ilyta, specifically, traditional home of Ferrilux.”\n“What do I care for Ilyta?” Liv asked.\n“What do you care for any human land? You’re a god now. But it is\ngood to have a home, and a people who will rally to you. And worship\nyou.”\n“He really thinks he’s going to win, doesn’t he?” Liv asked.\n“At this point, it’s nearly inevitable. The question is really where you’ll\nbe standing when the fighting stops. He also offers the superviolet bane,\nwithout which you will never reach your full power.”\n“My bane? He has it?” Liv asked."

He has it?” Liv asked.\n“Oh, now you’ve tipped your hand, haven’t you?” Samila said.\nLiv didn’t know what she was talking about.\n“Never mind. He guessed as much.”\n“Guessed what?” Liv asked.\n“You are the reason why the Chromeria hides so much knowledge,\nAliviana Danavis. You incorporated your seed crystal before it made a bane.\nIf you’d waited until the bane had formed around the crystal and then\nincorporated it, you’d have both your powers and the place that magnifies\nthem. Having incorporated the seed crystal too early, it will never form a\ntemple. Unless you can figure out something even our ancestors struggled\nwith. A Ferrilux would be the one to figure it out if any would, though, I\nsuppose. Good luck.”\n“He’s found a second seed crystal?” Liv asked.\n“Not yet. As you might guess, with it being invisible and with\nsuperviolet drafters of any skill so rare, superviolet seed crystals are the\nhardest to find. But he has teams looking for it. You understand, it is both\nthe carrot and the stick. He can give it to you if you will serve him, or if he\nfinds it, he can kill you and make a new, empowered Ferrilux who will be\nloyal to him.”\nLiv’s heart fell. She might be the most effective searcher for superviolet,\nbut the other gods would be attuned to such a thing, and the White King\ncould search many, many places at once. It would be a race to the death.\nThere was no way of knowing if another seed crystal had even formed\nyet. Liv might spend every moment for decades searching for something\nthat didn’t exist—and would have to, because her life would depend on it.\nMeanwhile, the White King would simply have subordinates do it.\n“That’s your deal?” Liv asked. “I may live as a slave queen?”\n“His deal. I don’t care what you choose. Technically, you’ve rebelled.\nBeing offered to live is generous in itself. But you’re special, and\nsuperviolet has always been different, and, bluntly, weak. You will never\nhave to wear the hellstone collar. But yes, you will bend the knee. Servient\nomnes. All shall serve, child.”\n“I won’t,” Liv said, but it sounded hollow.\nSamila Sayeh sighed. “Seasons come and seasons go, but youth will\nalways think they know more than their elders.”\n“And sometimes they’ll be correct.” But Liv knew she was being\nimmature. That was fine. Perhaps it would make them underestimate her.\nSomething more human entered Samila’s tone when she said, after a\npause, “I do hope this is one of those times.”\nThen she simply turned and left.\n“Wait,” Liv said to the retreating form. “That’s it? No trap? No\nbartering?”\n“Between gods?” Samila said. “Unwilling gods at that. No. If you take\nhis offer, you’ll know where to find him. You’ll feel him, perhaps do right\nnow, even from here. But if I may…”\n“Please,” Liv said."

Whyever you came here, you’re\nhere now. You’ll never find another good reason to visit a place so out of the\nway. Not with what you’ve become. You’ll regret it if you don’t go see\nwhat’s become of the places you loved.”\nLiv looked at the older woman for a long moment. “Thank you. One\nquestion.”\n“We’ve come all this way,” Samila Sayeh said.\n“Do you hope to escape?”\nThe Mot fell silent for quite some time. She waved off a silent voice\nspeaking to her. “No,” she said finally. “I save hope for things that are\npossible.”\n“On my way here, I came through Garriston,” Liv said. “Most of those\nwho died in the battle were buried in mass graves.”\nSamila Sayeh stopped breathing.\n“But some of the slum dwellers who remained thought the drafters’\nbodies might be worth a ransom to their families. Especially Blackguards\nand… bichromes.” Liv didn’t say the name Usef Tep. She could see it was\ndangerous ground. Never break the emotions of those who pride themselves\non logic. “Enter through the Hag’s Gate. Take the third alley on the left.\nBlue door at the end. Ask for Ordoño.”\nThen Liv left. To burn the time until Mot was far enough away that she\nwouldn’t know where Liv was going exactly, she went to the dead village of\nRekton. Eventually her feet took her to Kip’s old hovel—somehow unburnt.\nShe took in his scent deeply, deeply enough to send a message for him in\nsuperviolet, wherever he was now. He was the only wild card left, the only\nhope for victory.\nWould he even understand it? Superviolet, Kip. Who else could send\nyou a message in superviolet? But he was half the world away, and she had\nnot the control yet to make her message clear.\nIt was probably hopeless.\nShe unbarred a closet. What a shithole. There were little scratch marks\nand dark stains on the inside of the door. A rats’ nest sat on the ground, with\nold bones and fur and rat droppings. She’d had no idea Kip had lived in\nsuch squalor.\n“Why are you crying?” Beliol asked her.\nThere was indeed wetness coursing down her face. Both sides. “I don’t\nknow,” she said honestly.\nChapter 42\n“We have a problem,” Conn Arthur said as his skimmer bumped ashore on\nthe little island where Kip and the Mighty had camped. “I’ll explain as we\ngo.”\nKip and Cruxer helped push off and jumped aboard. The Mighty’s\nskimmer would follow. They were off instantly, if clumsily. The Ghosts\nwere still figuring out the skimmers.\nConn Arthur said, “There was a red wight yesterday who escaped our\nclash at the warehouse. Distinctive. No skin on his forearms. Several other\nwights and soldiers escaped as well, of course. But him… him we\nrecognized. Name’s Baoth. He’s a former novice of Shady Grove who left"

        "text": "wights and soldiers escaped as well, of course. But him… him we\nrecognized. Name’s Baoth. He’s a former novice of Shady Grove who left\nus years ago. It was not an amicable parting. His gifts lay… elsewhere.\nClearly he’s been exploring those gifts, and now he’s found a home for\nthem with the Blood Robes.\n“Trouble is, he recognized us. One of our scouts caught sight of him, last\nnight. He was carrying some scroll cases. We think he’s heading back to the\nmain army to report everything that happened here, both above and below\nthe falls. And, of course, who we are. Regardless, we get those papers, and\nwe get some idea of what they know.” He grunted, and it sounded like a\nbear huffing as it tore apart a fallen log, looking for grubs.\n“And you want to go after him,” Kip guessed.\n“One of our women who grew up here said she knows a river valley\nhe’ll have to pass through tonight. It’s narrow enough we can be sure he\nwon’t slip through our fingers there. After that, he’s gone. We don’t know\nexactly where the White King’s army is, and there are many paths available\nto him. Most of them not on the river. These skimmers are our biggest\nadvantage right now. Here’s our chance to use their speed.”\nKip looked to Cruxer for his take.\n“Anything we can do to minimize what the Blood Robes know about\nus…” the young commander said.\n“Can we go after him and still get back to Fechín Island the day after\ntomorrow?” Kip asked. He’d promised to meet the Cwn y Wawr there.\n“It’ll involve some backtracking, but… with the skimmers? Not a\nproblem,” Conn Arthur said.\nSo they skimmed up the wide river for a few hours. Kip noticed that one\nof the Ghosts with the conn—a newly established bodyguard—had a white\nspear etched with many yellowing runes. The leaf-blade of the spear was\nhellstone. “That a sharana ru spear?” Kip asked.\nThe young man looked immensely pleased. “My great-great-grandfather\nwas given it from the hand of Zee Oakenshield. He liked to say he should\nhave changed history with this spear. He coated the blade with poison\nbefore the battle, and during it, he stabbed Darien Guile in the arm, but it\nturned out the wise man who’d mixed the poisons was a charlatan—gave\nDarien nothing more than an itch for three days! Later my father served in\nDarien Guile and Selene Oakenshield’s household. Grandpa Sé said he was\nworried he’d be killed for that scratch when his betters made their peace\nand married. But the Guile laughed about it with him instead. Kept Grandpa\nSé close for many years. Even came when my great-great-grandfather was\non his deathbed and laughed with him about it one last time. Great man,\nDarien Guile. Wish our family could have stayed with yours through the\nBlood Wars, my lord.”\nThere had been so many back-and-forths in that interminable conflict\nthat Kip wasn’t even sure when the houses might have been pulled apart."

        "text": "Blood Wars, my lord.”\nThere had been so many back-and-forths in that interminable conflict\nthat Kip wasn’t even sure when the houses might have been pulled apart.\n“Well, the good news is that we’re on the same side again,” Kip said.\n“What’s your name?”\n“Garret, sir.”\n“Well, Garret, if you ever want a rapt audience who will ask you a\nmillion questions about that spear, talk to Ben-hadad. In fact, if you don’t\nwant to talk about it, you’ll probably have to hide.”\nJust then, there was a shout as one of the conn’s skimmers blew off one\nof its reeds.\nHalf an hour later, ashore, Ben-hadad hobbled over on one crutch and\nreported, “Repair shouldn’t take more than an hour.” He was taking the\nfailure personally.\nKip didn’t blame him. There was simply no way to expect reliable\ndrafting out of amateurs. He blamed the masters of Shady Grove. What the\nhell kind of drafters went their lives without drafting? Sure, you’d live for\nseventy years instead of forty or fifty, but a drafter was a candle. She was\nmade to bring light and be consumed in the process. These were candles\nwho lived and died having barely touched a flame.\nTo one who’d always heard that drafters were given their powers and\nprivileges for their communities’ betterment, it seemed astoundingly selfish.\nStill, in purely utilitarian terms, it did give him more of their drafting\nlives to use, if he could teach them quickly enough to keep them from\ngetting killed.\nKip didn’t want to split up the platoon if he could help it, so he\nconsulted with the woman who knew the valley Baoth would pass through,\nand decided they could lose two hours without losing their chance to catch\nit. Ben had asked for one.\n“You have an hour and a half,” he told Ben-hadad. Everything always\ntakes longer than you think it will.\nIn the meantime, as the others kindled a fire and made lunch and\nchecked their own skimmers for damage, Kip memorized maps and made\nplans for where they would beach the skimmers, who would stay with them,\nand how the rest would spread out through the woods. The Ghosts would\nlook for tracks to find the red wight’s trail if he was ahead. If they’d passed\nhim, they would prepare an ambush point. Otherwise they would wait until\nafter dark when he could no longer draft and set upon him at his camp.\nBaoth was a red, so Kip figured the wight would light a campfire to give\nhimself a source. It would make him much easier to find.\n“You’re confident in your trackers?” Kip asked the conn.\nThe conn nodded. “Not that I wouldn’t mind having me a Daimhin\nWeb.”\n“Daimhin Web?” Kip asked. There was an odd buzzing low in his ears at\nthe name.\n“Young man. Scary. Way over on the other side of Green Haven last I\nheard, though. In the old tongue, they call him Sealgaire na Scian.”\n“He Who Hunts with Knives?” Tisis asked.\nConn Arthur said, “I know it doesn’t sound very imposing, but—”\nBut it hit Kip between the eyes."

That was it. Something burning.\nNo, something that had been burning.\nKip opened his eyes and grabbed a stick from the fire. He stubbed it out\non the ground and walked away, wafting the smoking wood in front of him,\nconcentrating.\nAs with the first link of a chain, the rest came as he pulled on that. The\nsmell, the memory, was from a burning village.\nHe blinked. Blinked again. He went back to the fire to stand next to\nTisis. He murmured in her ear, “Was I gone for long, just now?”\n“What?” she asked. “No. A few heartbeats.”\nOh, good.\n“I’m sorry, but I must ask,” Conn Arthur said. “Are you ill? More to the\npoint, are you too ill to lead us?”\n“No, and no,” Kip said. “It was momentary, I’m better now. I must have\neaten something that disagreed with me last night.”\nWinsen cleared his throat behind his fist. “Didn’t sound like she\ndisagreed much.”\nThe rest of the Mighty cracked up.\n“Hey!” Kip said.\nIn a falsetto, as if in the throes of passion, Big Leo went, “Ah! Ah!”\nKip’s silver tongue failed him. He glanced at Tisis.\nHer color was high, but she shot back at Big Leo immediately, “Oh, you\nthink that was me?” She looked over at Kip significantly.\nThey burst out laughing.\n“Ah! Ah!…?” Big Leo said, somehow managing to append a question\nmark to his falsetto while giving Kip the side eye.\nKip nodded, taking his lumps. “Fine. Fine. I’ll practice making\nacceptably manly… ejaculations. Nightly. While you boys get to cuddle\nwith each other.”\n“Ooo,” Big Leo said.\n“That’s low, brother,” Winsen said. “Did Ferk tell you how Big Leo\nthrew his arm over me last night?”\n“No,” Tisis said. “What happened?”\n“I couldn’t get away! He wouldn’t wake up!”\n“A guy gets lonely,” Big Leo said defensively.\n“I need a new tent mate,” Winsen said. “Ferk? I know you snore, but I\ncan deal…”\n“That wasn’t snoring,” Cruxer said. “I do not know what it is. We all eat\nthe same food, but this man’s anus… If we could weaponize his farts…”\n“Those were farts?!” Big Leo said. “I thought we were being shot at!\nThey woke me up like six times!”"

So you were awake?” Winsen said. “Why\ndidn’t you let go of me?”\n“Oh, come on,” Ferkudi said, “maybe I fart a bit more than some of you.\nBut at least mine don’t stink.”\n“Ferk,” Tisis said, “I smelled you from our tent fifty paces away.”\n“Now you’re just piling on,” Ferkudi said. “Go on, have your fun, but I\ndon’t know why I always end up being the…” He trailed off as it dawned\non him. “Wait, I really am the butt of the Mighty, aren’t I? This is my\ndestiny.”\n“Why don’t you all go check with Ben-hadad if he needs anything,” Kip\nsaid. He just noticed that Conn Arthur hadn’t said a word in several\nminutes, since they started joking. Kip had been distracted by his friends,\nbut the man stood like a bear on its hind legs, staring at you, uncertain\nwhether to plop down on all fours and amble away or to charge you with\nsudden fury.\nTisis left last, giving him a kiss on the cheek and saying, “I’m sorry.\nThat was wicked of me. You’ll have to punish me later.”\n“Right. As if I’d punish you for…” Kip trailed off. “That was me\nmissing the point, wasn’t it?”\nShe winked at him and left, leaving Kip with the glowering giant.\nAs Kip studied him, though, he looked less angry and disapproving and\nmore bereft. This was a man to whom joy was only a memory.\nWhen he finally spoke, the conn said, “Congratulations on your\nnuptials.”\n“Thank you.”\n“We’re away from safe territory now. I think you pitching your tent\naway from the camp is a bad idea. You should be in the center of camp. You\nand your bride can carry on as you will. Our people aren’t shy about such\nthings.”\n“Right,” Kip said lamely. He’d thought the big man’s comments were\ngoing to be about something else entirely.\n“Sibéal was deeply impressed by what she witnessed last night.”\n“She was?” Kip said.\n“But I see that you’re still pretty young, too.”\nIt stung, of course, being slapped down by a big, imposing older man.\nHe was partly right, too. Sex jokes with his buddies? Or were they his\nbuddies? Shouldn’t they be his men? Shouldn’t he, their leader, demand\nmore respect?\nThe old Kip would have sucked that insult into his big old blubbery ego\nand gnawed on it, cracking apart bone and marrow of the insult and\neventually returning with his own mind made up.\nThat Kip hadn’t been all wrong. Because the opposite approach would\nbe to attack Conn Ruadhán Arthur in return. As any young blowhard would.\n“You’re not wrong,” Kip said. “But tell me, where’s saying that aloud to\nme come from? You’re a quiet man, and not stupid. Was that a test, or was it"

Was that a test, or was it\na friendly warning that your people distrust me because of my youth\nalready and I should be careful, or did it come from some bitterness at our\ncamaraderie?”\nThe conn looked at Kip through tight blue eyes. He stroked his red, red\nbeard. “It was a test. I didn’t have it all laid out sly-like. Just had a thought\nand wanted to see if you’d lose your temper if I said it to your face,” he\nsaid. “I don’t know what kind of man you are, Kip Guile. But you make me\nnervous. You led us to a great victory at Deora Neamh. Maybe a small\nvictory in size, but strategically important and flawlessly planned, and you\ndid it immediately after we joined you, which inspires us. How’d you do\nthat?”\n“I’ve read some books,” Kip said.\nTruth was, he had read Corvan’s books—but not like fifty of them.\nMaybe four. What he’d done at Deora Neamh wasn’t exactly forging new\nmilitary doctrine: a diversionary raid was pretty basic, and though he’d\nnever read about anyone’s using superviolet flares for communication, he\nsurely couldn’t be the first to come up with it.\nBut he’d also absorbed a lot of cards, a lot of memories. Surely among\nthem must be some of the greatest tacticians of all time. Kip knew he\nshould feel worried about dead men in his head.\nExcept they weren’t like invaders. The memories sat on one shelf in the\nlibrary of his mind, and he knew which memories were his and which were\nnot. He felt no more threatened by those memories than by a vivid book.\nWell, usually.\nSuddenly passing out because he’d stepped through an unseen trip wire\nof Daimhin Web’s memories was unnerving. And could maybe be\ndangerous if it happened in the middle of battle or something. But mostly it\njust was. For once he didn’t overthink it.\nIf he could find a tactician in his head and plunder that man’s thinking in\norder to save his life and his friends, to Kip that didn’t feel any different\nfrom studying General Corvan Danavis’s tactics during the False Prism’s\nWar: sure, it felt a little strange to scrutinize someone close to you by the\nsame standards you applied to the greats of history, but you got over it.\n“You read some books,” Conn Arthur said flatly.\n“Father Violet himself said he learned all he knew of fighting from\nbooks, and that he fought his last battle by the same tactics he’d used to win\nhis first. The art isn’t knowing what to do, it’s knowing exactly what your\npeople can do, and getting them to do it at the right time. I haven’t been\ntested on those parts at all.”\n“So despite our effortless victory, you’re worried you don’t know what\nyou’re doing.”\n“We got lucky. And I’m worried it won’t scale. That my skills won’t\ngrow as quickly as our army does.”\nThe conn snorted. “That’s what you’re afraid of.”\n“Why’s that funny?” Kip asked."

        "text": "grow as quickly as our army does.”\nThe conn snorted. “That’s what you’re afraid of.”\n“Why’s that funny?” Kip asked.\n“Because it hasn’t even occurred to you to be afraid that no one will join\nyou. I can’t tell if your total expectation of success is a function of your\nyouth and inexperience, or insanity, or a deserved confidence. Oddest of all,\nI’m not sure it matters at this point.”\n“But,” Kip said.\n“But it will matter later,” Conn Arthur said. He seemed as if he wasn’t\nsure he wanted to say it. He wasn’t trying to make Kip angry now. He was\ndeeply worried. “Someday we’ll face the White King himself or one of his\ngenerals, and I don’t want that day to be the day we find out it really was\nmadness or youth all along.”\n“That’s a lot of anxiety for you to tie up around some puerile jokes,” Kip\nsaid.\n“It’s not just the contents of the jokes. It’s that you’re joking. You’re\nenjoying yourself out here,” Conn Arthur said.\n“I was,” Kip said lightly.\nBut the conn’s point sank deep.\nPerhaps the hairy bear of a man mistook how quickly Kip could shift\nfrom jokey to thoughtful, though. The conn said in a way that made it clear\nhe was quoting someone, “‘A man who loves war will be feared by his foes;\nhe should be feared by his friends.’”\nKip had been careless. Conn Arthur looked like a badass warrior. He\nwould, if he lived long enough, probably become one. But he’d probably\nnever fought until yesterday. The man was shaken. He didn’t understand\nwhat it does to you to see a pile of fresh heads stacked in a pyramid, what it\nmeant to find half your friend’s leg lying on your pack or to laugh as a\nmusket ball snapped past your ear because hearing that snap meant they’d\nmissed. He hadn’t seen how precious any laughter at all is, because\nsometimes, at the campfire, a laugh was the only thing that kept you from\nthinking too hard about that thing you’d seen or that thing you’d done.\nBut Kip had been careless. Part of a warrior’s duty was to remember\nwhat it had been to be a civilian. To protect that innocence, and not sneer at\nit.\nKip recognized the quote. “Erastophenes, Tactics, the fourth scroll, if I\nrecall correctly?”\nThe conn shook his head. He didn’t know where it was from.\n“It’s from the conclusion in the sixth scroll, actually,” Kip said. “You\npass. I’m glad to see you’re not a man who pretends to know what he\ndoesn’t. At least in some things.”\n“You’re testing me now?” Conn Arthur said.\n“Have you heard the quote from Veliki Eden: ‘It is well that war is so\nterrible, or we should grow too fond of it’? Do you think he was kidding?”\n“I’ve heard it,” the conn said. “I’ve always taken that to mean that to\ntheir sorrow, men are fools, ever rushing to arms.”\n“I take it different: war is hell, but hell’s where all my friends are.”\nConn Arthur looked pensive. “Time will tell which of us is right."

I only hope for us all that your knowledge becomes wisdom\npainlessly. Your pardon, Lord Guile.”\nKip nodded, surprised that the man would ask to be dismissed. But\nbefore he had gone far, the conn stopped and turned back.\n“One last thing. As I said, my people aren’t shy about matters of the root\nand cave… but a little consideration for those trying to sleep nearby does go\na long way.”\n“Right,” Kip said. Root and cave? Oh. “Right!”\nWhen the hour and a half had passed, Ben-hadad hadn’t yet fixed the\nfirst skimmer, and he’d also found other potentially catastrophic cracks on\nthree of the other skimmers.\nKip elected to leave them behind, and headed out with only four\nskimmers loaded with the best fighters. Tisis stayed behind. She said, “I’m\nmore use to you as an ear and tongue than as another gun.” She looked\nmomentarily perplexed. “Not that that was supposed to rhyme.”\n“Such things occur from time to time.”\n“Very funny, you’re such a tease,” she said.\n“You know I always aim to please.” He frowned. What the hell? “I know\nthat’s the kind of silly thing I’d do,” Kip said, “but I swear I didn’t intend…\nto.”\nHe blinked. “That also wasn’t my intent—”\n“It’s fine, my dear, I know what you…” She seemed to struggle to form\na different word. Then in defeat, she said, “… meant. Kip, what’s going\non?”\n“I don’t know, but the effect is strong. Let—”\n“Superviolet!” she said.\nIt seemed the first line could be anything, but as if in some inescapable\nchain of cause to effect, it was impossible not to follow it with a rhyming\ncouplet. Slant rhymes worked. How about if you ended a line with a word\nthat didn’t have a rhyme? Oh… superviolet! She hadn’t simply meant to\nrhyme with let; she meant he needed to look at superviolet!\nHe narrowed his eyes to the superviolet spectrum and saw the color\nstorm whipping past them in ordered violence. Like a mechanical octopus,\nevery arm articulated with a million hinges, the storm swept the camp, but\neach segment of the arm moved only in right angles.\nKip handed his superviolet lenses to Tisis so she could see it, too.\nA few people were looking up around the camp, quizzical looks on their\nfaces. Of those who were moving about, they too were moving only in the\nsame straight lines.\nThe superviolet was everywhere.\nAnd then, before he could even say anything, it was gone.\n“Are you okay?” Tisis asked.\n“Why?” he asked.\n“Because it all swirled around you in a weird funnel cloud before it\ndisappeared.”\n“It did?” He’d thought it was everywhere, but then, if he had been in the\nmiddle of a cloud of it, he would have.\n“It was like it was looking for you.”\nAnd it found me.\nChapter 43"

And\nfour parts cowardice.\nTeia flicked on only the blue and superviolet lights as she came into the\nPrism’s practice room again. She’d taken to training more and more here\nwhile she marshaled her courage to talk to Gav Greyling.\nFine, while she avoided talking to Gav Greyling.\nShe tried not to come here too much, but the practice room had become\nher haven. There were good memories here, and light controls, and mirrors,\nand privacy—all the necessary ingredients to practice light splitting.\nShe tried not to come here too much, but she didn’t try very hard.\nWith the master cloak, invisibility had become stunningly simple. She\nput it on, opened herself to paryl, and it did the rest, flawlessly.\nAh, blessed, blessed invisibility.\nThere were still things to be aware of. She was invisible, not silenced.\nShe still left footprints. If she pulled the cloak over her eyes, she was blind\nherself, so in well-lit areas, she had to stare down at her feet and only steal\nglimpses up, knowing her disembodied eyes might appear to anyone who\nhappened to be looking in just the right place. The cloak was long enough\nto cover her feet, but any movement that displaced it, such as running or\ndescending stairs, could expose her legs. Also, its length meant that it\nbrushed the ground. Any dirt it picked up from the ground, it carried,\nvisibly.\nSimilarly, if she didn’t launder it regularly, the dust it picked up from the\nair slowly made it less effective. Of course, slaves did all the laundry in the\nChromeria, and of course, Teia wasn’t going to let the master cloak out of\nher sight, so she had to figure out ways to launder it herself. Sometimes in\nthis very room.\nShe’d even prepared her lies: the washboard was good for hand strength,\nthose incompetents had torn her cloak the last time, she kind of enjoyed a\nsimple task like this…\nWeak lies, and she’d not had to use them yet.\nBut after much practice, the cloak had become simply another tool. It\nenabled things impossible without it, and it had limitations, but it quickly\nbecame a known quantity. It wasn’t a sword or spear that required years of\nstudy to master, it was more like a pair of boots: you figured out what grip\nthey gave you, you broke them in, and then you forgot about them.\nWhat was more interesting for Teia than learning how to use it was\ntrying to learn how it worked. She’d put on a single red light in the practice\nroom, and use the cloak, then extend her will into the cloak to discern how\nit was splitting that red light. Then she’d repeat with orange, then yellow,\nthen green, then blue, for hours.\nIt had yielded interesting discoveries over the months of practice since\nKip left, if not the ones she was looking for. First, with a cloud of paryl gas\nsurrounding her, Teia became the next best thing to a superchromat. The gas\nitself was a filter like polarized glass. It filtered blues into the perfect blue"

It filtered blues into the perfect blue\nfor making blue luxin, filtered reds into the perfect red for making red luxin,\nand so forth. If she held a bubble of paryl gas perfectly so that it covered\none eye, she could look at any luxin and tell how well it had been drafted: if\nit looked and felt exactly the same to each eye, it had been drafted perfectly,\nand therefore probably by a superchromat.\nShe was sure there were handy applications for her discoveries, but she\nwasn’t sure what they were, and there was no one she could really ask. The\nonly one she’d really come up with was that, if she remembered to draft a\nparyl cloud, she could now differentiate red and green. She still couldn’t see\nthem as different, though, so it was a cold comfort.\nOne day she was sitting on the floor of the practice room. Always fearful\nof interruptions, she’d run through the obstacle course a few times first to\nwork up a sweat, and now she sat as if winded, wearing her skimpiest\nworkout attire. The point was to have as much skin exposed as possible.\nShe had to feel the colors, and dammit if that wasn’t taking a lot of practice.\nSo she sat on the floor, nearly naked but sweaty, so that if anyone came in\nshe could pass for someone just cooling from her exertions.\nThis new life of hers was always lies and preparations for lies.\nShe had her eyes closed and a headband functioning as a blindfold,\nevery sense attuned to the blue (perhaps?) light, when she heard a hiss as of\nescaping gas. Her eyes snapped open and she pushed the headband back up\nher into unruly hair. She grabbed her tunic and looked toward the door.\nNothing.\nShe widened her eyes to paryl and saw paryl gas dissipating. Teia\njumped to her feet, pulling on her tunic, eyes darting to the master cloak\nhanging on its hook by the door. She expected that paryl gas to come\nquesting out toward her. It had to be Master Sharp looking to see if she was\nin the room.\nBut it did nothing instead.\nShe moved to the door, and heard only retreating footsteps. She pulled\non long trousers and, after one moment of indecision, grabbed her cloak.\nThere was someone disappearing down the hall. Not Master Sharp. But at\nher feet, there was a wineskin. Its spout had been pushed under the door,\nand then it had been stomped flat, expelling the paryl gas within. Teia\npicked it up. In tiny script, but undoubtedly Master Sharp’s hand, there was\none word: “Follow.”\nOh hells! Here it was. Finally.\nSwallowing hard once, Teia ran on silent feet after the man. She caught\nsight of him quickly. She’d been right. It wasn’t Murder Sharp. Just a slave.\nHe had a paryl mark floating above him, invisible to anyone’s eyes except\nTeia’s.\nThe man walked to the servants’ stairs, and up. Teia followed at a\ndiscreet distance.

        "text": "discreet distance. In the entrance hall, his paryl mark abruptly blinked out.\nIt happened, of course. Paryl was so fragile that the slightest brush\nwould usually shatter it, and that was especially true of the lighter-than-air\ngel marks appended to targets. Teia kept the man in sight, but within\nmoments the mark bloomed over a slave woman.\nWhat the hell?\nTeia followed the woman as she headed outside. Teia put on her dark\nspectacles so she could continue glancing in paryl intermittently in the\nbright light without blinding herself. Mercifully, she didn’t look out of place\nwith them on. It was a bright, blustery, cool day. Distant clouds dotted the\nheavens like harbingers of the autumn coming on.\nJust after the Lily’s Stem, the paryl mark passed from the slave woman\nto a merchant heading down a side street.\nThis time Teia was ready. Marking someone with paryl required that the\nparyl drafter be nearby.\nBut Sharp was either being terribly devious, or he was using his own\nshimmercloak, because Teia never saw him.\nEventually she ended up in front of a tiny, run-down house in the Tyrean\nquarter with a paryl “Enter” written on the door.\nDrawing a surreptitious dagger to conceal behind a wrist, she knocked.\nIt opened and Sharp grinned at her through his exquisite white teeth. He\nbeckoned her inside, but made her step close past him. Orholam, how he\nmade her skin crawl. He sniffed as she slipped past him.\nHe closed the door. “Are we forgetting our mint?” he asked. “Not to\nmention the parsley.” He took her face in his hands, his manicured fingers\non each of her cheeks, angling her chin up, a gesture all too intimate for her\ntaste. He smelled her breath. Grimaced as if she’d farted straight in his face.\nSlapped her gently.\nThe gentleness made it almost worse.\n“You know what we do, Adrasteia?” he asked. “Stealth. Stealth is what\nwe do. Well, it’s the necessary building block for what we do. You know\nwhat’s not stealthy? Haltonsis. Haltonsis isn’t sneaky, Teia. Might as well\nchew garlic.”\nHe meant ‘halitosis.’ Moron.\nBut Teia didn’t say anything. Moron Sharp might be, but he was a\ndangerous one.\nMoron Sharp.\nTeia almost grinned at her new mental nickname for him. She couldn’t\nbe afraid of someone she had a stupid nickname for, right?\n“What’s that?” he asked.\n“I, um, I did it on purpose. I’ve been wondering if you were ever going\nto check in with me again. So I thought it’d be funny if when you did, I had\nstinky breath.”\n“Cute,” he said. “Don’t be cute.”\n“I’m sorry, I—”\nHe slugged her in the stomach. She dropped, gasping. He grabbed a\nhandful of her short hair and drew back a fist. But then he paused. He\npushed her lips around, looking at her teeth.\n“Ah, that’s right,” he said. He ran a tongue around his own teeth and let\nher go. “Sit.”"

He ran a tongue around his own teeth and let\nher go. “Sit.”\nThere was only one small chair and a small bed in this room. There was\na coil of rope hanging off the back of the chair. All Teia’s old fears came\nalive at the sight of it, but she sat. What could she do against Sharp\nanyway?\nHe bound her to the chair expertly, quietly whistling to himself.\nExcellent whistler. After he finished, he looked at himself in a tiny mirror\non the wall. He checked his dentures, mostly, moving his jaw this way and\nthat, smiling broadly or just cocking his lip up to reveal a tooth in a faux\ngrin, looking at the teeth from different angles.\n“We have a problem,” he said, not turning from the mirror. He touched a\ndogtooth with his tongue. “You didn’t tag anyone for me to kill.”\nTeia had known this was coming. Had been dreading it for a long time\nnow.\n“Why? Lose your nerve? Or are you not quite what you represented to\nthe Order? Perhaps a spy?” he asked as if inquiring after the weather.\nSo Sharp had been intended to be the murderer if she’d tagged someone.\nThat suggested that he was the only other Shadow that the Order had on Big\nJasper.\n“I did tag someone,” Teia said. “Did the assassin never find him?”\n“That’s impossible. Did you tag him poorly? Perhaps you tagged him\npoorly on purpose?”\nOf course, this gambit had meant casting aspersions on the skills of\nwhoever followed her. Now that Murder Sharp had suggested it was he, that\ngot dangerous.\n“No, but I did try to be tricky. I wanted to see how good my tail was. I\ndidn’t know it was going to be you.”\nSharp stopped looking at his teeth. He turned around, and for an instant,\nTeia thought she saw fear in his eyes. He was, Teia realized, terrified of\nanything that would threaten his value in the Old Man’s eyes. “I’d been up\nfor two days straight, but you were only out of my sight for perhaps an hour\n—surely not…?”\n“The night of my vigil?” Teia asked.\n“Anat’s cunt!” Sharp said.\nAnd that gave Teia another peek at one of Sharp’s cards: Sharp himself\ndidn’t have sources among the few Blackguards who’d been around on her\nvigil. That was good to know. She was always slowly compiling a list of\nBlackguards she knew she could trust.\nOf course, Sharp’s not having a source wasn’t the same as the Order’s\nnot having a source. But every little bit of information helped.\n“I wasn’t gone long,” Teia said. “Because I changed my mind.”\n“Wait? You took the tag off?” Sharp asked. He sounded angry and yet\nrelieved, too. If he’d missed a tag because she’d removed it, it wasn’t his\nfault, was it?\nOn the one hand, it was nice to see him scared; on the other, it was good\nto see him relieved. On the third, impossible hand, Teia was crossing a\nperson Murder Sharp was terrified of.\nTeia said, “The rules made it all pointless, didn’t they?” Bitter girl,"

On the third, impossible hand, Teia was crossing a\nperson Murder Sharp was terrified of.\nTeia said, “The rules made it all pointless, didn’t they?” Bitter girl,\nhateful, spiteful, right?\n“What rules?”\n“I couldn’t kill anyone important. I mean, I briefly considered killing\nsomeone who’d irritated me who was close to someone important like that\nasshole slave Grinwoody, but I figured there was a good chance the Old\nMan would take that as me being impudent if not disobedient, so why risk\nit? And then I thought that if I wanted anyone who wasn’t that important\ndead, I can do it myself now. I mean, it would be easiest if I have the\nshimmercloak—which I’d like to start learning to use better, thanks—but\neven without it, I could start throwing paryl crystals into someone’s blood\nuntil they die. No one can find it except you, so no one can catch me. So if\nI’ve got a favor coming to me from the Order, I’m going to save it for when\nit matters.”\n“One doesn’t save up favors from the Old Man. You obey or you take\nthe consequences.” Sharp scowled. “He told me how to deal with you if\nyou’d been disobedient or if you’d betrayed us… but this is something\ndifferent. He’ll be irritated. But I guess he’ll have to deal with it himself.”\n“Himself? What’s that mean?”\n“I’m leaving,” Murder Sharp said. By the way he said it, it was clear he\nmeant for a long time.\n“Where are you going? I thought you were going to train me!”\n“It’s war. Plans change. The Old Man isn’t pleased, but there’s word that\nthere’s a Third Eye.”\n“What’s that? What’s that mean?”\n“A prophetess. A true prophetess. Apparently for a long time she was\nsafely out of the way on Seers Island where she couldn’t tell anyone\nanything, but now she’s out in the satrapies, helping the Chromeria with the\nwar. You might be able to guess how important someone who can see the\nfuture would be to either side.”\n“Pretty damn,” Teia said.\n“That’s right. So that’s where I come in.”\n“Isn’t it going to be a bit hard to get close to someone who can see the\nfuture? I mean, you’d figure she’d protect herself, right?”\nSharp sucked spit through his dentures. “Smart one, aren’t you?”\nShit. Teia was supposed to be playing dumb. “I’m not trying to be wise,”\nTeia said, placating. He might punch her again, if not do something worse.\n“The cloaks,” Sharp said.\n“The cloaks?”\n“Her powers are all connected to light, turns out. The Order’s known\nabout her kind for centuries. She can’t See the future, past, or present of\nanyone who wears the cloaks. Course, the Seers know that we know, which\nis why they usually stay on their island sequestered away from our blades.\nGavin Guile brought an end to that. So I guess we can blame this on him.\nBut them Seers gotta know their place.”\nTeia felt sick to her stomach. “So what’s the plan? Kidnap her and sell"

Hold her somewhere and make her work for\nyou?” Maybe Teia shouldn’t give them ideas.\n“Too dangerous. How do you outwit someone who can see the future?\nYou can’t. We gotta kill her.”\nIt shouldn’t have shocked Teia, this blithe talk of assassinating someone.\nIt was what she was here for, after all. To learn, to become part of the plans,\nand then upend them on the Order’s head. But… he was going to kill this\nwoman. It was just work to him.\n“Thanks,” Teia said.\n“Thanks?”\n“For telling me. Like you trust me.”\n“Eh.” He shrugged, and finally started working at the knots to untie her.\n“It’s lonely work. No one to talk to. No one to appreciate it when you’ve\ndone good, you know? Shadows usually work in twos, maybe for just that.\nSo you know, I asked that you be promoted to be my second.”\n“Really?” Teia said. She was oddly flattered.\n“The Old Man said you aren’t ready yet. It’s why you won’t get to keep\nthe Fox cloak, at least not unless he’s got a job for you.”\n“What? I earned that cloak.” Inside, though, Teia was delighted. As long\nas they thought she had no cloak at all, they wouldn’t be on the lookout for\nher doing the things that only a cloak allowed her to do; being known not to\nhave a cloak made her invisible to the Order.\n“He wants to hide himself from her, of course. He needs the cloak for\nthat.”\n“So does that mean I’m never getting the cloak back? He’s going to\nwear it all the time?”\n“We know she needs direct sunlight to do her… Seeing? Seering? So if\nyou do jobs, you’ll likely go after sunset and have to return the cloak before\ndawn. If you do well, after she’s dead, you’ll get to keep your own then.\nYour own fault, though, you shoulda found the other cloak they recovered.”\nTeia raised her hands. “It wasn’t there.”\n“I know. We believe you about that. We’ve had the White’s room turned\ninside out, looking for hiding spots. Went through all your shit, too. Best\nguess is that she hid it somewhere and didn’t tell anyone where before she\ndied. The Old Man thinks she kept the Fox cloak to study it, thinking that\nno one could use a cloak that short. Or maybe she knew about the cloaks\nand hoped to teach you how to use it herself, someday. Loved to study\nthings, she did.”\n“Whoa,” Teia said. “She never said anything to me about that. Swear.”\n“Death does tend to interrupt plans. It’s why we do what we do.\nAnyway, the Old Man will be handling you directly from now on. I’ll fill\nyou in on your drops and how he’ll signal you, or how you can signal him\nin an emergency.”\nHe did, using much of the same tradecraft that Teia already knew from\nworking with Karris. It all left Teia’s mind whirling, though. She’d be\nmeeting directly with the Old Man of the Desert?"

She’d be\nmeeting directly with the Old Man of the Desert?\nAfter so long of nothing, it was hope. She might actually cut off the\nOrder at the head.\nIf she was smart, she’d need to do it before the Third Eye was killed. In\nthe meantime, she’d have to pass word about all of this to the Iron White.\n“There’s just one more thing,” Murder Sharp said. “You’re still pretty\nuseless with paryl. It’s my fault, I know. I haven’t been able to come around\nand teach you like I should. But it’s war. Everything is different now.\nNothing is as we’d like. In the basement here is the solution to your\nproblem.”\n“Solution?” Teia asked. Her chest tightened.\n“There’s a slave down there. An old man. Won’t be missed. Practice on\nhim. The paralysis pinches, the lung clots, the seizures. When you’ve\nlearned as much as you can before your next shift, kill him. With paryl if\nyou can. There’ll be a new slave down there every few weeks. Do try to\nlearn fast. Murder practice ain’t like other practice. Every body we have to\nget rid of puts someone’s life in danger.”\nAnd then he left.\nMurder practice. Dear Orholam. Teia looked at the doorway to the\nbasement stairs as if it were the mouth of hell itself.\nShe reached to squeeze the vial of oil she kept at her neck, but it was no\nlonger there.\nChapter 44\nThe woods sang a song Kip had never known. The ponderosas swayed and\nshyly sighed as frogs croaked in chaotic chorus, descants of squirrels\nsoaring high above all like preening sopranos while the wind danced past,\nher tresses brushing his cheek as she spun, leafy skirts flaring, willowy legs\nflashing.\nThe evening chill held him back from the floor, putting a hand upon his\nthudding heart. Be still, my dear, be still.\nThe last drop of rain pressed a shushing finger across his lips.\nMade pliant by the rain’s caresses, the earth pulled back her leafy covers\nlike a beckoning lover, and the scent of their love filled the house of sky.\n“Kip?” Conn Arthur whispered. “My lord, are you well?”\nKip came back to himself. “I’m eccentric, Conn Arthur,” he said, very\nquietly, “eccentric.” Not crazy.\n“Never mistook you for concentric, sir.”\nKip grinned. A wit, in a bear?\nOn the other hand, he was probably the last person who should judge a\nperson’s mind by the flesh suit it wore.\nThey were fanning out through the woods here as the late afternoon\npassed, looking for signs of the spy. They had docked not twenty paces\nback, and it had taken only that much distance for Kip to be overwhelmed\nby a sense of homecoming.\nNot his own homecoming. Daimhin Web’s. He nodded to Conn Arthur,\nand, spreading out with twenty others for a distance of three hundred paces,\nthey began ghosting through the woods."

        "text": "Not his own homecoming. Daimhin Web’s. He nodded to Conn Arthur,\nand, spreading out with twenty others for a distance of three hundred paces,\nthey began ghosting through the woods.\nDaimhin Web was from a village long lauded for its skillful hunters.\nAmong the best of them, there was a test, an impossible test, to sneak up on\na deer and touch it with your bare hand. Many young men tried for years,\nlearning everything from their elders about scent and silence and silhouettes\nand the sweet subterfuge of stalking; they meditated on water and wind and\nall the ways of the wood and weather. They became satraps of silence,\nconns of camouflage, paragons of patience.\nAnd friends of frustration.\nThose were all traits invaluable to the master hunters they became, for\non the path that led to that test and that failure, they were molded into the\ngreatest stalkers known to man.\nAnd this time, unlike any other time he’d been in the cards, Kip could\nremember exactly how Web did what he did.\nAs he moved through the woods, though, it became clear that\nremembering the mechanics of an action was different from learning it in\nyour own body. Moving silently was itself the culmination of dozens of\ndiscrete skills, practiced separately and then together for so long that the\nstalker could do them without thinking. Scouting was a set of different but\nparallel skills: paying attention to the wind, to the sounds of the animals,\nknowing each kind and knowing to what each kind reacted and how: this\nbird goes silent when it notices animals, this kind takes flight when a\npredator or outsider is within this distance, these squirrels turn toward those\nthey scold.\nTo pay attention to all those while tracking and using scent as well was\nsimply beyond Kip.\nBy living the card and remembering all that was in it, he was instantly\ntwice as adept as he had been before—he could now understand what made\nthe master masterful, but that didn’t make him a master himself. Kip could\nsuddenly identify all the smells in his nostrils, but his nose wasn’t as\nnaturally keen as Web’s, nor his body so light and lean. Web could bend\nbranches with a step that Kip’s big tread would crush.\nBut what a man! Web’s first hand brush against a deer’s flank had been\npartly luck. While he’d been stalking the deer, a running javelina had\nstartled it toward him, so he’d not had to close the last ten impossible feet\nby stealth.\nAnother man would have taken his bragging rights and never looked\nback. Web had instead redoubled his efforts. This at fourteen years of age.\nHe’d succeeded twice more by the time he was sixteen, and when a rival\ncalled him a liar for his claims—no hunter had ever succeeded three times\n—Web had left his village with only a knife and gone to stalk the legendary\nwhite stag.\nIt took him a month of living on bugs and berries, but he’d slain it with\none stroke of his knife. He’d dragged the body—intact, not gutted—all the\nleagues back to his village so that none could deny he’d taken the white\nstag with only a knife.\nFor anyone else, taking a white stag at all would have been a tale to tell\nfor the rest of his life."

Nearly everyone was dead.\nThe famed hunters could have fled, but none had been content to leave\nthe old and the young and the infirm to die.\nThey’d stayed, they’d fought, and they’d been massacred by the Blood\nRobes. Only a few cowards had fled.\nWeb hunted the cowards first, including the man who had called him a\nliar.\nNow he stalked the Blood Robes in the deep woods of western Blood\nForest. In military terms, his killings didn’t make much of a strategic\ndifference. He killed only one man or one wight at a time, and always used\nonly his knife or his bare hands. He spent days setting up a strike, and his\ntarget would simply disappear.\nBut not disappear forever. A camp of the White King’s men had woken\none morning to find their kidnapped leader in the middle of their own camp.\nHe was skinned, gutted, his throat cut, and hanging upside down from a tree\nlimb as meat is hung to cure by a butcher.\nThe men in that camp weren’t simple foreign soldiers with lax\ndiscipline; they were locals who knew the land here; they were the White\nKing’s best scouts.\nDaimhin Web had murdered their leader simply to embarrass them.\nFrom time to time, he would show up in friendly villages or towns laden\nwith gems or gold or coin sticks he’d taken from his kills. He would give\nthese to the town’s conn. He wanted nothing in return, not even the steel\nfishhooks or sugar or salt or whisky that other long-term trappers or hunters\nwould have traded for. He simply gave them the valuables because he knew\nthey would need money to rebuild their lives. And he would tell them the\ndisposition of the White King’s forces and the direction in which they were\nheading—usually toward that village.\nHe asked for nothing, and seemed not to care if they heeded his advice.\nHe spoke with a gentle voice and then disappeared. He became like a forest\ncreature, and his eyes were soft and skittish, not what you would expect of a\npredator who skinned and gutted men.\nHe was content to live alone, and he had become a beast.\nAnd now Kip was doing his best to emulate him, though it was more and\nmore obvious that he’d had too much confidence that he could ape such\nperfection, moving through the dusky woods searching for the red wight\nBaoth.\nThis wight was so far into his transformation that Kip suddenly smelled\nhim—the tobacco-and-tea-leaves scent of his red luxin and the slight whiff\nof smoke.

He couldn’t have\nlived an archer’s card, could he?\nNah, that would have been far too helpful.\nOf course, at least one of the people in the cards must have been an\namazing archer. More than one, surely, with so many warriors represented.\nIn fact, Web himself had to be more than competent with a bow, but did Kip\nreally want to sift Daimhin Web’s memories further? The first thing that\ncame to mind when he pulled those memories farther off the shelf was the\nsight of the charred bodies of Web’s favorite little cousins. No thanks.\nThe next great warrior Kip could easily recall was Tremblefist, and\nthough Kip had nothing but compassion for the man who’d lived and died a\nhero, fair or not, the memory that leapt out was of the Butcher of Aghbalu.\nDouble no thanks.\nKip came over a rise and knew that something was wrong. You can’t let\nyour mind wander while you’re tracking. He’d defaulted to being his\noverthinking self—and now the wight was gone, and Kip was alone.\nIn his reverie, Kip hadn’t even realized how he’d picked up the trail.\nMaybe Daimhin Web had sunk in deeper than he’d realized.\nThat didn’t matter now. Too much thinking!\nIn cresting of the rise, he’d skylined himself—putting his darker\nsilhouette against the lighter forest behind him.

It might have a flint and steel to\nscratch sparks onto each flammable missile, but that was like a musketeer\ngoing into battle with musket unloaded. Few warriors were daring enough\nto trade strength for stealth, especially not passionate reds.\nAs he moved back to the crest of the hill, Kip guessed at the fireball’s\ntrajectory from where he had been standing and where the fireball had hit\nthe trees behind him.

Kip’s studies had\ntold him exactly how much sizzling and popping a flame of that size would\nmake, and thus how loud it would be. Over this distance, in this jungle that\nhe knew so intimately? Kip could guess exactly how much noise his own\npassage through the undergrowth could make without the wight’s hearing\nhim.\nWithin half a minute, he’d flanked the wight, who was now moving\nstealthily toward where Kip had been. Baoth had further banked the flame\nhe carried, making his right hand an inverted bowl like a hooded lantern.\nHow was he drafting so much with this light, though?\nAnd then Kip saw how, and he was baffled that no one had ever\nexplained it.

This wight had copious amounts of\nimperfect red luxin encasing his entire body, so he could flash it back into\nred light that he could then draft. It was inefficient to draft from broken\nluxin, but this meant a wight could never be trapped powerless in darkness.\nEffectively, it carried its own mag torches in its body. And, come daylight,\nit could easily replenish itself.\nThe Mighty, like all the Chromeria, had discounted the accounts they’d\nheard of nighttime attacks. Drafters would never attack at night, they\nthought. They’d thought wrong, and it could have been a disastrous\nmistake.\nBut too much thinking, again.\nKip had lost the blue in all his running and loss of concentration. The\nfletching of his arrows had been fouled with mud from his roll on the\nground. How accurate would they be?\nHe swapped through the spectacles on his left hip, drafting some\nsuperviolet—he didn’t need much—and then some red, each color sending\na new glimmer of light into the Turtle-Bear tattoo. In sub-red, Kip looked\nfor any forest creatures. All I need is just one squirrel, dammit.\nBut there were none.\nHave to do this the old-fashioned way.\nWith his left hand, he pushed a veritable ice carpet of superviolet\nwebbing forward through the undergrowth. Superviolet was so light and\nweak that any particular strand of it could break easily, so he took the Gavin\nGuile approach: more is better. He needed only one continuous section to\nproject his will through the luxin. With his right hand, he picked up a rock\nand threw it deep into the woods off to one side. It was unlike his usual\nKipliness that this time, he didn’t hit the first branch and spoil the whole\neffect.\nThe whisper of the falling rock in the undergrowth froze the wight, who\nlooked first for an attack, and then for prey.\nThe pause was long enough. Kip’s web of superviolet spread as far as\nthe red wight’s feet, up its ankles, and to the inevitable seams between the\nsolid luxin plates of its feet and its calves."

Kip’s web of superviolet spread as far as\nthe red wight’s feet, up its ankles, and to the inevitable seams between the\nsolid luxin plates of its feet and its calves.\nA man wasn’t made to have an exoskeleton. Skin moved and flexed in\nways that solid plates didn’t allow. The solutions most wights came up with\nwere taken directly from armorers: painstakingly articulated joints, or\nchain-mail meshes, or bulky straps and prayer. This wight was floating an\nentire layer of open red luxin underneath his armor so that he could use it\nfor fuel, and so his skin could move.\nWith his left hand seeking the open red luxin, Kip reached his will\nthrough the superviolet, while his right hand sent a tiny bolus of a\nfirecrystal through the superviolet toward his target.\nEvery plate of the wight’s armor would have knots—places where the\nmagic had been sealed. Naturally, they would be on the protected inside.\nKip was planning to unknot all the plates at once, but before he could reach\nthem, the wight started to move.\nKip threw his will hard into the wight’s open red luxin. He pulled it all\ntoward the wight’s chest, twisting hard. Its chest plate cracked with a snap\nat the same moment the firecrystal reached the wight’s feet. Kip popped the\nfirecrystal up, and, exposed to the air, the crystal flared and sparked.\nCovered completely in a mess of open red luxin, the wight went up in\nflames.\nBut that wasn’t enough. Kip ran forward, nocking an arrow.\nThe wight reacted first as a man would, slapping at the flames, terrified.\nSo it wasn’t so far gone yet, or so smart. He could have drafted off his own\nflames and covered himself in more and more red luxin until it made a crust\n—it was difficult to burn a red drafter to death, if he was thinking.\nKip couldn’t give Baoth time to think. He loosed the first arrow a mere\nten paces away. Drew another, loosed it. Drew another, loosed.\nThe wight screamed, a pillar of fire in the dark woods. He flung out a\nhand, and Kip leapt aside.\nA gout of flaming oily red luxin went out from the wight, splattering and\nburning trees and bushes in a wide arc. It passed over Kip’s head. Then,\nweakening, the wight threw one more burst of liquid death upward.\nBy the time the flaming goo dropped to the ground, the wight was dead.\nIt had become a charred pillar of blackened luxin, still-burning patches of\nred luxin, and steaming bits of seared human flesh and white bone peeking\nout like gore candles.\nWithin minutes, drawn by Kip’s oh-so-subtle signal fire, the Mighty\narrived, along with Conn Arthur and a few trackers.\n“So,” the conn said, looking around the forest punctuated with burning\nclumps of red luxin around this epicenter of destruction, “I’m guessing you\ndidn’t get the scrolls he was carrying.”\n“Ah shit,” Kip said.\nChapter 45\nFor a long while, Gavin lay bleeding on the floor of the yellow cell without"

        "text": "didn’t get the scrolls he was carrying.”\n“Ah shit,” Kip said.\nChapter 45\nFor a long while, Gavin lay bleeding on the floor of the yellow cell without\neven the courage to open his eyes. But he was a Guile, and to him ‘a long\nwhile’ without doing something wasn’t long.\nHe’d already catalogued his own injuries. It was the curse of his family:\nhe couldn’t stop thinking or planning any more than he could stop\nbreathing. He sat up.\nThe injuries weren’t bad. Well, ignoring for the moment the lost\ndogtooth, two stubs where fingers should be, and the gaping hole where an\neye belonged. His cuts from falling were shallow, the bruises painful but\nnot incapacitating, his jaw unbroken despite his father’s punches. The\nweakness from the hunger was extreme, though.\nThe first thing he saw was his own reflection.\n“You were a beautiful man once,” it said.\nOf course the dead man in yellow would be the perfect balance of logic\nand emotion, devastating him with each. Gavin ignored him for the\nmoment, and cast his eyes down.\nThere was no corpse.\nOh, thank Orholam, there was no corpse.\n“You don’t look well,” the dead man said.\n“Does that make your work harder or easier?” Gavin asked him.\n“Tell me, O man of Guile, what’s worse? Madness unknowing, or\nmadness recognized?”\n“So… harder, huh?” Gavin said.\nWhat was this talk of madness? Maybe the yellow dead man thought\nGavin was more gone than he was. Gavin tried to remember if hunger\ncaused hallucinations. Perhaps it did. Perhaps that was why saints and\nascetics starved themselves—they were seeking a path to enlightenment\nthrough the signals for help a body released when it was being destroyed.\nGavin wasn’t mad yet. He was too focused for that.\nHis father had pulled the rug out from under him. Very well, point to\nAndross Guile. His father had humiliated him by pummeling him with his\nfists. Fine.\nGavin was more than a match for the old spider. He would escape, and\nhe would rise. He was unstoppable, unmatchable, superlative.\n“Ah, Gavin Guile, surrounded with mirrors, and yet you refuse to see the\nsimplest truths,” the dead man said.\n“Dazen,” Gavin said. “I’m Dazen Guile.”\n“Indeed. And what happened to Gavin?”\n“Go to hell.”\n“You seem not to have noticed,” the dead man said. He gestured to the\ncell. “Here am I.”\nOrholam, I sure was a dick when I will-cast these walls with dead men.\nI guess that was the point.\nIt wasn’t until Gavin moved to lap up some water that he saw the other\nwall of the cell. His blinded left side had faced toward that wall, and he’d\nbeen too addled from the fall and his hunger to fully examine this new hell.\nHe saw the bullet holes scarring the wall from when he’d blown off his\nbrother’s head.\nHis breath caught as the memory filled his mind’s eye, as he lifted both\nIlytian flintlock pistols and shot Gavin dead. One bullet through the center\nof his chest, the other right through the chin. If either pistol had misfired,"

If either pistol had misfired,\nhe’d still have had a quick death.\n“He was insane,” Gavin said aloud. “Maybe he was already insane\nbefore he came down here, but in my worship of him, I never saw it. Or\nmaybe his madness was my fault. I know I’d not last sixteen years down\nhere alone. Regardless, he was too far gone to be saved. It had to be done.”\n“It was a mercy killing?” the dead man asked.\n“Mercy too long delayed,” Gavin said. “And that is my fault indeed.”\n“Is that what you tell yourself?”\n“Do you have a point?” Gavin asked.\n“Two.” The dead man pointed across the cell toward those impact holes.\nGavin stood with difficulty. He’d expected there to be blood spatter or\nbrain matter or something similar for the dead man to torture him with.\nThere was no gore. Apparently the water wash had worked well.\nInstead there were two simple holes, the squashed lead musket balls\nvisible less than a thumb’s thickness inside each, the outside of each hole in\nthe splintered yellow luxin forming short cracks in the top layer of the cell\nwall. He’d made the yellow luxin wall of this cell thicker than his hand; the\nbullets hadn’t even come close to fully piercing the wall.\n“First thing that might catch your attention,” the dead man said, “is that\nthere wasn’t any ricochet. Solid yellow luxin, and no ricochet? But then,\nwith the positions of your hands when you fired, each shot was perfectly\nperpendicular to the angle of the wall. So it is odd, but not impossible.”\nAt first Gavin didn’t understand. And then he did.\n“No,” he breathed. “This is a trick. No.”\n“Oh, so you’ve spotted the impossibility, have you?”\nGavin shuffled over to the wall. He stuck his pinky finger into one of the\nbullet holes and scratched, trying to dislodge the lead.\n“What is that going to prove?” the dead man asked.\n“This is not my bullet. It’s impossible. He did this. My father. It’s a\ntrick.”\n“What are you doing? Picking it out of the wall won’t prove anything.”\n“I can see if it’s one of my bullets,” Gavin said. Like many veterans,\nGavin had cast his own bullets. One of the tricks he’d picked up in his\nmany years of fighting wights had been to pour the lead around a core of\nhellstone. It penetrated luxin like nothing else. Lead tore flesh\ncatastrophically, but some wights layered themselves thickly enough with\nluxin armor to stop lead.\nIn Dazen’s musket balls, the lead would tear away quickly, leaving a\nhellstone core that could pierce anything but thick solid yellow luxin. Few\nknew his trick, and of those who knew, fewer still could afford the hellstone\nnecessary. In monetary terms, it was like shooting solid gold musket balls.\n“Ah,” the dead man said. “Look at it at an angle.

        "text": "brightwater so pure a man could see through it.”\nIt was a good idea. He put his face against the wall. There! A nugget of\nhellstone, a hand’s thickness deep in the wall.\nDesperate, he went to the other bullet hole, and saw the same.\n“Father could have shot balls from my own gun. He would have access\nto my ammo pouch, too.”\n“I told you it wouldn’t solve anything,” the dead man said. “But think.\nWhere the black luxin hasn’t corrupted you, your memory was once so, so\nperfect for a mortal. Can you remember which bullets you fired that night?\nCan the Gavin Guile of legend remember that?”\nThe problem with hellstone was how brittle it was. Sharper than any\nsteel, but you couldn’t carve it. It fractured into bitter planes and hard\ncurves and angles. It meant that when he was casting bullets, Gavin always\nhad to make odd compromises. A star-shaped chunk of hellstone was what\nhe always looked for—its weight balanced so it wouldn’t put an odd spin on\nthe musket ball, and small enough to fit within the lead, but large enough to\nretain momentum if it struck luxin and lost its lead jacket. Most times he\nmade do with rough squares, triangles, or diamonds. Every bullet was\ndifferent because the hellstone crystals were always different. He’d always\narranged them by reliability.\nOnly the two bullets in his fine Ilytian pistols’ chambers had had the\nstar-shaped hellstone cores. Even he wasn’t so wealthy that he could\ndemand perfection in every bullet. His ammo bag was always full of\nsecond-best musket balls.\nHis father couldn’t have known that.\nThe first bit of hellstone, deep in the wall, was star-shaped…\nHe checked. So was the second.\nGavin sat back, baffled. His father wasn’t this good, was he?\nGavin had killed too many men to believe how his eyes and his memory\nwere contradicting each other. He’d shot Gavin through the chest, a straight\nhole through his bony sternum. The other bullet had gone smashed through\nhis chin and blew out the back of his head.\nLead squished on impact. It mushroomed, spun, tore gashes through\nflesh and bone. It was possible for the hellstone cores of his bullets to have\npierced his brother and still hit the wall, but unlikely. There wasn’t enough\nvelocity left in the hellstone for this depth of impact, not usually, not\nthrough two layers of bone.\nAnd for the lead itself to have survived intact to hit the wall as well?\nThat couldn’t happen.\nThese musket balls were his own. These were the musket balls that had\nbeen in his pistols that night. He couldn’t deny that. But these musket balls\nhadn’t torn through a body—much less bone—before hitting the wall.\nImpossible.\nGavin couldn’t be alive. Dazen hadn’t missed. Couldn’t have.\nBut that was the only possible answer. Wasn’t it?\nDid his father know even Dazen’s musket-ball-casting method? It was\npossible, but why?\n“Oh, my dear Black Prism,” the dead man said. “You can’t say you\nweren’t warned. So tragic. And the perfect Guile memory is such a special\nthing, is it not? You did this to yourself. You knew the risks, but you"

You knew the risks, but you\ncouldn’t help but draft black, could you? Black, the color of… Say it.”\nGavin’s mind went many places at once.\nHe was standing on the beach with the Third Eye.\nHe was standing in the hot, smoking ruins of Sundered Rock.\nHe was standing in front of his mother, after returning from the war,\nwith his brother unconscious in a trunk right behind him, telling her No, no,\nhe was dead. He didn’t suffer.\n“Say it,” the dead man said.\nGavin said, “Black is the color of oblivion. Black is the color of death.\nBlack is the color… of…”\n‘You didn’t spare Gavin out of pity,’ the Third Eye had said to him. And\nthen she said, ‘Does the man who killed his brother expect the truth to be\neasy?’ He’d interpreted her words to be wry; he’d thought there must have\nbeen a little stress he missed in the moment: ‘Does the man who “killed his\nbrother” expect the truth to be easy?’\nBut there had been no wink or smile or nudge. Had there?\nShe had known how he would take those words at the moment, hadn’t\nshe? But she had also known that he would later remember those words.\nThat was why she had been so very precise, so that without her lying to\nhim, he could continue to delude himself until it was time to stop deluding\nhimself.\n“Tell me,” the dead man said. “When did your nightmares about your\nbrother stop?”\n“Around the time I killed him.”\n“No, Dazen. That’s when they began.”\nNo. Impossible. The dreams about his brother’s escaping his prisons had\nbegun right after the war ended, right after Sundered Rock. They had\nstopped only recently.\n“Because…” the dead man said, as if leading a very stupid pupil to an\nobvious truth, “because black is the color of…”\n“Of madness,” Gavin said hollowly.\n“Dazen, Gavin has been dead seventeen years. He was never\nimprisoned. You killed him at Sundered Rock.”\n“That’s not… that’s not…” Gavin felt suddenly lightheaded. The\ntightness in his chest returned. He fell to the floor.\n“All your contortions and striving have been to hide a man who wasn’t\nthere. Did you think it was a coincidence that as you lost blue, you dreamed\nof him breaking out of your blue prison? That as you lost green, he broke\nout of green in your dreams? The black luxin hell you brought to earth at\nSundered Rock killed one man, but it destroyed two. Do you remember the\nbowl in the blue prison? And the cloth woven of human hair?”\nGavin remembered.\n“How would you remember that? He never told you about it. He hid it\nfrom you.”\n“I must have discovered them when I went through that cell.”\n“Where was it when you were in the blue cell just weeks ago?”\n“It must have been repaired.”\n“Your father bothered to repair a slight depression in luxin more than a\nfoot thick? And reset the trapdoor? And he repaired the green chamber?"

And he cast new musket balls, all to make you\nthink now… after all this, that you’re mad? Does that sound like your\nfather’s work? Gavin was never here.

How\ncould you know any of this?” Gavin asked.\n“We know, Dazen, because you came down and raved to us. Told us\nwhy it had to be this way. I, for one, always figured that the truth was, you\nmade this prison for yourself. Surrounded by problems too big for you, you\nmade a problem small enough for you to handle.”\nDazen felt the tightness increasing in his chest. He remembered, as in a\ndream, coming down here that fateful night. He opened the yellow chamber\nand thought of closing himself inside. He argued with himself, aloud. There\nwas no one here but his reflection, his own image crafted so carefully to\nlook like a dead man, his brother.\nThe dead man laughed. “Come now, think of it! Did you really think that\nafter Sundered Rock you were able to stuff your brother in a box, and keep\nhim alive but drugged for the whole journey home, and bring him into the\nChromeria—and no one ever noticed?! You had a box that you wouldn’t let\nthe servants touch. Do you think they wouldn’t tell your father and mother\nabout such a thing? Do you think your father and mother didn’t break into it\nimmediately?”\nThere had been a chest. He opened it in his memory, and this time,\noverlaid on the phantasmal image of his brother unconscious, he could\nfinally see the truth. Inside the chest had been a spear of living black luxin.\nBlack luxin he’d drafted himself.\nIt was the implement he’d drafted in those last desperate moments at\nSundered Rock, the weapon with which he’d killed his brother. Beautiful\nand terrible as the night sky devouring itself unto eternity.\nHe’d carved the cells out of the Chromeria’s heart with that spear,\ncutting through rock and the old bones of buried drafters and the luxin\nencased in their bodies with equal ease, until it too had failed, and broken\napart into ten thousand pieces of hellstone.\nThe ten thousand pieces that he had then used in crafting the tunnels\nthemselves.\nHow else could he have stolen such a kingdom’s fortune’s worth of\nhellstone without his father’s noticing?\nBut what would his mother have done if she’d found that spear straight\nfrom hell in his belongings, still smeared with his brother’s blood?\nShe would have wept, and prayed, and waited, and hoped that her last\nson would come back from his madness. She would have been gentle, and\npatient, and protective. As she had.\nAnd his father would have been scared, and distant, and angry, and\nwatchful, and intrigued, and enraged, and uncertain.

In reality, they’d played along, pretending to be\ndeceived because they had no other options, no other sons, because in their\nown ways they both still needed him: his mother needed him to keep her\nown hopes alive, and his father needed him in order to rule through him.\n“It didn’t take everything, though, did it?” the dead man asked. “Despite\nthe black luxin, you knew certain truths.

There’s no way my father has known all this\ntime. He could never let anyone think they were fooling him. It isn’t in him\nto play along.

Not now. Please.

What was—\nTisis turned to Sibéal. “I don’t suppose the Third Eye said anything\nabout what we’re supposed to do now?”\n“No.” Sibéal’s face was impossible to read, maybe a little tightening\naround the eyes, but the smile not moving. That was unnerving. Luckily, the\nhe-bear of a conn was far more expressive. His already pale face went\npasty. His fists clenched, and Kip could actually see the tight thews of his\nshoulders swell with sudden tension.\n“Kip,” Tisis said, “do you remember when you were going through your\nBlackguard initiation, and you grabbed that boy’s open-luxin spear and\nshattered it?”\n“How’d you know about that?” Kip asked.\n“Balls, Kip. You think the Blackguard trainees do anything in the\nChromeria that isn’t immediately grist for the rumor mills?”"

You think the Blackguard trainees do anything in the\nChromeria that isn’t immediately grist for the rumor mills?”\nKip hadn’t really thought about it. But he supposed that the attractive,\npowerful young men’s and women’s fights would be fairly intriguing to the\naverage drafter who never got to raise a fist in anger, much less throw a\nluxin missile. “Grazner was his name,” he said. “Commander Ironfist called\nit willjacking.”\n“Right. Willjacking is one tiny part of will-casting,” Tisis said.\n“Shit,” said Cruxer, who had just come up to join them. “I can’t believe\nI didn’t put the pieces together. Will-casters. That’s why Sibéal’s with you.\nThat’s her people’s magic.”\nTo Kip, Tisis interjected, “Will-casters draft only enough luxin to\ntransmit their will. To objects and to animals.”\n“And to people,” Cruxer said.\n“Not to people,” Sibéal said quickly. “Not in the sense you mean.”\nCruxer interrupted, “Forcing your will onto a person, making them do\nwhatever you want? It’s mind rape—and often a precursor to actual rape.\nThat’s what I was taught. Are you saying it isn’t used that way?”\nA frisson passed through the nearby boats, and Kip was keenly aware\nthat Cruxer had just equated a hundred nearby drafters with rapists.\nEveryone in the boats within earshot went very quiet and very tense.\n“It can be used that way,” Sibéal admitted.\n“And animals.” His mouth twisted. “Uniting with an animal. Forcing\nyourself. On an innocent animal. It’s like—”\n“It’s a terrible thing to call good evil,” Sibéal interrupted. “Horny,\nshamed zealots often see perversity in innocent activities. Men like that\nwould describe a mother changing her son’s soiled nappy as stripping an\ninfant naked and rubbing his genitals. It’s true, but it’s misleading. When a\nman sees perversity everywhere, one must question who’s the pervert. I’d\nhate for you to become a person like that, Commander.”\nCruxer looked as if he’d been slapped. “Yet even a shamed, imperfect\nman might actually find himself among those who pervert the gifts Orholam\nhas given them.”\nIt was a step back, but the crowd of will-casters didn’t see it that way.\nThey moved from vindication to surly outrage in an instant. Point to Cruxer,\nbut maybe this wasn’t an argument worth winning. Kip felt as if he were\nwatching a team of runaway horses pulling a heavy-laden cart down a\ncrowded street. Perhaps disaster couldn’t be averted forever.\nBut Sibéal held her hand up. “Will-casting is a sword. Like any sword, it\nis meant to cut and kill. It is an implement—mostly—of violence and\nugliness. It is a sword we here carry with an appreciation for the dangers of\nthe blade. Surely you warriors can understand this. We do not disagree\nabout how vile are the abuses of this craft.”\n“Except the Chromeria says all uses of your craft are abuses,” Cruxer"

But shut your gob. Sibéal?”\nShe looked down the river nervously, but they were still quite a ways\nout. “Your Magisterium draws its edicts in such a way as to keep as many\npeople safe as possible. It would ban swords altogether, so as to save us all\nfrom those who use swords to rape and steal and kill. But there is a time to\nkill, and a place to use every weapon at our disposal. Is now the time and\nplace for you, Kip Guile, who said he would lead us to kill and to die?”\n“I take it that the Cwn y Wawr disagree,” he said.\n“The Cwn y Wawr are liars and hypocrites,” Conn Arthur said, hot.\n“They claim they abide by the Chromeria’s laws? For generations they’ve\nsent discipulae to the Chromeria, taken all the education they can get, then\nfailed out on purpose so their contracts could be bought out cheaply.\nThey’ve even trained with the Blackguard, abusing your trust and stealing\npositions and funds.”\nKip should have been thinking about whether he could bring together\nancient enemies without losing everyone. Instead he thought about the\nBlackguard and its old discrimination against anyone not Parian or Ilytian,\nfirst justified because they were the peoples with the darkest skin—a\njustification made flimsier with every mixing generation.\nThose old snubs must have made the Blood Foresters who became the\nCwn y Wawr feel justified in stealing what training they could: ‘You won’t\nbe fair to me? Fine, I’ll take your training and leave.’\nThose desertions would have then made the Parians and Ilytians feel\njustified again: ‘See, these people are untrustworthy. They aren’t worthy of\nbeing Blackguards.’\nEvery community is a gull gliding over a sea of spite, eager for carrion,\nall too ready to steal, and all too quick to squawk when stolen from.\nKip held up his hands, and they all quieted. They actually listened to\nhim. As if he was a real leader. “Some things at the Chromeria are going to\nhave to change. But we’re in no position to change anything until we win.\nAnd to win, we need all the allies we can get. We’re in a fight to the death.\nI’ll pick up any sword I can.”\n“Even if it cuts you?” Conn Arthur said. It must have come out louder\nthan he’d meant, because he reddened—Orholam bless that light skin—but\nhe stood fast when he saw the others look at him, suddenly stubborn.\n“If it cuts the White King deeper? Absolutely. This isn’t a time when we\nhave the luxury to cast aside help. And I’ll tell them the same thing, when\nthey raise the same objections about you.”\nThe big muscles went rigid again, and then slowly deflated. Orholam\nhave mercy, but Conn Arthur was big, his muscles and fiery body hair\nrippling with every move.\n“Sibéal, explain will-casting. You have four minutes.”"

        "text": "have mercy, but Conn Arthur was big, his muscles and fiery body hair\nrippling with every move.\n“Sibéal, explain will-casting. You have four minutes.”\nAnd, with remarkable concision, she did. The peoples of the deep woods\nhad been will-casting for millennia. And, perhaps affected by the Great\nRiver itself, they had always conceived of magic in dichotomies: drafting\nwithout casting one’s will into the world making one river, and will-casting\nmaking another. Down the will-casting river was another fork: will-casting\ninto the soulless, and will-casting into the souled; then will-casting into the\nsimple souled (small animals, mainly) and into complex souls (larger\nanimals and humans); then will-casting into animal souls and into human\nsouls, and so forth.\nThe first kind of will-casting—into objects, luxin, usually—was\nconsidered safe and almost mundane: it was tiring and usually short lived,\nbut a drafter-archer might cast a bit of luxin into the fletching of her arrow,\nand then fix her will upon a target.\nWhen released, the arrow would curve to some small extent, seeking its\ntarget automatically. These weren’t dramatic effects: the core physics of an\narrow’s flight and momentum were still the same. One couldn’t shoot an\narrow and have it curve back to hit someone behind you, but a skilled will-\ncaster might curve an arrow a bit over a wall to hit someone taking cover\nbehind it. Or—if she possessed greater skill—she might focus on a difficult\ntarget and be able to shoot more accurately than her own mundane skills\nought to allow.\nHoly shit, Kip thought. He’d heard of that in the Blackguard itself. Some\nof the nunks had sworn they’d seen some of the best archers like Buskin\nand Tugertent shoot arrows that curved in midair.\nNo wonder they’d been quiet about doing it—it was utterly forbidden.\nNo wonder they’d done it anyway—it worked.\nThis kind of magic was exhausting, Sibéal said, and it usually expired\nwithin seconds or hours of being separated from the caster. They could\nmake simple machines, too. Hidden traps whose trigger was something like\n‘If touched, ignite.’\nThe far more dangerous will-casting was into the souled. Whenever they\ncould, they didn’t allow their will-casters to start learning it until they were\nat least thirty years old—when they had a stake in their community, when\nthey had families, when they had reasons not to go mad.\nThe simple souled could be given only relatively simple instructions:\n‘Go to this place,’ or maybe ‘Go to this place and do this.’ This, Kip\nrealized, was what his father Gavin had done at the Gargantua. He had sent\na rat to find the floating fortress’s powder magazine.\nThe height of the will-caster’s art was working with creatures with\ngreater intelligence—the complex souls, as they called them—the wolves\nand dolphins and horses and elephants and jungle cats.\n“And bears,” Kip guessed. Motherfucker.\n“Yes. Bears.”\nConn Arthur gestured to a nearby skimmer to come closer. He turned to\nSibéal after he hopped gracefully onto the moving deck of the other boat.\n“Tell him about it. Go on. I don’t want to hear it, but he needs to know.”"

I don’t want to hear it, but he needs to know.”\n“Conn…?” Kip asked, as the other skimmer separated once more.\n“Conn Arthur communes with a giant grizzly,” Sibéal said quietly,\nlooking at the big man’s back.\nA giant grizzly. In case a regular old grizzly wasn’t terrifying enough. “I\nthought the last of those died long ago,” he said.\n“There are a few left. The Deep Forest remembers, Lord Guile.”\nWonderful. “Tell me about the dangers,” Kip said.\n“With the lower forms of will-casting, we’re not sure why… It doesn’t\nsap people of their will, like the Chromeria believes. Instead it seems to\nslowly eat away at their intelligence. We think sometimes the caster forgets\nto breathe while his will is elsewhere, and his body dies a little. He might\ncome back to himself, but never really be the same. It’s a death by slow\ndegrees. As there are few old drafters, there are few old will-casters.”\n“And as with drafters who go wight, there are the reckless among will-\ncasters, too,” Tisis added. She’d been quiet until now. “There are men and\nwomen who believe they are wrongly souled. That they are, deep down,\nwolves or bears or tygre wolves.”\n“And what happens to them?” Kip asked.\n“Most madness shows up early,” Sibéal said. “It’s part of why we don’t\nteach will-casting to the young. They get themselves killed. Mauled by wild\nanimals usually, or starved. A man is body and soul, and those who separate\nthe two for long do it to their grief.”\n“So if you’re controlling an animal, and it gets killed, what then?” Kip\nasked.\nShe glanced at the conn over on his other boat. “Sometimes nothing.\nSometimes the caster is made an idiot. Sometimes she simply dies, too. It\ndepends how intricated the caster is.”\n“Intricated?”\n“Polychromes can more fully take on their host’s body. The different\ncolors connect… differently.”\n“Let me guess,” Kip said, stomach sinking. “Superviolet to understand\nthe thoughts, blue to see and remember, green to feel and to sense how the\nbody should move, yellow to hear and hold the balance of man and animal,\norange to smell and process what an animal smells, red to taste and feel the\nemotions, and sub-red for the passions and the other animal senses a man\ndoesn’t share.”\nSibéal looked at Kip as if he were a rock trout who had just beached\nhimself and started lecturing her on eudaemonic theology. “How…?”\n“Lucky guess,” Kip said. The cards. It was the same as the cards. So\nwill-casting was, deep down, connected to the same magical reality that\nchromaturgy was. It was simply understood differently.\nAll magic worked by certain laws, but no one knew them all.\nBut Sibéal wasn’t ready to let go of it. “I would have expected someone\nwho had read up on will-casting to say blue for sight, green for touch, and"

Trying to\ntrap me in a lie?”\n“No. And we don’t have time to quibble now,” Kip said. “What happens\nif the man is killed while he’s controlling the animal?”\n“No, how did you know about the colors’ connections?” Sibéal insisted.\nKip said nothing, and they stood eye to eye. Or more accurately, eye to\nbelly, but the pygmy didn’t let the height differential affect her in the least.\nShe was flushing, skin turning bluer by the moment.\n“Lord Guile… sometimes just understands things about magic,” Tisis\nsaid, trying to spread oil on the waters. “He’s kind of irritating that way.”\nSibéal went silent, and her grinning mouth threw Kip. He was still\nlearning to look around the corners of her eyes and to ignore the mouth.\n“Conn Ruadhán Arthur’s twin, Rónán, was killed while he was fully\nintricated in his bear, not two months past. Ruadhán had to go kill the bear\nhimself. The animal that held the last living remnants of Rónán’s soul. It\ntore Ruadhán’s heart out to kill it.

But the\nmagic fades, and it reverts to animal, and the man-soul dies at last. But all\ntoo often, it gets violent, for it’s been changed, been violated. They kill\npeople.

He wasn’t telling her about the cards. “So it seems\nlike, to put it in your dichotomies, we’re talking about two different things:\nwill-casting and… what?”\n“Soul-casting.” Sibéal looked up the river. “Do we really have time for\nthis?”\n“I’m afraid we don’t have time not to do this,” Kip said.\n“Have you not read the Philosopher? Before you understand anything,\nyou must understand physics—what is in the corporeal world. Upon that\nyou build your understanding of the metaphysics, what is beyond the simple\ncorporeal: emotions and thoughts and so forth. From those two, you derive\nyour ethics, how one is to act properly in accord with the facts, above that,\npolitics, how bodies of individuals are to act toward each other, and then\nrhetoric and the arts, the poetics. We and the Chromeria disagree about our\nmetaphysics, and it affects everything above it.\n“If, as they believe, you tear off a piece of your soul when you will-cast,\nyou’re doing fundamental harm to yourself every time you do this magic. It\nwould be akin to magic powered by murdering someone—it wouldn’t\nmatter if you did good with the magic, because at base, the action\nempowering that good is itself evil. Thus, the good we do they discount,\nwhilst every ill effect that comes from our magic they say obviously springs\nfrom the corrupted nature of the whole. We can’t win, because we argue\npolitics—the regulation of magics—when our dispute is about\nmetaphysics.”\n“This is… very complicated,” Tisis said.\n“Not really,” Sibéal said. “We say the will is the breath of the soul. Like\nyour body needs breath and will die without it, your soul needs will. But we\ncan inspire an animal—literally, ‘in-breathe’—to do something. Of course\nwe need to recover afterward, like you need to inhale every time you\nexhale. Like you breathe hard after running. You need recovery time. And\nyes, if you go too long without breathing, you die. Or if you deprive another\nperson of their breath, it’s killing. This is murder if it’s a person, but the\nanimals we inspire can also be killed thus if it’s done wantonly or clumsily\nor for too long, and we regard that as a serious offense, too.

Doubtless it\nis a unique temptation for those with such great power.

Why would a man do that?\nKip had only hatred for his own half brother, but he’d seen what a big-\nhearted man will give for his brother. And he said a silent thanks to\nTremblefist and Ironfist for that. For here, though different in culture and\ncolor and circumstances, he saw a mirror of their love. And what\nTremblefist had taught him might just save his life.\nWhy would Conn Arthur not lead?\nNot because he was ashamed of his brother, who had done something\ndesperate as he died. There was little shame in that. Conn Arthur wouldn’t\nlead because he was ashamed of himself.\nBecause there was no way in hell he’d killed Rónán’s bear Lorcan,\nbecause that would have meant killing his brother. Rónán was out there,\nsomewhere, trapped and going mad in the body of that bear, and nothing\ncould stop him but death. Conn Arthur bore the responsibility to his people\nand to his brother to kill the animal, but that would mean admitting Rónán\nwas dead. It would mean killing the last remnant of his brother with his own\nhands.\nHis love was his shame. But if he wouldn’t confront that on his own,\nKip was going to have to make him do so before someone got killed.\nBut how do you reveal a man’s deepest secret shame, accuse him of\nheresy and cowardice, and not destroy him?\nA commander couldn’t. Maybe a friend could. Kip had to give Conn\nArthur time to deal with it, had to pray the forest was big enough for one\ncrazed grizzly.\nTime was up. The island was coming into view."

Terrified through ignorance, partly, sure. But when you\nlive in the forest, and you know the creatures there well, how scary is the\nidea of someone who can turn any one of those creatures against you, with\nthe capabilities of the animal but the mind of a human? How terrifying is it\nthat a person might take over your own body? How terrifying is it to\nactually meet the kind of people responsible for all the tales of the living\ndead and wolf men and worse?\nTo them, the name ‘Ghosts’ wasn’t a sarcastic reference to how\nephemeral and helpless these homeless, bereaved wanderers were. To them,\nthe Ghosts haunted the darkness of the forest, ready to turn nature or even\nyour fellow man or your dead against you.\nBut trained warrior-drafters were scary, too. And these Cwn y Wawr\nwere in bad shape, whether they knew it or not. They’d been freed from\ndeath or servitude, but they’d lost two precious things: their confidence and\ntheir honor. They’d lost their confidence in being betrayed and captured and\nneeding to be rescued, and they’d lost their honor in pursuing a separate\npeace with the White King.\nA soldier without confidence and honor is a breath away from becoming\na brigand or gangster.\nBut it had always been a fool’s dream. Kip, leading men to destroy the\nWhite King himself? These two camps were like lodestones pushing against\neach other invisibly, endlessly.\nErgo, just flip one. They’ll fuse themselves together.\nRight?\nKip stepped ashore without a word, without so much as a nod at the men\nstanding there to ask him a question.\nDrafting green from a thousand trees shining on each bank of the river in\nthe noonday sun, he threw down steps and made a small platform to stand\non. “We,” he declared, “are damaged but not dismayed, oppressed but not\noverwhelmed. We are the Broken, for when our oaths were tested, we broke\nthem and ourselves. We were the despised: Here are my best friends. This\nworld sees a bastard, an orphan, a hostage, a cripple, an idiot. I call them\nthe Mighty. We—you—are outcasts all, the homeless driven from the lands\nwhere our mothers were buried. They have taken the light from our lives.\nKilled our loved ones, our friends.

You tried not to\nbetray too much as a slave, lest your fear or hatred or disgust or longing\nearn you a beating.\n‘Earn.’ Orholam damn us all.\nShe could see him trying to place her so that he might guess what to\nexpect: Traders’ clothes, perhaps? Young—she had always looked young\nfor her age, which was made worse by her short hair and what looked like\nmere skinniness when her clothes covered her arms and shoulders. She\nprobably didn’t look too frightening to him, though. Just a slip of a girl, she\nwas.\nNo, old man, I am death come for you.\n“This shouldn’t hurt,” Teia said.\nSlaves had superstitions about who was the most likely to be brutal to\nthem. Insecure wives, drunkards, slave owners barely rich enough to own\nslaves but desperate to do so to prove their status, the youngest children in\nwealthy households, and that particular breed of rich luxiat that strained\nunder the hypocrisy of keeping slaves while Orholam taught that all men\nwere brothers. Where did Teia fit? this man was wondering. Sometimes a\nvery young girl didn’t see a slave as a slave. He might be a playmate, an\nadult kinder than others because he gave her his time.\nSooner or later, they learned.\n“Not until the end, anyway,” she said.\nThat was another evil of slavery, wasn’t it? How it twisted not only the\nenslaved, but their owners as well. Teia had seen the worst impulses of her\nonetime playmate Sarai not only tolerated but encouraged as far as slaves\nwere concerned. Surely every child has terrible impulses. Surely every\nmother says, ‘No, child, don’t hit!’ Except a slaveholder says, ‘No, child,\nyou may only hit Kallas or Elpis!’\nAnd Kallas was twisted by accepting the blows of his mistress’s brats.\nAnd Elpis was twisted by her weekly rapes at her master’s hands. And her\nmaster was twisted by thinking it was natural and moral, his right.\nThis is why Orholam hates slavery, as he hates divorce and war. But he\ntolerates them. They are his compromises with humanity, with the hardness\nof our hearts. For who could imagine a world without any of those?\nShe let loose a cloud of paryl from her palm, and then, given the\ndarkness of the room, she remembered her dark spectacles, and took them\noff.\nThe slave shuddered at the sight of her irisless black eyes, monstrously\nagape, swallowing all light.\nHe bucked against his shackles. He tried to scream, but whoever had\ngagged him had not just bound a rag around his mouth—which did little to\nnothing. They’d filled his mouth with a rock and then bound it in place.\nPoor bastard.\nAnd old, and male. Because an old worker slave was cheap. An older\nwoman could be put to work inside, watching children or knitting or doing\nsimple tasks. Not all were, of course, but enough that they generally cost\nmore than old men broken by long physical labor."

Not all were, of course, but enough that they generally cost\nmore than old men broken by long physical labor.\nTeia felt far away from herself. As she streamed paryl through one of his\narms, looking for the nerves, another part of her immediately started\nconcocting schemes, each more impractical than the last. She could take the\nman out of here under the cover of her cloak—too small. She could wait\nuntil darkness—and what if someone came before then? She could find a\ndead body about his age and size—where? She could kill the Order’s lackey\nwho came to get the body—and who was to say that wouldn’t be just some\ninnocent grave digger? Even if it was one of the Order’s people, killing\nthem would tip her hand, wouldn’t it?\nIt was already too late to go after Murder Sharp and try to kill him and\nthen pretend she’d never gotten the orders. She hadn’t even thought of it\nwhen he’d left.\n“Mmm! Mmm!” His eyes rolled back in his head and he bucked again,\nmaking her lose the paryl stream, dammit.\nHe thrashed, tearing the skin at his wrists, blood trickling down his bare\narms.\nShe could simply disobey—and show that she wasn’t loyal. That was\ndeath. But perhaps she could disobey for some excellent reason—she\nrefused to kill slaves because she’d been a slave, or, or…\nIt wouldn’t matter. Not to the Order. Not in wartime. Disobedience was\ndeath. Their secrecy was more important to them than having another\nassassin.\nShe’d have to run away, far, far from here, to some city or village where\nthey would never find her.\nShe found a thick tendon and pulled the paryl tight around it. His arm\nbarely twitched before the paryl shattered. Apparently she wouldn’t be\npulling anyone around like a marionette with paryl.\nIn the right place, though—say by making a finger twitch on a trigger—\nit could make all the difference, couldn’t it?\nShe was doing it. Exactly what the Order had commanded. She was\nusing this slave like a practice dummy. A whetstone on which to hone her\nskills razor sharp. Not a human. Not an old man with fears and hopes and a\nhistory.\nI’m a Blackguard. This is what I must do. I’m a soldier, under orders.\nThis is war, and I am a soldier. I could have run away, but I chose this. I\ncould run away now.\nShe could get money. How could you stop a thief who could make\nherself invisible?\nHow she wished she were back in the Prism’s training room. She could\nbathe in superviolet and blue until there was only the cold logic of\nnecessity.\nThe nerves! At last. She tweaked a bundle at the slave’s elbow. His arm\ndropped, paralyzed, until the shackle caught his wrist. He gasped.\nThe problem was how much sense it all made. It made sense for the\nOrder to train her. It made sense that she be trained on old, useless slaves\nwho would die within a couple of years anyway. On the Chromeria’s side, it\nmade sense that Teia be ordered to comply with whatever the Order"

It was the only way they could get her close enough to uproot\nthem.\nKarris was an admiral accepting the death of her men on the front lines\nto protect more at home. Accepting, even, the corruption and breaking of\nthose at the front lines to protect the lives of those at home.\nBut all that logic couldn’t argue with the fear on the face of this man,\nwho’d done nothing to deserve a death that accomplished something so near\nto nothing it surely couldn’t measure against his life.\nShe would use these skills she would learn here with this man’s pain and\nhis death against the Order—but first she would use her skills for it. How\ndid that balance any scales?\nShe wasn’t killing an innocent on purpose; that was the difference\nbetween the good guys and the bad guys. Bad guys killed the innocent on\npurpose; good guys sometimes killed the innocent, but only by accident\nwhile trying to kill the enemy.\nBut she was killing an innocent deliberately in order to get a chance to\nkill the guilty. How was she any different from a marksman who shoots a\nchild in the legs so that he can gun down any combatants who came to save\nthe child?\nNo, the Order was making her do this. It was the Order who would kill\nher if she refused.\nAlone, the Chromeria would never order this. Experimenting on and\nmurdering a slave for practice was the Order’s way of doing things.\nYet here she was.\nThe Order would keep sending her slaves until she mastered all the\nskills they demanded of a Shadow. If she mastered them quickly, they\nwould send her sooner to kill targets out in the world. If she mastered them\nslowly, they would send her more and more slaves to practice on—and then\nmurder.\nThere was no good choice, if she stayed. Nothing that would let her stay\ninnocent.\nIf she ran, she wouldn’t be a murderer. But she would never avenge\nMarissia, either. The spymaster was probably dead, but to run would mean\ngiving up on her. Then Teia would never stop the Order, and they would\ncontinue murdering whomever they wanted. They would forever take their\ntithe of blood.\nIf she ran, she wouldn’t be guilty of anything except cowardice.\nI don’t run.\nFear was a shackle. Fear was a shackle she would never wear again.\nOrholam, forgive me for what I am about to do.\nTeia pulled off the man’s gag and removed the stone from his mouth.\n“What’s your name?” she asked quietly.\n“Rajiv.”\n“Rajiv? You don’t look Atashian. What’s your birth name?”\nHe looked at first as if he couldn’t remember. Finally, in a tone that said,\n‘Must you take also this?’ he said, “Salvador.”\n“You’re Tyrean.”\nHe nodded.\n“Any family, Salvador?”\n“A son.”\n“Slave?”\n“No longer. They took him from me. Beat him to death years ago.”\n“As they do,” Teia said. Fuck them. “I wanted to tell you, Salvador, that\nyour death today is going to accomplish something. That it’s part of"

Tisis practically glowed\nwith pride in Kip and hunger for him. It was so weird it actually gave him\npause, and made him think.\nThinking was clearly the enemy here.\nThe Cwn y Wawr and Ghost camps had joined together on the island,\nand tonight they were celebrating the end of generations of internecine\nstrife and oppression. It was the wildest party Kip had ever seen. The kind\nof party where before you slipped into your tent, instead of worrying that\nyou were going to disturb your neighbors, you worried that it might already\nbe occupied.\nAnd Kip. Goddam Kip. He was seriously considering not making love\nwith this beautiful woman. Against every sane consideration, Kip was stuck\nbetween his pride and having some good old-fashioned dirty fun with his\nmind-blowingly amazing wife.\nSwallow your pride and take what you’re given, you fat idiot. This is\nbetter than you deserve. Why can’t you just enjoy it?\nTisis gave a little wave and a wink to her healer friend Evie Cairn,\nwho’d been teaching her battlefield medicine, and tugged on Kip’s belt\nagain, her other hand holding open the flap of the much-larger tent the Cwn\ny Wawr had insisted on giving them. “You coming inside, or do you want to\nget started right here?”\nBut then her smile faded as she saw the look in his eyes. She dropped\nKip’s belt.\n“We have to talk,” Kip said. Not words he would have ever imagined\nspeaking.\nWhen bodies should speak, words are the enemy, moron.\n“This is about the will-casters, isn’t it?” Tisis said. She swallowed. She\nlooked around guiltily, blonde hair glowing in the light of the rising moon,\nunwilling to meet his eyes. She ducked into the tent.\nIt looked like flight, and it triggered a predator instinct.

Instead, he was reminded of his mother. She had lied\nreflexively, for no purpose. She manipulated him, too, always, ever twisting\nhim into guilt and shame when she could have accomplished the same ends\nwith a simple request. Her manipulations were wanton and wounding and\npointless.\n“You kept what they were a secret from me—even when we were half\nan hour from meeting the Ghosts’ mortal enemies.

After… I mean, I feel like we just came to this\nnew understanding, this new place, and things are so good between us—and\nyou sided with them against me.”\nWhoa. Kip the Lip. That got away from him a little.\nShe said nothing. She didn’t even turn around, damn her.\n“Turn around,” he demanded.\n“No.”\n“You’re just like my mother,” Kip said. Untruer words had never been\nspoken. “You ever side against me again, and we’re finished.”\nStill not speaking, she stepped past him, averting her face and bringing a\nhand up to block his view—so he couldn’t see her tears, no doubt, as if that\nvery action weren’t rubbing in that he’d made her cry.\nMere moments after she was gone, Kip’s hot blood cooled. But he didn’t\nmove. She was in the wrong!\nSo why did he feel so wretched?\nShould have waited until after sex to fight.\nNever choose fighting over sex.\nHe opened the tent flap, but he couldn’t see her anywhere.\nKip knew he should go after her. Bugger what anyone else in the camp\nthought of him. They were busy with their own pleasures tonight. He\nneeded to go apologize. He needed to go tell her he was an asshole.\nThese new clothes were too wide across the shoulders and chest and too\ntight across the belly, too much effort to keep clean. Too damn grown up.\nPutting on Kip the screw-up, Kip the fatty, Lard Guile, Kip the victim\nwho soaked up damage and mistook passivity for placidity, who thought\nthat being imperturbable was being invincible, putting on that old Kip was\nlike putting on his old tunic. It reeked; it was stained and dumpy, but it was\ncomfortable.\nHe couldn’t suck in his gut and stand up straight every day. He was a\nchild, pretending to be a lord.\nHe could remember his mother, sneering when Kip told her he’d been\nbeaten again by Ram, after he’d seemed so nice for several weeks: ‘Don’t\nbe a fool.

Ben-hadad had pointed out jokingly that if you made the\nlinks of chain small enough, the chain rope would be as flexible as real\nrope.\nIt hadn’t been so simple, but after studying hemp ropes and then\napplying some other colors of luxin, Kip was actually making good\nprogress.\nOnce he thought he heard the tent flap open, but when he looked up a\nmoment later, no one was there.\nHe went to bed alone, and somehow he slept until he was awakened by\nCruxer. The morning was as foggy as Kip’s head, and as he came to join his\ngenerals and Tisis, Kip saw why he’d been awakened. On every bank\nopposite their little island were soldiers, armed and ready for war, bearing\nthe Green Boar of Eirene Malargos.

Sat silent, cross-legged, with the poisoned bread\nclasped lightly in his hands.\n“Useless,” the dead man said to him.\nThe poison, and the bread, and the hunger—his companions—they were\noddly precious to him now. His world had contracted to a space as narrow\nas his dreams and as wide as his rib cage with its knocking, laboring heart.\nHe was, perhaps, losing coherence.\nThey have loved the darkness.\nHow could anyone love darkness?\nHe supposed that in darkness, everyone was as blind as a one-eyed man.\nHis handicap became universal.\nHe was afraid of dying, he saw that now.

He was poison, and he’d known it. And yet he had let her love\nhim.\nShe’d had nothing from him but grief. It was so unfair. Unfair of him,\nwho should have known, and unfair of Orholam to allow it.\nBut then, of all people it was unseemly of him to whinge about fairness,\nwasn’t it?\n“You could be in Karris’s bed now,” the dead man said. “You coward.”\nThe first part cut through Gavin like a black luxin tooth.

But in physical danger he was often careless\nto a fault. Had he really once thought ‘coward’ would be a cutting insult?\nOdd.\nIt actually took his attention away from the open sore that was Karris\nand how badly he’d treated her. At some point, seated cross-legged as he\nwas, he faded into sleep.\nAs he stood atop a tower, a dream giant towered over him, a colossus of\nlight, blocking out the sun, but its own features not thereby cast into\nshadow.\nGavin felt himself guttering under the force of the giant’s gaze, no,\nmelting like a candle man in a holocaust, wax streaming from every limb,\nright on the edge of combustion.\n“Please!” he begged. He held up a hand to block out the light, to find\nsome darkness in which to hide. But his hand itself shimmered, turned to\nliquid glass. It gave him no shade. He was transparent.\nBut he wasn’t clear.\nThreaded through the pellucid flesh of his very hand were veins of\nthorny black, quivering angrily, exposed and hurting in the light, shrieking\nsoundlessly, grinding and twisting to find some relief.\nAs the thorns rotated, splintering and lacerating the flesh they called\nhome, Gavin’s entire body convulsed with pain. He fell.\nFrom the pure white marble ground, he crossed his glassine arms to\ndefend himself. And saw another thick vein of parasitic, bloated blackness\nin his other arm. He tore open his tunic and saw, encased and strangled in a\ncage of thorns, his own black heart. No, not black. It was gray, diseased.\nIt pulsed loathsomely. And he was disgusted. And he was ashamed.\nHe plucked it from his chest to fling it away and die, rightly die.\nAnd then he saw, at his heart’s heart, a glimmer.\nStorm clouds were gathering overhead, massive thunderheads of\njudgment, coming with such speed as to make up for how long they had\nbeen delayed. The air, so thin up here, changed palpably.\nBut Gavin had seen the white. His gray heart writhed, and the whiteness\nwas swallowed again.\n“No!” he shouted to the coming storm and the wind that whipped his\nbody cold. “I need more time!”\nChapter 50\nKarris wasn’t certain how he’d gotten the message to her without its being\nintercepted.

Each man wore his\nspectacles and had full grip of his color and a musket. Karris didn’t offer\nadvice to the Blackguards on their disposition, though she would have when\nshe was first elevated; she had brought only the best Blackguards, and they\nknew their work.\nExcept, of course, that they had allowed her to come at all. Commander\nIronfist might not have.\nShe had prepared her arguments before she’d summoned Commander\nFisk. They had all boiled down to one thing: if I can end the war with words\nalone, it’s worth the risk. If Fisk had been adamant, she would have brought\nup that she missed her brother. That was true, but it was false, too. She was\npretty certain the man who had been her brother was long dead.\nBut Commander Fisk hadn’t argued at all. ‘Who do you want on it?’\nhe’d asked instead.\n‘You’re not going to try to stop me?’\n‘You’re the Iron White. In my experience, you stop when you’re good\nand ready.’\nHer brow wrinkled. ‘I don’t know if I like being trusted so much.’ Have\nI changed so much? Has the world?\nFisk only sighed. ‘I only know one man who could stop you, and\nbegging the High Lady’s pardon, but I’m not that man, nor will I tell him\nwithout your leave.’\nFisk didn’t mean Gavin. He didn’t mean Ironfist. He meant Andross.\nWas this what happened when you didn’t have strong voices around\nyou? Gavin and Ironfist would have kept her from making mistakes. Instead\nshe was alone.\nFor a single moment, she remembered the day when she was seven years\nold, and her hateful slave-tutor Izza had forbidden her to leave her reading\nlessons until she finished ten pages, even though Karris told her that she\nneeded to use the latrine. Shaking and crying, she’d made it through five\npages before she’d wet her léine.\nShe’d opened the door, and Izza was gone. Her father was in the library\ninstead, meeting with an important noble. He’d looked at her as if she\ndisgusted him. ‘Look what you’ve done!’\nShe soul-wept, hysterical, but he had pushed her away when she tried to\nhug him.\nKarris had never tried to hug him again.\nIt had been Koios who’d found her after she’d fled. He’d wrapped his\ncloak around her and walked through the manse with her. When their\nmother had asked why Karris was wearing his cloak, he’d said they were\nplaying a game.

He’d taken her to the nursery slaves to wash her and her\nclothing, and commanded their silence about the matter.\nThe slave Izza hadn’t been beaten. That wasn’t Rissum White Oak’s\nway. That would have been too direct for him. Instead he sold her to the\nsilver mines at Laurion. Karris still felt a stab of shame at the elation she’d\nfelt when she’d heard that.\nThe silver mines! An educated slave should never have faced such a\npunishment. Especially not a woman.\nAh, that was why she’d thought of that day now: shame and\ndisappointment and her brother, all twined together like wintering serpents\nin a ball of slithering warmth.\nShe was still thinking of that day, of that young man whom she’d adored\nas only a young girl can adore her big brother, when they spotted the\nislands.\nHis note had invited her to choose whichever island she wished in the\ncluster, that she might be assured there was no trap. There were a dozen tiny\nislands here, differentiated mostly by how much or how little vegetation\ncovered them. The Blackguards studied them through long lenses and\npicked one.\nShe jumped out of the skimmer as it came to rest on the blindingly\nbright white sand. Her Blackguards had chosen one of the smallest islands.\nAs she waded ashore, they spread a cloth over the skimmer to hide its\nworkings.\nKarris had worn her whites. She thought that the odds of an\nassassination attempt were about one in two—yes, Commander Ironfist\nwould have been furious they’d come. With those odds, there was no need\nto make herself clumsy with frocks and petticoats. She had a brace of\nIlytian wheel-lock pistols tucked in her belt. They were all ivory and\nscrimshaw—a bit fussy for Karris’s tastes—but they were also the finest\npistols in the Chromeria’s armory.\nTruth was, the whole Iron White thing had taken on a life of its own.\nEvery diplomat and noble who appeared before Karris brought a gift that\nsomehow incorporated white. White leather, white silk, white cotton, white\nflowers—flowers! White with actual iron, white with platinum because it\nwas more expensive, and every once in a while, some daring soul would do\nwhite with gold—for the sun, you see? Because you are so close to\nOrholam, you see?\nOh, I see.\nDid no one—no one?—remember her love for color?\nIf only someone would bring her something red, or green, or black, she\nwould grant their petition immediately, regardless.\nBut Karris wasn’t a woman anymore. To become the Iron White was to\nbecome a symbol. If her greatest sacrifice in this war was giving up her\npreferred fashions, she should really wake each day with a heart full of\ngratitude. She could only hope that someday the inner woman resembled\nthese trappings.\n“There he is,” Gill Greyling said, lens up to his eye. “But what the hell\nis that?”\nHe handed the monocular off to his brother.\n“Don’t know.

Six dorsal fins like\njagged teeth bit the waves.\nAs they entered the shallows, Karris caught sight of a hammer-shaped\nhead and an eye streaming blood or glowing from within with some\ndemonic light.\nIt took everything she had not to step farther away from the waves. A\nrational part of her whispered, ‘They’re simply will-cast sharks,’ probably\nwith red luxin. But her stomach didn’t hear that, her weak knees couldn’t\nhear it, her tight throat wouldn’t.\nIron White, Karris. Iron White. She painted on ambivalence and hoped it\ncould fool the brother who’d known her so well.\nHeedless of the sharks, six bodyguards clad all in white hopped from the\nchariot and waded ashore.

Orholam, let it be so.\nUpon reaching the shore, the bodyguards turned and cast blue luxin to\nmake a bridge. The White King walked to shore without even dampening\nhis boots, leaving only a hunchbacked charioteer behind.\nThey stood nearly a hundred paces from each other, a man in white and\na woman in white, across the white sands, under Orholam’s white, hot eye.\nKarris drew her pistols and handed them off. She drew her bich’hwa and\nher ataghan and handed them off as well. Last, she took her green and red\nspectacles off their necklaces and gave them away.\nThe White King handed off a scepter that could serve as a mace, and a\nsimple hunting knife. He started across the sand without hesitation.\nOf course, either of them could be hiding another weapon. But they\nwere drafters. They both were weapons, against which the only defense\npossible was vigilance. Karris walked toward him.\nWhen she’d been captured by King Garadul, her brother had appeared in\nthe vast carapace of luxin armor he’d created for himself. But this man\ndidn’t so much as shine in the sun. There were no luxin angles reflecting\nlight, no winking blues or flashing yellows.\nHe was smaller than she remembered, barely even taller than she was.\nBut then she saw his face. Somehow she’d forgotten, the scouring of time a\nmercy.\nThe burn scars. Orholam. Her beloved brother’s face looked as if\nsomeone had given a wax poppet to a cruel child. His face had been melted.\nOne eye was lower than the other. A thick knot of tissue had fused his cheek\nto his neck, and then been cut.\nHe looked far, far worse than when she’d met with him in Tyrea.

He’d\nbeen burnt then, but not misshapen.\nShe composed herself against the pity and despair. She had to be sharp\nand cold for this. She was the White, and her office settled over her like a\nblanket of snow, covering the cracks in her armor.\n“Koios,” she said, choosing to let some warmth seep through her tone.\nShe was happy to see him. She was happy to have a chance to end this war,\nslight though it might be.\n“You’ve come a long way since last we met,” he said, gesturing to her\nrobes. Even his voice had changed from when he’d been young. Husky,\ndamaged by the smoke, changed by that damned fire that had changed\neverything else.\n“As have you,” she said.\n“You mean this?” he asked, pointing to his face. “It was hexes, before, to\nminimize your horror, I hoped. I have since become… more comfortable in\nmy own skin. Or what’s left of it, I should say.” He smiled as if it were\nsome unfunny joke.\n“I was referring to the lands you’ve conquered and the untold misery\nyou’ve spread for scores of thousands,” Karris said.\n“We’ve freed four of the nine kingdoms of old,” he said, barely hearing\nher. “But there is so much to be rebuilt. So much that was destroyed\nthrough ignorance and greed.”\nIt was as if they were speaking different languages. He saw himself as a\nbuilder?\n“This is hopeless, then, isn’t it? There is no bridge across this chasm,”\nshe said.\nHe smirked, and it was his old lips, unscarred; his old expression, and an\nold memory. “I had forgotten how intuitive you are, sister. You wrapped\nyourself in the blue virtues, but you understand with your heart first.\nAlways did.”\n“And does that make my judgments suspect?” she asked, coolly.\n“On the contrary. I think you’ve grasped the crux of the matter. There\ncan be no peace between us, only pauses to rearm.”\n“Is that what you’re seeking? An armistice?” Karris asked.\n“Yes,” he said. “Effective immediately. My armies have advanced as far\nas Azuria in Blood Forest. We’ll give the city back as a sign of goodwill. In\nthe north, we’ve crossed the Great River. We’ll fall back to the west bank.\nThe truce lasts until spring. It will give everyone a chance to harvest the fall\nand winter crops—lest everyone starve.”\n“My generals tell me Azuria is indefensible. You’re giving me what I\ncould take with little effort.”\n“And yet you have not taken it,” Koios said. “Perhaps you are spread\nthinner than you would like to admit.”\nHe was right, although the real reason they’d not taken the city was that\nthe question arose, what then? Her armies were needed elsewhere, and the\nChromeria and Satrap Briun Willow Bough of Blood Forest were\nconcentrating on keeping Green Haven free. Instead she said, “If we both\nrearm, it only guarantees that the next war will be even bloodier.”"

Instead she said, “If we both\nrearm, it only guarantees that the next war will be even bloodier.”\n“Life is lived in the pauses between wars. Any peace is better than any\nwar, some say.”\n“Do you take me for one of those?” she asked.\n“I’m not asking anything of you. Any place your troops hold today, they\nshall keep. It shall be my side that falls back.”\n“And I’ll guess that your spies will be repeating all this on the streets of\nBig Jasper within the week? Undermining support for the war?”\n“Mm. That sounds like an excellent idea. It’s a weakness of your empire:\npeople here never want to bleed for strangers over there. Whereas my word\nis holy writ. I command the gods themselves. I say when it is time to bleed\nand when it is time to build, and none question me. Not bad for the\nweakling once beaten by your sadly deceased husband, mm?”\n“What you’ve suffered doesn’t excuse what you’ve done,” Karris said.\n“I’m not looking for an excuse.”\nAnd then she saw the terrible logic of it. Koios might be faced with a\nparticular weakness right now that prompted him to a truce; perhaps he was\nwaiting for someone to be bought off, or a critical shipment of black\npowder to come through. Certainly any pause would undermine support in\nthe satrapies. But those things might not be the point at all.\nKoios wanted both sides to rearm and come back to battle with more\nterrible weapons because Koios wanted slaughter. He wanted to demolish\nan entire generation. It wasn’t just that he wanted to kill everyone who\nstood in his way and war was the most efficient way of lining up your\nenemies and finding out which of your friends might be too formidable\nsomeday. He wanted to prove that the Chromeria’s way of doing everything\nwas utterly broken. He wanted to kill their apologists, and anyone whose\nvery memory would gainsay his new story.\nIt’s easier to build a new culture on the graves of the dead than around\nthe homes of the living.\n“This isn’t the kind of trap I was expecting,” she said.\n“Trap my own sister?” he said, but his mouth twisted.\n“If you kill me, I’ll be a martyr for attempting to find peace, and you’ll\nprove that you’re untrustworthy. Dammit, Koios, how’d you come to this?”\n“Fire burns away illusions,” he said.\n“So now you’ll plunge the satrapies into the fire, hoping it cripples\neveryone else as well?” she asked bitterly.\n“I’m not a madman,” he said. “It’s beneath you to suggest I am. Too\nconvenient by half. As lazy as I’d expect from some Chromeria witch or\nMagisterium sycophant. I thought better of you, though.”\nShe looked at him sadly. “Your plan isn’t mad, brother; it’s evil.”\n“Evil is what we call what we don’t understand.”\nShe took a deep breath. “I’m going to leave here today and wonder why\nI didn’t try to kill you before you could do more harm, aren’t I?”\n“It’s not in you to break a pledge, sister.”\nMaybe it is, this once.\n“How do you do it?” she asked. “How do you convince them all that"

I became one,” he said. “The same way Dazen Guile did it.”\nHe noted her confusion.\n“You’ve either become a better liar than I’d have expected of you, sister,\nor you’ve stayed exactly, disappointingly the same, and you’re still the\nwide-eyed naïf who helped start the last war. You do know that the man you\nmarried is Dazen Guile?”\nShe tried not to react, but his face lit up.\n“You did. So, not a complete naïf. But he kept some things from you.\nHeartbreaking.”\n“Are you really trying to poison my marriage?”\n“Dazen took all pleasures of the flesh from me. If I can be a fly in his\nointment, I will. I wish he were alive so I could kill him with my own\nhands. But… we must all deal with our little disappointments, mustn’t we?”\n“I think we’ve said everything profitable here,” Karris said. “Goodbye,\nbrother. Nice chariot.”\nShe turned her back and started walking away.\n“I did have a trap,” he said as she left. “But I’ll not trigger it. My gift to\nyou, sister, for the love we shared.”\nShe turned again. “The next time we meet, O White King, shall be the\nlast. For the love I bear still for that precious boy who died in fire, I will end\nyou. And I’ll weep for him, but for your death I will feel only relief.”\nHe said nothing, only watched her go, and when they pushed away from\nthe island, the skimmer was surrounded by a score of will-cast sharks. The\nfearsome beasts fell into an escort formation around the skimmer.\nBut as soon as they reached deeper water, an enormous black shape\nburst through their ranks and scattered them like chaff. A whale? A black\nwhale?\n“More than just men are concerned with this war,” Karris said. “That\nshould comfort us.”\nShould. But then, she didn’t feel any comfort herself.\nThey didn’t wait to see what happened. They pushed the skimmer to full\nspeed and headed for home.\nChapter 51\n“This could be good news,” Tisis said in a voice that told Kip the sentence\nwas bound to continue in a direction he wasn’t going to like, “but I doubt\nit.”\nThought so.\n“You remember I told you about my cousin Antonius?” she said.\n“The one you said got all the family charisma?” Kip said. “This is him?”\n“I might not have mentioned his flaws.”\nThe island was like the intertwined fingers of lovers this morning, soft\nand hard, billows of fog covering and revealing a thousand spears and\nmuskets arrayed on every shore around the island. The beauty of the warm,\ndiffuse light of the rising sun setting off the threatened death. “So what\nabout this could be good news?” Kip asked.\n“Lord Guile,” Derwyn Aleph of the Cwn y Wawr said, coming up to\nthem. “The men are ready.”\nEveryone had formed up neatly with their various constituencies.

They\nweren’t integrated or arrayed exactly the way Kip would have preferred. It\nwould do for now. Kip hadn’t read any books on what to do when you’re\noutnumbered and surrounded—and on an island. Probably because no\ncompetent commander in history had ever put himself in such a position.\n“Good. We wait,” Kip said. He motioned for Tisis to go on.\n“Antonius is amazing. I got to spend a couple of weeks with him every\ntime we’d swap off at the Chromeria.”\nKip had known the Malargos family had been required to send hostages\nto the Jaspers to enforce the end of the Blood Wars, and that Tisis had been\none such hostage, but he hadn’t thought through the mechanics of\nalternating the hostages.\n“Everyone loves him, but he’s… he’s a total idealist. Thinks the best of\npeople, but follows authority dogmatically because he trusts that those in\ncommand are acting as he would act if he were in their place. I never\nwanted to tear down my sister by telling him not to trust her that way. I\nhoped that he would grow out of it on his own. More gently.”\nSo we’re fucked.\nKip considered it a moral victory that he didn’t say that aloud. That was\ngood, because a moral victory was the only kind of victory he was going to\nget today. He said, “Allies don’t surround you to cut off every escape.”\n“You convinced age-old enemies to join together yesterday,” Tisis said.\n“This shouldn’t be as hard as all that. Right?”\nHer tone was light, but he could tell she was scared, too. If it came to it,\nwould Kip’s outcasts attack Eirene Malargos’s people?\nWould he?\nIf he did, even a win would embark Kip on a terrible course. The\nmarriage with Tisis was supposed to make peace. That had been Andross\nGuile’s whole reason for arranging for Tisis to think the marriage was her\nown idea.\nApparently Eirene had figured out that Kip had more to lose from a\nclash of arms than she did. Or she simply didn’t believe that he would bring\nit to that—which might be true. Or perhaps she thought Tisis had been\nkidnapped and forced into this marriage.\nA rowboat emerged from the mists. A standard-bearer held a green flag\nwith the Malargos Bull mounted on Antonius’s personal sigil, a shield. So\nthe young man saw himself as a shield for his aunt, Eirene Malargos, and\nhis cousin, Tisis. A saver of damsels in distress. Wonderful.\nAntonius Malargos didn’t look as if he’d come with wedding gifts. He\ndid look young, with a lean build. He held a spear, and a pair of red\nspectacles sat high on his head.

Cruxer\nstood behind Kip and to his left, bearing a flag of the Mighty—was that\nKip’s personal seal now? It would have to do until they could come up with\na flag for the Nightbringers. Tisis was at his right, and at his left stood Conn\nArthur and Derwyn Aleph.\nOn seeing Tisis, Antonius’s face lit up. Gap toothed and wide mouthed,\nhe had an infectious smile, and mere streaks of red through his irises.\n“Sissy!” he said. Ignoring a sharp word from one of his men, he used the\nspear he held to vault off the boat and land ashore without soiling his fine\nboots. He rushed over and hugged her like a little boy, picking her up and\nspinning her around in a circle.\nShe smiled, too, eyes dancing.\nKip was suddenly glad that he knew Antonius was her cousin, because\nbeing jealous of someone who gave his wife joy would have been pretty\nshitty.\nHe put her down and stepped back, and clouds rolled over his open\ndemeanor. “Or should I say Lady Guile now?” he asked.\n“I am proudly both,” Tisis said. “But… if you’re going to call me Sissy,\ndo you want me to call you… ahem?”\nHe winced playfully. “Maybe not in front of my men.”\nTisis said, “Then let me introduce you: Lord Antonius Malargos, my\nhusband, Kip Guile. Kip, my cousin, Antonius.”\nThe Malargos men had come to bracket their commander once more,\nand in contrast to his open spirit and happy demeanor, they had the air of\nmen ready for violence.\n“Sissy?” Kip asked Tisis under his breath as Antonius introduced his\nlieutenants.\nIt was an artful introduction, though, personal rather than the full\nintroduction with all of Kip’s newly claimed titles. That would have\nsounded more impressive, but also directed attention to whose title was\nbiggest, and how these powers would interact with each other.\nKip would need to remember to praise Tisis for that, later. If they had a\nlater.\nHow the hell had Eirene Malargos gotten word that they would be here?\n“I’ve had less kind nicknames,” Tisis murmured.\nIntroductions of his subordinates concluded, Antonius straightened his\nshoulders and cleared his throat. He looked pained. “My dearest cousin,\nEirene has given me some very strict orders. I feel compelled to—”\n“Where have you been?” Tisis asked. Smart. Never let an idealist frame\nyour problem in black and white. “Things have changed very quickly, and\nyour orders may well have been, um, outpaced by events.”\n“Because you’ve come here on skimmers and I couldn’t possibly have\nheard something as recently as you?” Antonius asked.\n“Yes. How’d you even know…”\n“Our family has skimmers now, too. Not as big as those you have\ncovered over there, but enough for a drafter and a messenger to travel\nquickly together. I was upriver, near the Floating City with Satrap Willow\nBough. My orders are only a week old.”"

My orders are only a week old.”\nIn other words, almost as soon as Kip and his friends had blasted past\nRath, Eirene had sent her hounds after them.\nShit.\n“How did you get designs for the skimmers?” Kip asked.\n“Commander Ironfist showed us how to build one. Former commander, I\nguess. As you said, events have been moving quickly.”\n“Why would he give you such a secret?” Kip asked.\nIt was more thinking aloud than a question he expected answered, but\nAntonius said, “Eirene promised him all our intelligence on your location.”\n“So he’s coming here?!” Kip asked.\nHaving Ironfist come to join them was the best news he could imagine.\n“I… don’t know. Apparently he spoke with his sister the Nuqaba, who\nwas our guest at the time. They had a spectacular fight. He disappeared after\nthat, and she left the next day. I don’t know if they were together, or if they\nparted ways.”\nWell, that went from good news to bad quickly. If Ironfist had been\ncoming here, he should have made it already. Unless he’d been waylaid.\nIronfist was intimidating, but he’d also been traveling alone, in these\nwoods, with no law to speak of and many, many talented archers.\nWhat if he’d been killed by some idiot bandits?\n“But that’s beside the point,” Antonius said. “Tisis, Eirene ordered me to\ncome here and take you home. By force if necessary. Come home, Sissy.\nYour family needs you. Your sister needs you.”\n“Home,” Tisis said quietly, nostalgic. “I can’t tell you how much I miss\nthe terraced gardens of Jaks Hill…”\nTisis had a home, and a place. Not just sleeping in the woods, arguing\nwith a boy and in constant danger. An honored place as heir to a vast\nfortune. Her sister Eirene was the real power in Ruthgar. Surely there would\nbe important, fulfilling work for a woman like Tisis there.\nIt made him feel the gulf between them again. He had no home. Twice\nan orphan. Flames and death had taken everything except the Mighty from\nhim.\nThen Kip was struck by the thought that perhaps last night had not been\nthe perfect time to have his first big fight with his bride. With one more\nword, she could destroy them all.\n“I miss Eirene. I miss the mansion,” Tisis said. “My old rooms. I miss\nour people. The smell in the air. The festivals, the races. But I have no home\nbut at my husband’s side.”\nOh, good. She doesn’t want me and all my friends and allies dead.\n“So you’re here by choice? Truly? The slave Verity said so, but Eirene\ndidn’t trust a slave with such a claim.”\nWhy would you name a slave Verity and then not trust her? Mercifully,\nKip didn’t say it aloud. But then, his holding his tongue twice in a row\nmeant he was probably due for a blunder anytime."

Kip can’t hurt you now,\nand, if necessary, we can do this in such a way that Andross Guile never\nhears about it.”\nThere was only one way that could happen.\nBalls! This smiling boy was threatening a massacre. Kip heard\nsomething quite like a growl from Conn Arthur.\nTisis was right about one thing: Antonius was an idealist. If he thought\nhe would simply leave this parley to go order their massacre, he was going\nto find his head separated from his ass in short order.\nTisis said, “Cousin, I am not only here by choice, but by design, as my\nletters should have confirmed. This marriage was my idea, and it may well\nbe the smartest thing I’ve ever come up with. Eirene intends to imprison\nKip, when he can serve the Seven Satrapies and our house both instead.\nWhen he can help save Blood Forest and Ruthgar.”\n“The Guiles unseated you,” Antonius said. “You were the Green. You’ve\nsimply forgiven them that?”\nThrough which Kip heard: Eirene hasn’t.\nAgain Kip was struck with a thought: maybe he had all this capacity to\nbe struck with thoughts because he wasn’t speaking. He hadn’t said\nanything at all. He, Kip Guile, leader of the Mighty, Slayer of Kings and\nGods—fine, singular for each, so far—but he, the Breaker, possibly\nDiakoptês, possibly Luíseach, possibly Lightbringer, was just standing\ndumb and listening to his (furious-at-him) wife do all the talking. His life\nwas a child’s racing boat, bobbing in the stream, suddenly swallowed by the\nrapids, utterly out of his reach.\n“Forgive them?! I thank them for it!” Tisis said. “Cousin, can you\nimagine me outmaneuvering the Golden Spider Andross Guile on the\nSpectrum? Or, failing that, convincing his lickspittles and lackeys to do\nsomething contrary to his will?”\nAntonius paused. He’d obviously never thought about what being on the\nSpectrum entailed. “Perhaps not.”\n“By marrying Kip, I’ve utterly guaranteed the only thing that Eirene\ncould hope I might gain from any number of years on the Spectrum: timely\nhelp from the Guiles—and, through them, all the Seven Satrapies.”\n“He is a good man, a good commander?” Antonius asked as if Kip\nweren’t there, and as if it were one question.\n“He’s barely arrived here and look,” Tisis said. The fog was clearing,\nand the extent of Kip’s forces was obvious now.\nAntonius studied the forces for what seemed the first time. “He’s united\nthe Cwn y Wawr and the Ghosts?”\nThat was answered with a nearly simultaneous grunts of assent from\nConn Arthur and Derwyn Aleph.

Kip thought of saying\nsomething to sway him, but Tisis motioned subtly to be silent.\nYes, dear.\nThe young man finally said, “Lady Eirene is considering… a treaty of\nnonaggression with the White King.”\n“What?!” Tisis demanded.\nDerwyn Aleph bristled, but her hand motioned for his silence, and he\nsaid nothing.\nAntonius went on. “Eirene said you and this Guile fighting the Blood\nRobes might—how’d she say it? ‘Preclude the option of peace for us and all\nof Ruthgar.’”\nTisis was taken aback. “Does she think we can simply trade with that\nmonster?”\n“I know not what she thinks, nor could I likely understand all the\nmachinations in her mind if she explained them. Your sister has a genius for\nsuch things. I don’t like peace with those creatures, either, but my trust in\nher has never been misplaced. And she has given me orders. She won’t\ntolerate anything less than total obedience in this. Not with your life in the\nbalance. You are all she loves.”\n“I love her most dearly, too,” Tisis said. “But sometimes we are called to\nobey higher things. My sister is a merchant queen, not a queen in truth,\nmuch less a warrior queen. Eirene’s brilliant, but she thinks others will be\nrational as well. You remember when you wanted to give your pony to the\nluxiats to sell to feed the poor?”\nHe brightened at the memory. “She told me if I wanted to help, I should\nhave her sell the pony. She’d take a small commission, then invest the\nprofits in one of her businesses. In five years, I could buy a better pony and\nstill give twice the amount of money to the poor—who would surely still be\npoor.”\n“She thinks the White King is like her. He’s not. He’s like us. There’s no\nnegotiating the best deal with someone who plans to kill you and take\neverything.”\nKip moved to speak again, but Tisis gripped his hand: No!\n“She called me a zealot that day, for trying to obey what I understood\nOrholam to be telling me,” Antonius said, with a woundedness unhealed by\nthe passing years. “She didn’t understand me at all. Despite all her smarts.”\nAnd suddenly Kip felt a wind of hope filling his sails with a crack.\n“It’s funny, isn’t it?” Antonius said. “How the Lord of Light asks us to\nstep blind into darkness?”\n“Orholam always gives us light enough to take the next step,” Tisis said.\n“Ha!” Antonius barked. “You know me too well.”\n“Orholam uses the simple to confound the wise,” Tisis said, attempting a\nlight tone.\n“I’m certainly the former,” Antonius said wryly. But then his open face\ntook on a troubled cast. Finally he said, “You seem… happy.”"

He\nis my love.”\nThe thought sent a frisson through Kip. Sure, they had some\ncommitment (at least until one of them revealed they’d never consummated\ntheir marriage), and they’d had some sweetness and excitement in the\nprivacy of their tent (at least until recently), and he liked Tisis, and he\nrespected her far more than he had ever expected to. But was that love?\nOr was she just lying to save their cause?\nBut even if Kip didn’t quite believe her, Antonius clearly did. A slow\ngrin broke over his broad face. “Then my prayers are answered.”\n“Mine, too, cuz,” Tisis said.\nEasy, dear, don’t lay it on too thick.\nAntonius looked down at his hands as if to find an answer there. “I don’t\nwant to kill Foresters. Or Guiles. Especially not for this White King.\nSomehow you boxed in Andross Guile, forcing him to do the right thing in\nagreeing to your marriage.” He looked up and smiled, and Kip felt all the\ntension whoosh out of Tisis. “It’s only fair if we box in Eirene, too. Right?”\nGiving a perfect court bow and then taking one knee in front of Kip,\nAntonius said, “Lord Guile, I took an oath to Lady Eirene Malargos, but my\nallegiance to Orholam is higher. By the inner light that is my conscience, I\nknow I must disobey her. So, Lord Guile, if you would take the oath of a\nman others may justly call Oathbreaker, then until the Blood Robes are\ndestroyed, I pledge my life, my honor, my men, and my fealty to you.”\nAnd… that didn’t go how I expected at all.\nKip decided that in the future, his legend would be that he moved\nenemies to break their oaths and swear fealty without him even saying a\nword. He would be the Unmoved Mover.

It wasn’t the preferred way for Teia to arrange a private\nmeeting with the White, but this couldn’t wait.\n“And you’re certain Andross ordered this?” Karris asked.\nIt had been a long summer and autumn for both of them.

In every spare moment, she’d been scouring\nfor information from every source at her disposal for any hint of Gavin’s\nwhereabouts anywhere in the Seven Satrapies, and sending out teams of\nBlackguards she could ill afford to spare to investigate any rumor.\nTeia had been training constantly, and trying to figure out how to kill\nslaves and how not to kill them. After she’d killed a few to show that she\nwas willing to do so, she’d left one alive with a note that she’d devised an\nexperiment that would take three weeks. She’d left the man—they were\nalways old men—blindfolded, and prayed. He’d been alive the next week.\nIf she took three weeks to kill a slave rather than killing one every week,\nthat was two lives she saved, wasn’t it?\nOr at least two lives she didn’t take, which wasn’t quite the same thing\nat all, was it?\nSharing the burden with Karris had helped some. The White had agreed\nthat Teia needed to continue the killing and training no matter what. But\nTeia was still killing innocents. Nothing made that acceptable.\nEvery honest conversation was a huge risk. If their plans were\nuncovered, every murder was for naught. So Teia swept her gaze around the\nroof of the Prism’s Tower again, and then put on her dark lenses and did it\nagain with paryl. The White had taken to soaking up some sun to think on\nthese late-autumn afternoons, and it was impossible for anyone to\neavesdrop here, but there was no such thing as too careful where the Order\nof the Broken Eye was concerned.\n“My contact called this ‘a little project for our sometime friend,’” Teia\nsaid. “‘Our sometime friend’ was the same phrase he used once when he\ndescribed who ordered Marissia’s kidnapping. And I was there when\nAndross ordered that one, though I didn’t know then that they were talking\nabout Marissia.”\nIt was funny, in a not-funny-at-all sort of way. Teia had been waiting for\nmonths to be activated by the Order. She’d needed to be given something to\ndo that would enmesh her more deeply into their hierarchy. Something, at\nleast, that would stop her murdering innocent old men. Now that something\nhad come, and she felt not relief but fear.\nKarris sighed. “All of us are become weapons in this war, aren’t we? But\nAndross Guile is all blade. I know that to not pick up that naked blade is to\nperish. But he cuts my hand to the bone with every move.” She turned to\nTeia, eyes resigned. “I will never be able to exact justice for Marissia from\nhim, Teia. You know that, right? He’s too valuable.”\n“But you want justice for her, right?” Teia asked. She knew the answer,\nshe thought, but she needed to hear it.\nThe White held her eye. “I hated her, for a time, if that’s what you’re\nasking.”\n“I didn’t mean to—”\n“How do you feel about Tisis?”\n“Excuse me?!” Teia said.\n“If someone murdered her, how would you feel?” Karris asked."

Of course I’d want—but what’s\nthat got to do with—”\n“Are you actually insulted that I know a thing or two about you, Teia?\nYou, who know what we do? How we live? How secrets are our currency?”\n“I don’t know what you’ve been told, but they’re clearly mistaken about\nthat,” Teia said.\n“It was an illustration, not an attempt to embarrass you,” Karris said.\n“How you and Kip feel toward each other only becomes my concern if you\nthreaten his marriage to my very tenuous ally in Ruthgar. What I was trying\nto say—”\n“Daelos. It was Daelos, wasn’t it? That little crippled piece of shit. You\ninterviewed him like three times.”\n“Peace,” Karris said. “What I meant to say is that I long ago burnt\nthrough all my hatred for her. In fact… we were close to becoming friends.\nShe disappeared too soon for that. But enough. Enough of all that. The\nquestion now is what to do about this. Whether we can stop it. Whether we\nshould.”\n“Whether we should?” Teia asked, at first happy not to be talking about\nKip. She shot another paranoid look around. They were still alone. This was\nthe whole reason they’d met. “Andross Guile has hired the Order to kill the\nNuqaba! I mean, I know you’re mad at her, but—”\n“Mad? Mad?! Because she kidnapped and blinded my husband, the\nEmperor of the Seven Satrapies himself? You think that makes me merely\nangry?” Karris asked.\nTeia walked a circuit around the rim of the tower, streaming paryl down\nover the edge to make certain there were no climbers on the outside who\nmight overhear them. Again. Then she said, “I’m not saying she doesn’t\ndeserve death, but you’re the one who was just talking about using dirty\nweapons when they’re the only weapons you have. The Nuqaba is a bitch,\nbut she’s the bitch who runs Paria. Paria.”\nParia had a satrapah, of course. One of the Azmith family. The damned\nAzmiths, who included General Caul Azmith, who’d led the Seven\nSatrapies army to the disasters at Ox Ford and Raven Rock, and Akensis\nAzmith, who’d been nominated to be the White before he tried to kill\nKarris. Shamed on the one hand, aggrieved on the other, they were like a\nmad dog you didn’t want to get too close to. They might cower, or attack\nfor no reason.\nBut even Teia knew that Paria’s satrapah was a figurehead. The Nuqaba\nwas in charge, in charge of the satrapy that two out of every three\nBlackguards and the best soldiers in the world came from.\nBut Karris knows all that. Right?\nTeia realized how foolish it was for her to lecture the White about this,\nbut she couldn’t help saying, “If I fail as I attempt to kill the Nuqaba—hell,"

Ever since the Battle of Ox Ford, they’ve\ncontributed nothing to the war effort. They lost ten thousand men there,\nwhich is grievous, but compares not at all with the thirty-five thousand the\nRuthgari lost. But since then, they’ve been saying they’re still mobilizing,\nand we know they are. But they won’t move. Cowardice or caution or\ntreason, they aren’t coming. Apparently, Andross expects her to say no to\nour ultimatum, or to stall again. So Andross wants to kill her so someone\nmore amenable can take over.”\n“Or maybe he’s upset that she imprisoned and blinded his son?” Teia\nventured.\nKarris looked at Teia, and thought about it. “More likely someone\nmoving against one of his own offends his ego. Regardless, it’s not a bad\nmove. He probably would even expect me to be pleased if she turned up\nconveniently dead. I don’t know that he has anyone in place behind her,\nthough. The Nuqaba conducted a purge recently. I think it may have wiped\nout some of Andross’s spies and agents over there. Now that I could see\nhim being upset about.” Karris pursed her lips. “So that’s why he’d order it.\nBut why would the Order take the job?”\n“Anything that destabilizes the major powers is a net positive for the\nOrder,” Teia said. “They want to institute some kind of new world on the\nashes of the Seven Satrapies.”\n“That might be enough reason,” Karris said. “And I suppose an erratic\nfigure like the Nuqaba is no fun for them, either. Who knows but that they\nlost people in the purges as well. And perhaps the Old Man of the Desert is\nmore motivated by passions like revenge than our icy promachos.”\nKarris looked up toward the fading sun in what might have been prayer.\n“What if… what if I have you intentionally fail… or what if you frame\nsomeone for the deed instead? Who? How? Hmm… Or I could just prevent\nyou from going at all, but that might tip my hand…” She crossed her arms\nunder her breasts and scrunched her shoulders against a sudden cold wind.\n“What would Orea do? Something gentler, no doubt. Something clever and\neven kind. Of course, it’s her fault I have all these Azmiths to deal with in\nthe first place. In this world of bloody-minded men, is there not a smarter\nway? Must the Iron sometimes be a blade?”\nShe was quiet for a long time. Then, finally, Karris straightened her back\nand turned to Teia. “It won’t be enough to kill the Nuqaba. You’ll also need"

You’ll also need\nto kill her master of spies, Satrapah Tilleli Azmith.”\n“Am I to be your official assassin, then?” Teia asked. She couldn’t keep\nthe grief out of her voice.\n“You have a problem with that?” Karris asked coolly.\n“High Lady… I had a chance to murder… two men I find loathsome,\nand it would have stopped much trouble. I didn’t because I felt Orholam tell\nme that I’m not an assassin; I’m a soldier. I’m a Blackguard. Not a knife in\na darkness, a shield.”\n“You train much with a shield?” Karris asked.\n“A little. Trainer Fisk said he’d rather I was in the enemy’s shield wall\nthan his own.” He’d actually said he’d use Teia as a scout instead, even if\nhe had to go one man short.\nTrainer Fisk, of course, had hurled insults at all of them while they\npracticed. But a single day of charging at another line from a mere twenty\npaces, each side equipped only with shields, had convinced Teia not only\nthat Fisk was right, but that no amount of training could help her overcome\nher limitations. Many of the men in the lines were twice her weight; some\nwere three times her weight. Charging full speed into them? She got\nflattened, every time. And holding up a shield for several hours? She\ncouldn’t have done that with both hands, even while not fighting.\nThank Orholam that magic and black powder had rendered shield walls\nand phalanxes mostly obsolete. Teia preferred a buckler or even a targe,\nwhich required more agility and perhaps more luck, but less strength and\nendurance.\n“Then from your training you should know,” Karris said. “Shields also\nkill.”\nTeia remembered the lesson now. She quoted Trainer Fisk: “Those who\nuse a shield only to block are ignoring a weapon in their hands.”\nWell, shit. There went her whole metaphor about being a shield.\n“Teia, you are my shield. You guard me well, but if I get the chance, I\nabsolutely will bring you down on the neck of my enemies.”\nAnd when I shatter, you will cast me aside. Teia didn’t say it aloud.\nBut Karris must have seen the look on her face. “Yes. If you break, I will\ntake up another. We are not so different. I too am serving in greater hands,\nand I too fear that I am inadequate for what I’ve been called to do. I too\nwanted something different from this life.”\n“A slave to your duties, huh?” Teia asked.\nKarris shot an iron glare at her. She hadn’t missed the notes of bitterness\nand scoffing in Teia’s voice. “Yes,” she said. “If I had my way, Teia, I\nwould send you and every drafter after my husband, and then I would add\nevery slave and every tradesman and every soldier in my command, and to\nhell with it if all the satrapies together burnt.

No, mine is not actual slavery. No one beats or rapes me,\nbut you’re a fool if you think my cold, empty bed is much more a comfort\nto me than a slave’s pallet or a soldier’s bunk.”\n“I’m sorry,” Teia said. The one person she could trust, the one person\nwho knew her now that Kip was gone, and she was venting her bile on her.\n“As am I,” Karris said. “Not least for what I’m doing to you. The good\nnews is that this will give us your first solid scent in your hunt for the\nOrder.”\n“How so?”\n“Here’s one of the few beauties of war. Sometimes pieces put into place\nsecretly must be used openly if they are to be used at all. In the same way\nthat you had to break our normal protocol so that you could meet quickly\nwith me today, someone will have to work hard to get you—of all the\nBlackguards—onto that ship. That someone will be in the Order. There are\nreally only two options: it’s one of my watch captains or someone of high\nrank will ask a watch captain to do it for them. So when that captain comes\nin and shows me the deployment orders, I’ll say that I’d prefer you to stay\nhere; you’re my favorite. If that captain is himself the Order’s plant, he’ll\ninsist on you for some reason. If it’s just a favor he’s doing for some\nambassador, he’ll say who asked him to get you on this detail. The watch\ncaptain could lie, of course, but I can check on lies. No matter what they do,\nit gives us something. Given enough time, I’m sure the Old Man could\ncome up with a better stratagem, but he has to act fast here, and he’s\njuggling other subordinates and tasks—as I am. He’ll have to opt for a\ndirect approach.”\nA lead on the Order. That meant an end to infiltration, and an end maybe\nto all of them. Teia could hardly wait.\n“Wait,” Teia said. “Did you say that my second target was the satrapah?\nThe satrapah of Paria? The satrapah is the Nuqaba’s spymaster? I’m to kill\nboth of the most powerful people in Paria?”\nChapter 53\nThe game seemed trivial before Gavin understood it. His daily bread came\ndown the chute. He caught the loaves if he could before they hit the ground,\nwhich would damage the crust.\nThen he would examine every bit of each loaf’s surface, looking for an\ninjection site. He often couldn’t find it. The loaves dropped down the chute\nand collided with several locks on its way to him, so finding a small hole\nwas often impossible.\nHe would tear open a loaf and smell it, sometimes catching a faint whiff\nof something off. Then, with a carefully cleaned, dry finger, he would touch\nthe soft flesh of the broken bread, feeling for wetness or any temperature\nvariation.\nIf he didn’t find it, he would close the loaves up as well as possible and\nwait. The poison, being liquid, would make the affected bread go gummy\nafter a time."

The poison, being liquid, would make the affected bread go gummy\nafter a time.\nThen sometimes Andross would baste the poison onto the outside of a\nloaf, as if buttering a pastry as it baked. That tended to affect either the\nflakiness or the color of the crust, so Gavin took to examining each loaf for\nthose variations.\nIt was harder to examine the weekly fruit, not least because that sweet\ntreat called to him in a way the boring bread never could. Some weeks, only\na single segment of the lime would be contaminated. Other times, it would\nhave seeped through numerous segments, and he would debate with himself\nabout how much of the poison he might be able to ingest without losing\nconsciousness.\nNor was he always perfect. He’d gotten woozy a number of times when\nhe’d eaten some of the narcotic by accident.\nHe’d fought through his sleepiness and never lost consciousness.\nBut that wasn’t the game. That was only the beginning of the game.\nAs the long days passed, until the summer must surely be over, and deep\ninto autumn, Gavin saw that the game was one of endurance, to see if he\ncould keep the same level of boring vigilance day in and day out, as his\nemotions cycled down and further down and the sands scoured the gilded\ngrandeur of the idol he’d erected to himself, and it was revealed to stand on\nbare scaffolding and feet of clay.\nThis game was not a game; it was his whole life.

A political marriage to the White isn’t\nsomething anyone would scoff at. You staying alive only gives her a reason\nto feel guilty.”\n“She doesn’t know I’m alive, so it doesn’t matter,” Gavin croaked. This\nwill-casting was better than some of the others at getting him to talk. Or\nmaybe Gavin was just that much weaker now.\n“No, I meant when they find your body.

They tasted wonderful.\nHe could hardly hear the dead man laughing, and not for long.\nChapter 54\nThe skimmer ride from Big Jasper to Azûlay showed Teia how fast this war\nwas changing the world.\nLike many great discoveries, Gavin Guile’s insight was simple in\nretrospect: instead of taking the oar as his paradigm, or the sail, he took the\nwind itself. The skimmers were powered by drafters who shot unfocused\nluxin to propel them.\nBut Andross Guile had seized on his son’s original insight and innovated\nupon it, realizing that the new technology had a cultural implication: the\ntypical threshold by which a satrapy justified the cost of educating a drafter\nat the Chromeria was her ability to make a solid, stable luxin in one or more\ncolors.\nWhat Andross was the first to realize was that the reedsmen didn’t need\nto draft stable luxin. So he had called up all the discipulae who’d failed out\nof the Chromeria in the last four decades. Hundreds of suitable candidates\nhad been found already. Thus, he gained an entire corps for transportation\nand saved the halos (and lives) of his trained drafters for war. Four of those\nnow powered the ultralight skimmer that propelled Teia, the messenger, and\nbarely more than the clothes on their backs across the sea to Paria.\nBut they made it in a day and a half. Gavin Guile was rumored to have\nbeen able to go twice as far in a single morning, but Gavin was also\nrumored now to have been ten feet tall, to have ended wars with a word,\nand to have been able to draft black and white luxin both. Gavin was said to\nhave had a shining mien that made men gape and maidens swoon.\nThe mien part was basically true, but still. Though Teia would admit he\nwas a man the likes of which the world would never see again, he wasn’t a\ngod.\nThey also said now that he was going to come back to the Seven\nSatrapies in their hour of greatest need to save them all.\nWould have been better if he hadn’t left us in our hour of greatest need,\nTeia thought. He was dead now. As like as not, the Order itself had killed\nhim. He was simply too powerful and unpredictable for them to tolerate.\nAll too soon Teia and the messenger, a senior diplomat named Anjali\nGates, were in sight of Azûlay. Teia tried to get all her gawking out of the\nway before they docked, but the grandeur of the city defied dismissal.\nTheir first glimpse was of the lighthouse called the Sword of Heaven. Its\nred glass dome gleamed in the sun like a ruby set in its pommel, walkways\nmade the hilt, and the body of the lighthouse made a blade, its point buried\nin the earth. From the ground up, the first ten paces were blank gray stone\nlike steel, above that the stone was whitewashed, and above that beaten\ngold had been laid over the stone into flames, as if fire were emanating from\nthe hilt down the blade.\n“You should see it on Sun Day,” Anjali Gates said, coming to stand next"

I wanted to see all the wonders of this world.”\nShe fell silent, and Teia asked, “And have you?”\nAnjali grinned. “Well, I’ve not seen the City of Stone in the Cracked\nLands, but no one else has either for at least four hundred years. As for the\nrest, mostly. From the Everdark Gates to the Melos Deeps, from the Rath\nDelta in flood to the Floating City.

I’ve played Nine\nKings with satraps and danced a gciorcal with one of the last pygmy\nchiefs.”\n“Really?” Teia asked.\n“Really. We diplomats often stretch the truth, and sometimes make what\nwe say seem to be the opposite of what we’re actually saying, but we do our\nbest not to lie straight-out.” Anjali smiled. “Well, at least that’s the\nChromeria’s school of thinking. Other nations, satrapies, and even clans\nhave other approaches.”\n“You just go from wonder to wonder? Nice work if you can get it, huh?”\nTeia said.\n“Oh, don’t get me wrong, most of my work has been much more\ntedious. It took me a full year to negotiate the passage taxes the Aborneans\ncharge on the Narrows. A year working, for an agreement that only lasts ten.\nThough naturally, one flatters oneself that the representatives will simply\nrenew it when it expires four years from now. If the satrapies last so long.”\n“How’d you get to see all those things, though? You don’t even look that\nold. Er, sorry.”\nAnjali grinned. “Easy. I gave myself all the interesting assignments.”\n“You what? Wait, how senior are you?” Teia asked.\n“Ambassadorships are given out to friends of satraps and Colors.\nThey’re not quite sinecures, but they are largely ceremonial positions.\nImportant for what they do, of course, but there are entire armies of people\nlike me—the career diplomats, not the political appointees—who get the\nwork done where the satrapies rub each other wrong. Fishing rights, piracy,\nextradition of criminals and runaway slaves, water rights, taxes, spot checks\nof compliance to the slave laws, and, of course, these days, communicating\nand compliance checks of the new balancing dictates.”\nThe new laws governing drafting that Promachos Guile and the\nSpectrum had instituted didn’t apply to drafters training for war, so Teia\nhadn’t even noticed them. Drafters elsewhere, however, had to compensate\nfor the war effort—not drafting a certain color as news of light storms came\ninto the Chromeria, or trying to draft more of its opposite color.\n“I imagine that’s a nuisance,” Teia said.

Azûlay was built on a steep hill down to the\nsea after the arm of its protected bay and the lighthouse. Buildings were\npacked literally against each other, sharing walls up four and five stories\nand redbrick roofs, differentiated from their neighbors only by their\nindividual bright-pastel walls. Ivies and greenery of all sorts sprouted\neverywhere.\n“A nuisance? You have no idea, do you?” Anjali Gates said. “In the rich\ncities like Big Jasper, sure, drafters still use magic for entertainment and\nconvenience. But in the villages where most people live, a ban on green in\nthe fall might damage the olive harvest or mean only natural fertilizers can\nbe used with the barley and wheat plantings. Sub-red is chronically\nrestricted, so if the weather turns bad an entire grape harvest might be\nruined. Worse, it means a new mother with a fever can’t be cooled. A\nnuisance? Child, people are dying so your compatriots can train with fire.”\nTeia swallowed. She’d not even considered it.\n“On the plus side, there haven’t been as many light storms since the\nrules were instituted, and no reports of bane in months, of course.”\nOrholam’s ball sweat. But Teia said, “You never answered me, did you?\nAbout your position.”\n“Oh, did I not?” But Anjali Gates smirked. “I’m the corregidor emeritus\nof the diplomatic corps.”\n“That means you were the boss but you retired?” Teia said.\n“Unretired now. Briefly. They needed someone who had a chance of\nreasoning with the… mercurial Nuqaba, and someone expendable, in case\nshe does to me what has been done to messengers bearing unwelcome news\nfrom time immemorial.”\n“Tough assignment,” Teia said.\n“I volunteered.”\n“I didn’t,” Teia groused.\n“I know, that’s why I brought it up.”\n“What do you mean you brought it up? I asked you out of the blue.”\n“Did you? Regardless, if they seize me, you should get the hell out. If\nthey take me, they’ll either kill me outright, or possibly do something to\nshame me. Send me back naked or shave my head or rape me. Each is its\nown word in the language of diplomacy. The Chromeria will respond\nappropriately, as it finds possible.”\n“What the… what the hell does that even mean?” Teia asked.\n“If the Chromeria were to later seize the Nuqaba alive, then if she has\nbeheaded me without torture, she would be beheaded in turn. If she sends\nme back naked, she would likewise be paraded through the streets. If I were\nto be raped on her orders, she would be tortured horribly and shamed\npublicly as much as possible, though not raped, of course: we aren’t\nanimals. Most leaders have an intuitive understanding of this kind of\ngraduated retribution, if not an explicit one. Of course, how she conducts\nherself in the intervening time between my death and her reckoning could\nnegate or change all of this.”\n“And you volunteered?” Teia asked.\n“I’m old,” Anjali said cheerfully. “After negotiating grain prices and cart"

But\nit also takes a certain gravitas to deliver a proper epistolary beating. If I pull\nthis off, I’ll have to award myself the corps’s highest honor. If I don’t, I’ve\nleft orders that they should award it to me posthumously.” She grinned at\nTeia.\n“What’s an epistolary beating?”\n“Watch the introduction. You’ll see what I mean. Just because I know\nthe ceremonial bows and the twenty-seven titles of the Nuqaba Haruru\ndoesn’t mean I like reciting them. You realize you’re part of this diplomatic\ngrammar, right?”\n“Huh?”\n“One Blackguard accompanying me, not two, and the one they send is…\npetite. Forgive me for stating what others will think, I do not share this\njudgment and in fact know your reputation well—but the Nuqaba will see\nyou as a little girl. Your slight stature makes you look even younger than\nyou are. She might not even believe that you’re a Blackguard. The\nChromeria sending you to accompany me is a small snub, but it also means\nthey’re less likely to take or kill you. They’ll think you’re some child put\ninto this role, and whatever glory they might find in defeating or\nhumiliating a big man Blackguard is therefore absent.”\n“My presence itself is an insult? And that’s supposed to make me feel\nbetter?” Teia asked.\n“I’m trying to help you gauge and define your own scope of actions\nhere. This isn’t my assignment alone. It’s ours.”\n“You really think we can reel them back in?” Teia asked. She hadn’t\nmeant to ask a real question. She knew what she had to do here.\n“I think diplomacy may resolve all conflicts between parties of\ngoodwill.”\n“That last bit is the part that bites you in the ass, isn’t it?”\n“Rather, it’s the part that bites you in the ass, my young Blackguard\nfriend. For where there’s no goodwill, my job ends.”\nTeia had thought for a moment that they were very different indeed.\nAnjali the happy talker, traveling through the satrapies, her words bringing\nlife and peace wherever she went, soothing conflict and finding outcomes\nacceptable to all parties; Teia the shield that came down on stiff necks.\nBut perhaps they were simply two different horses, pulling the same\nchariot of state. Anjali, at the front, saw different scenery wherever she\nwent. Teia, pulling behind her, saw only horses’ asses and different kinds of\nroad.\nThey passed under the very shadow of the lighthouse, the reedsmen\nartfully guiding their small craft between the hundreds of ships going in and\nout of the port.

People\nbegan pushing closer on the crowded beach to get a look at them, so Teia\nthrew her cloak back off her shoulders to reveal the sword and pistols at her\nbelt and the rope spear wrapped around her waist, its long blade hanging\ndown one thigh like another sword.\nThe crowd backed off, but Teia and Anjali didn’t even make it off the\nbeach before they were stopped by a detachment of port guards. Evidently,\nthe oddity that was the skimmer speeding across the waves had elicited\nsome alarm.\nAnjali Gates did all the talking, declaring them to be a delegation from\nthe Chromeria and demanding the skimmer and their men be unmolested\nwhile they themselves should be accompanied to the satrapah’s palace.\nWhile the diplomat spoke, Teia did her best to look imposing without being\nthreatening. It was doubly hard with her feet sunk into the sand while the\nport guards stood on the paving stones of the street just above them. Teia\nfelt about as tall as Caelia Green.\nNo wonder Buskin had worn those shoes. Teia would give her second-\nfavorite rope spear right now to be a little taller.\nIn short order, though, they found themselves being escorted through the\nstreets. Teia wished that they could take their time in the city instead. Steep\ncobbled streets led up to a plateau where the majority of the city rested, and\nivy adorned every building. Where the ivies or wisteria had torn apart stone\nor lumber, the people had simply rebuilt around them rather than trimming\nthem back, even building supports to prop up ancient vines. Every window\nwas a riot of flowering plants as well. The pastel paints were fresh and\nbright.\nAnd the people, ah, the people.\nAzûlay was as cosmopolitan as any of the other great cities of the Seven\nSatrapies, but here the many skin tones of the satrapies’ ethnicities were\npainted on a background of many Parians. It made Teia feel oddly at home,\nand she realized only slowly that it was because she didn’t feel odd. In Big\nJasper she hadn’t stood out, simply because everyone stood out. But this\nwas different. Homey.\nShe wasn’t able to enjoy it or explore any of the little alleys, though—\neach one adorned with murals, it seemed—or visit the little kopi counters or\nthe kitchens wafting heavenly smells into the street. A great wide ribbon of\nless steep grand boulevard switchbacked up the great hill so wagons could\nmake their way to and from the port, but the guards took them straight up,\nsometimes climbing steep stairs, muscling aside burnous-clad crowds when\nnecessary.\nSome kind of palace guards joined them halfway up, and at the doors of\nthe palace grounds, four of the Nuqaba’s personal guard, the drafting Tafok\nAmagez, fell in around them. Dressed in white and black with blue vests the\ncolor of the sky, the Sun Guards claimed their genesis from Lucidonius’s\nfirst followers and personal guard, but the only thing relevant about them\nfor Teia was that these were the men who’d helped blind Gavin and tried to\nkill Karris and Ironfist and Essel and Ben-hadad. They had killed Hezik."

They had killed Hezik.\nHe’d been a jovial braggart, and Teia hadn’t known him well—but he was\nher brother, and she would never forgive his killers.\nKarris had sneered about the Tafok Amagez’s magical abilities, calling\nthem blunt drafters who lacked all subtlety. But no one had criticized their\nfighting abilities, and Teia saw that they held themselves like professionals.\nTeia realized that if she hadn’t come as an assassin, her role here would\nbe entirely ornamental. If the Parians decided to kill her, she would be lucky\nif she took down even one before they got her. So she pulled her cloak back\naround herself.\nIt’s a bad idea to poke a lion in a cage.\nThese lions weren’t caged.\nWhen they entered the grand doors of the palace itself, Teia almost\nmissed a step. Soaring ceilings, white marble, black marble, flying\nstaircases, stained-glass-filled clerestories, jewels and onyx and a giant\nstatue that seemed to be made entirely of obsidian and gold standing on\npowerful legs, wearing what Teia thought was called a toga, reaching\ntoward the sky—the sun?—with yearning, and with determination in his\nclenched jaw.\nAnjali Gates saw Teia’s astonishment. “At the midwinter feasts, the\npyroturges remove the pinnacle cap of the dome and lower an incendiary.\nAll night long, he reaches for a burning sun, and these stained glass\nwindows shine light out for leagues for everyone to see all through the\nyear’s longest night. Inside, there is one hell of an all-night party.” She\nsmiled at a memory. “He is known as ‘handross Orh’olam. The Seeker after\nthe Lord of Light. Or perhaps the Striver after Orholam. Or, less popularly,\nHe Who Strives with Orholam.”\n“‘With’ as in ‘with,’ or ‘with’ as in ‘against’?” Teia asked.\n“Indeed.”\n“I think I lost you there,” Teia said as they ascended a staircase with no\nrailing or visible supports.\n“The grammar allows for either interpretation, but these are a pious\npeople. It is best not to note aloud that while their people were the first to\nfight with Lucidonius, they were also the first to fight with Lucidonius.”\n“Ah,” Teia said.\n“A subtle tongue, it is, Old Parian. So contextual, and we don’t possess\nso much of that context anymore. The scholars even say that instead of\n‘handross Orh’olam, it may actually be ‘handross h’olam. Which would\nmake it the Seeker after the Hidden.”\n“Or He Who Strives with or against the Hidden?” Teia guessed.\n“Indeed,” Anjali said.\n““handross’? That isn’t the same root name as Andross…”\n“It is. The Guile family has deep roots here in Paria.”\nBy chance or design, they had arrived while Satrapah Azmith was\nholding court. More palace guards in white and black stopped them at the\ndoor."

More palace guards in white and black stopped them at the\ndoor.\n“Weapons? Any other contraband? Dangerous items?” a young man\nasked.\nAnjali Gates handed over a belt knife and was given a chit with which to\nreclaim it.\nTeia just stared at the man. She threw back her cloak. “I’m a\nBlackguard, cur. By ancient right and treaties, we go unarmed nowhere. Our\nright holds in the presence of Colors and satraps and the Prism himself.”\nThe man gulped and shot a look at the Tafok Amagez. “I’m commanded\nto let no one…”\n“We are here with an emergency message from the promachos and the\nWhite and the entire Spectrum,” Anjali said. “Young man, Orholam help\nyou if you detain us. The fate of the satrapies themselves rests upon a\nspeedy response from your people.”\n“I, uh…”\nOne of the Tafok Amagez interrupted. “Oh, quit this! We can handle one\nlittle girl, whatever they dress her in.”\nOne little girl? Teia knew she should feel good they’d said it. She was\nsupposed to be underestimated. So it was working.\nBut fuck them.\nThe guard had the Tafok Amagez sign for her, and then let them pass.\nThey opened a small door inset in the great hall doors.\nThe great hall was a variation on the entry’s theme: several stories tall,\nstained glass in clerestories, flying buttresses, and here silver and ebony and\nteak and walnut woods with mirrors that beamed diffuse sunlight to the\nplatform.\nThe four Tafok Amagez and an equal number of palace guards took\nthem to a line at least a hundred supplicants long and stopped at the back of\nit. Teia could barely see the Nuqaba and the satrapah from here.\nThe Nuqaba sat at the satrapah’s right hand—or perhaps the satrapah sat\nat her left. Their chairs were of almost an equal height, the Nuqaba’s a\nsmidgen lower, but significantly grander.\nAnjali Gates held herself at peace. When it took another ten minutes for\nthe Nuqaba and the satrapah to finish with one case, the details of which\nTeia couldn’t even hear, the diplomat put on her violet-tinged spectacles—it\nhadn’t even occurred to Teia that the woman was a superviolet drafter. Of\ncourse she was.\nAs soon as a chamberlain brought down his iron-capped staff onto the\nfloor, causing a bang that Teia assumed meant judgment had been rendered,\nAnjali was out of her place in line like a shot.\nSomehow she moved quickly without appearing to hurry, and she was\nten paces down the main aisle before even Teia moved. An instant later, the\nTafok Amagez woke up and poured out after them.\nAnjali pulled a small orb from a pocket and twisted it. She held it above\nher head as she continued to walk, and in an instant it bloomed, and then\nburnt an intense yellow.\n“Blessed Nuqaba! Exalted Satrapah Azmith! I come from the"

This is my proof,” Anjali boomed, just as Teia and the Tafok\nAmagez caught up with her. “I come with an emergency message from the\npromachos himself and the White’s own pen for the entire Spectrum.”\nThe spectacle—and Anjali’s confidence—was enough to buy them time\nto get to the front of the room, but there a rank of Tafok Amagez had\ndeployed, spears leveled, blocking their path to the platform.\nAnjali Gates stopped and held out the beacon toward the commander of\nthe Tafok Amagez facing her. “For your inspection.” She promptly ignored\nhim.\nSatrapah Azmith conferred with the Nuqaba. She had the dark, dark skin\nof a mountain Parian, with long, narrow limbs adorned with gold and\nturquoise bands. She wore a transparent black veil trimmed in gold, and a\nflowing black burnous with black embroidered squares interlocking. A jug\nof wine sat on the table at her left hand for her to serve herself. She said,\n“We’ve not seen the western star beacon in these lands for decades. You’re\nlucky the Amagez didn’t skewer you.”\n“Such a fear didn’t even occur to me. We are all loyal children of\nOrholam here, and brothers and sisters under the light,” Anjali said. She\nmight have stressed the word ‘loyal’ just a little.\nThe satrapah and the Nuqaba spoke again, and Teia was stunned by the\nNuqaba’s glamour. Where the satrapah was modest and sedate, the Nuqaba\nlooked more like a pagan priestess oozing sensuality and demanding\nattention than a servant of Orholam humbly directing attention up toward\nthe Lord of Light.\nOf course, Gavin Guile had certainly had more than a little smoldering\nsensuality himself when he wanted to, and Teia had heard women getting\nthemselves worked up just talking about how he’d looked during Sun Day\nfestivities past, where he’d gone more than half-naked.\nSo maybe it wasn’t any different. But it felt different. For a moment,\nTeia forgot her training and took in all the jewels, the perfectly tailored\ndress that emphasized the woman’s enviable curves, and the gold and ochre\nand kohl face paints highlighting her eyes and the tattoo under each:\njudgment under the left and mercy under the right.\nBut then she remembered herself, and looked not to outer things but as a\nBlackguard looking at a potential opponent. The hauteur overlaid physical\nweakness. Her upper arms were flabby. There was a loose puffiness in her\nface that spoke either of overindulgence last night or of chronic\noverindulgence. Her eyes were glassy, as if she’d been enjoying ratweed\nthis morning. Her attitude was insolent.\nIn short, though the Nuqaba had to be in her midthirties, she reminded\nTeia of a Blackguard nunk who needed a good ass-kicking.\nThe Nuqaba waved lazily at her Tafok Amagez to withdraw.

All of them\nwere eyeing Teia’s many weapons, glancing back only occasionally, so\nnone of them happened to be looking at her as she gave the gesture. A look\nof sudden rage at being ignored washed over the Nuqaba’s face and she\nsnapped her fingers. Not just once, but twice. As if they were dogs.\nAll of them looked back at her. All of them. The men weren’t fools or\namateurs, so it spoke to Teia of how horribly the Nuqaba must treat them.\nWhen the Nuqaba wanted their attention, she demanded all of it. It was\nstupid. If Teia were an assassin, it would have given her ample time to draw\nher flintlock pistol and—\nOh shit. She was an assassin.\nJust not that kind.\nThe Nuqaba slashed her hand, and the men pulled back instantly.\nStill, their commander gave orders, and as Teia and Anjali took several\nmore steps forward, Teia saw that two Tafok Amagez quietly lit slow\nmatches and affixed them to muskets. The others were already filled with\ntheir colors, and Teia realized that the front of the great hall was covered in\na pristine white rug that had to be there so that the bespectacled Tafok\nAmagez could draft as quickly as possible.\nOne paryl drafter. If there’s just one paryl drafter here, I’m in big\ntrouble.\nThe Nuqaba was studying them, and apparently it was good manners not\nto speak until given permission, because Anjali Gates held her tongue as if\nhappy to wait all day.\nTeia had slightly more trouble doing so when the Nuqaba looked at her\nand openly sneered. Apparently she saw only a little girl, too. Again, it\nshould have felt good.\nAgain, it didn’t.\nThe Nuqaba turned to Satrapah Azmith, but spoke loudly enough for all\nto hear. “Do you know, back when my brothers joined the Blackguard, it\nwas a revered body. In fact, to get in, I think you actually had to have\nreached puberty!”\nThe satrapah chuckled and the front rows laughed like sycophants.\nTeia had to take deep breaths. A Blackguard guards her tongue. This was\nexactly what she wanted, right? To be overlooked… by these disrespectful\npieces of—easy, T, a Blackguard guards her tongue.\nThe Nuqaba harrumphed and turned to the satrapah again, this time\nmore quietly asking a question about the star beacon. She asked a few other\nquestions, and Teia was able to get enough of a grip on her temper to see\nhow clever it was to have the satrapah be the Nuqaba’s spymaster. Everyone\nknew that Tilleli Azmith was a figurehead, so they would take the Nuqaba’s\nspeaking with her to be merely keeping up appearances. The satrapah would\ndaily meet with dozens of the most important people in the satrapy and\nbeyond, but would be underestimated if not dismissed.

Karris had told her that her\ntime to strike the satrapah might be during the very first paragraphs of her\nmessage. She’d said that the satrapah might find them so infuriating that if\nshe went into seizures or had a heart attack, no one would be surprised.\nWhile keeping her arms carefully motionless and down at her sides, Teia\nreadied paryl in her fingertips. She hadn’t had time to scope out every one\nof the Tafok Amagez. One of them might be a paryl drafter. If so, Teia was\nabout to sign her own death warrant.\nBeside her, Anjali’s voice took on the cadence of Karris’s own as she\ndelivered the White’s message:\n“Tilleli, you’re useless. If you’d fulfilled your duties as satrapah with a\nmodicum of competence, I’d be addressing this letter to you. You haven’t,\nso I’ll not keep up the pretense that you matter. Further, in our hope of\nsomeday working with a representative who possesses a spine, by\nunanimous vote, the Spectrum hereby strips you of the rights and privileges\nof a satrapah. We will eagerly await whichever successor the Nuqaba names\nfor you, and address this letter to her instead.”\nTeia had her eyes locked on the satrapah. The woman looked as if she’d\nbeen run over by a charging horse. But her face didn’t go to rage.\nTeia hesitated.\nAnjali Gates continued, unperturbed, in the sudden, utter silence in the\ngreat hall. She turned to the Nuqaba. “Haruru, let me be blunt. You\nwounded my husband and tried to kill me. As a woman, I despise you and\nhate what you’ve done. No doubt you hate me as well. But I speak to you\ntoday not as a wife, but as a woman entrusted to care for the drafters of the\nSeven Satrapies, even as you have been entrusted to care for the believers\nof Paria and beyond, and to guard the legacy of the Lucidonius. We are\ngreater than our quarrel, and we would besmirch our offices and indeed our\nvery faith if we were to brawl like tavern wenches who might only upset\ntables and feelings. So I put our personal quarrel behind us, and trust you\nwill do the same.”\nThe Nuqaba had slowly been rising from her chair as Anjali spoke. For a\nmoment, Teia thought that the Nuqaba was going to bolt out of her throne\nand attack the diplomat with fists and fingernails.\nIf she did, should Teia fight her off?"

Shit. That meant Teia couldn’t take this\nopportunity to assassinate her.\nAnjali continued her message placidly, but Teia could tell that the\nmadwoman was enjoying the hell out of this. “That said, we have not the\nluxury of time to continue overtures and negotiations and stalling and\ngames. The Seven Satrapies are at war.\n“We need you, Haruru. We need Paria wholeheartedly with us. Without\nyour soldiers, the Seven Satrapies will fall. You think you have three\nchoices: one, helping us and losing many of your men; two, joining the\nColor Prince and possibly being rewarded greatly, at the cost of violating\nyour oaths and inviting civil war with those still loyal to us; or three,\nwaiting as long as possible, hoping that we slaughter each other, and then\ncoming in at the end and ending up in a better position than either, and\nmaybe setting up your own empire.”\nTo see the cynicism and disloyalty of those calculations laid out so\nnakedly took the breath of many in the great hall. Even those jaded enough\nto have read the tea leaves in what the Nuqaba was doing were shocked to\nhave someone actually say it publicly.\nTeia saw then that Karris White’s power was in speaking openly what\nothers trusted everyone would hide. This is the game, others thought.\nKarris said, I see your game… and no.\nAnjali said, “If you thought those were your choices, you were wrong.\nI’m not giving you those options. The Color Prince will destroy the\nChromeria utterly without you. You owe us your loyalty. We ask for nothing\nthat doesn’t already belong to us. So if we are to die, you will die, too. I will\nleave my back exposed to the Color Prince, knowing it will mean the loss of\nthe Jaspers and the Chromeria, and I will sail all of my soldiers to your\nhome. And all my drafters, who train for war even now. When we arrive, we\nwill kill everyone who joins you in treason. We will enslave the families of\nall those disloyal to us, and give their lands and houses and titles to those of\nour friends who remember their oaths.\n“Under such circumstances and with such promised consequences, how\nmany of your men will join you in treason? Even if all of them do, the\nChromeria still has power enough to destroy you. We will, utterly. This we\nswear. And then we will attempt to colonize Paria, and hold our defense\nagainst the Color Prince in your—our—mountains. This strategy will likely\nmean our death. We are willing to risk it. For us, it is a likely death against a\ncertain one.\n“Now Blessed under the Light, Guardian of Truth, Arbiter of Mercy,\nHoly Nuqaba, your choice is simple: fight us or delay us and certainly die,"

The forest air between the old giant spruces was cool and soft\nwith thick curtains of fog.\nThe fog was welcome. It dampened vision and noise both, so it would\nmake Kip’s superviolet signal flares visible only within a small range, thus\nlimiting the dangers his men faced.\nThey were deep in enemy-held territory, attacking a supply train full of\nblack powder mined and refined in Atash heading to resupply the White\nKing’s Blood Robes besieging Green Haven. Destroying it would be good.\nSeizing it would be much, much better.\nThrough all their recent months of raiding, Kip had carefully been\nbuilding a profile for his Nightbringers. Unless they had an overwhelming\nforce, they attacked during the day, often just before dark so they could melt\naway into the night, relying on their superior woodscraft. That identified\nthem as a force that relied on drafting, and as raiders, glorified bandits.\nWhere other guerrilla forces traditionally exaggerated their numbers, Kip\nconsistently understated his own, even when procuring food and supplies\nfrom merchants and friendly towns. He relied on Eirene Malargos’s quiet\nlargesse to cover the shortfalls.\nIt had been another of Tisis’s victories, mollifying her furious sister for\nturning Antonius and refusing her orders to come home by making promises\nshe and Kip would someday regret if they lived so long. They’d also had to\ntrade intelligence for food—Eirene was a merchant to the core.\nOn the other hand, the woman wasn’t going to let her only sister and\nfavorite cousin starve or die out here because they lacked supplies.\nA further part of Kip’s stratagem was that fire was usually a big part of\ntheir attacks, used with only the crudest drafting—first from necessity as the\nGhosts learned Chromeria-style drafting, and later to hide how effective the\nMighty had been at training their new compatriots. The Cwn y Wawr Kip\nused everywhere. The Ghosts’ will-casting he used more judiciously, mostly\nfor scouting and for tracking and killing the Blood Robes’ scouts.\nBut the Nightbringers’ ranks had swelled as their fame grew, and\nkeeping secrets amid a growing army was a losing game—especially when\nyour army included the giant grizzly Tallach that was partnered with Conn\nArthur.\nStill, Kip’s attempts at secrecy and the lightning-fast relocation that the\nskimmers allowed had borne fruit. Now it was time to push into the next\nstage of the war.\nKip hoped that all meant the Blood Robes wouldn’t be ready for a night\nattack of this magnitude.\nHe found Sibéal lying under some bushes at a good vantage point, her\nskin flushed the adrenal war blue of her people.

He lay down beside her and\nclicked his tongue softly. Two mastiffs in heavy armor came up on either\nside of him. The Cwn y Wawr—the Dogs of Dawn—hadn’t chosen their\nname at random. They’d kept war dogs for centuries. Getting the dogs’\nhandlers to agree to let will-casters close to those beloved hounds had been\nbeyond Kip’s persuasive powers.\nBut somehow, someone in the will-casters’ ranks had convinced the\nCwn y Wawr that they cherished the animals they partnered with, and that\nthe dogs would be safer with a human partner than without. Perhaps it had\nbeen that simple. Kip didn’t know how it had happened.\nThat was what it was to be part of a team. Others were out there, doing\nthings you never heard about to try to achieve the same goals you had.\nThere was a sound low in the bushes, and a hound with droopy ears\nemerged. Sibéal Siofra woke and the hound shook itself as if it had been\nwet. Then it licked her as she reported, “Sixty oxen. Somewhere around one\nhundred men. Sarai’s not good at counting that high and their scents are all\non top of each other. Sixty-two horses. A blue drafter. Four red drafters. Red\nluxin. Two greens. And, um, freshly dug earth?”\n“From fortifications, I’d guess. War dogs,” Kip announced, “those are on\nyou. Clear a path for us.”\nKip gave a few moments for the word to filter down his lines. Men were\nmaking the sign of the three and the four, praying. Kip looked back at the\nmassive hillock behind him that was Conn Arthur’s giant grizzly Tallach.\nHe really needed to have that talk with the conn about his brother. Not\ntonight, though.\nThe giant grizzly was lying down so as not to upset any of the other\nanimals more than necessary. Its head, helmed with blackened steel and\nyellow luxin over the eyes, bobbed in assent. That and a small breastplate\n(well, small relative to a mountain) were all the armor the great bear would\ntolerate.\nKip threw up a superviolet flare to signal the drafters to fill themselves\nwith their colors, sharing lux torches and shielding them under blankets.\nThe lux torches’ flaring made for a lot of night-blind drafters—not all of\nthem had at-will pupil control yet—but it couldn’t be helped.\nHe studied the trees for reflections of light from the torches and was\npleased to see none.\n“Wolves,” Kip said quietly. “Go!”\nThey tore off with the unnerving speed of the predators they were. They\nwere to hit the camp first, silently, and take out as many sentries as possible.\n“War dogs. Go.”\nThe mastiffs were off only slightly slower, all big shoulders and spiky\narmor, and terrifying mass. If the wolves didn’t raise an alarm, the war dogs\ndefinitely would.\n“Night mares.

All\nwere will-cast and carried Cwn y Wawr drafters on their backs. A will-cast\nhorse knew when you needed it to be silent, and the union of its animal\ndexterity with full human intelligence and discipline—discipline not to bolt\ndespite the pressures of battle and magic and snarling animals on every side\n—meant every one of them was at least the equal of a well-trained veteran\nwarhorse.\nKip turned and found Tallach waiting, snout low and level to the ground.\nKip stepped up and grabbed the horns of his platform. One didn’t ride a\ngiant grizzly. Its mass was too great for human legs to straddle. And if you\nsomehow strapped yourself on, the undulations of its great form when it ran\nwould break you. Instead Ben-hadad had designed something halfway\nbetween a saddle and a howdah. Kip—sometimes joined by Cruxer—could\nstand and stabilize himself with one hand on any number of grips while\neither drafting or firing one of the many muskets attached to the platform’s\nracks, or he could sit and lock his legs into place, whether Tallach was on\nall fours or rearing up on his hind legs.\nWhether it terrified the enemy or Kip more, he still hadn’t figured out.\n“Nightbringers,” Kip commanded. “At a walk. Advance.”\nFor those beyond the sound of his voice, he threw up a superviolet flare,\nshielded like the first to radiate light only toward his own lines. A\nsuperviolet drafter looking into superviolet might still notice the light on the\nbranches of the trees, but if you have to speak during a stealth attack, it is\nstill better to whisper than to shout.\n“Tallach—”\nBut the bear and the man inside it didn’t wait for the complete order. Kip\nheld on to two horns of his howdah and absorbed each loping impact with\nthe ground with his knees. It was terrifying that something so large could\nmove so quickly and dexterously. He ducked and bobbed and prayed while\nTallach wove around the spruces that had branches low enough to sweep\nKip off. The giant grizzly was still fast enough to almost close the gap with\nthe night mares before they hit the camp.\nThe first cries that rose into the air were cries of surprise, not alarm:\nmore yelps of What the hell was that thing that just ran past me? than fear.\nThe wolves went only for the sentries and men with torches.\nWhere the wolves had slipped easily through the gaps in the sharpened\nstakes ringing the camp, the mastiffs had to pause to muscle their way in.\nTwo teams of them stopped to clear lanes through the stakes for the horses\nand men coming up behind them, while the rest of the mastiffs streaked on,\nhunting anyone with the stench of drafting on him.\nThe tenor of the cries changed immediately as they began bursting\nthrough tents and tearing out throats.\nThe night mares rolled like distant thunder on the horizon into the camps\nnext, streaming like twin lightning strikes through the two paths the war"

The Nightbringer\ndrafters riding on the night mares splashed green or blue or orange luxin\ndown on every fire to smother it, from the smallest torch to the cookfires,\nengaging only those Blood Robes who directly stood in their way.\nThe White King’s camp was plunged into darkness—and blindness for\nmost of the humans, who were so bad at seeing at night. Blood Robes,\nspinning, startled by the streaking shapes, fired their muskets blindly, hitting\nnothing or hitting their own comrades.\nTallach simply jumped over the stakes ringing the camp, his gait hardly\nchanging. When they landed, Kip finally had time to grab a flash grenado\nfrom his belt. His job was to guard Tallach’s back—which mostly meant to\ndistract and delay anyone who attacked him.\nA Blood Robe soldier knelt with flint and steel, trying to light a slow\nmatch for his musket, each skritch and flare of sparks an invitation to death.\nTallach’s claws answered the call with a quick bloody swat.\nThen Kip saw the sudden starburst of mag torches being broken open at\nthe center of the camp, near the wagons.\nTallach saw it, too, and charged straight for it. His path took him over\ntents and through a dozen men trying to hand out muskets, whom he\nscattered like chaff. In a bound, he leapt over a picket of whinnying horses.\nThen, from the high vantage that only Kip had, the disaster opened in\nfront of him. The central pavilion contained nothing except a great pit. One\nof the mastiffs must have inadvertently knocked down one of the supports\nor had already fallen in. A pit that big could only be for Tallach.\nA trap.\nKip yelled in alarm, but Tallach had too much momentum to stop.\nInstead, he tried to leap all the way over the pavilion and the pit.\nHe wasn’t going to make it. Kip leapt from his platform as Tallach came\ndown, crushing the pavilion and hitting the far edge of the pit. Kip flung the\nflash grenado toward where he thought the mag torches had been. A fraction\nof a heartbeat later he hit the ground.\nHe rolled perfectly—Ironfist would have been proud—but Tallach had\nbeen running at terrific speed. Kip flipped and flipped, trying to keep his\nlimbs in. A flash split his vision and he hoped that had been the grenado,\nand not his head hitting a rock.\nSomehow he found himself on his feet, only slightly dizzy. There was a\nstrong stench of tea leaves and tobacco. Someone had drafted a lot of red\nluxin here.\nBut he was more worried about the four wights in front of him, each\ncarrying a lit mag torch. Two of them appeared to be blinded and dazed\nfrom the flash. One, a blue, bolted.\nOne of the dazed wights lifted a pistol in Kip’s direction.

Then it\ndisappeared in a blur of fur and saliva and snarling. Coming in from the\nside, a mastiff had clamped its jaws on the wight’s gun arm and whipped\nhim around. The war dog outweighed the man and had hit with great speed.\nThe wight was flung aside, and in moments the snarling dog was atop\nhim, this time knocking aside frantic arms and going for the throat.\nKip turned and spiked the other dazed wight before it could recover. He\nsaw another wight he’d missed before as the young woman drew an arm\nback and threw her burning mag torch toward the hole.\nThe hole. That was where all that red luxin Kip was smelling must be\npooled.\nTallach was half out of the massive hole, recovering from his shock,\nclaws piercing the ground, back legs churning for a grip, fur smeared with\npyrejelly.\nKip shot out a dozen fingers of fast superviolet at the arcing mag torch,\neach streaming a line back to him. One hit, and along that guide line, Kip\nthrew all the last of his orange luxin.\nThe burning mag torch was blasted safely away from the pyrejelly and\ninto the distance.\nSomething knocked Kip off his feet as a musket went off, deafening\nhim. From his back, he saw a war dog atop the wight who had thrown the\nmag torch. A musket lay on the ground beside her. She was limp already;\nthe dog whipped her back and forth, his jaws clamped around her neck.\nIt must have knocked Kip down to save him.\nBut Kip was already scanning the distance for the blue wight who had\nrun away—and he found him.\nHe hadn’t run away. He was running toward the wagons laden with\nblack powder, mag torch in hand.\nFigures illumined only by that bobbing star flashed and shifted as the\ntwo camps fought, shadows in a night made darker by the contrast. The\nsprinting wight wasn’t thirty paces from the wagons.\nKip had only a little superviolet and yellow left. Still lying on the\nground, he shot out the yellow as hard as he could. The molten yellow\ntwisted in the air, connected to Kip’s will by trailing tendrils of superviolet.\nIn midair, it solidified and curved.\nThe projectile connected with the blue wight’s head—but it hadn’t\ntotally solidified. A failure. It splashed into light.\nBut Kip was already up and running after the wight.\nThe wight had fallen. Being hit from behind while running, even by a\nfist of water, had been enough to knock him off his stride.\nThe blue wight staggered to his feet and picked up the burning mag\ntorch, mere steps from the wagon.\nA Cwn y Wawr soldier ran in from the darkness and clubbed him with\nthe butt of his blunderbuss.\nBut it was a glancing blow to a shoulder, and the hit spun the wight\nbetween the soldier and the wagon loaded with black powder. The Cwn y\nWawr soldier lifted his blunderbuss."

Don’t shoot!” Kip shouted, running. “Oof!” he tripped over a body\nin the darkness.\nThe soldier looked back, whether he understood what Kip had said or\nsimply thought it was another attack.\nHe squinted against the darkness, unable to see Kip, and died as the\nwight’s blue spikes rammed through his neck.\nThe wight released the spikes back to dust, and switched the mag torch\nfrom his wounded left hand to his right. He lofted the torch—\n—and jerked forward several paces as Cruxer’s giant elk rammed its\nantler through his back. The giant elk lifted the wight high in the air, but\neven then the wight didn’t drop his torch.\nCruxer’s first stab missed as the giant elk’s animal instincts took over\nand it tried to shake the wight off its antlers. Then it paused and lowered its\nhead, about to buck the wight up and off the tines of its antlers.\nThe wight threw the torch.\nBut Cruxer threw himself backward so he was lying on the giant elk\nand, upside down, swung his spear, slapping the torch off to one side.\nHis momentum carried him and he flipped off the giant elk’s back just as\nthe animal flicked its head upward. The wight flew into the air and\nsomehow Cruxer flowed into position, his spear butt planted on the ground.\nThe wight landed, his momentum impaling him on Cruxer’s spear.\nCruxer took his hand out of the way at the last moment, casually releasing\nthe haft of the spear and then taking it back as the wight thudded to the\nground. He spun the spear, its blade slashing the wight’s throat, and stepped\nout of range, eyes already looking for any other threats.\nHe gave a command to the giant elk, and it charged off.\nKip kicked dirt over the torch and walked to join Cruxer in guarding the\nwagons.\nThe Cwn y Wawr soldier was dying nearby, holding his throat, gurgling,\nhis eyes on Kip accusing him of betrayal.\n“You were going to shoot a blunderbuss toward a wagon full of black\npowder,” Kip told him. “You would have killed us all.”\nBut the soldier was beyond hearing.\nMoments later, the rest of the Mighty swept in and surrounded Kip.\n“What are you doing?” Big Leo shouted. “We’ve been looking\neverywhere for you!”\n“Why isn’t Tallach with you?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“How did we manage to lose him again, Mighty?” Cruxer demanded.\n“It’s a trap,” Kip said, over labored breaths, still trying to yawn away his\none deafened ear from the musket blast. “Was. Was a trap. Fire. Wagons.\nBlack powder.”\nConn Arthur, animating Tallach, must have realized that coming to help\nKip keep the wagons from blowing up when Tallach was utterly soaked in\npyrejelly was not the best idea. He’d gone elsewhere.\nThe other possibility, that he had run away, was simply impossible."

He’d gone elsewhere.\nThe other possibility, that he had run away, was simply impossible.\n“These are rigged?” Ben-hadad asked from atop his night mare. “Then\nwhat the fuck are you doing right next to them?”\nBut for the next minutes, they kept everyone away from the wagons. Not\nthat any of their foes had any interest. Most of the men had no idea they’d\nbeen bait for a trap. The camp had been broken now.\nIt left Kip with a few minutes. His officers knew their work and didn’t\nneed him interfering, and he was too valuable to risk himself at this stage\nwhen the battle had already been won. He looked at the Mighty. They’d\nsharpened in these last months, and all of them had their halos at least half-\nfull. Ben-hadad had crafted some device to move his crippled knee, and\nspent hours a day wincing, tears sometimes silently streaming down his\nface, regaining a range of motion. Big Leo had grown a heavy beard and\npicked out his hair to a large dark halo. He wore spiked gloves and carried a\nheavy chain into battle now. He’d joined Conn Arthur in his exercises and\ntried to eat only what the conn ate, envious of the man’s ridiculously\nmuscular upper body. Ferkudi had picked up a scar exactly where he parted\nhis hair, from the top of his head down to one eyebrow. It was the only\ngoofy scar Kip had ever seen.\nOnly Winsen seemed unaffected by all the fighting they’d done and\ndeath they’d seen. He’d saved countless friendly lives with his\nmarksmanship, but had taken two. He’d reported those himself, but seemed\nunburdened by it. ‘He dodged left for no reason. Arrow was already in the\nair.’ His bow had been shattered during an engagement where he’d\napparently saved many Cwn y Wawr lives, and they’d given him a new one\nin thanks. Or, more appropriately, an ancient one. It had a sea demon bone\nworked into the spine of the bow, and its mammoth tension could be strung\nonly by will-casting. Winsen was able to learn enough of that art for the\nbow, and his eyes lit with real joy when he tested the draw for the first time.\nBen-hadad had, of course, wanted to study it immediately.\nSix months, Kip thought. Halfway through our halos in six months.\nThat meant they had six more months at the most, fighting this way.\nOrholam’s balls, just at the time they reach their full capacities as\nwarriors, I’m going to have to take all these guys off the front lines\ncompletely.\nThe other options were of course impossible: tell drafters fighting for\ntheir lives not to draft, or let them draft all they wanted and then just kill\nthem when they broke the halo.\nStill, what nineteen-year-old was going to take retirement well?\nFrom the screams, the Blood Robes who had fled into the woods were\nencountering the will-cast jaguars and mountain lions waiting there. In the\ndarkness, those who fled had no chance. As far as the White King was\nconcerned, these wagons would simply disappear."

As far as the White King was\nconcerned, these wagons would simply disappear.\nNo. This had been a trap, a sacrifice. That meant the White King would\nwant to know how and if it had worked—or why it hadn’t.\nKip said, “There will have been at least one scout stationed to see if the\ntrap worked. The pit was to kill Tallach. The black powder was to kill me\nand as many of the rest of us as possible. So… two scouts, at least.” Kip\nlooked around. He couldn’t see the hills in the darkness, but he’d\nmemorized the map of this area. If the White King had been expecting a\nhuge explosion, his scouts wouldn’t need to be close. But if you wanted to\nsee how many of the enemy you killed in that explosion, you had to have a\nsight line. “Send the hounds over to that hill there, and get the war dogs\ngoing up Tenling Rise over there. Send some mounted men with them, in\ncase it’s a long pursuit. The one on the rise will be mounted, trying for\nspeed.”\nThe orders were relayed, and Cruxer said, “Now will you please get\nyour ass away from here, Breaker?”\n“You forgot to say ‘milord,’” Winsen said, his yellow-veined eyes\nsarcastic. Carelessly he flipped back the canvas covering the wagon’s\npayload. It revealed cannonballs and stones and iron nails all tied tight\naround a dozen casks of black powder.\n“Yep, that’s a trap all right,” he said blithely.\n“Are you insane!?” Ben-hadad shouted at Winsen. “That canvas could\nhave been booby-trapped! It should have been booby-trapped! You idiot!”\n“Uh, yeah, let’s get to a safe distance,” Kip said. “No ‘milords’\nnecessary.”\nBut in the back of his mind, the danger wasn’t Winsen. The White King\nhad been willing to sacrifice several hundred men, half a dozen wights, and\nmany casks of black powder just to kill Kip and Tallach.\nSo they knew about Tallach. He was always going to be the first secret\nthat slipped, of course. People on either side would love to talk about a\ngiant grizzly.\nBut that the Blood Robes had thought it was worth losing many men to\nkill Tallach? That meant the raiding phase of Kip’s war was well and truly\nfinished. Kip’s raiders needed to become an army now. That meant giving\nup sapping the enemy’s strength, and trying to destroy him directly.\nKip had hoped that eventually some other satrapy would send in its men\nto do the large-scale killing and dying while he simply weakened the Blood\nRobes. That fantasy was dead now. No one was going to help them. This\nwas their fight alone.\nThey’d won here tonight, but they’d come damn near a disaster. If all the\nWhite King had to do to lure Kip in was put some supplies in danger, he\nwas going to get him eventually.\nIn a way, it was encouraging.

A leader wouldn’t spend that many lives\nand that much matériel to try to take out two enemies if he could kill them\nmore cheaply.\nThat meant the White King didn’t have any zealots willing to trade their\nlives for Kip’s, or any professional assassins in Kip’s army. Yet.\nWhich likely meant the next attempt would be a while. But when it\ncame, Kip might have just made himself worth the expense of hiring a\nShadow from the Order of the Broken Eye.\n“Cruxer,” Kip said.\n“Mm?”\n“Remind me to give you a medal.”\n“Sure,” Cruxer said. What had once been thin streaks of blue in his eyes\nwere now perfectly horizontal and vertical bars that nearly glowed with\namusement despite the strict professionalism of his expression.\n“Wait, no, remind me to make up a medal first, so I can give it to you.”\n“Uh-huh,” the commander said, using a rag to clean the gore off his\nspear and hands.\n“Order of the Skewer, maybe?” Kip suggested.\nFinally Cruxer cracked an unwilling smile. He shook his head. “You\nknow, you can just say thanks.”\n“Thank you for saving my life, Commander,” Kip said gravely.\n“No thanks required, sir.”\nIt was Kip’s turn to smile. “That’s it. You’re getting that damn medal.”\nChapter 56\nTeia was surprised that they hadn’t been thrown in a dungeon after\nwitnessing the Nuqaba’s fury reach such crescendos that Teia froze up. The\nNuqaba had actually spat on them.\nIt was only after the first storm had passed that Teia realized she’d\nmissed a perfect opportunity to fake a heart attack for the Nuqaba rather\nthan the much older satrapah. She readied her paryl in case the Nuqaba\nstarted shouting again—the woman was an erratic moving target, though,\nand Teia wasn’t fast enough with paryl to penetrate the skin, find a good\nblood vessel, and tie off a solid crystal all while the woman moved.\nAnd then the satrapah calmed her, at least temporarily. The Nuqaba\nstormed out of the room, and as the supplicants and courtiers in the hall\nerupted in speculation, Tilleli Azmith came forward and spoke quietly to\nAnjali Gates. “You will stay the night.”\n“I was instructed to head back to the Chromeria immediately,” Anjali\nGates said.\n“Would you insult us more?” she asked. “Besides, we may have an\nanswer for you by morning, and we’ve no way to get the reply back as fast\nas you can. Your person will be respected; we’re not barbarians here. As a\nrepresentative of the Chromeria, you’re invited to dinner tonight. It’s ‘āsōr\nImbarken, which means—”\n“The Blessed Ones. A feast in honor of the first ten captains to join\nLucidonius, yes, I know,” Anjali Gates said. “Is it minor enough that it will\nbe canceled?”\nHer interruption wasn’t, perhaps, the deference due to a satrapah, but\nthen, technically, Tilleli Azmith wasn’t one anymore."

And no, it shan’t be canceled.\nThe Nuqaba never shirks her religious duties. You’re invited to dinner, but\nI’d advise you not to attend.”\n“Of course not,” Anjali said.\nSo they were staying. Teia was half-relieved and half-terrified. That\nmeant she’d have a chance to complete her mission. It also meant she’d\nhave to complete her mission.\n“Chamberlain, rooms and provisions for these two,” the former satrapah\nsaid.\n“If I may?” Anjali interjected. “Can you see to it that someone takes\nprovisions to our crew? The men expected to head back today, and will\ninstead have to stand watch all night. Some meat and wine would be a\nkindness.”\nThe satrapah looked sad. “In ordinary times, I would take offense on\nbehalf of my city that you think your crew needs to stand watch all night in\nmy port. But these are no ordinary times, are they?”\nDo not like this woman, Teia. Don’t like her.\n“May such times return,” Anjali said, “and quickly.”\n“Indeed. See to their men’s needs, Chamberlain. Thank you.”\n“My lady?” Teia said, speaking for the first time. “Um, I’ve never been\nto Azûlay before, and… the city is beautiful. May I… if we’re to be sitting\nin our rooms all night… I would love to have a chance to get out and see\nthe city. Is that acceptable? Or should I stay here?”\nShe smiled. “It is a beautiful city, isn’t it? You’re no prisoner. You’ll find\nyourself followed at a discreet distance while you explore the city. To watch\nyou, of course, but also to watch over you. Last thing we need right now is\nfor something terrible to happen to a Blackguard and have the White\nbelieve we had a hand in it. Mm? So please avoid the neighborhoods east of\nthe docks.”\n“Thank you.”\n“As you will.” She nodded and left.\nAfter the Chamberlain got them situated in a large suite and a\nneighboring servants’ room, Anjali Gates said, “Please leave ascertaining\nwhether we’re prisoners to me, would you?”\n“I wasn’t—”\nAnjali’s eyes were as forgiving as steel. “By forcing the question, you\ncould have pushed the woman into a position we didn’t want. By speaking\nto her unbidden at all you invited punishment. You let me decide when to\npush and when to hold back. Understood?”\nTeia was stung. “I—yes, Mistress.”\n“Good. Now get out of here for an hour. I’ll write my report, and then\nyou’ll take it to our men at the docks.

Too much time with Kip and the\nBlackguard had somehow made her forget what she was to others. How\ncould she, of anyone, forget?\n“Adrasteia?” Anjali said. “Did you notice anything peculiar about her?”\nTeia thought. “No wine on her breath,” she said.\nAnjali smiled. “See? They don’t make Blackguards out of just anyone.”\n“I won’t step out of place again,” Teia promised.\nOf course, my place is as an assassin—excuse me, I mean as a shield\nedge being brought down on some poor women’s necks.\n“Please close the door behind you.” Anjali Gates sat down at the deck in\nfront of a nice window overlooking the cliffs and the sea, and pulled out her\nscrolls and quill. “One hour,” she said without turning.\nThe door was still cracked open. Teia threw her hood up, let the\nlodestone clasps click the mask shut, and stepped into the hall, invisible.\nShe shut the door behind her. Anyone watching the room would think that\nTeia was still inside.\nBut there was no one watching the room.\nTeia ghosted through the halls, getting her bearings. Karris had shown\nher a map of the palace, but she hadn’t had long to study, and Teia was\nembarrassingly terrible with maps. By the time she figured out which rooms\nbelonged to the Nuqaba—well, those were obvious, being huge and\ncrawling with Tafok Amagez—and which were the satrapah’s rooms, her\nhour was nearly up.\nThe great hall was being set up for dinner, musicians tuning instruments\nand white-clad slaves setting the tables, when Teia passed back through.\nShe came to her hall and saw a servant in nondescript clothing leaning\nagainst the wall where he could watch the entire hall. But he was obviously\nbored, and he was flirting with one of the dancers who was limbering up in\na thin bodysuit nearby.\nTeia took her time. It seemed that the dancer had figured out that he\ncouldn’t leave his spot, so she was teasing him. “Well, why don’t you come\nover here and show me?”\n“Ah, later, I will. I promise.”\n“Later? Later I’ll have some lordling wanting me to sit on his lap. Can\nyou compete with that?” She stuck her chest out and then rolled backward\nto form a bridge, kicked into a handstand, scissored her legs, and stood.\nTeia actually stopped. That was amazing muscular control and\nflexibility.\nBut the man groaned aloud, his mind obviously on other things. Teia\nmoved past him and missed whatever he said to the dancer as she turned the\nkey in her door’s lock.\nBut he missed the clacking of the lock as well.\n“I’ve been known as a girl of easy religion,” the dancer said, winking,\n“but I only worship at one shrine a day.” The woman slid smoothly into a\nfull split on the floor and bounced on the ground suggestively.\nBut Teia didn’t wait to see what the man said. His eyes were stuck. She\nslipped into her room."

She threw her cloak back and opened the door again. She locked\nher door behind her and walked next door openly, as if she’d been in her\nown room the whole time. She knocked and went in.\n“Perfect timing,” Anjali Gates said. “I’m just finishing up.” She blew on\nthe warm wax sealing a scroll and then slid it into a leather scroll case. She\nalso had a sheathed table knife on the table.\nAnjali handed Teia the scroll case. “That’s the decoy. Filled with happy\nnothings about how well we were received and so forth. The real report is\nwritten in superviolet and wrapped around the blade of this knife. If you’re\ntaken, make sure you rattle that blade around inside its sheath well to break\nup the superviolet script, understood?”\n“Understood. Can I run with it?”\n“Absolutely. This knife’s seen duty all over the world. You won’t\ndestroy my note by accident. When you get to the skimmer, one of the\nreedsmen will ask if he can borrow a knife for his dinner. Give it to him.\nYou can eat before you go, if you like.” She gestured to the wine, bread,\ncheese, and meats that had been delivered.\nTeia shook her head. “Sooner started, sooner finished. I’ve been needing\na run anyway.”\nMinutes later, she was heading out the front door of the palace. A young\nTafok Amagez fell in behind her. She turned and looked at him, amused.\nThen she took off at an easy run. She’d left her sword behind, though\nshe still had her knives and the rope spear around her waist. He, on the\nother hand, carried a decorative heavy spear and wore a gladius in addition\nto a brocaded burnous more fit for standing around looking pretty than for\nrunning.\nSo Teia took it easy on him—and ran as fast as she could. Blackguard\nArchers always had something to prove, and they treasured the chip on their\nshoulders as a birthright.\nTeia made the pass at the skimmer with no problem. She took a draught\nof watered wine, didn’t offer any to her escort, who was pretending\nunsuccessfully to not be winded, and then, on hearing that no one was\nbothering the reedsmen, she ran back to the palace.\nThis time she took the long way, going up the winding grand boulevard\njust to add distance.\nWhen she got to the Tafok Amagez at the palace door, her guard was\nfifty paces back. Teia dabbed her forehead with a handkerchief as if it had\nbeen an easy jog. “Tell your man it’s really sweet that he let me win, but\nI’m the slowest of the Blackguards, and I know I wouldn’t beat one of you\nin a real race.” Teia winked at the captain, who scowled, and patted his\nshoulder as she went past.\nAfter she got inside, she finally took the deep, leaning-over-and-heaving\nbreaths her body demanded.\nIt had all been the kind of thing she would have done if she were a real"

That girl Blackguard who teased\nother soldiers with her prowess was the girl she could have been. Maybe it\nwas the girl she should have been. Like all soldiers, the Blackguards had\nhours of boredom to fill, and like all soldiers, they filled them with pranks\nand the breaking of silly rules.\nShe didn’t get to be that girl. The candor and winsome integrity of a\nCommander Ironfist would never be hers. She could play at it, but it sat on\nthe other side of a glass, the reflection of a girl she would never get to be.\nTeia reported in to Anjali Gates, who gave her food and told her there\nwas a bath waiting in her room. Teia pretended to be more tired than she\nwas, and said she’d probably retire for the night unless Anjali needed her.\nThe diplomat said she’d not go out to keep from antagonizing anyone—the\nparty had already started, and the Nuqaba insisted everyone drink heavily at\nher parties. “I know you might be curious to go to the great hall, have some\nfun, drink too much, maybe kiss a boy, I understand. But anything you do\nmay have repercussions beyond yourself. And after the White’s message,\nthere will be those eager to pick a fight with you. Winning such fights\nwould be as bad as losing them.”\n“I understand,” Teia said.\nNaturally, she headed out to the great hall immediately.\nChapter 57\nThere was nothing but time here. Time and the lure of insanity.\nThe dead man spoke to him whenever he opened his eyes, so he often\nsat in a torpor to gain a measure of peace. But when torpor yielded to sleep,\nthere was a different kind of torture.\n“Go on, sleep,” the dead man said. “I’ll be here when you wake.” And\nhe laughed.\nGavin tore his heart open, and it tore him in turn. His fingers ripped on\nthe thorns, bled. Blood flew in frantic gray splatters to fall to the luminous\nwhite marble of the tower’s roof. But he didn’t stop. Couldn’t.\nThe storm bore down upon him, thunder rolling within the gathering\nclouds, all streaming toward the judging hands of the colossus who stood\nover him, towering over the tower, examining him with the intensity of a\nman stooping over a tantruming child, and at the same time so vast that the\nwhole earth was his footstool.\nGavin threw aside dark thorns and chunks of his own skin and flesh,\nheedless, but he wasn’t fast enough, couldn’t be fast enough.\nThe gathered clouds massed around the great figure’s fist, and rose, all\ntogether, rose, rose over his head, with a great sucking sound of all the\nwinds twisting together. His fist rose in preparation to strike, to shatter, to\nsmash, to judge, to obliterate the stain that was Gavin Guile.\nHis heart was full of murder, murder, murder. He broke the thorns off"

And lies. Everywhere lies.\nShame and bitterness and cowardice and lies. His oarmate-prophet Orholam\nhad warned him to quit his lying. But he couldn’t quit his lying. His whole\nheart was dark with it.\nEverywhere he tore off thick black veins, glimpsing febrile gray muscle\npalpitating beneath them—gray because it was starving, dying.\nHe was a liar, Gavin Guile. He was so inveterate a liar that he didn’t\nknow his own face in the mirror anymore.\nHe was weeping, weeping from the pain, weeping from memories half-\nseen, fully shunned.\nHe saw his brother, standing over him on the egg-shaped hill—the Great\nRock before it had become Sundered Rock—and his brother said, ‘Dazen,\nDazen, Dazen. You could never beat me. Not in magic, not in muscle. Never.\nNot in cunning, not in counsel, not in stratagems or seductions. Not once in\nall our years. How did you think you would beat me now?’\nThe real Gavin had picked up a spear and limped toward where Dazen\nlay concussed, delirious, immobile.\n‘Brother,’ the eldest said, his voice softening as he approached, steps\nslow, ‘did you think I would give up this life? Do you even know what I paid\nto be here?’\nAnd the elder brother, even as he lofted that spear and prepared to kill\nhim, wept. How had Dazen forgotten that? The real Gavin’s tears had fallen\non barren, smoking ground.\nCrying? Dazen had barely thought his big brother could.\nBut his tears didn’t stop him from advancing. He didn’t want to kill\nDazen, but he was going to.\nNo, no, no.\nIt didn’t matter. He broke the heart into its last pieces. From a distance,\nit looked gray. It wasn’t gray. There were no shades of gray. Life was white\nand black streaked together so intimately that the two couldn’t be\nuntangled. If he tore out what was corrupted, it tore out everything.\nThere was nothing wholly untouched, nothing pure, nothing innocent.\nHis heart fell to pieces, putrescent, rotten stinking meat in his hands.\nHe rolled from his knees onto his back, limp.

Teia couldn’t see the Nuqaba’s facial\nexpressions in the few brief upward glimpses she afforded herself.\nTeia was, of course, invisible, but coming into the feast in the great hall\nhad not been one of her better ideas. It was called a great hall, and indeed, it\nwas huge, but it was also filled with nearly a thousand people. They weren’t\nquietly sitting at their tables and talking and eating, either. They were\nmilling about, grabbing wine jugs and food from beleaguered kitchen\nslaves, gambling, singing along to musicians, grabbing the asses of the\nslave dancers, kissing, gambling, and Teia didn’t even know what else. A\nyellow show drafter appeared to have eaten a large quantity of\nhallucinogenic mushrooms and was sketching wonders in the air and\nblathering incoherently.\nIt was still a good five hours until midnight.\n“This what happens when the first four courses consist of beer, wine,\nbrandy, and arak,” a nobleman said to Teia. He started when he looked\ntoward her and saw nothing. “Oh, Nwella, I thought you were standing right\nhere,” he said to a woman a few paces away.\nHe must have sensed Teia’s presence. Her breathing? Had she made a\nsound? How could he have heard that in this cacophony?\nShe hadn’t come directly to the high table on purpose. Instead she’d\nbeen driven here as she’d dodged into what gaps she could see. She’d\nthought it would be safe to come in here, that anyone who ran into her\nwould likely be drunk and not even notice it. Instead, because whenever she\nwanted to see she had to uncover her own eyes, it meant she was giving\nhundreds of people a chance to discover her, over and over again.\nSatrapah Azmith looked baffled. “You’re not really considering…”\nThe Nuqaba picked up a narrow sausage and looked at her. She took a\nbite and chewed, apparently in no hurry to answer her.\n“So tell me again why you think I shouldn’t unveil him here. Would it\nnot be a demonstration of my power? To have plucked such a prize from the\nChromeria itself?”\n“Fuck that. I’m not even talking about that idiotic idea now,” Satrapah\nAzmith said. “Are you really considering letting them demote me?”\n“Oh, I’m considering doing it even if we reject their proposal. You seem\nto be forgetting your place in our partnership.”\nIt hit the satrapah like a punch in the face. “Are you…” She looked as if\nshe were struggling to contain herself, and failing. “Are you fucking\ninsane?”\nThe Nuqaba sucked the juices off long, gold-lacquered fingernails.\n“Careful, old woman. Addressing me with such language flies perilously\nclose to blasphemy.”\n“Blasphemy? Who do you think…” But the satrapah regained control of\nherself, and stopped speaking, though she did set her cup down with a bang.\nTeia wanted to see how this turned out.

Would the\nNuqaba apologize when she was sober? Would she take some vengeance?\nFor Orholam’s sake! The satrapah was the Nuqaba’s spymaster! If there’s\none person you don’t threaten, it’s got to be your spymaster, right?\nBut it was all irrelevant. Satrapah Azmith was flushed with rage, and\nthat was all Teia needed. What she might do or might say, or that she\nseemed like a nice woman, that all meant nothing.\nThe warm, red light of the fire in the great hearth and the many torches\nsuffused Teia and gave her all the passion she needed.\nShe was become death, and she would collect her due.\nShe’d already scanned the satrapah’s body. The blood vessels around her\nheart were already narrowed, as Teia would expect in one who’d had so\nmuch stress and so many years and a rich diet to boot.\nOne by one, Teia brought paryl crystals into the woman’s bloodstream,\nmaking many little crystals of it in the vessels leading to her heart. One for\neach slave she’d had to kill for these bastards.\nThe satrapah’s own body attacked those invaders immediately, forming\nclots. Teia merely nudged the clots closer toward each other, helping them\nglom together. One passed through the narrow opening and whooshed right\nthrough.\nThen another, as Teia had to dodge a servant carrying the next course of\nthe meal.\nBut Teia had made half a dozen clots, and one caught. Then another, on\nanother ventricle of the heart. She started moving to get out, and barely\nheard the woman grunt.\nHow dare you act decent and kind? How dare you merely do your duty\nwhile you served this monster? A thousand slaves might die at your word,\nand a hundred thousand if you nudged the Nuqaba one way rather than the\nother. And you didn’t care. All you cared for was yourself.\nHow dare you? How dare you show a face to me that seemed kind and\ngood?\nThere is nothing kind and good.\nTeia slid as far as a slaves’ door before she turned around. Tilleli Azmith\nwas grabbing her left arm and grimacing.\nIt was over. Teia had claimed some small vengeance. She didn’t even\nneed to see her work.\nAs she turned away, Teia heard a crash as the woman fell.\n“Tilleli?!” the Nuqaba said. “Satrapah! Damn you! What’s wrong?!”\nTeia felt only a warm satisfaction, the lambent radiation into her soul of\na big fuck you to all of them.\n“Tilleli?!” the Nuqaba shouted, as everyone else went quiet in waves—\nmusic cutting out, awkward laughs hanging in the air from people who\nhadn’t seen yet, and gasps from those who had. “Tilleli, don’t you do this to\nme!”\nTeia looked at the Nuqaba’s puffy, stupid face, and thought, One down.\nThe night wasn’t over yet.\nChapter 59\n“The question is why the White King changed his strategy so drastically."

He had grown more comfortable with giving commands, even ones\nnobody liked. And they’d grown more comfortable accepting them, too. Not\neven Winsen complained that it was late and they probably weren’t going to\nsolve what he saw as a nonproblem.\nThey knew he’d get to the battle plan, and that they’d need to be sharp\nwhen he did, in case he had in-depth questions about their positions.\n“Why does there have to be a grand answer?” Cruxer asked. “The White\nKing felt he was getting overextended, so he paused. The break does him\nmore good than it does us. He has secured and fortified his supply lines\nbetween Atash and the siege at Green Haven. Not even we could get to\nthose unless we wanted to give up Dúnbheo and the lake.”\nDúnbheo—the nonfloating Floating City—was the Forester name of the\ncity the Nightbringers were going to try to save tomorrow. It controlled\naccess to the Great River and the immense lake by which Green Haven was\ngetting what little supplies it still was.\n“He’s also had to deal with us,” Ben-hadad pointed out. “Isn’t it possible\nthat we actually stopped him?”\n“But he was advancing steadily,” Big Leo said. “Just as he has\neverywhere. Why stop halfway through Blood Forest? Why not at least\npush to the Great River everywhere and then consolidate?”\n“Too much guerrilla warfare that way?” Winsen suggested. “He could\ncapture the cities, but if he doesn’t deal with us first, supply lines get long\nand vulnerable.”\nThat could be it, but he’d advanced so fast elsewhere, leaving small\nforces to mop up any continuing resistance. Was Blood Forest simply\ndifferent because of its huge population of hunters and hard terrain for\nsupply lines?\n“All the fights we’ve had have kept us from linking up with the satrap’s\nforces,” Tisis said. “If he pushed us to the river, it’s the only place we’d\nhave to go.”\n“We don’t want to link up with the satrap’s forces,” Kip said. Satrap\nBriun Willow Bough wanted Kip’s army—and Kip, if he could get him.\nWhat he didn’t want was another person running around his satrapy with an\narmy he didn’t control.\nWhich was understandable, and the man was a decent sort.\nUnfortunately, he was also a moron who had no idea what to do with the\narmy he already had. There was no way Kip was going to take orders from\nhim about how to use his own very peculiar forces.\n“We all know that,” Tisis said. “But the White King doesn’t. Joining\nforces is what most defenders would do.”"

Joining\nforces is what most defenders would do.”\n“You think he’s allowed us our victories?” Kip asked.\n“Not the first one at Deora Neamh,” Tisis said. “Maybe not the\nskirmishes around the Ironflower Marsh or the Deep Forest Ambush. But\nwe’ve sometimes traveled pretty far to get disappointing quantities of food\nor muskets. And you yourself said the black powder wagons were an\nassassination attempt.”\nIt had been a hollower victory than Kip had hoped. They had done\neverything right, wiping out the enemy and seizing everything with minimal\nlosses. They even successfully disarmed the booby-trapped wagon. But then\nthey found that of the five wagons, it was the only one loaded with powder.\nThe others’ barrels were loaded with a layer of black powder, then sawdust.\nThe men of the wagon train hadn’t even known they were bait.\nIt was small comfort that the war dogs had hunted down the scouts sent\nto watch the outcome. It was small comfort that Kip had been right and\nthere had been two scouts.\n“We haven’t fought many drafters, either,” Kip said. “We’re missing\nsomething here.”\n“Maybe we are,” Cruxer said, “but then the question is whether the\nWhite King has some grand design or whether it’s just an error. He’s\nalready spent many lives to keep us away from a place we never intended to\ngo. Just at the wagons he lost several hundred men, half a dozen wights, and\nfive wagons trying to kill you. He’s a good orator, an inspiring leader by all\naccounts. But maybe he’s simply a poor strategist.”\n“Poor enough to take two satrapies,” Winsen said dryly.\nIf anything, Kip thought, he himself was the one who was a poor\nstrategist. Good tactician. Loved by his people… but he still couldn’t\nresolve the big picture. Damn, how he’d love to take some lectures with\nCorvan Danavis now. When he was a boy he’d wanted stories of battlefield\nheroics. Given the chance now, he’d say, ‘Talk to me about rations for\ncavalry when moving through forested river valleys.’ ‘What’s the\nbreakdown of your command staff per soldier?’\n“That was when the Chromeria didn’t know what we were up against,”\nCruxer said.\nCruxer still said ‘we’ when he talked about the Chromeria. Kip loved\nhim for that idealism, but he didn’t share it anymore.\n“He’s successfully stalled reinforcements, though,” Tisis said. “We\nknow from the White’s letters that he’s been trying to turn the other\nsatrapies to his side or at least keep them out of the war. That’s not the work\nof a poor strategist.”\nThat Karris had written to the Nightbringers at all was the biggest shock\nfor Kip. Without shaming anyone, she’d laid out the numbers—Tyrea and\nAtash were lost, the Ilytians didn’t care who won, the Nuqaba’s Paria had\npulled back all its soldiers after Ox Ford and had never sent reinforcements,\nand other than the several hundred men Eirene Malargos had sent under"

Eirene could be forgiven\nfor not wanting to send more soldiers when Kip simply took them. And if\nKip’s co-opting of Antonius and his men was the reason Ruthgar wasn’t\nsending reinforcements to Green Haven, Kip could well become the reason\nthe Chromeria lost this war.\nWith all those satrapies out, only Abornea and the small army directly\nunder the Chromeria’s control were left. Karris had said nothing about that,\nand Kip wondered if that meant they were coming but coming late, or\ncoming as part of a stratagem to sweep in at the last moment, or if Andross\nGuile had decided to cut his losses and let Blood Forest die.\nKarris had also written about her insight that the White King wouldn’t\nmind a slaughter of both sides, and in fact might prefer it so he could\nremake the entire culture of the Seven Satrapies. It had seemed an odd,\nparanoid thought at first, but Kip didn’t think so anymore.\nThe White King hadn’t sent one man or one squad on a suicide mission:\nhe’d sent hundreds to die, just to kill Kip and Tallach. And from how the\ncamp had fallen, except for a couple of the wights, those people hadn’t\nvolunteered.\nThat was some coldhearted butchery there.\n“So he’s successfully tying up our reinforcements from coming,” Kip\nsaid. “But he’s not pressing his advantage. Why? Why why why?!”\nBen-hadad chimed in for the first time. “I don’t mean to distract us from\nthis highly profitable colloquy that is still not answering a question we\nhaven’t been able to answer for many months, but maybe we should talk\nabout the battle that’s going to shape our entire future that we are going to\nfight tomorrow?”\nBig Leo looked down at him. “You take that crazy talk and get out of\nhere.”\n“What’s a colloquy?” Ferkudi asked.\nNo one answered him.\nKip acquiesced even though he felt he was close to figuring it out.\nAnother almost. Kip Almost.\n“Enough,” Kip said. “Let’s go inside.”\nThey moved to the map in the command tent. By this point, Kip had\ntrained others in how to create the things, which was fortunate given that\nthey needed new maps constantly as they moved.\n“Let me lay this out plainly,” Kip said. “Tomorrow’s battle at Dúnbheo\nwill either be the crowning achievement of all our work to keep our strength\nsecret, or it will be the end of our hopes to save Blood Forest.”\nThere were grim faces all around, and a few muttered curses. Handsome\nGeneral Antonius Malargos cursed quietly.

I hope we haven’t engrained\nthat into our troops.”\n“We won’t run, my lord,” Antonius said. It was his supreme confidence\nin Kip that made him a useful battlefield commander. It spread to his men.\nKip could only hope it spread enough.\n“Here are the stakes,” Kip said. “Hiding behind its Greenwall, Dúnbheo\nhas always been a defensive redoubt. They never projected force into the\nforests beyond them. But perched as they are at the mouth of the river, they\nhave kept the river open to the lake. Besieged, it’s been nothing to the war.\nFreed, it can become a gateway to a huge number of supplies. Lost, it\nbecomes a stranglehold.”\n“We free it, we can save Green Haven,” Cruxer said. “We lose it, we\nlose Green Haven.”\n“Right,” Kip said. “And we don’t know how bad things are inside the\ncity, except to know they’re bad. They’ve been able to bring in some\nsupplies from the river, but the capital’s mostly needed those supplies for\nthemselves. We can’t expect any help from the city. The Council of Divines\nis made up of old cowards. At best, if we’re already winning decisively,\nthey might send some small force to help. I doubt it.”\n“That’s just fantastic,” Winsen grumbled. No one upbraided him.\n“But if we win,” Kip said. “If we win, with the skimmers we can land\nanywhere on the lake. We’ll own the lake. With resupply readily available\nto us and to Green Haven, and with our forces able to strike anywhere we\nchoose, lifting the siege of Green Haven will be only a matter of time.”\n“Save the city, save the satrapy,” Cruxer said.\nCruxer was right, and Kip was maybe telling too much, but he always\nwanted his inner circle to know the full strategy. If he was killed, someone\nelse would need to take the torch. A lot of lives depended on it.\nNot that he said the last part aloud. That would only devolve into\nprotestations that he couldn’t die.\nDúnbheo was a strange city. It had once been the religious center of one\nof the nine kingdoms. Dúnbheo had been deliberately shunned since the\nestablishment of the Seven Satrapies, but never destroyed. Apparently it\nwas a beautiful place, and Lucidonius had believed that every beautiful\nthing man creates points to how the creative spirit of Orholam himself lives\nin all people.\nSo instead of being destroyed, the city had been starved of influence. No\none born in the city or who had spent more than ten years there total could\nhold any position of power in Blood Forest, the Chromeria, or the\nMagisterium.

Thus, as soon as any family native to the city rose high\nenough to entertain ambitions of being greater, it left. It bore and raised its\nchildren elsewhere, and those children generally didn’t want to come back,\nlest they spend more than their decade there.\nIt meant, oddly, that there were a lot of nobles dispersed throughout\nBlood Forest and Ruthgar who had ties to the place—because the smart, the\nambitious, and the strong were exported instead of killing each other off.\nThe Malargos family had first risen from Dúnbheo, which was one reason\nTisis had so many ties to Blood Forest while her family was technically\nRuthgari.\n“Commander? Over to you,” Kip said.\nCruxer pointed to a map of the city as it had been before the siege. It\nshowed the city surrounded on three sides by trees and also filled with trees,\nmore than any other city in the world. He gestured, and a swath of trees\naround the city walls disappeared.\nThe maps were put together now by a team of drafters and Derwyn\nAleph of the Cwn y Wawr, who was in charge of the scouts, and Tisis, who\ninterviewed the refugees. The maps now allowed them to advance time and\nsee the reports appear as they had come in.\n“Two months ago, the Blood Robes cleared the forests around the city\nfor a hundred paces in every direction. They believed that the city was\nbeing resupplied through the trees.”\nDerwyn said, “Which is nonsense. There were ladders and rope swings\nconcealed in those trees so that single scouts and messengers might move\nthrough the sylvan giants quietly, but entire convoys of food? Impossible.”\n“Any caves?” Conn Arthur asked.\n“Few, and none deep,” Derwyn said. “Not only do you have the tree\nroots to stop that, but there’s the groundwater to deal with. The river runs\npartly through the city itself.”\n“It is possible there could be caves,” Ben-hadad said. “Purely from an\nengineering perspective. But I guess it depends what you mean. Do you\nmean do the inhabitants of the city have any tunnels, or are you asking\nabout sappers?”\n“Either, both,” Kip said.\n“The city might have made tunnels. If you took your time—and I mean\nyears—you can dig and pump out the water and seal the tunnels with luxin\nand support them appropriately,” Ben-hadad said. “I mean, you’d be\nconstantly fighting the roots and leaks in the wood and luxin. But it’s\npossible. The city has been here a long, long time. But to do it and then\nmaintain it would require a permanent corps of drafters. Drafters of average\nability? I’d say you’d need thirty or forty, which is expensive and very hard\nto keep secret. You can hide what one or five drafters do, but when you\nhave forty, people wonder, people gossip, and spies find out.”\nFerkudi said, “Dúnbheo doesn’t have forty drafters. Thirty-eight, tops, in\nthe whole city, and surely most of those would be tasked with defense,\nright?”"

Thirty-eight, tops, in\nthe whole city, and surely most of those would be tasked with defense,\nright?”\nAs far as Kip knew, Ferkudi didn’t have any ties to Dúnbheo, nor did he\nsee the scouts’ reports.\n“Why do you say that?” Cruxer asked before Kip could.\n“Oh,” Ferkudi said, finger lodged up his nose. “You just cross-reference\nall the activation lists of the lords in the surrounding areas with lists of the\nFreeing, the Cwn y Wawr, and the Ghosts, take out those we know are dead,\nand those we guess have joined the White King. That’s why it’s fuzzy. We\ndon’t how many joined the pagans, so we have an upper bound of around\nsixty-one, but not a lower bound. There’s a bit of unknown with how many\ndrafters in the last ten years have been reported dead before their Freeing\nwho might actually be alive—those records are weak, and don’t show place\nof birth. Then Satrap Willow Bough came through here three months ago\nand offered protection and great pay to any drafters who joined him\nimmediately, so I’m also assuming that any refugee drafter would have\njoined up with him at that point, what with an army on the way to besiege\nDúnbheo. But that’s why the number’s a guess. Irritating.” He flicked a\nbooger into the fire. “What?”\nThey still hadn’t gotten used to how Ferkudi did that every once in a\nwhile.\nAnd usually, they couldn’t harness those little moments of genius for\nthings that mattered more than food and boogers.\n“So, no escape routes from the inside out,” Kip said. “Outside in seems\neven more improbable. It would cost too many drafters to make it as\nquickly as you would want, especially to seize this city. Am I right?”\n“It holds great symbolic and religious value to pagans,” Tisis said. “But\nstill… no, I don’t think the White King would think dedicating so many\nsappers to this was worth it. One of his Lords of the Air might feel\ndifferently.”\nThe White King had split his armies, giving control of them to various\ncommanders he called Lords of the Air. The Mighty thought the one known\nas Amrit Kamal was in charge of these besiegers, but their intelligence on\nthat wasn’t good. The Lords of the Air would do anything for a victory;\nthey were replaced immediately if they failed.\n“Is there any way that any of you can see that we might buy victory\nwithout tomorrow’s battle?” Kip asked.\nThey all scowled at the map for a while.\nThen Ben-hadad said, “If we simply go around the city and attack the\nbesiegers’ own supply lines, we might starve out their siege without a\nfight.”\n“Besiege the besiegers?” Conn Arthur said. “But if it takes more than a\ncouple weeks, the White King can bring down part of his forces and besiege\nus in turn, in which case we lose every advantage we’ve built up to this\npoint.”\n“That would weaken the White King’s siege at Green Haven,” Tisis"

Audacity wasn’t the satrap’s strong suit. Kip couldn’t trust\nhim to see and take advantage of what might be only a small opportunity.\nNor did he want to put his raiders through setting and undergoing a siege at\nthe same time; it was totally the opposite of what they’d done before.\n“If we attacked the Blood Robes briefly and let their messengers\nthrough, they might be recalled, again without a fight,” Big Leo said.\n“I like this thinking,” Kip said.\n“There’s a problem with that,” Tisis said. “If you free the city in a clever\nway where the Blood Robes simply leave, that’s wonderful, and we’ll have\ndone a good thing. But we’ll get no credit for it. It will just seem like\nDúnbheo’s good fortune. We’ll get no new recruits, no funding, and no food\nexcept what we take at the point of the spear. You take food then, and\nthey’ll hate us instead.”\nShe was right. Dammit.\nThey all chewed on the injustice of that, but no one disputed it was what\nwould probably happen, not even Antonius.\n“Curious world, isn’t it?” Kip said. “Seeing your foes driven away\ninspires more gratitude than cunningly having others draw those same men\naway. The charging in is all Gavin Guile, the cunning is Andross Guile. One\nof them is loved, and the other hated. Is that because men are so\nshortsighted or because we long to see those who hurt us be hurt\nthemselves?”\n“Some more one, some more the other, I’d hazard,” Ferkudi said. He\nhad trouble identifying rhetorical questions.\n“Also, Andross Guile is an asshole,” Big Leo said.\nThere is that. Kip grinned grimly. “So I have to let more men die so that\ntheir friends will be grateful enough to replenish my ranks of the dead and\ncontinue to support us and keep the rest of us alive. In other words, I have\nto be cunning enough to not be cunning.”\n“The most important part of seeking victory is defining it first,” Tisis\nsaid.\n“Shit,” Kip said. “And I had this really brilliant idea about how to get\naround the Blood Robes’ partial river blockade, too.”\n“I’m sure you did, dear,” Tisis said.\n“You know how they’ve set up the weirs to block the city from getting\nany fish?” Kip said.\n“Are we going to use this idea?” Tisis asked gently.\n“No,” he grumbled.\n“Mmm,” she said. “We wait at your command, my lord. Despite the\nhour.”\n“I’m mean, it was an ingenious idea,” Kip said. “You’d all be very\nimpressed.”\nCruxer theatrically stifled a yawn. As if at a signal, everyone else\nstretched and rubbed their eyes. Even Conn Arthur blinked sleepily.\n“I hate you guys,” Kip said. He waved his hand, and the battle order"

He waved his hand, and the battle order\nappeared on the map. “Study your positions, then go. Sleep fast. Conn\nArthur, a word.” It was almost scary how well they worked together now.\nHis commanders knew exactly what they needed to do and how and when.\nIn turn, he gave them a huge amount of autonomy. He’d even taken to\nrotating commanders over various elements, partly so that each understood\nthe others’ duties and problems and speed, and partly so that the army\nwouldn’t splinter into factions. The common soldiers certainly had favorite\ncommanders, but they trusted all of them.\nThey all soon left, except for Conn Arthur and Tisis, who withdrew\nsubtly.\n“Conn Arthur, we need to have that talk.”\n“Which talk, my lord?”\n“The one neither of us wants to have.”\nThe muscles in Conn Arthur’s jaw clenched.\nKip had had the other sections of the map brought in and assembled.\nHe’d had to learn to get over his reflexive avoidance of inconveniencing his\nservants and subordinates. If someone needed to be wakened so Kip could\nthink, even if it was only once in a hundred times that he came up with a\nstratagem or noticed an error in his plans, that one time in a hundred was\nworth waking them.\nTisis had directed the placement and organization of the figures on the\nmap. Each refugee reported to her, and she placed forces on the map in\nvarious colors for each report. Each was dated, too. The will-casters had put\nit all into the map so Kip could watch colors blossom across the map a day\nat a time. His own scouts’ reports bloomed in different colors.\nThere were hundreds of false reports, exaggerations, and mistakes, but\nwith thousands of reports, those tended to reveal themselves as the noise\nthey were. On the other hand, even low-quality reports, if repeated often\nenough, gave Kip a place to send his own scouts or raiding parties.\nIf he did nothing else, this map would likely be Kip’s legacy, his big\nadvance that he’d given the world.\nOf course, the map had to be imbued with a bit of will, so it was\ntechnically forbidden magic. So maybe even this would disappear.\nHe put his hands on it and extended his will. Little lights bloomed\naround his own forces, leagues away most of the time, but shadowing them\nat all times. “These are reports of a giant grizzly,” Kip said.\n“Hmm. I try to keep Tallach away from people, but grizzlies roam. It’s\ntheir nature.”\n“And doubtless,” Kip said agreeably, “some farmers and shepherds who\nknow that we travel with Tallach have caught a glimpse of something in the\nwoods and reported it as him, hoping for us to reimburse them for lost\nlivestock.”\n“Right, right,” Conn Arthur said.\nHe thought Kip was going to let it go.\nAnd how Kip wanted to.\nKip slowed down the advancement of the map. Lights bloomed\nsimultaneously, tens of leagues apart. One day, then another, and another.\n“Odd, isn’t it?” Kip asked. “A series of these reports come from the kind"

One day, then another, and another.\n“Odd, isn’t it?” Kip asked. “A series of these reports come from the kind\nof places I would expect you to send Tallach—abandoned areas with good\nhunting, mostly, and few humans. Others, sometimes simultaneous with\nthose, come from more populated areas.”\nConn Arthur swallowed, but said nothing.\n“What happens, then, if we assign a different color to the ones in\nrational areas than to the ones way too close to settlements?”\nHe started the series over again, and suddenly the reports made sense.\nStill shadowing the Nightbringers, two dots hunted the forests nearby: the\nred always farther from villages, the blue always closer.\nThere were still a few false positives from bad reports, but otherwise it\nexplained all the data.\n“This is… all guesswork,” Conn Arthur said, but he sounded more sick\nthan defiant.\n“Someone’s going to get killed,” Kip said gently.\n“I can handle it.”\n“So you don’t know,” Kip said.\n“Know what?” The quick crease of his forehead told Kip he was telling\nthe truth.\n“Someone’s been killed already.”\nAll the color drained out of the big redhead. “No. Orholam forbid it. I\nwould know if—”\n“Not by Lorcan. By Tallach.”\n“What? Lorcan?! I told you my brother’s bear is dead. What—”\n“Two hunters heard a giant grizzly was eating folks’ pigs. They got\nliquored up and decided to go hunting. Said they’d be damned if some dark\nTyrean—that’s me, I assume—would tell them what to do in their own\nwoods. One survived.”\n“Well, maybe that’s their own fault, then, right? We’ve warned the\npeople everywhere to stay clear…”\n“Tallach shouldn’t have been in that area at all, Ruadhán, and you know\nit. Wouldn’t have been there, except that you had to keep him on this side of\nthe river so Lorcan wouldn’t attack him. Am I right?”\nKip could see Conn Arthur trying to build up a rage, but the big man\ncouldn’t do it. “How long have you known?” he asked instead.\n“He’s your brother. You love him,” Kip said.\n“So…”\n“All along. As you’ve known what needs to happen, but knowing in\nyour heart takes time.” Kip put his hand on the big man’s shoulder. “It’s\nbeen almost a year.”\n“You were giving me time to do the right thing,” Conn Arthur said.\n“Mm-hmm.”\n“And I never did it.”\n“How much of Rónán is left inside that bear?”\n“Good days and bad. It’s as bad as when our mother lost the light of\nreason. Never thought I’d have to go through that hell twice.”\nKip said, “When you have to go through hell, go quickly.”\nTears dripped silently down the big man’s face. “I thought if anyone\nmight be the exception, it would be him. I thought maybe he could beat\nthis.”\n“He’s made it this long. That is exceptional,” Kip said. “But we both\nknow, when he goes, he could take out an entire village easy as snapping\nyour fingers.

You think I haven’t told myself all that a thousand times? I just\ncan’t do it!”\nAnd he wouldn’t want anyone else to do it, either. He’d never forgive\nhimself for that, or whoever did it.\nKip said nothing for a while. Then he said, “The battle tomorrow’s\ngonna be tougher than most of us realize. We think of Dúnbheo as a\nbackwater. The White King is a pagan. He thinks of it as the capital of\nBlood Forest. He’s not going to retreat.”\nConn Arthur’s brow wrinkled.\nKip said, “When you—as Tallach, of course—and I ride out here into\nfull view, I’ll throw up some firebirds and put some signal flares on this\nridge just before dawn. When their people see a giant grizzly outfitted for\nwar, it’ll be hard to look anywhere else. If Lorcan can swim the river and\nland here and come fast through this gully, he’ll be in the underbelly of the\ncamp in minutes. If he can hit the camp, if he can give just a few minutes of\nchaos—right when the sun dawns—it’d make all the difference. No man\nwants to face one giant grizzly. Trapped between two?”\n“Hell, I wouldn’t want to do that,” Conn Arthur grunted.\n“You think he can do that?”\nConn Arthur examined the terrain. “It’s a suicide run.”\n“That’s right,” Kip said. He let that sit, didn’t defend it.\n“But one that will save many lives if it works,” Conn Arthur said.\n“If,” Kip said. “It’s a gamble. He may die for nothing.” He wasn’t going\nto twist the conn’s arm into this.\nConn Arthur was quiet again. Then he said, “Surely a man who gives his\nlife trying to save his friends is just as much a hero as one who dies actually\nsaving them, right?”\n“Better to die trying to do good than make your own brother blow your\nhead off,” Kip said.\nConn Arthur took a deep breath. Then nodded. “Rónán would’ve agreed\nwith that.”\n“Then go and speak with him. If all goes well, tomorrow night we\ncelebrate, and the next day we mourn.”\n“As it should be,” Conn Arthur said. He had regained some composure,\nbut he was still taking deep, gulping breaths. He left swiftly.\nKip sat down and silently studied the map. Tisis came up beside him,\nand he rested his hand companionably on her hip.\n“You did good there,” she said.\n“Did I?” he asked.\n“How could you even ask that?” she said. “You gave him every chance\nto come clean on his own, and then when he didn’t, you gave him the\nchance to give his brother a hero’s death.”\n“But why?” Kip said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Did I hold back until now because I didn’t want to force him to kill his\nbrother, and lo and behold! here came an opportunity to avoid all that!

But it was also kind,\nand respectful, and life giving. What if, my lord husband, you are a man\nwith not one nature, but two?”\n“Two?”\n“What if you were not only flesh, but also spirit, and those moments\nwhen you bring the two together are not failures, but are your moments of\ndeepest integrity and brilliance?”\n“You think I’m brilliant?” Kip asked.\n“I can’t believe you still question it,” she said. “But the real question is,\ndo you think you’re good?”\n“No,” Kip said without hesitation. “Competent. Crazy stubborn.\nCunning sometimes.”\nShe sighed and looked at the map. “What are you looking for?”\n“Clarity,” he said. He thought about getting out the rope spear and\nworking on it quietly for a few minutes or an hour to ease his mind. Young\nGarret had died in a raid and shattered his heirloom sea demon bone spear.\nKip thought he’d figured out a way to make those bone fragments into the\nspine for the rope spear, which would give it some unique abilities.\nBut Tisis always got that aggrieved look on her face when he worked on\nthe thing, like he wasn’t paying attention to her or something. He didn’t\nknow what her problem was, but she seemed to hate the thing.\nAnyway, it could stay in its bag for now. Enough time to take it out after\nTisis went to bed.\nShe said nothing for a few minutes, then kissed his cheek. “You’ll not\nfind clarity tonight, I think. Come to bed or you’ll stay up so late that it\ncosts you the clarity you’ll need tomorrow.”\nHe followed her to the other side of the command tent. Their personal\nquarters consisted of a small area separated by a curtain, a chest to sit on,\nand a pile of blankets on the ground. There was barely room for the room\nslave Verity (a gift from Eirene that they had not been able to refuse) to\nstand with them, helping Tisis undress. “I’ll not be able to sleep,” Kip said.\nTruth was, he wouldn’t mind some distraction before he went back to\nthe maps. They hadn’t made love all day.\n“You don’t need sleep tonight,” she said.\nWell, that was promising, especially as Verity peeled away her dress.\nBut Tisis dismissed the slave and continued. “What you need is\nintrospection and time. Come and rest on my breast.”\n“Rest… after?” he asked.\n“No.”\n“Rest… first?” he asked.\n“Only. Rest only. You wouldn’t lose yourself to pleasure tonight, or if\nyou did, you’d feel guilty about doing so while Conn Arthur is out having\none of the worst nights of his life.”\n“Be nice to forget all that for a little while.”\n“Tonight you need to think about brothers, and family, and what they"

I want to help you heal it.”\nKip lay his head in her lap as she stroked his hair, and then later upon\nher breast. He didn’t think. Though she’d expected him to think of family\nand of love, for the longest time, here in her softness and her strength, here\nwith this family and this love, he didn’t think at all.\nChapter 60\nTeia made her way back to her room, which she entered unseen in the\nchaos. She wasn’t sure how long she could afford to wait, but she was glad\nshe had when someone banged on her door not ten minutes later.\nA captain of the Tafok Amagez was standing there.\n“What is it?” Teia asked. “I’ve heard shouting. My lady ordered me\nearlier to stay in my room tonight no matter what. Is she safe?”\n“Yes,” the man said. “Everyone’s fine. There’s been a death.”\n“A death? What happened?” Teia asked.\n“Please stay in your room for the rest of the night.”\nTeia gave him a suspicious look. “Well, now you’re making me nervous.\nMy lady’s safety is my sole charge. Do I need to be alarmed? Should I—”\n“Absolutely not. General’s orders. Stay put. I’m putting men outside\nyour rooms to guarantee your safety. We’ve already checked on your lady.\nShe’s fine. The death was an accident. We’re just taking precautions given\nthe fraught nature of relations with the Chromeria right now. Can’t have any\nwell-meaning idiots jump to conclusions and maybe do something we all\nregret.”\n“If that was meant to soothe me, I’m afraid—” Teia started.\n“Satrapah Azmith died at dinner. Had all the signs of a heart attack, but a\nwoman dies at dinner with you, you check the food for poison, right?\nYou’re a Blackguard.”\nTeia feigned shock. “The satrapah? Now? I knew we should have left\nright away.” She mumbled a curse.\n“People are blaming your mistress—” the captain said.\nOh hell no.\n“—for putting such strain on her with her message. Please stay inside for\nthe night until tempers cool. You’ll have orders in the morning.”\nOrders? The Nuqaba wasn’t in authority over them. That her men\ncasually assumed she was wasn’t a good sign.\n“Uh, thank you, then,” Teia said.\nHe turned to go, but she stopped him.\n“Um, sir? Before the screaming just now, the party sounded, uh, pretty\nexuberant. Should I advise my lady not to bother the Nuqaba too early in\nthe morning?”\nHe looked at her as if deciding whether to take offense or not.

If my\ndaddy won’t swive me then, I just find a boy who will. No, it’s, uh… my\ninfection’s flared up.”\n“Infection?”\n“You know, the boy who gave it to me swore I wouldn’t get it if I just\nused my mouth, too. And I believed him. I guess that’s what you get when\nyou start swiving in back alleys at ten to get money for sweets.” Teia\ngrabbed her cheek and turned it out so he could see the lumpy, bloodied\nflesh she’d just bitten.\nThe look on his face was one of pure horror.\n“And if you think that looks bad…” She glanced downward and"

You’re disgusted now, aren’t\nyou?”\n“No, no,” he said, backing away.\n“I just didn’t want you to take it personally, you’re very handsome.”\n“No, no, I understand. It’s fine.”\n“It is kind of burning right now. Maybe I’ll just sleep tonight and let\nmyself heal,” she said.\n“That… that sounds best,” he said. He left quickly.\nBenighted jackass. Dammit. As Teia closed the door, she rubbed her\ncheek. It hurt like hell, but she silently thanked her Archer sisters for the\nstratagem.\nThat you can kill a man easily doesn’t mean he knows it; even if he\nknows it, it doesn’t mean he’ll act in a rational way with that knowledge.\nTheir fault, but your problem.\nShe grabbed her gear and went to her window. Her room had no\nbalcony, but that was just as well. The window opened wide enough for her\nto wriggle through. She popped the first climbing crescent and affixed its\nsticky side to the wall and then poked her head out. This side of the palace\nsat over a cliff, with retaining walls leaving barely enough room for a row\nof low flowering bushes before the palace itself sprang from the ground.\nTeia’s window was only about ten feet above those bushes, but if she fell\nand didn’t grab on to them, a fall of several hundred feet onto rocky beach\nawaited.\nGood thing I’m not afraid of heights.\nMuch.\nThere was no one else out here. No balconies hung out above the cliff\nface, though there were inset patios on the roof, Teia knew.\nShe moved carefully and took her time. She didn’t have enough\nclimbing crescents to make it all the way to the top, so she planned on\ngetting into a window on the next floor. Quick and easy.\nThe window was locked.\nNothing is ever quick and easy.\nShe made it to the next floor up before she ran out of climbing crescents.\nThe window was cracked open, but there was a couple inside. They looked\nlike they’d be busy for a while.\nTeia wasn’t exactly fond of clinging to a wall while the autumn-evening\nbreeze kicked up, chilling her fingers, but she didn’t see that she had many\ngood options, so she waited.\nShe peeked again. The couple—younger staff, servants both—were still\nsitting on the woman’s bed, only kissing. The woman had her legs spread\nand was arching her chest toward the man, but he barely had his hand on\nher thigh. Awkward kisser, too.\nTeia waited. She couldn’t make her move now. The couple was seated\nfacing the window she’d be trying to get through. Anywhere the cloak\nslipped, Teia would be visible, and it would be impossible to get in without\nmaking some sound.\nShe would have to wait until they were too distracted.

She finally took his hand and pulled it to her breast.\nHe stopped and pulled his face away from her, though he left his hand\nwhere it was.\n“Tiwul, I don’t know if we should…” he said.\nOrholam have mercy, man! Get on the horse and ride, or get out of the\ncorral!\nTeia looked around and considered her other options. They weren’t\ngood.\nI don’t need to worry. I’ve got all night.\nAll night to figure out how to kill the Nuqaba, without anyone\nsuspecting it’s an assassination. No problem.\nSo Teia alternately blew warm breath on one hand and then the other to\nkeep her fingers from getting stiff while she clung to the wall at three\npoints. Five minutes passed and Teia heard a little sound of protest.\nShe peeked again. Oh no.\nThis time the young woman had broken off the kissing. His burnous was\noff, and her dress was pushed down to her waist, and her skin was all\ngooseflesh.\nOh no no no, Teia thought. The young woman walked toward the\nwindow, shimmying so her dress dropped past her hips and onto the floor.\nShe was flushed with glee and desire.\n“It’s freezing in here!” she said. “Why don’t we—” and Teia lost the rest\nof the woman’s doubtless brilliant seduction with the creak of the window\nshutting.\nDamn. It.\nFor one murderous moment, Teia thought of cracking the window just\nenough to draft through the empty space. At some opportune moment, she’d\ntweak a nerve in a leg or an arm and make the young man crush that stupid\ngirl. Better yet—\nActually, she’d never thought of it before, but could she make a man’s\nhorn fall? Just by tweaking the right nerves? That opened up all sorts of\npossibilities for mischief.\nCould she make a man’s horn rise against his will with a similar\nmanipulation?\nNow that—!\nNot the time, T.\nNonetheless, the idea made her almost giggle. It was almost irresistible,\nbut she knew if she started, she wouldn’t be able to stop. It was totally\ninappropriate, totally immature, but she was so scared, so nervous, so afraid\nof failing and of not failing, that she almost dissolved. She bit down on her\nmacerated cheek.\nToo hard. She almost yelped aloud.\nBut she felt more levelheaded when she was done cursing silently.\nMaybe that was the darkness working on her. Not a total darkness out here\nby any means, thank Orholam. She thought she’d go mad in ten minutes in\ntotal darkness. Here the lights of the city below and the stars above relieved\nthe empty cold of blackness.\nTime for a new plan.\nTeia climbed back down to her own window, getting her feet onto the\nfirst crescents she’d placed. Each climbing crescent had a string dangling\nfrom it. Pull that string in a big circle around your crescent, and the string\ncut it off the wall. Each time you removed it, you lost adhesive luxin, but\nthe crescents could be reused."

Each time you removed it, you lost adhesive luxin, but\nthe crescents could be reused.\nOf course, it was one thing to place a crescent and then decide you\nneeded that handhold to be farther to the right; it was quite another to do\nwhat Teia planned.\nStill clinging to the wall, she removed her boots and stockings one at a\ntime and stowed them in her bag. Each string had a ring at the end of it.\nDipping low, she grabbed one with her big toe, cut the climbing crescent off\nthe wall with the string, and carefully stood. Then she lifted the crescent\nwith her foot, holding on to the wall with a single hand and foot, and\ngrabbed the crescent in her hand.\nEach crescent retrieval took time, and after a few, Teia’s toes were so\ncold and insensate that she had to watch carefully while grabbing at the\nrings, arching her head dangerously far from the wall. But in another ten\nminutes, she made it to the third floor.\nLocked. Curtains drawn. Who locks a third-floor window overlooking a\ncliff?\nShe debated breaking the window, but she couldn’t be sure the room was\nempty. Nor could there be any doubts about the Nuqaba’s death. There were\nother windows on the same floor, but she had no guarantee that those would\nbe open, either.\nWorse, the climbing crescents were starting to lose too much adhesive.\nShe rubbed the wall with a sleeve each time she set a hold, to remove the\ndirt, but it wasn’t enough. Either the humidity or the dust or the simple fact\nthat Teia was short and had to place the crescents closer than a taller\nassassin meant that there was no way Teia would be using the crescents to\nclimb back down to her room.\nThat was a problem for later.\nShe decided to go for the rooftop gardens.\nIt took her an hour, and more than once, she told herself she was a fool,\nbut there was no way down now; she’d brought the crescents with her.\nWhen she finally threw herself over the edge of the roof, she simply lay\nbeneath an immense rhododendron bush and quivered. Her hamstrings\nwould never forgive her. Her knuckles were scraped bloody. Her sleeves\nwere pilled from polishing the rock wall. Her toes were bruised and alight\nwith pain where the feeling was leaching back into them. Her arms were\njellyfish, stinging her shoulders with their death throes.\nWhen she felt she had the strength, she sat up and massaged her feet and\nthen put her boots back on. Standing, she shook out the master cloak to get\nthe dust off it—and a gust of wind and her own zealous whipping of it\nlaunched it from her cold-clumsy fingers.\nFor a moment, it drifted over the void, flipping away from her—and\nthen she snatched it, nearly lurching off the edge to reach it.\nShe held herself very still, the thunderbolt of what might have been\nparalyzing her for a moment. She let it roll slowly past her as she merely\nbreathed, breathed.\nAn unforced blunder like that? What kind of nunk was she?"

What kind of nunk was she?\nShe had almost just killed herself. Losing the master cloak? Dear\nOrholam, it was that easy to die. One slip. The Order had provided her with\nthe Fox cloak for this mission, but it was so inferior to the master cloak she\nhadn’t even taken it out of her pack in her room.\nThe garden was beautiful. The kind of place Teia would have liked to\ntake her time to explore. But it was night, and the moon was rising, and it\nwas cold, and the garden was empty, so she simply made her way invisibly\nto doors leading inside and whispered a quick prayer.\nIt was open. Thank you, Orholam, for people who aren’t paranoid\nenough.\nThe wide hallway was enclosed with a glass dome from the interior wall\ndown one side and down to the ground on the garden side. Profusions of\nimmaculately trimmed flowers yielded one to another in a pleasing\nsequence of colors and textures. In between large private rooms for the\nNuqaba, there were little garrets for slaves everywhere. Private chapel,\nslaves’ closet, private library, slaves’ closet, drawing room, slaves’ closet,\nmusic and art parlor, more slaves, rock-and-water garden, still more.\nMost of the slaves’ rooms didn’t even have doors, merely a sharp bend\nupon entry so the slaves themselves wouldn’t be visible. Teia peeked in one.\nShe couldn’t help herself. Four men slept on a single narrow bunk bed in a\nroom not even as wide as Teia’s stretched arms. A small washbasin sat\nagainst the far wall, and they’d hung their clothes flat against the wall. A\nfew personal effects were stuffed under the bunk, with room to spare. They\ndidn’t even have shoes.\nOne of the men had his legs uncovered with his bedmate taking their\ntoo-small blanket, and Teia saw whip scars down his very calves. She was\nglad she couldn’t see his back. Above their door was a small bell attached to\na string, and a bundle of other strings passing through their wall to and from\nthe rooms on either side. Teia moved in the direction their bell’s string came\nfrom.\nAfter passing a few more rooms—a swimming area and a hot room?—\nTeia found the chief eunuch’s room. It was the center where all the bell\nstrings led. Doubtless on being summoned he would then summon the\nappropriate slaves—because it’s just too hard for a slave owner to figure out\nfor herself which slaves she should call to address her doubtless urgent\nneeds. Probably the bells were only for nighttime. The Nuqaba would be\nattended at all times when awake.\nThe next room was the Nuqaba’s own, and Teia heard the woman’s\nvoice before she got there.\n“Too hot, you idiot! Get out! No, stop, hold still.”\nThe crack of a heavy slap connecting with bare skin, and then a slave\ngirl not twelve years old burst through the door, bucket in hand, sobbing.\nShe tried to sob quietly.\nTeia remembered that shit: Stop crying! Slap. Stop crying! Slap. You\ndare defy me? Report for whipping, you stupid bitch!"

To save tears up for later.\nTeia slipped in before the slave standing outside the door could close it.\nThis was the Nuqaba’s bed chamber, but though she had entire rooms\ndevoted to baths just steps down the hall, they’d brought in a copper tub full\nof steaming water.\nThe Nuqaba herself was pacing the room in a bathing robe—Teia had\nforgotten that Parian women rarely bathed nude, which had always struck\nher as a weirdly backward custom for an otherwise reasonable people. How\ndo you get really clean when you wear clothing into the bath? The\nnoblewoman’s hair was bound up on top of her head with aromatic oils to\nmoisturize it through the night, her skin scrubbed of all cosmetics. But her\neyes were puffy from tears and bloodshot from either whatever was burning\nin the hookah on the table, or the bundle of haze beside it, or the\nmushrooms she had diced very finely in a dish.\nIf only Teia hadn’t been such a straight arrow growing up, she might\nknow how much of which intoxicant would kill you. It would have been a\nnicely believable accidental suicide.\nI’m a soldier, not an assassin.\nBut as the door closed quietly behind her, Teia was arrested by\nsomething else, and she instantly forgot all about the Nuqaba and\nassassinations and stealth and consequences.\nChained against the Nuqaba’s wall, head imprisoned within a helm with\nblackened glass over the eye slits to keep him from drafting, but\nunmistakable from his towering form and chiseled body, was Commander\nIronfist.\nChapter 61\nHe woke in the deepest darkness he had ever known. When his panic\nsubsided, he examined his surroundings. He’d been moved while he was\nunconscious.\nIt was a black cell, but otherwise identical to the ones Gavin had made.\nJust more cruel.\nMore secure, too, naturally. It was very Andross Guile. This cell didn’t\neven have to be made of luxin. Dark stone of any kind, plus no light, and\nthere could be no escape.\n“Feel it,” a voice said.\nOh no. “Who are you?” Gavin asked. That wasn’t his father’s voice.\n“Feel the stone,” the dead man said.\n“You can’t be here. You…”\n“Feel the stone!”\nGavin felt it. Not granite, smoother. Marble? But without the slick\ncoolness of marble. This was more metallic, as if rather than simply being\ncold, it was sucking the warmth right out of his skin.\n“No,” he said.\n“No one has drafted so much black luxin since Lucidonius,” the voice\nsaid. “Here lies your masterpiece, and no one but your father will ever\nknow.”\nI made this? An entire cell of black luxin, a dark mirror of the others.\nWhy?\nI should feel distrust. I should have my guard up here, against this dead\nman, surely the worst part of me. Instead I feel only a cavernous desolation\nthat sits below my rib cage, burrowing at my heart."

Instead I feel only a cavernous desolation\nthat sits below my rib cage, burrowing at my heart.\nI am a skin suit. A hollow man. I am a disguise buttoned up over\nnothing.\nI am as empty as the eye they burnt out. Lensless, I gawp and stare.\nBathed in light, I remain a black Prism, reflecting nothing, spitting only\nfacets of myself into these cells. I am the unseeing I.\n“Of all the dead men, surely you would be the greatest liar. Why should\nI believe anything you say?” Gavin asked. But he believed.\n“Because you know what makes the best lies, and you think you’re\nsmart enough to winnow out the facts even if I did lie to you.”\n“That does sound like me,” Gavin admitted to the voice of the darkness.\nThe younger me. Am I really talking to a part of myself in each of these\ncells? Shouldn’t I be a good man, then, if I drained so much bile into these\nabominations?\n“I created us one at a time,” the voice said. “Blue first, then green\nsometime later, yellow, orange quite a while later—the technical problems\nmade it difficult to craft a chamber entirely of orange. It was important to\nme, to you, not to cheat and use multiple colors. We fixated on that. Red we\ndid with many layers of seared red luxin and liquid red. Anyone else would\nhave worried about placing what amounts to a bomb in the Chromeria’s\nheart. Superviolet and sub-red not even I could figure out.”\n“But I did,” Gavin said, thinking he’d caught his dark mirror in a lie. He\nhad some inkling of this, scratching around the back of his skull.\n“By cheating,” the dead man said. So he knew that, too. He’d merely\nbeen baiting himself, to torture himself more.\n“There is no cheating in life, only success and a thousand flavors of\nfailure.” Gavin sounded like his father, saying that. He couldn’t remember,\nthough, if he’d heard it from him first.\n“See, you do remember, a little. We made superviolet and sub-red as\ndeath traps rather than as true prisons. We crafted the superviolet so that in\nbreaking any part of the luxin, it would all break. So when any man fell in,\nin falling in or fighting it, he would shatter it all and release so much luxin\ndust into the air that he must suffocate. And the sub-red, do you\nremember?”\nThe obvious problem was that sub-red was highly flammable. You could\ndraft a crystal of it, but if exposed to air, it caught fire instantly.\n“I did… something… with orange.”\n“You carved out the space for the chamber, sealed it airtight on every\nside, then made a permeable wall of orange luxin that you stuck your hands\nthrough repeatedly. You burnt sub-red in that chamber until there was no air\nin it at all, and then you created the chamber itself with a monomaniac’s\ntotal fixation. That cell is perfect, a perfect sphere shining and crystalline, a\nmarvel with the beauty of ten thousand flame crystals larger than anyone\nelse has ever drafted. A perfect cell that no man will ever see.”"

He wouldn’t have time to even see the fire that would consume him.”\n“Or if he miraculously lived through the inferno, he would then\nasphyxiate, as you built the trapdoor to seal airtight behind an intruder.”\nThat was right. He’d done that to keep it from being an actual bomb.\n“You’re being awfully helpful,” Gavin said. The darkness was getting to\nhim, even with this comforting voice.\n“You made me different from the others. Don’t you remember?”\nGavin didn’t. Not enough. But the dead man knew that, didn’t he?\n“You assumed that if father caught you, he would throw you in here.\nBecause why would Andross Guile try any half measure?”\n“So I made an escape route?” Gavin said.\n“Naturally, I thought about it. For a long time.”\n“I built escapes for the others.” Most of them. “Why not this one?”\n“Perhaps I planned to. Perhaps it was too hard. Perhaps I wanted one\nprison that I might use for someone else—father, perhaps—from whence I\nknew no one could escape. Or perhaps it was that madness in me. That\nfixation. Perhaps I couldn’t bear to build an almost-perfect prison.”\n“‘Perhaps,’ ‘perhaps’? Stop that!” Gavin said.\n“Then you tell me,” the dead man said.\n“I don’t know.”\n“You do.”\n“No, I don’t remember.”\n“This doesn’t take memory. I’d bet you haven’t changed as much as all\nthat.”\nThe dead man didn’t goad him after that.\nIt took a few minutes, standing in the darkness, feeling it soak into his\nbones, feeling the terror rise like water flooding the cell, covering his toes,\nthen his ankles.\nGavin cursed aloud. “How young and stupid was I?”\nThe dead man didn’t answer. Didn’t need to.\nWhy do men walk to the edge of a chasm? Is the view so different, right\nat the edge, than it is two steps back?\nThey walk to the edge because it scares them.\nI wanted this here because it frightened me. I, a veritable lord of light,\nwas ashamed of being afraid of the dark. So I made my own cell, my own\ngreatest terror, and I put it under my own house. But its existence wasn’t\nenough. It had to be inescapable. A cell without locks isn’t scary enough for\na brash fool. It’s only as scary as the threat is real.\nThere were many kinds of suicidal madness. There was only one name\nfor the kind of madness that puts a gun to its own head when it has no\nintention of pulling the trigger: youth.\nAll these years of the terrors in the night and the sudden paralyzing\npanics that I dismissed as foolishness and cowardice and nonsense.

As if we don’t have all\nthe time in the world. Very well. You made me last of all the dead men. You\nmade me with the black luxin that destroyed you, that obliterated so much\nof the Dazen Guile who had been. You didn’t craft my personality to punish\nyou, though. No additional torture is necessary in a black cell. You made me\nto hold all the memories you hoped to lose. Finally, Dazen, you made me to\ncomfort you.”\nSo the young me wasn’t heartless. Brash and irritating and irritatingly\ncompetent, but not always thoughtless. But this was a palliative comfort. A\nhierarchical comforting, wasn’t it? Old me saying sorry, but I’ve clearly\nbested you, future me. Because I can’t imagine you ever reaching the\nheights of perfection again that I have reached now.\nFuck you, young, arrogant me. “What if I don’t want your comfort?”\n“Then we reach an impasse far more quickly than the old you expected\nwe would. Hmm. Funny. The old you was the young you. Regardless, the\nyoung Dazen desperately wanted to share, to justify himself, to be\nunderstood. He thought you would be the only person who could\nunderstand him.”\n“‘The young Dazen’?” Gavin asked. “Like you aren’t him?”\n“A will-casting like me is… quite special. I’ve been in here for almost\ntwo decades. I’ve aged. Learned. So no, I’m not exactly young any longer.”\n“A will-casting doesn’t age. It only decays.”\n“Depends on how well they’re made. All magic fails eventually, yes.\nWill-castings deteriorate regardless of how well drafted. Me? I’ve aged.\nI’ve been aware of the passing time, and I don’t know that I would thank\nyou for it. I’ve wanted someone to talk with for a long time, and I’ll only\nappreciate it more if there are big differences between us now. I’ve talked to\nmyself enough. You will wish to talk. Now, or soon. I know, because I am\nyou.”\n“And if I don’t want your truth?” Gavin asked.\n“My truth? Is this the madness speaking? There is no my truth or your\ntruth. You have forgotten the truth; your forgetting it doesn’t make it cease\nto exist. I am here to remind you of it, so that perhaps in the last days of\nyour life, you might reconcile yourself to who you have been, and die with\na measure of peace.”\n“You’re gentler than I would have been, back then,” Gavin said.\n“Clearly not. But I do tire of your obstinacy, old man.”\nGavin waited in the darkness for a long time. It was impossible to tell\nhow long, though. He felt his way around the chamber. Had he already done\nthat?

It might extend only as\nhigh as his upstretched hand could reach, and he would never know.\nThat would be the kind of bitter joke young Dazen might have played.\nSo he moved around the cell, as methodically as he could in the total\ndarkness, and jumped, slapping his hand against the curvature of the wall as\nhigh as he could.\n“I could mock you for this,” the dead man said. “But I don’t find it\nfoolish, despite how it looks. I rather admire your tenacity instead. I’m glad\nI didn’t lose that as I got old.”\n“‘Despite how it looks’?” Gavin said. “Can you see in here?”\n“A figure of speech only. I can hear you slapping the wall, and it’s what I\nwould do. Would have done? Will do? I’m not really sure how to address\nus.”\n“I would have thought I would only put the vile parts of me into this\ncell, into the black,” Gavin said, though he hadn’t really intended to talk to\nthe thing.\n“My control of black wasn’t that precise.

And I wanted\nme to be a comfort to you.

He\nplanned to go around at least twice, just in case he missed a spot on the first\nround. “The others said I was the Black Prism. Is that true?”\nThe dead man sighed. “So it worked, to hide that from you for all these\nyears?”\n“So the answer is yes.”\n“Yes,” the dead man admitted.\n“They said that I needed to kill drafters to refresh my powers.”\n“That makes it sound like an evil power. It’s not evil. Black luxin itself\nisn’t evil… though I guess I, being will-cast into black luxin, probably\nwould try to convince you of that. Hmm. Well, you needn’t believe me\noutright on matters pertaining to black luxin itself—I wouldn’t in your\nplace, I suppose. Won’t in your place, whatever. Suffice it to say, I only\nkilled those who attacked me first, or those who wished to suicide anyway.”\n“The Freeing.”\n“That’s right.”\n“Is that what the Freeing was always about?” Gavin asked. “Giving\nprovender to feed a black luxin drafter?”\n“I don’t know,” the dead man said. “I think maybe it once was, but I\ndon’t think that all the Prisms have been black drafters. Maybe only very\nfew. The Spectrum was baffled when I made it past the first seven years.\nThey expected me to die, or they thought I needed them.

I feared that father\nfigured it out then, but from how old you are, I’m going to guess he\nremained ignorant for longer than I imagined.”\nGavin said, “What happened at Sundered Rock?”\n“I think you know by now,” the dead man said.\n“Fragments only. I want to hear it all.”\nGavin could see no expression, of course, and eventually the dead man\nspoke: “Our plan worked, mostly. I—we—decided that some of the friends\nI’d made and allies I’d promised myself to were worse than who we were\nfighting. You remember this much, right?”\nThat was where the plan to replace the real Gavin had come in. Gavin\nsaid, “If I won, I wouldn’t really win. As it was, the war was traumatic, but\nbrief. If I won as Dazen, I’d have gained the upper hand against the\nChromeria, but I would still have had to subdue five of the Seven Satrapies.\nI might have beaten them eventually, but it was the wrong victory. My\ngeneral Gad Delmarta had killed eighty thousand people in Garriston, and\nmy army was full of Gad Delmartas. I remember what I planned with\nCorvan before the battle. What I don’t remember is what happened during\nand immediately after it.”\nThe dead man made a sound low in his throat. “Mmm. General Danavis\nmanaged to array the men I most wanted to die against the strongest parts of\nGavin’s army. Unfortunately, it is remarkably hard to lose a battle in exactly\nthe way you wish. A lot more people died in bringing me face-to-face with\nmy brother than I’d intended, and then, of course, he kicked our ass.”\n“How did he do it?”\n“I don’t remember that, either. I remember thinking he’d cheated. But\nmaybe there is no cheating, there’s only success and a thousand flavors of\nfailure.”\n“Thanks.” Old me is a dick. Guess that proves it is old me.\nBut the dead man went on. “At the end, rather than die, I drafted black—\nand wow, did I draft black. It struck like a thousand cannons. Afterward,\nover the years, I asked a score of different soldiers who’d been there what\nhappened that day. None wanted to talk about it. When pressed, there was\nno stable, single story. I drafted so much black luxin that day that it\nobliterated other people’s memories as well as my own. And, like me, they\nfilled in the details as well as they could without even knowing it. The mind\nabhors a void, so it fills it with avoidance and fantasies, and calls them\ntruth.\n“There was an explosion, they said. The gods walked the earth again,\nthey said. No, the Guile brothers became gods and warred, they said. Magic\nhad undone the world, they said. The brothers brought hell to earth, they\nsaid. Others insisted nothing happened. Just a huge battle like any huge\nbattle, they said. Others said that was what split Sundered Rock, that the\nrock had another name before that they couldn’t remember now. Storm\ngiants came to Sundered Rock, they said, and threw mountains and\nlightning at each other.\n“Others, who were much farther away—outside the influence of the"

They saw something on the horizon, an obsidian sunrise.\nMaybe it was ash, a scholar guessed, from a new volcano—but there was no\nash found later.”\n“Stop. Enough.” It was too painful to dwell on. The lies and their cost,\nthe men and drafters dead, undeserving. All those closest to Gavin and\nDazen, the guards rushing to preserve them… obliterated by the brothers’\nhatred and power.\nNow here he was, trapped in his own cell. The cell he had forgotten was\nthe cell in which he would be forgotten.\nIt would take a miracle to save him. Something never seen.\nPerhaps something… mythic?\n“Tell me,” Gavin commanded the dead man. “So there’s black luxin. A\nlegend come to life. Is there white, too?”\n“No.”\n“That doesn’t make sense. There must be a balance.”\n“There is a balance. There is pure, white, full-spectrum light—which we\nsplit into all the colors of the rainbow, and which we draft in innumerable\nways into matter—and there is darkness and black luxin. That is the\nbalance: black against all the colors put together. As there is no forgiveness,\nonly forgetting, white luxin’s a myth, a lie for the desperate and foolish.\nThere is no hope for you, Guile. No escape. There is only the perfection of\ndarkness. There is no white luxin.”\nChapter 62\nIronfist wore a peculiar white gem on his chest. Teia didn’t recognize the\nstone, which had always been tucked into his tunic, but she did recognize\nthe leather thong from which it hung.\nApart from his size and musculature, it was the only thing about him she\nrecognized. His bare limbs were manacled to the wall at his wrists and\nelbows, thighs and ankles. An iron strap held his waist flush against the\nwall. A helmet was bolted directly into the stone and encased his head\ncompletely, locking under the chin, the glass over his the eye slits so dark\nhe could probably barely make out shapes as he twisted his head back and\nforth painfully.\nLittle wads of cloth had been stuffed into several of the manacles to\ncushion them. They were bloody. He’d lost weight, too.\nHow long had he been here?\nTeia was so stunned that she almost didn’t move in time when the door\nopened behind her. The crying slave girl brought in a bucket of water and\nstood next to the tub awkwardly. Must have been new.\nThe Nuqaba touched the water. “You took so long it’s fine now. Begone,\nand see to it I’m not disturbed.”\nThe girl bobbed down to her knees and backed out to the door, then\nstopped. “Blessed? Would you like your bathers?”\n“What part of ‘not disturbed’ was unclear? Out!

Teia\nsaw what she guessed was a musket-ball scar, months old but still red and\nangry.\n“I want you to know, I wasn’t always like this,” the Nuqaba said, though\nshe didn’t look at Ironfist. “Your Prism friend shot me. I almost died. The\nmusket ball is still in my leg, and the pain is… quite something.” She\npicked up a little cup of a brownish liquid that Teia assumed was tincture of\npoppy and drained it.\nThe Nuqaba gritted her teeth against the taste.\n“I made it through four broken bones, a broken tooth, innumerable black\neyes, and such humiliations as you would scarce believe at the hands of that\nhusband you left me to, and I never once asked for poppy. But maybe I was\nscared that it would make me lose control, that I would tell him how I\nwanted to kill him, how I’d been planning it for years. How he reduced me\nto seducing his men because I knew I’d need help.”\nShe walked over to him and removed a pin at Ironfist’s throat.\n“Turn your head away. I’m going to bathe.”\nIronfist turned his head, and she replaced the pin, locking his head in\nplace.\nShe stripped off her overrobe and grabbed a pinch of the cut mushrooms\non the table. She tucked them into her lip, then limped over to the bath. She\ngot in, slowly, as she spoke. “They all want everything, Harrdun. I had\neverything arranged, you know? Hanishu would be my satrap, you would\nbe my general. We would secede from the Chromeria and be our own ruling\nfamily, like the Guiles. Instead you refuse me? You get Hanishu killed? For\nthe Guiles? You want to go after Gavin’s bastard son and save him? Why do\nyou care less about us than about them? Where’s your loyalty, brother?”\nTeia hadn’t even known Ironfist and the Nuqaba were related. At first,\nshe’d thought this was some sort of weird seduction.\nThe Nuqaba was Ironfist’s sister?\nOh hells.\nThe jumble of emotions Teia’d felt on seeing him—terror that he was\nhurt, inexpressible joy that he was alive, determination to release him\nimmediately, fury at this bitch for doing this to him, and relief that he would\ntake care of things from this point if only she could free him—suddenly\nshattered.\nTeia was here to kill Ironfist’s sister. Right in front of him.\nHe had never spoken of her, but this was the woman he’d kept a portrait\nof in his chambers. A man like Ironfist didn’t keep a picture of someone he\nhated.\n“Why? Damn you! Speak!” the Nuqaba shouted, and she flung the\nempty laudanum cup at him. It shattered on the wall, but Ironfist said\nnothing.\nA quick tap sounded on the door, and it opened. The chief eunuch poked\nhis head in. “Blessed?” he asked."

Remove\nit.”\nThe eunuch went to Ironfist and pulled a different pin in the helmet, and\nmanipulated something Teia couldn’t see. The eunuch then grabbed a few of\nthe larger pieces of the broken cup.\n“Leave them. Go to bed. I’ll not need your services for the rest of the\nnight.”\nThe eunuch bowed. “Blessed, may I summon your bathers?”\n“They’re all spies. Good night.”\nHe sighed. “Blessed, I worry—”\n“Good night,” she said. It was a command.\nAnd as the door closed, Teia had her plan.\n“Brother?” Haruru said.\n“I didn’t know,” Ironfist said, his voice low and rusty with disuse. “I\ndidn’t know he beat you.”\n“Because you were gone! Why? If you were here, you’d have seen.\nYou’d…”\nIronfist, his head still trapped pointing away from her, only sighed.\n“When… when mother died, I swore vengeance on her killers. I thought it\nwas my fault she’d died. And then I’d foolishly killed the man who held the\nblade, so we couldn’t be sure who’d ordered it. I know it may seem obvious\nin retrospect, but mother had many enemies, and not just enemies of our\nfamily. There were old rivals and bitter former friends. She was…\napparently not an easy woman to get along with.”\n“What are you talking about? Mother was beloved. Everyone loved her,”\nthe Nuqaba said. She filled a golden chalice—though this simply with wine\nas far as Teia could tell.\n“No, she wasn’t. You were too young, you don’t remember what she was\nlike, Haruru. You were her baby, her only surviving daughter. She was\ndifficult, but we loved her.”\n“And you sure showed it!” she sneered. “Giving away everything she’d\nworked for to go to the Chromeria.”\nA big breath, then, “I went to the Chromeria at the command of the\nOrder of the Broken Eye,” Ironfist said.\nTeia saw the shock on the Nuqaba’s face mirror her own. Ironfist? The\nOrder? Ironfist was in the Order?\nIronfist was everything Teia had ever hoped to be. He was her patron\nBlackguard, for Orholam’s sake. Resolute, loyal, comfortable in command,\nsupreme in competence, unrivaled in confidence. Hearing from his own lips\nthat he was a spy and therefore a traitor, that he was actually part of the\nOrder whereas she herself only pretended to work for it, was like taking\nyour wedding ring in shame to a shop to pawn it, and then hearing the gold\nring was brass over lead, that all the precious stones were nothing but\ncolored glass.\nTeia was so shocked, she almost lost her grip on paryl and became\nvisible.\n“Impossible,” the Nuqaba said.\nTeia had told Iron fist everything: not just about Aglaia’s blackmail, but"

So why wasn’t she dead? Had he not told the Old\nMan? Why?\n“You remember our uncle? He… was able to point me to the right\npeople. I went to them and asked that mother’s murderers be killed. All of\nthem.”\n“What?”\n“Of course, I didn’t know who those murderers were, or how many there\nwere, and we had very little money then. I couldn’t pay the Order, so they\ntook my service instead. It was too much for me, at first, to swear allegiance\nto such filth. But then I thought, who has a better claim on my fealty: a\ndistant Orholam or my own family? So I went back three days later, and\ntold them if they would not only avenge mother, but also protect you, I\nwould join them. They said they were not bodyguards, but they would foil\nany assassination attempts against you they heard of, and would do their\nbest to guard your life. They found and left the evidence for you to find that\nmother’s killer was in the Gatu tribe. My first test of fealty was to enroll in\nthe Chromeria instead of hunting down the murderer myself. I didn’t know\nit until he was dying, but Hanishu followed me to the Chromeria because he\nfound out about my oath to the Order. He hoped to save my soul.”\n“This isn’t true,” the Nuqaba said. “You were never a liar before. What\nhave those Guiles done to you?”\n“Sister, the Order has killed fourteen men for me. But they weren’t\nabove keeping me in the dark. I didn’t know your husband was such a\nmonster. They told me that only four years ago. The captain who helped\nyou? Yattuy? He worked for them… us.”\n“Lies. Lies. I did this.”\n“Takama Tanebdatt. Tatbirt of the Ishelhiyen. Tadêfi of the coast. Ultra\nSinigurt. Aghilas the spearman. Yuba Winitran. Sifax Winitran. Isil Gwafa.\nAzrur Badis. Idus Aziki. Izem of the Tlaganu. Usem Yuften. Ziri the\nStranger. Udad Red. In return, I gave the Order information. It never\nseemed to really matter, what I told them. It was just family politics, right?\nUntil this war—”\n“I don’t care about that!” she said. But obviously now the intoxicants\nwere fully upon her, and she was struggling for clarity. “Those are all the\npeople who stood between me and becoming Nuqaba. You’re claiming you\nkilled them all?”\n“I—they were all people who planned to kill you. Once others figured\nout that opposing you meant risking assassination, those who could be\ndeterred by fear were deterred, and those who were more ambitious went\nstraight to trying to kill you first. It wasn’t what I intended—”\n“You’re saying you handed me this seat? That I am Nuqaba only\nbecause of you?!”"

That I am Nuqaba only\nbecause of you?!”\nTeia saw his chest rise and fall in a silent sigh. “You never wondered\nwhy all those people died or disappeared? Your enemies certainly did!”\nShe was silent.\n“What? You really thought that you were so lucky? So ‘blessed’ that\neveryone in your way fell dead at your feet? Dear Orholam, sister, how\narrogant have you become?!”\nHe couldn’t see her face or he probably would have stopped talking,\nbecause after her initial shock was the briefest flash of embarrassment like\nlightning in a distant cloud, and then the thunder of her rage rolled.\nTeia started drafting, and she was only lucky that the Nuqaba went to a\nside cupboard first. Dripping wet, the Nuqaba threw open a drawer and\ngrabbed for something. She swayed, missed, and rummaged. Her hand\nemerged with a short, sharp knife.\nShe was so furious she didn’t even speak. She rushed toward Ironfist\nwith murderous intent. Teia tried to make the Nuqaba’s arm go dead with\nparyl, but she missed the nerve as the woman moved.\nAt the last moment, Teia abandoned her magical efforts and chopped her\nhand down across the Nuqaba’s extending wrist. The knife clanged on the\nfloor, nearly striking Ironfist’s leg on the way down.\nTeia jerked her arm back within the confines of the master cloak as the\nNuqaba rubbed her wrist, baffled.\nShe looked at Ironfist as if he’d done it somehow, and then she pounced\nafter the knife, dignity forgotten.\nThis time Teia didn’t go after the nerve in the arm, she went for the\nspine. She’d had far more practice with this. Many slaves’ worth, Orholam\nforgive her.\nIt still took her until the Nuqaba had recovered the knife and stepped\nagain toward Ironfist, undeterred.\n“And now,” the Nuqaba said, “you mother—” She raised the knife as\nTeia got the right grip.\nTeia squeezed hard, and the Nuqaba dropped boneless. Teia caught her,\nbut lost the paryl.\nIt didn’t matter. The Nuqaba was so befuddled in her intoxicated haze by\nsuddenly losing control of her limbs that she didn’t even fight.\n“What’s happening? Haruru?” Ironfist said, neck locked to the side. The\nhelmet rattled. “Who’s there?”\nTeia had almost wrestled the bigger woman back to the tub when the\nNuqaba started trying to fight. Teia squeezed hard again, but her hold on the\nspine must have shifted because this time the Nuqaba’s body bucked and\nseized so violently they both went down.\nBut Teia held on to the paryl at the woman’s throat. Perhaps her very life\ndepended on it. Her grip shifted to the right place again as the Nuqaba fell\non her, and the woman went limp again.\nTeia scrambled out from under the woman’s dead weight, careful to keep\nthe paryl grip.

It was like lifting a fish live from the river, losing the hook,\nand finding it both too big and too heavy for your hands, praying it didn’t\nslip or thrash before you got to shore.\nShe’d lost her invisibility, but maybe it didn’t matter. Ironfist’s face was\nturned away, and though his helmet rattled with his efforts to see what was\nhappening, he couldn’t—at least as far as Teia could tell.\nThe Nuqaba’s eyes rolled in terror as she saw the hooded figure standing\nover her, and her mouth gaped to scream, but nothing came out. She had no\ncontrol over her body below the neck.\nWith difficulty, while keeping the paryl hold on her spine, Teia lifted the\nwoman and lowered her into the bathtub. She flopped the woman’s limp\narms over the sides of the tub to keep her from sliding down.\nHer first thought had been to simply drown the Nuqaba. Drunks passed\nout and drowned all the time, especially in hot water. It had seemed to be\nwhat the chief eunuch had been nervous about. But that wasn’t going to\nwork now.\nNot if Teia freed Ironfist.\nIf she freed Ironfist and the Nuqaba was found drowned, they would\nassume he’d done it. It wouldn’t matter that there were no bruises on her\nface, no signs of violence anywhere on her body.\nDamn. It had been a good plan.\nTeia stood frozen with indecision.\n“Murder Sharp?” Ironfist said. “Is that you? Morteza? Is this you and\nNouri Sharp? Speak to me, please. You can’t do this. Things are different\nthan whatever the Old Man thought when he sent you, please…”\nTeia didn’t answer. It was all true, then. Ironfist really was in the Order\nof the Broken Eye. It felt as if her world were coming down. The best man\nshe knew was on the same side as the worst men she knew: Murder Sharp\nand the Old Man of the Desert.\n“Don’t you dare hurt her!” Ironfist hissed. Teia had never heard him\nangry before, had never heard his voice skittering along the edge of control.\nShe approached him, pulling her invisibility back around her. It didn’t\nwork fully. The master cloak had gotten wet from the Nuqaba’s soaking\nbody and bathing robe, and the master cloak shimmered weirdly in the air\nwhere it was damp.\n“I can convince her,” Ironfist said. “Whatever it is we need. I’ll make\nwhatever deal you want. I’ve given my whole life and all my integrity for\nthis. Please!”\nTeia said nothing. She felt as if her heart had been ripped out. She\ncouldn’t keep this up. She was still barely holding on to the Nuqaba’s spine,\nand this…\n“You leave me no choice,” Ironfist said, and his chest lifted as he took a\ndeep breath to shout an alarm to the guards.

There was no way he was going to break those\nmassive chains.\nBreath hissed out from the huge man. His muscles went taut throughout\nhis torso and arms. Veins jumped out.\nBut the chains held.\nA moment later, he gasped a breath and went limp.\nTeia turned and picked up the knife the Nuqaba had dropped.\nA moment later, Teia heard Ironfist’s manacles rattle as he flung himself\nagainst them.\nTeia stepped close to the Nuqaba. She whispered so Ironfist wouldn’t\nhear her or recognize her voice if he did. “And now, you bitch, now you pay\nfor your treason.”\nShe dropped the invisibility so that the last thing the Nuqaba saw would\nbe Teia’s paryl-widened eyes, all black as the hell that awaited her. The\nwoman blanched in terror, and Teia calmly pushed her arm under the water\nso there would be no spurting, and sliced her veins open from wrist to\nforearm.\nA gush of blood incarnadined the bathwater.\nThe chains rattled again. Another grunt of expelled air and failure.\nTeia grabbed the Nuqaba’s other arm and slashed it underwater, too.\nThen she lifted it just enough to drape it over the side of the tub. Blood\npoured onto the floor like wine from the slaves’ pitchers at the party\ndownstairs.\nTeia doused the blade of the Nuqaba’s knife in that already-slowing\nstream, and then dropped the knife onto the stones beside the tub, careful\nlest the blood spatter her cloak.\nAfter the action came the horror of it. The Nuqaba was blinking wildly,\neyes rolling, face contorting. She clearly wanted to scream. She wanted to\nweep. She wanted to run. But there was to be none of that, not for her. She\nwas to watch herself die, knowing that her murderer would go free, that this\nwould look like self-slaughter. If she could but yell a single word, she\nwould live.\nTeia held the woman, eye to eye, her own muscles knotting with the\ntension of holding the paryl grip tight on that spine, for long minutes. Under\none fluttering eye was a tattoo in Old Parian: justice. Under the other:\nmercy. But neither winked, neither was any different from the other or\ndifferent from any woman’s eyes. Haruru was no longer the Nuqaba. In her\ndying, she was no more a symbol of Orholam than she had been in her\nliving. She was now only a victim of those stronger than she was. Now she\nwas just a woman, dying in her bath.\nTeia held the Nuqaba’s spine. The water was a deepening red when she\nheard Ironfist say around his gag, “Heeaa! Heeaa! Theeaaa!”\nTeia.\nFuck!\nWith a muffled roar, he threw himself against the chains again."

The bolt that held one of the\nchains to the wall had pulled forward.\nNo, not the bolt—the bolt had held—Ironfist had pulled an entire block\nnearly clear of the wall. Blood streaming down his arms, he threw them\nforward again, like an injured eagle flapping its wings, longing to be free.\nThe masonry broke; an anchor block tore clear.\nIronfist slapped at his helmet, trying to free his head so he could see, but\nthe great swinging block impeded him. But only for a moment.\nAs Teia fumbled, flinging paryl toward him, he tore away the pins on the\ngag and holding his head to the left.\nHe reached over to free his right arm—\n—and finally Teia caught his spine, and his arms dropped.\n“Teia,” he said tersely. “For Orholam’s sake. I know it’s you. That\nheight. That chop across the wrist. Of the Shadows only you’re that short.\nIt’s you!”\nTeia’d grabbed the spine too low. He could still speak, and he was trying\nto crane his head to see his sister, but the helmet still blocked that from him.\n“She tried to kill Gavin,” Teia whispered.\nShe shouldn’t have said anything. Shouldn’t have confirmed his\nsuspicion that it was her.\n“She was going to kill you.”\n“I don’t care what she did! I damned myself for her!”\nToo loud. Teia shifted her grip on his spine upward, perilously close to\nwhere she might paralyze his lungs and not just his voice.\nShe’d never handled two spine pinches at once. Had never known she\ncould.\n“Teia, no. Teia, no,” Ironfist whimpered, but Teia held. Soon it would be\ntoo late for him to do anything.\nIn those long minutes, as Teia’s courage faltered, she knew she should\nhave thought of the Nuqaba’s betrayal of the Seven Satrapies, how that\nwoman turning her back on her vows cost the lives of hundreds or maybe\nthousands in the Blood Forest and elsewhere as the White King’s armies\nadvanced. Teia should have steeled her spine knowing that this woman had\ntortured and tried to murder Gavin Guile himself.

Burn in hell.”\nTeia reached a finger out and held the Nuqaba’s right eyelid, Mercy,\nclosed.

You might even make it out of this alive.”\nChapter 63\n“Tonight is the night,” the Third Eye said from behind him as he stood on\nthe palace balcony. “There’s no way to delay it longer, my love.”\n“That’s not true.” Corvan Danavis looked unseeing over his fleet. He\nwore his dress uniform tonight, all brass buttons, battle sash, and medals,\nmost of them given him by a man all now thought dead: Dazen Guile. His\nmustache had grown out to something near its former glory, gold beads\nadorning each side. They’d thought General Corvan Danavis dead, too.\n“We’ve talked about this,” the Third Eye said. “If we delay, others die as\nwell. And in the end, it changes nothing. Someone once said, ‘Better to lose\na scout today than a squad tomorrow or a city next week.’”\n‘Someone’ had been he, of course. He tried to grin, but it failed.\n“I would sacrifice the world for another day with you,” he said. He\ncouldn’t turn and look at her, still. He didn’t want to waste this precious\ntime with weeping.\nShe came to stand at the railing beside him. She put her sunburnt hand\nover his. She said, “Romantic… but if it were true, I never would have\nmarried you.”\n“‘A man may weaken,’” he said. Now he was quoting her to her. It was\nthe problem of both of them being leaders. They both had to sling grandiose\nhorse shit sometimes. The quote ended ‘without it invalidating all he\nbelieves.’\nTypical that his quote would be about giving others to death, and hers\nwould be about extending grace to others’ failures.\n“I hope this one will,” she said.\nHe turned to look at her for the first time tonight.

        "text": "“I hope this one will,” she said.\nHe turned to look at her for the first time tonight. She wore a white silk\ndress with black ties drawing it snug around the body he worshipped. She\nwas terribly sunburnt, with blisters on her skin over scars from older\nblisters. Her power of Seeing required sunlight on her whole body, and\nshe’d been Seeing as much as possible for this past year, desperate to save\nothers’ lives by her own sacrifices. She’d known early on that there was no\nfuture in which she died of the skin cancers.\nHe saw the scars and railed against how they pained her, but they didn’t\ndim her beauty in his eyes. The scars were only proof of her love made\nvisible in her flesh, like a mother’s stretch marks. Anyone who couldn’t see\nbeauty in them was a fool.\nNor was she self-conscious about her red and tender skin.\nAt thirty-nine years of age, his wife was the mistress of her body and her\nself. She knew her strengths and wasn’t threatened by her weaknesses. She\nwas a woman whole: able to cry or laugh or be silly or be seductive, and\nmove from each in her own time, and move you with her. Her confidence\nmade her far more appealing than even the few women Corvan had met in\nhis life who might be objectively more beautiful, if such a thing as objective\nbeauty existed.\nFor beauty isn’t passive; beauty acts upon its beholder, moving and\nchanging him. Line up ten paintings of different women by the same artist\nand ten men might agree which subject is the most beautiful. But let those\nmen and women mingle for an evening, and duels might be fought over the\nsame question, with no one lying in either case, and each convinced of the\nrightness of his judgment.\nCorvan had lost two wives, but it was the loss of this third that would\ndestroy him. The Broken Eye had sent one of its murderous Shadows for\nher. Something about the cloaks the assassins wore disrupted even Seers’\nvision. But she had been able to track her own presences and absences to\nfigure out all the futures down which she died, though not how.\nIt is Orholam’s will, she would say. Orholam would provide for him\nafter she was gone, she would say.\nWords strangled in his throat, he turned away from her. “I have not your\nfaith,” he said.\n“Not like this, please,” she said, preempting him. “Let’s not spend our\nlast night in those conversations.”\nShe was right. One didn’t have to be a Seer to see how such talk would\nend with angry words and angry tears. This night was too precious.\nThe yellow luxin tattoo on her forehead gleamed softly, and he felt\ncalmed.\n“Using all your tricks on me again?” he said gruffly.\n“Tricks? I prefer to think of them as my charms,” she said, grinning.\n“And yes… before the night is over, all of them.”\nThe yellow eye tattoo was a cunning piece of art that seemed to be a\nSeers Island secret, but the real cunning of it was that the Third Eye wasn’t\nonly a yellow drafter. She was also an orange, and the Seers had no absolute\nprescriptions against the use of hexes.\nInvisible behind the bright distraction of the gleaming yellow eye, she"

She was also an orange, and the Seers had no absolute\nprescriptions against the use of hexes.\nInvisible behind the bright distraction of the gleaming yellow eye, she\ndrew mood-changing hexes. No one could help but glance repeatedly at that\nyellow eye, so no one could help but be affected by the hexes there, hidden\nin plain sight. They’d been married before she told him of it. The\nChromeria had a bad habit of executing hex casters.\n“Your scouts from Blood Forest get back yet?” she asked.\nHe lifted his eyebrows. “You want to spend our last night talking about\nthe war?”\n“It’s your calling,” she said, as if it were simple. “And when we talk\nabout it, I feel I’m helping you and the world, and I feel closer to you than\nat any time other than when we make love.”\n“I hope I wasn’t presumptuous to expect—”\n“That’s next,” she said. “I’m greedy. I want to be with you in every way\ntonight.”\nIt was surreal to talk so lightly about her death. But she was right. She\nusually was.\n“A number of scouts have come back, actually,” he said. “Piracy is\nrampant across the entire sea. Some new pirate queen named Pasha Mimi\nhas got the Aborneans paying her to keep the Narrows open while they\nbuild their own fleet. She, naturally, is using the fortune they’re paying her\nto build her own fleet. My scouts looking for the White King seizing bane\nall came up empty, but it’s a big sea. They do report many superviolet bane\nstorms, but it could be because so much sub-red is being used elsewhere in\nthe world with so few superviolet drafters to balance that. The storms could\nbe natural.”\nOf course, neither of them believed that. Aliviana had become the\nsuperviolet goddess, Ferrilux.\n“I’m sorry, dearest,” she said. “You saved her life and helped her win\nher freedom. How she uses it…”\nAs if there were any meaningful choices after you bound yourself to\ndark forces.\n“I should have raised her better. Told her more,” Corvan said. “But…\nnot tonight. Let’s not… Not tonight.” He forced a smile and set that grief\naside that he might focus on this brief blessing before it too turned to grief.\n“What about Ironfist?”\n“He either is or will soon be on his way to the Chromeria with a heart\nfull of rage. For him and those who love him most, I see only sorrow now.”\nCorvan fell silent. Their last night together, and he was picking at these\nfuture scabs. But he couldn’t help it.\n“Dazen?” he asked, hopefully. As if she wouldn’t have told him right\naway.\n“I tried again. I still couldn’t See him, Corvan.”\nSo either he was wearing a shimmercloak all day every day, or he was\nhidden from her sight by some magic they’d never encountered—which\nwas possible with the enemies he had! Possible, but not likely.\nOr he was dead.\n“One chance in five, you said?” For Aliviana, he meant.\n“She’s a Danavis. They’re a tough breed.” She squeezed his hand."

They’re a tough breed.” She squeezed his hand.\nThere was nothing more to say on that. “Has Kip seen the trap?” he\nasked.\n“No. He’s still marching in the wrong direction. He may save the city.”\n“And lose the war. Dammit. It’s like he read all my books for nothing,”\nCorvan said.\n“Not everyone can be the best general of their time,” she said.\n“By definition I suppose there can only be one.”\nHis wife, his daughter, his best friend, and his ward—it was as if\nOrholam was determined to take every light out of his life.\n“I have something to ask,” the Third Eye said. “Will you give this note\nto Karris?”\n“Of course. What’s it about?”\n“Locusts,” his wife said.\nHe raised his eyebrows, but she said nothing as he tucked it away. She\ndidn’t always intend him to understand. “Very well, then,” he said.\n“I just left things… I was unfair to her, I think.”\n“I’ll tell her so,” he said. They stood for a time, watching the sunset and\nthe sea. She made the sign of the seven, and, unbeliever though he was, he\nmade it, too, tapping heart and eyes and hands: what you believe, what you\nbehold, how you behave—each leading inexorably to the next.\n“Now make love to me, and then go.” She smiled as if to soften the\napparent command. “You have much to do tonight elsewhere. I’ll be fine\nuntil morning without you.”\nAnd then he understood. She thought the assassin was already in the\nroom. She was telling the Shadow that Corvan would be gone soon, that she\nwould be alone and vulnerable, if only he would wait.\nCorvan blew out a long breath, trying to get a hold of himself. She’d\ntold him that if he tried to kill this Shadow, he would die. Period. She had\ntold him the greatest gift he could give her this night was his total attention.\nSo he blocked out his rage, and his indignation that some killer was\nwatching this private moment, and everything but his wife and his love for\nher.\nThey made love, and they shared breath and body. It was tenderness and\ndesperation and clinging and resignation and acceptance. It was joy at what\nthey’d had and sorrow at its brevity. It was golden heartbeats of pure\nunthinking pleasure pierced by iron arrows of grief.\nAfter a long time, after all too brief a time, they held each other. She sat\nin his lap, arms and legs embracing him. She didn’t lie down, though she\nwas winded and sweat glistened on her skin. These were to be her last\nminutes. She wouldn’t waste them in seeking sleep.\nShe touched her forehead to his, and kissed him. Then she reached one\nfinger up to the yellow eye tattooed in luxin on her forehead. It went dark,\nand then frayed and disappeared.\n“I have run the course set before me,” she said. “I have finished the\nrace.” Then she whispered in Corvan’s ear, “Polyhymnia.”\nA lone tear coursed down her cheek, contrasting with the brave smile on"

A glimpse into his own future,\nperhaps, a benediction and a farewell.\nHe rose, tears blinding him, and dressed in silence, strapping Harbinger\non his hip, not trusting his voice, not trusting his rage. His breath came in\nlittle gasps as he struggled for control. When he looked back to her from the\ndoor, she didn’t meet his eyes. She had thrown on a thin robe and sat, legs\nfolded, hands resting in her lap, her back straight and proud.\nHer face as cool and peaceful and beautiful as a statue of the saints, she\nfaced the eastern window, praying, waiting for a sunrise she would never\nsee.\nChapter 64\nIt can’t be that big, was Kip’s first thought as he first saw Dúnbheo in the\nlow light. From his maps and many descriptions of it, Kip knew exactly\nwhat Dúnbheo looked like. But as with so many things in life, there’s a\ndifference between knowing and knowing.\nUnlike most cities, there had been only a few buildings outside the\nwalls. The population of Dúnbheo had shrunk so much over the years—and\nbeen so huge before the Chromeria’s rise—that land inside the walls was\ncheap. The inns and food stalls that had set themselves up outside the walls\nfor the convenience of travelers had been burnt or cannibalized for lumber\nand stone by the Blood Robe besiegers months ago.\nIt made for an odd scene: the attackers set up in a wide crescent around\nthe walls amid the great stumps of all the trees they’d cleared, their boats\nanchored in a neat crescent outside the river gate, and then the vast,\nincomprehensible greenery of the wall itself.\nKip had seen the creation of one of the wonders of the world in\nBrightwater Wall, but the Greenwall surrounding Dúnbheo was something\non a completely different scale. Kip had assumed Greenwall was a screen of\nimpressive trees in front of a wall itself. When told the trees were the wall,\nhe’d thought there must be fortifications stretched between each tree.\nThat was wrong, too.\nMassive sabino cypresses made towers to heaven every thirty paces, and\nthe gaps between them were filled with millennial cypress and other trees,\ntrunk to straining trunk, growing more thickly than should have been\npossible and also more closely to their neighbors. But no branches hung out\ninto the space over the invaders. Every limb had instead grown back into\nthe mass of the wall itself, as if guided by some chelonian intelligence to\nmake it impregnable.\nOver and through all the massive trees grew ivies and vines, further\nbinding the trees together and clogging the spaces between them, but their\nleaves also gave the defenders perfect cover. An archer would part the\nleaves, take a shot through the makeshift murder hole, and then disappear,\nleaving not so much as a target."

An archer would part the\nleaves, take a shot through the makeshift murder hole, and then disappear,\nleaving not so much as a target.\nThe impression of the whole was of a green cataract as far as the eye\ncould see, cascading in every direction as if it were the old gods’ own\nverdant fountain. Flowers even sprouted everywhere, not deigning to accept\nthe mortals’ war going on beneath them.\nIn some places, the ivies had been burnt or pulled down in previous\nsallies, but it had done little. In fact, against the mammoth height of the tree\nwall, the tiny scars only made the efforts of man seem paltry and impotent.\n“Time,” Ferkudi said.\nIn their months fighting together, Ben-hadad had fashioned clocks with\ndeliberately weird intervals for each Nightbringer captain’s superviolet\ndrafter. Kip didn’t need a clock to count out the six-minute-and-thirty-\nseven-second interval they were using today. Ferkudi counted it in his head.\nAll the time. Without apparent distraction or even effort.\nSometimes Kip wanted to kiss the big dope.\nHe threw up a superviolet flare in the predawn gloom.\nFor a long time, nothing seemed to happen. Then Kip saw the answering\nsuperviolet flare. The night mares were in place in the woods.\n“Time,” Ferkudi said.\nAround him, Kip saw men and women silently making the sign of the\nseven, preparing their immortal souls and hoping they wouldn’t find out if\nthey had immortal souls today. Here we go.\nKip gestured, and they released the fire birds. It had taken the will-\ncasters and pyroturges a long time to figure out how to set birds on fire\nwithout actually burning them. But the Ghosts absolutely refused to\nintentionally harm the animals they partnered with. It was war, harm\nhappened, but they did absolutely everything they could to avoid it. The fire\nbirds went up in a broad fan in front of Kip and his lines, perfectly spaced.\nTheir charges burnt for ten seconds, and then winked out.\nBefore they were all gone, four thousand throats roared, and fires went\nup all along Kip’s lines. Narrow trenches filled with pyrejelly had been cut\nbetween each of the widely spaced lines and they lit with a satisfying\nwhoosh in long deep streaks as if a dragon had clawed the forest itself with\ntalons of fire.\nThen each man and woman dipped their torches—two for each—into\nthe flames. Eight thousand torches to make it look as if they had eight\nthousand soldiers, for Kip had ordered that even the camp followers should\nmarch behind the army to appear to be part of it. Everyone could carry a\ncouple of torches.\nThe Blood Robes’ officers would know the numbers were wrong, were\nimpossible—but the men would see those supposedly impossible numbers\nwith their own eyes.\nOnce a man is convinced to believe the impossible, it’s impossible to\nmake him disbelieve it.\nThe pagan army was spread red and black across the floodplain to Kip’s\nsub-red vision.

        "text": "sub-red vision. Only its commanders held torches. General Amrit Kamal,\nthe Lord of the Air who led the enemy, had lined up his people in what had\nbecome a standard battle formation for the Blood Robes: centuries—each\nliterally one hundred men—arrayed in lines. Battalions comprised of six\ncenturies were deployed one hundred men wide and six lines deep. Between\neach two battalions was a century of drafters.\nThese, being so much more rare, were deployed in four lines of twenty-\nfour men each. But only half of each drafting platoon was made up of\ndrafters. Each drafter was paired with a shield bearer whose main duty was\ndefending his drafter with a massive tower shield that took both hands to\nhold. Each shield bearer also carried a pistol, a knife, and a bich’hwa or a\npunch dagger that could be mounted on the wrist without interfering with\ntheir grip. The tower shields had a spiked bottom so they could be stabbed\ninto the ground to provide cover.\nSometimes wights led the drafter centuries, blues or superviolets or\nyellows predominantly. Like the greens, orange and red and sub-red wights\nwere generally uncontrollable and were instead unleashed to fight alone\nwhere they willed.\nKip’s army was facing Kamal’s six battalions and six drafter centuries.\nProbably an elite battalion was being held in reserve back at the camp\nwhere the blurriness of sub-red vision couldn’t even make it out against the\ndarkness. So, just as reported, Kamal had more than four thousand men.\nAgainst Kip’s two thousand. But Kip had the Ghosts.\nTallach came out of the woods behind Kip, wearing his special howdah\nharness. Cruxer floated up into his place with that infuriating grace of his.\nHe’d decided Kip didn’t get to ride into battle alone ever again. Tallach\ndidn’t seem to even notice the additional weight.\nPutting on spectacles, Kip looked a question at Tallach—‘You ready?’—\nand the giant grizzly woofed. He was. Kip mounted the howdah beside\nCruxer, and motioned for the bonfires behind him to be lit. Then Tallach\nstood on his hind legs, lifting Kip and Cruxer high in the air. The bonfire\nbehind them made a huge silhouette for the enemy to see. Then Kip threw\nfire into the air from his own hands, and his forces advanced.\nKip and Tallach advanced more slowly than the rest. No need to put\nhimself at risk too early. They were supposed to be a distraction. He didn’t\nwant to arrive in musket or bow range before the battle was joined. That\nwas the problem with arriving in battle on the back of a huge-ass bear: you\nmade a huge-ass target.\nHis own soldiers were deployed in Kip’s modification of General\nDanavis’s model. The modifications had not been made because Kip\nthought he was an equal of the legend, but because he had an\nembarrassment of riches in having so many drafters. Danavis’s armies had\nmaybe one warrior-drafter for every fifty soldiers.

Kip had one for every\nten, and that wasn’t counting the night mares.\nA trumpet blew amid the enemy lines, and Kip saw the back two lines of\neach of Kamal’s battalions peel off to march to either side of the Blood\nRobes’ already-wide lines. They meant their wider lines to curl around\nKip’s lines and crush them from the sides.\nIt was a pretty standard maneuver when you had twice as many men as\nyour enemy did.\nSo the officers hadn’t been fooled. It meant the Blood Robes were\nsticking with their own battle plan, despite Kip’s gambit with the torches.\nIf Kip wanted his lines to be as wide as theirs, he’d have to literally\nstretch his men thin and meet Kamal’s four-man-deep lines with his own\nlines only two men deep. Their going only four deep was risky. His going\ntwo deep would be insanity.\nIt was a trap, but not the obvious one. No sane commander in his\nposition would try to fight only two men deep.\nInstead, a sane commander would try to punch through the Blood Robe\nlines, hoping to break through the four lines in a sharp move.\nWhat else could he do? He couldn’t match the width of their lines, and\ncouldn’t allow them to turn his flank, so instead he would draw his men in\nto hit their center hard and try to break their lines fast before the encircling\nmaneuver killed them all.\nNot today.\nWhen his Nightbringers reached the appointed places, their commanders\nbellowed, and they stopped dead, as they’d planned.\nExcept that not all of Kip’s men stopped as they’d been commanded.\nBecause glory is to young idiots as a mountain of poppy is to the lotus eater.\nIgnoring the screams of their commanders, several dozen men tore away\nfrom Kip’s lines and ran forward, screaming.\nBecause war is a fat whore who rolls over on her babies in the night.\n“What the hell are those idiots doing?” Cruxer asked.\n“Weeding themselves out of my army,” Kip said, furious.\nThe Turtle-Bear tattoo on his arm lighting up in angry red, Kip hurled\nout his signals, but now in fire: HOLD. HOLD!\nThe men who’d broken away ran, heedless, and all Kip could do was\npray that they died quickly so that their friends didn’t follow them, trying to\nsave them.\nHe could sense others on the verge of breaking. Everyone knew that if\nthey didn’t follow those young fools, the fools would die.\nKip’s commanders were screaming, even firing their muskets in the air\nto try to draw their men’s eyes to them, lest they break.\nThen an explosion rocked the field, and one of the charging idiots\nsimply disappeared in fire as if he’d stood on the barrel of a musket aimed\nat the heavens. An instant later, another hit another of the buried charges\nand was flung skyward. Only half of him landed.\nNot even the war dogs had smelled the charges; the Cwn y Wawr’s dogs\nwere bred to fight, and while they could smell more acutely than any man\nby far, their abilities were wan compared to those of the two scent hounds\nthe will-casters had brought.\nIt was two hounds who would save Kip’s entire army."

That had led their commanders—Kip hadn’t even known\nabout it until the deed was done—to scour the ground three nights in a row,\ndodging patrols and (unknowing at the time) the buried charges in order to\ndiscern the trap.\nKip watched the twenty men die with cold command. He had no pity for\nmen who were willing to trade their friends’ deaths and their commanders’\nplans for their own glory. He watched them die in blood and fire, men\nscreaming with blown-off feet and partial faces. Mostly he noted which\ncharges had been exploded. He had a partial map of them, not a full one, so\nit was probably wasted effort, but you never knew.\nOne fool panicked as he saw his compatriots die. He turned and tried to\nrun back in his own footprints. Another improbably made it through the\nmines and within twenty paces of the enemy lines. Somehow every shot in\nthe first volley of at least twenty muskets had missed the man.\nBut two miracles was as many as a man could ask in one minute. The\nnext volley, guns and magic both, leveled the man as he came within ten\npaces.\nIt had happened soon enough that none of their friends followed them.\nThank Orholam.\nThe killing ground in the middle of the battlefield was limited, and the\nBlood Robes naturally knew exactly how far it extended. It had been their\ntrap, hoping Kip would race into the minefield as he tried to break their\nlines.\nKamal’s Blood Robes stopped their advance in the middle so as not to\ntrample on their own charges, but their broad flanks extended around each\nside. Those continued their enveloping tactics.\nKip’s drafters didn’t waste any time. Those at the center of his line,\nknowing they were against a minefield and not soldiers, hadn’t been\ncarrying many weapons. Instead they’d been lugging slabs of luxin in pairs,\ngreen over yellow, three feet wide and five feet tall. Another crazy invention\nBen-hadad’s corps of engineers had come up with, a portable wall. Under\nmusket fire, the men now stabbed the sections of the portable wall into the\nsoil in rapid succession, from left to right, each section fitting perfectly into\nthe next.\nMeanwhile Kip’s reds threw out long streams of pyrejelly, which a\nmoment later sub-reds set fire to. The killing field was now visibly\ndelineated for Kip’s men: ‘Don’t go in here.’\nBut now the Nightbringers’ flanks, which had stopped, too, faced enemy\nlines deeper than their own, and far wider.\nThey collapsed before they even came in contact with the Blood Robes.\nAs the Blood Robe cavalry advanced, completing its flanking maneuver,\nthe Nightbringers’ torch-carrying camp followers were revealed to be\ncivilians, betrayed by the swelling light of the rising sun as the cavalry\ncame nearer."

The sight of those fleeing did to the\ncavalry what fleeing prey does to any predator. Hundreds surged forward,\neager for killing and plunder. Their commanders didn’t even try to stop\nthem.\n“Hold!” Kip shouted. That was the signal. With the sun nearing dawn,\nhe’d caught sight of a broad form pulling itself out of the river behind the\nBlood Robes.\nTallach tossed his head and Kip sawed at the reins they’d tied to his\njaws. The reins were purely for show. Kip never used reins. The immediacy\nof command would have actually been nice, but the bear wouldn’t stand for\nit.\nKip shot superviolet signals out, and his men started screaming,\ncollapsing back farther. The infantry lines were closing in on the sides, and\nTallach seemed unnerved by the charging men.\n“Hold, Tallach! Hold!” Kip shouted.\nAnd the bear bolted.\nKip dropped his sword and Cruxer his spear, and they simply held on.\nTallach bounded away from his army, fleeing into the forest.\nHe heard a cheer from the Blood Robes as they saw Kip’s army lose its\ncommander.\nIn between surprisingly fluid bounds, Kip saw his gambit unfolding in\nthe forest.\nThey’d put the fleetest of foot at the front of the line—making the young\nmen and women the last people to get to flee from the cavalry. They’d also\narmed them with grenadoes. The civilians had followed orders better than\nthe hotheads in Kip’s lines, and had run all the way to the cover of the forest\nbefore turning and throwing the grenadoes.\nSome ran too slow, though, and were run down. Some panicked and\ndidn’t stop at all, forgetting their weapons and their orders, but Kip had\nfigured that would happen. He’d armed them with grenadoes mostly to\nbolster the courage of those who were the bait for the trap.\nNonetheless, Kip saw a number of them turn and hurl the hand-size\nbombs at their pursuers. One hit a tree not two paces away from herself, and\nshe was shredded by shrapnel. Another hit a horse and blew off its leg. Its\ncareening body planted its rider headfirst into another tree, crunching him\ndown to half his original height. Others missed and turned to run again.\nNot far into the woods, which were significantly darker in the dawning\nlight than the treeless floodplain, the night mares sprang their trap.

Tallach’s path cut back into the forest, and\nthen along its front edge, hopefully just out of sight of the Blood Robes on\nthe plain.\nOne straggler from the cavalry was slow enough to be in their path, and\nTallach elongated his bounds and slashed one huge paw as they went behind\nthe horse. His blade-lined claws caught only the head and shoulders of the\nrider. Conn Arthur hated killing horses.\nThe horse staggered for one step, and then stood. The rider slumped and\ntumbled out of the saddle, his head and one arm torn completely off. Tallach\nhad barely even broken stride.\nThey emerged from the woods, hundreds of paces west of where they’d\nentered.\nThe disposition of the battlefield had changed utterly in the minute or\nthree Kip and Cruxer had been gone. As ordered, the Nightbringers had\ncollapsed into a tight-packed square. They were surrounded on all sides by\nthe Blood Robes, and held only because of the luxin walls they’d so\nhurriedly assembled.\nMen deeper in the formation were reloading muskets and passing them\nforward again. It was perhaps the first time in military history that muskets\nwere being used to good effect after the first shock of an infantry charge.\nBut the numbers were still too lopsided. They’d held out this long only\nbecause the cavalry had been drawn away.\nAnd now the Blood Robes’ reinforcement battalion was coming in.\nTheir cavalry was lowering their lances and charging.\nA signal flare went up from a wight near the killing field.\nThe wight had disarmed the Blood Robes’ explosives. Dammit.\nKip’s timing was off by just that much. Lorcan had needed to hit them\nthirty seconds ago.\nBut then he saw Lorcan. Somehow, in the screaming and their tunnel\nvision toward the enemies in front of them, the Blood Robes hadn’t seen\nhim yet.\nThe huge bear plunged into the back ranks of the infantry\nreinforcements running across the plain. He sank deep, deep into the heart\nof the infantry formation before they even saw him. They were jogging\nforward, the front lines already breaking into a run, so in moments it\nbecame utter chaos.\nMen shrieking in fear, Lorcan roaring, and metal rending with every\nswipe of his big paws. Men were hurled bodily into the air. Commanders\nshouted unheard over the melee.\nMeanwhile the charging cavalry hurtled across the killing ground. Not a\nsingle charge went off. But that side of the square was ready for them. A\ncloud of black smoke was vomited out into the air, streaked with green and\ngolden lights and lit from within by streams of liquid fire.\nThe first rank of the cavalry didn’t even make it to the Nightbringers’\nline, obliterated by hot lead and magic, and the second rank was\nappreciably thinned. The third rank hurtled past them and the fourth and\nfifth had to leap over the fallen.\nBut many made it through. They crashed into the luxin wall, lances\nextended.\nThey’d expected a shield wall, though, not an actual wall. Each section"

Each section\nwas not only physically linked to the others on each side, but also braced\nagainst the force of their charge with long diagonal supports.\nSome few sections buckled, but most held.\nMen flipped off horses brought to a dead halt, and toppled into the\nsquare, where the Nightbringers waited with axes and daggers.\nThree red wights riding in the fourth rank of the cavalry leapt off their\nhorses as they crashed into the mass of their friends and foes. Tumbling\nthrough the air, they blasted through the petty attempts to swat them aside\n—Kip had set the fastest drafters to knock grenadoes out of the air.\nWhen the wights landed, they hurled death in every direction. But each\nwight was quickly brought down.\nThe last ranks of cavalry broke off the charge, seeing they’d only cripple\nand kill their own.\nBut that was when Kip and Tallach entered the fray.\nThey hit the cavalry from the rear quarter.\nThe men turned to see that their own infantry, which was supposed to\nsupport them, had melted behind them instead—and two giant grizzlies\nwere tearing them apart. The other battalions’ cavalry had gone into the\nwoods and not reappeared.\nIt was too many shocks at once for men trapped between a wall and a\ngiant grizzly ridden by a man throwing fire down on their heads. Panic\nspread faster than the flames.\nThey broke in every direction.\nTallach gave a few more swipes at those nearest him, then halted at\nKip’s signal, and, as quickly as it had begun, Kip’s fight was over. Now he\nwas a general again. He began throwing flaming signals at once.\nThe tight square unfolded, pursuing the Blood Robes. Most of them\nheaded toward the forest, where the night mares awaited. A few were\nheaded too far east or west, but Kip’s men drove them as sheepdogs drive\nsheep: a little barking here, a little nipping at the heels there, and they\nturned back to where Kip wanted them, like mindless animals.\nThe other Blood Robes ran toward their own camp and the walls. Kip\nsent more than half his forces after those, under Derwyn Aleph. He knew\nwhat to do.\nLorcan was deep in their camp. It wasn’t where Kip wanted him, but he\nwas beyond orders now.\nKip only hoped that in its rage, the great bear wouldn’t kill any\nNightbringers.\nHe started toward the city walls himself, and the actual horses and\nponies of the night mares fell in with him.\nA rout had started from the Blood Robes’ camp. General Kamal’s staff,\nhis bodyguards, their servants and families—these were the people who\ncould see the noose dropping over their necks. They knew that if they got\ntrapped against the river, they’d not stand a chance.\nSo they ran the other way. If they could make it past the hulking form of\nGreenwall and its archers, they could escape.\nIt became a race, Kip and the night mares trying to head them off before\nthey cleared the walls."

The archers lining the walls rained down shots on the fleeing Blood\nRobes, mostly missing, but killing a few and injuring more, slowing those\nwho stopped to help them. The line elongated and separated completely.\nThose with horses abandoned the others.\nBut Dúnbheo was vast, and Kip and the Mighty had the angle. They\nreached it a hundred paces before the end of the wall.\nNow if those idiots up on the wall can just not shoot us.\nIt was a thought without rancor. Men long bored and suddenly excited\nwho held weapons in their hands could get careless with whom they pointed\nthem at.\nOn reaching the wall, Tallach wheeled and stood on his hind legs. He\nroared fury.\nTallach didn’t want to be here. He wanted to be with his brother. Musket\nfire and explosions from the camp—and the lack of Lorcan’s reappearance\n—didn’t bode well for how Conn Arthur’s brother was doing.\n“Halt, halt!” the man mounted at the lead shouted to his bodyguards.\n‘Man’ might have been generous. He was a blue wight, dressed in gaudy\ngold robes, skin sparkling with facets like snake scales.\n“Lord Guile! Lord Kip Guile!” the wight shouted, holding his hand up.\nTallach dropped back to all fours and roared again. The Mighty\nthundered in to surround Kip even as Lord Kamal’s own bodyguards\nsurrounded him in a sudden flood.\n“Lord Guile! I, Amrit Kamal, Lord of the Air, do challenge you to a\nduel!”\nHis men were hurriedly reloading muskets they’d discharged in the\nfighting.\n“Yeah. No,” Kip said.\nThe Mighty fired their muskets immediately, perforating the Lord of the\nAir in as many places as possible. Waves of fire and missiles followed\nbefore Lord Kamal’s bodyguards could counterattack.\nThat was enough for everyone else behind Lord Kamal. They doubled\nback and, fleeing, made easy prey for the Mighty. The Mighty hadn’t been\nable to do much fighting in this battle, and they were eager to make up for\nlost time.\nChapter 65\n“This, finally, is a cruelty beyond me,” Andross Guile said. “You deserve it,\nbut this is beyond what I am willing to do. You can’t be released, and I\nwon’t punish you any longer. How do you wish to die?”\nGavin had felt a change in the air. It could mean only one thing. His cell\nopening.\nHe hadn’t spoken to the dead man in days. Didn’t want those cold\ncomforts. And the days or weeks had blended together. Another thunk of\nbread falling, another slice of crust against black luxin. Another sleep.\nNightmares passed to hallucinations, like paired dancers spinning a\ngciorcal. Gavin had no energy, couldn’t plan, couldn’t concentrate. The\nisolation was driving him slowly mad.\nBut now he could hear his father breathing.

From old habit, Gavin\nlooked in sub-red, and he could see the man so brightly (though in white\ntones rather than red) it almost blinded him. Gavin looked down, blinking.\nHe didn’t want to laugh—it would seem proof of his insanity—but he\ncouldn’t help it. His father’s words were an exact echo of his own thoughts,\nagain, regarding his brother: You’re too dangerous to release, so I’ll\nimprison you. Your imprisonment is too cruel, so I must kill you.\nHis father had arrived at the logical conclusion much faster than he had,\nthough. Give him that.\n“Fuck him,” the dead man said. It was the first time he’d spoken in a\nwhile.\nGavin said, “I’ve murdered hundreds. Maybe thousands. I don’t know if\nthere is an appropriate method of execution for me.”\n“I was thinking starvation. Or poison. I can’t imagine I’ll ever have to\nuse this cell again, so either would serve. I could simply leave you here to\nrot.”\nAs I did my brother. Or didn’t.\nCould you be guilty of things you thought you were letting continue but\nreally weren’t?\nAndross said, “I’m going to make a light. I would see your face one last\ntime. Don’t humiliate yourself and embarrass me again by trying anything.”\nThe dead man said, “Listen to me. You can escape. This is your chance.”\nA moment later, light bloomed. Gavin squinted against the glare, but the\nlight itself didn’t command his attention. First, eyes averted from the\nlantern his father produced, he saw the black luxin. There was barely any\nreflection off that eerie black. The light that touched it simply died. He cast\nno secondary shadow from refracted light, and his primary shadow was\nbarely visible, greater darkness against darkness.\nThen, pupils constricting, he turned to his father.\n“This was a mistake,” Andross Guile said. “I don’t want to remember\nyou like this, this hideous ghost of what you once were.”\n“Too late now, isn’t it? I got my memory from you, after all. You don’t\nforget, either,” Gavin said.\n“I suppose not,” Andross said.\n“If you were simply going to put me down like a mad dog, you’d have\ndone it without this much bother,” Gavin said. “You came down to say\nsomething.”\nAndross smirked, but only for a moment. “I suppose I haven’t dealt with\nmadmen enough. Losing your wits doesn’t mean losing your wit, eh?”\nThe dead man grew more insistent. “Why aren’t you listening to me?\nAre you frightened, Gavin? Gavin Guile? Frightened?”\n“Frightened only of what I might do,” Gavin said below his breath.\n“What’s that?” his father asked.\nLouder, as if merely repeating himself, Gavin said, “I’ll take that as a\ncompliment.”\n“How soon did your mother know?” Andross asked. He meant after\nSundered Rock.\n“Instantly.”\nAndross cursed. “Of course she did.”\n“Gavin,” the dead man whispered, “you have a way out.”\n“When did you figure it out, then?” Gavin asked."

We\nhad figured out that you—the victor of Sundered Rock—had drafted black\nluxin, of course. I chalked up all the changes in you to that, and to killing\nyour brother. Would have shaken anyone. But then you never even asked\nabout doing the ceremony again. I didn’t believe that you could have\nforgotten that.”\n“The Prism ceremony?”\nAndross waved it away. He wasn’t interested in explaining. “And then,\nonce I could accept that you’d fooled me, it all became obvious. Audacious,\nthough. You played it perhaps as well as it could have been played.”\n“Mother coached me.”\n“Of course she did.”\n“And when you figured it out, there was nothing for you to do but go\nalong with it,” Gavin guessed.\nAndross turned his palms up in a small surrender. “Gavin was dead and\nothers believed you were he, so what could be done? I could mourn him. I\ncould make you pay, but what would that accomplish?”\nAs if you didn’t make me pay.\n“We have a way out,” the dead man said.\n“I’m sorry, father.”\nAndross Guile looked at Gavin as if he were suddenly speaking in some\nforeign tongue. “We’ll pretend you didn’t say that. I came here for one\nreason.” He stopped, shook his head. “No, what am I doing here?”\nHe’s lonely.\nThe thought tore through Gavin. For some reason, looking at this\nmonster, Gavin felt a sudden unwonted compassion.\nHe’s lonely. Mother left him. His sons are dead. He’s recovered his\nhealth and vitality, but it is nothing to him. His last son insane, and even\nKip has fled.\n“Let’s play a game,” Gavin said.\n“A game?” Andross asked skeptically.\n“You always loved games. You and your Nine Kings. You can’t tell me\nthat you haven’t missed matching wits with me. Witless as I may be.”\nGavin grinned.\n“What kind of game?” Andross asked, suspicious but obviously\nintrigued.\n“Gavin!” the dead man said. “You don’t need to put yourself at his\nmercy. Andross Guile’s mercy. Andross. Guile’s. Mercy.”\nGavin said, “You tell me about some of the problems facing you, and I\ntry to guess what you’re doing about them. Of course, you have to give me\nenough relevant information to give me a chance. We’ll call the game,\nWhich Guile Rules the Seven Satrapies Better?”\n“There are several weaknesses to this game,” Andross said.\n“There are weaknesses to every game,” Gavin countered.\nAndross obviously missed sparring. He didn’t think too long before\nsaying, “To clarify: in the game, you’re guessing what I have done, or will\ndo, not what you would do in my place? After all, we have… somewhat\ndifferent strengths.”\n“Exactly,” Gavin said. Anything to keep from going insane. Anything to\ngive himself more chances. Anything to make him valuable to the old man\nmight give him an opening."

Anything to make him valuable to the old man\nmight give him an opening.\nGrowing more irritated, the dead man said, “You don’t need to do all\nthis.”\n“I can play this game,” Andross said. “You know who the White King\nis?”\n“Koios White Oak, unhappily back from the grave.”\n“And you know what he is?” Andross asked.\nGavin stared at him blankly, not sure what his father was asking. “A\npolychrome? A man remade with incarnitive luxins?”\nAndross sighed. “Are you playing dumb, or did you cut yourself so\ndeeply?”\n“I don’t know what you mean,” Gavin said. This was not starting well.\nAndross sighed. “I was hoping you might be useful, in this one thing at\nleast.” He waited, apparently to see if he’d called Gavin’s bluff about being\nignorant. Then, nonplussed, he said, “You are not the only man alive who\ncan draft black luxin. Merely the only one on the Chromeria’s side.”\n“Koios is a black drafter,” Gavin said as it dawned on him. Of course.\n“He’s taken your old path to power. Except, of course, he doesn’t glean\nhis powers from already dying drafters and wights.”\nMy old path to power? “So you think I’m the Black Prism, too?”\n“Too?” Andross frowned. “You didn’t tell Karris about this.”\n“No. Orholam, no. I didn’t even remember any of it then. I…” It cut him\nto think about her. It was impossible. Hopeless.\n“Then who else calls you that?” Andross asked.\n“Never mind that.” Telling his father about the dead men was a sure way\nto cut this conversation short. His father would think him mad in truth.\nAndross looked amused to have this imprisoned wretch tell him what to\ndo, but he let it go. “I more thought of you as a light-splitting black drafter.\nIf you want a more grandiose title, I suppose the Black Prism fits.”\n“Are you sure?” Gavin asked.\n“Whatever do you mean?”\n“About me. I don’t… I don’t remember any of that. I didn’t seek out\npeople to kill them for their magic. It wasn’t like that. Was it?” Gavin said.\nHe thought he’d done all that to save people. That he’d put himself in\nharm’s way for the satrapies. That he’d been at least a little… good.\n“You really have forgotten it all, haven’t you?” Andross said. “What’s\nthe alternative? That you’re Lucidonius come again? You’re the\nLightbringer?”\n“Mother said I was a true Prism…”\n“Your mother loved you very, very much. But you were her last child,\nand you were a blind spot for her.”\nThere was something odd in how he’d said that. Irony aside, though:\nGavin was Felia Guile’s blind spot?

There is still some\nspark of you left in that shell, isn’t there? Well, I had planned to tell you\neventually. No time like at your end, I suppose. Do you remember that\nprophecy? The day the Mirror Janus Borig told you that you would draft\nblack luxin? She told me, ‘Of red cunning, the youngest son, cleaves father\nand father and father and son.’ You remember?”\n“I remember.”\n“There was this librarian. She had access to some documents we needed.\nWith your mother’s permission, I seduced her. Naturally, I was careful. She\nshouldn’t have gotten pregnant. She swore she’d take the tea to abort it if\nnecessary. She lied. Showed up in our camp pregnant and with demands.\nYour brother didn’t take it well. She fled.”\nThere were so many things wrong with what he’d just said that Gavin\ncouldn’t even begin to parse them. Andross had cheated on mother? And\nwhat pathetic lie was this that she’d approved of it? She would never do\nthat!\n“What documents would be worth such a thing?”\n“It doesn’t matter now.”\n“You’re certain the girl wasn’t lying?”\n“I presumed she was lying, of course. But over the course of time, I’ve\nbecome sure she wasn’t.”\nGavin was incredulous. “Are you telling me I have a brother out there?”\n“When she sent you your note, she sent me one, too.”\n“Sent me a note? I never got a note—You can’t mean—Lina?!”\nAndross said, “She took the name Katalina Delauria when she fled,\napparently. Lina. Kip isn’t your brother’s son. He’s mine.”\nOut of all the things that should have leapt to Gavin’s mind, what he\nthought first was how odd it had been that when his mother had come to\nGarriston for her Freeing, she hadn’t tried to meet Kip. Hadn’t so much as\ninquired after her only grandson.\nBecause she knew. She knew Kip wasn’t her grandson. She knew he was\nAndross’s bastard, and she had no interest in having that rubbed in her face.\nDear Orholam. Kip.\nThe funny thing was, it didn’t really matter, did it?\nInstead of being the boy’s uncle and pretending to be his father, he was\nactually his half brother, acting as his father.\nIf anything, that should make things easier, shouldn’t it? It wouldn’t be,\n‘I’m not your father, and by the way, I killed your real father and took his\nplace.’ Now it would be, ‘I’m your half brother.’ Full stop. Kip already\nknew that the Gavin who was still alive had killed his own brother. Without\nthe weight of being the real Gavin’s own son, Kip would be freed of a son’s\nburden to avenge his dead father.\nBut then, it didn’t matter regardless. Gavin was here. He was going to\ndie in this black cell.\n“This doesn’t have to happen,” the dead man said.\n“Are you going to tell Kip?” Gavin asked."

As for a second time—you’re\ncounting when he attacked me on the ship after the Battle of Ru? He was\ntrying to kill me, if you recall. I was only defending myself, and I was in the\ngrip of red.

This whole conversation. Give\nme so many things to think about that I’d slip up. Orholam’s balls, father. If\nyou wanted to know where the knife was, why didn’t you just ask?”\nAndross didn’t deny anything. “I have an island, off Melos. Small house\nthere. Excellent though small library, including many forbidden books.\nStocked with enough provisions for you to stay there for years. Impossible\nto approach if you don’t have the chart, though. Terrible reefs. You go into\nexile there. I’ll even let you take a couple of slaves. But you never leave,\nand you never try to send a letter out. You’re dead to the world, you\nunderstand?”\n“And in return, I give you the Blinding Knife?”\n“You really have no idea what it is, do you? We can’t make Prisms\nwithout it, son. The Seven Satrapies will dissolve. The False Prism’s War\nwill look like a village fair compared to what comes next.”\n“You can balance manually, by dictate. It’s been done before. The\nsatrapies can stand.”\n“We’re already doing that. It’s failing. We don’t have enough people\nobeying to make up for those who don’t. What happens when half the\nsatrapies are pagan? When you’re a blue drafter and a firestorm lays low\nyour village because the Chromeria’s suggestions are ignored, will you\nobey their call next year to stop drafting blue so that those sub-red bastards\nwho killed your family will be safe?”\n“Maybe the Chromeria deserves to fall,” Gavin said.\n“Oh, most certainly. Our regime is the absolute worst way to rule, except\nfor all the others that have been tried. The Chromeria is an idea, son, and if\nit’s exposed as a hollow one, civilization falls.

Would Andross really let Gavin go? Would he trust\nthat he could smuggle Gavin away from the Chromeria itself? What if the\nsmuggling failed?

We must find it.”\n“There’s only one? Can’t you make another? I mean, who made it in the\nfirst place?”\n“The luxiats have stood in the way of previous attempts to make another.\nIt’s a holy relic. Maybe Lucidonius made it. Maybe Karris Atiriel. Maybe\nthe one we know was a much later replica. But the luxiats’ grandstanding\ndoesn’t matter. There’s a key ingredient in the Blinder’s Knife that is\nextinct.”\nOf course.\n“White luxin,” Gavin said. He cursed. The dead man was a liar—or at\nleast wrong.\n“Indeed. The stories say that before Vician’s Sin, things were different.\nDrafters of white luxin were born every generation. A piece like the\nBlinder’s Knife was a stunning achievement, but not unique. In the\nintervening centuries, all of the others have been lost.”\n“So if you could find even one white drafter or find one piece of white\nluxin from an earlier era, you could make a new knife? So surely you have\nsuch a knife somewhere, just waiting for a bit of white luxin?”\n“No,” Andross admitted. “It was tried. There’s a level of unity of will\nthat couldn’t be achieved by any team, not even one trying to save the\nworld. A blinding knife has to be created by one person. He or she has to be\na full-spectrum polychrome and a superchromat to handle the intricacies of\nbalancing that kind of magic.”\n“You mean a person like me.”\n“Now you understand,” Andross said.\n“So that’s the real reason you didn’t expose me, didn’t kill me.

You kept\nme alive just so I could make you a new knife!” Of course there had been\nanother reason, and one tied to Andross Guile’s own well-being. “But you\nnever so much as hinted about this.”\n“I criticized your brute-force drafting,” Andross said. “I hoped it would\ninspire you to learn more delicate work.”\n“You asshole!”\n“I thought we had at least another five years to get things in place.”\n“Why not just tell me?” Gavin asked, though he should have known\nbetter.\n“If I told you we absolutely needed you to craft an instrument which\nwould allow you to be replaced, you would know that until you crafted it,\nyou could do anything you pleased, anything at all, and we would not only\nnot be able to oppose you, we would have to help and protect you. Even\nOrea agreed we had to keep that knowledge from you. And of course, this\nwas all speculative anyway, contingent on us rediscovering white luxin—\nand you being able to draft it if we did. But even the hope of such a thing\nwould have put tremendous power in your hands, if you’d known about it.”\nIt was like being punched in the stomach after already having had the\nwind knocked out of you. Gavin had been so consumed with keeping his\nown secrets that he had never pried into theirs. He hadn’t noticed that\nthey’d also avoided talking about the Prism ceremony, because he’d been so\nterrified of their discovering his ignorance.\nHe’d been like a wayward youth, sneaking out late and getting drunk,\nthinking his parents must never know, thinking them fools who had never\nbeen young themselves, while they watched it all and hoped he grew up\nsooner rather than later.\nBut there was some puerile protest left in him. “If the knife was so\nimportant, why did you bring it to war against me? It makes no sense. Why\nwould the High Luxiats allow you to endanger it like that?”\n“Gavin was made promachos. They couldn’t refuse him.”\n“You mean they couldn’t refuse you, armed with a promachos,” Gavin\nshot back.\nAndross tipped his head and shrugged, acknowledging the compliment\nand the truth of it.\n“That doesn’t answer why. Why would you take it out there? You were\ngoing to kill me with it?”\nAndross Guile sighed. His piercing gaze rested heavy on Gavin. “We\nwere going to try to save you.”\n“Save me?”\n“I was becoming an authority on black luxin. Your mother and I started\nsecretly studying it as soon as Janus Borig told us that you would become a\nblack drafter. Fascinating stuff, about which the world is clogged with\nsuperstition and misinformation. But this isn’t the time for a lecture.\n“In sum, your mother and I hoped that if we stabbed you—of all people\n—if we stabbed a black drafter with the Blinder’s Knife, that you would\nsurvive it. Probably you would survive bereft of your powers, true, but if\nyou can save a mad dog, you don’t mourn that you have to break its fangs\nto do so.”\nGavin felt sick.

It had taken his colors. It had also taken his color\nvision—Blinder’s Knife indeed. But it had left him alive. Somehow, the\nknife had separated his powers from his life. His parents’ hopes and their\nresearch had borne fruit—only too late for him, too late for them, and too\nlate for the satrapies.\n“The knife doesn’t take away the black, though,” the dead man said,\nbreaking his silence. “Nothing can take away black luxin from you. The\nabyss lives in you.”\nIf Gavin believed his father, and his own will-cast reflections, his own\npast self and the evidence in front of his own eyes, he had been on the\nwrong side all along.\nThe Prisms’ War really had been the False Prism’s War.\nIt had been his fault, utterly. All of it. From the massacre of the White\nOak family to the Battle of Blood Ridge to the burning of Garriston to the\ncoming fall of the Seven Satrapies.\nHe hadn’t been caught up in his brother’s and father’s schemes to purge\nthe Seven Satrapies of their enemies. He wasn’t the victim. He’d cast\nhimself as the aggrieved party, but of what had he been the victim? Being a\nyounger brother?\nThe real Gavin had been no saint, either, sure. In fact, maybe he’d been\na villain, too. But he’d tried to save Dazen.\nFor all his flaws—and there had been many—his big brother had tried to\nsave Dazen.\nAnd in return, Dazen had killed him and broken the empire.\n“You see what the old man’s doing,” the dead man said. “Don’t you?\nHe’s steeling himself to kill you. Or at least to abandon you here and never\ncome back until you die. He’s saying farewell.”\nAndross said, “All this devastation, caused by one bitter librarian who\nseduced your brother in a vain attempt at revenge on me, and then stole the\nknife while he slept. That was why I wasn’t at Sundered Rock. I was going\nafter her and the knife. I’d heard she had people in Blood Forest. Never\nguessed she’d double back to Tyrea. Smart, going back to the very center of\nthe devastation. I never figured she’d be that canny, or that a woman with a\ntreasure literally worth all the gold in the Seven Satrapies would keep it in a\ncloset in a shack. Never figured you’d stab yourself with the knife and then\njump in the sea, either.”\n“Lot of inconvenient surprises for all of us in this,” Gavin said\nsarcastically.\nAndross waved it away. He wasn’t interested in revisiting that. “Tell me,\nat Sundered Rock, if Gavin had held the Blinder’s Knife, would he have\nhad a chance to use it on you?”\n“Yes,” Gavin said.\n“Don’t you see?” the dead man whispered. “He’s getting all his last\nquestions answered. This is the end, Gavin.”\n“That bitch.” Andross sighed. He was preparing to go.\n“Damn you!” the dead man said. “Draft black! Kill him! Let your hatred"

Let your hatred\nmake you strong for once!”\n“Poison, I think,” Andross said. “Starvation is easier for me, but only in\nthe short term. I should regret it later, I think, if I weren’t as humane as\npossible.”\n“I don’t believe you,” Gavin said. “What about our game?”\nAndross just shook his head.\n“You don’t have any equals,” Gavin insisted. “You don’t have anyone to\ntalk to. You’re not going to kill me. You’re too lonely.”\nAndross said, “Goodbye, son.” He picked up his lantern.\n“You cretin!” the dead man said. “You worm. You spineless !\nRaka! We can get out!”\n“Father, tell me you’ll come visit.” Gavin was barely hanging on. He\ncouldn’t bear the darkness again.\nAndross hesitated. “No, Dazen. It hurts too much. No games. The poison\nwill be in your next meal. And in every meal until you eat and die.”\n“Draft black! Kill him!” And suddenly, the dead man’s voice took on\ncavernous depths and thunderous tones that reverberated into realms\nbeyond human ken. “I won’t be imprisoned forever!”\n“I REFUSE! NON SERVIAM!” Gavin roared at the wall, and the\ndarkness, but his shout was as much fear as it was defiance.\nHis father looked at him, shouting at a wall like a madman. There was a\ntremendous sadness and resignation on his face. He folded his arms. “You\nknow… for a moment this conversation… It was almost enough to make\nme forget…”\nNo. Orholam, no.\nAndross said, “There’s one last thing I wanted to tell you, though. Did\nyou ever wonder why I picked your older brother to be the Prism and not\nyou?”\nStill recovering from his terror and confusion—had the dead man said\nhe wouldn’t be imprisoned? as if they were separate?—Gavin said, “He was\nthe eldest. You needed to make someone Prism immediately.”\n“Triply wrong. First, I’m a younger brother myself; you think I care\nabout primogeniture? Second, I had all the time I needed—and third, that\nisn’t why you believed I picked him, anyway, was it?”\nGavin swallowed, and said quietly, “Because he was your favorite.\nBecause he was like you.”\n“Half-wrong.”\nThe dead man whispered now, his voice low, gravelly, menacing, “Do\nyou want to be in here with me forever? I won’t make it pleasant.”\n“Which half?” Gavin asked. “No one is like you?” Arrogant old cancer.\nHe was right about that, but that only made him worse.\nAndross said, “I fell in love with Felia, not some woman who was a\nmirror of me. Of course I searched her out for her pedigree, for her family’s\nlineage of drafters, for their intelligence and hers. Those were all\nprerequisites.

I felt I owed it to you to give you a mother as\nexcellent as your father is, not just some beauty or heiress or noblewoman.\nBut there were other possibilities.\n“However, it was your mother I fell in love with, because I realized she\nhad strengths where I had weaknesses. She had not just a mind, but also a\nheart. She had wisdom, and discernment, but she also had compassion. I did\nnot. Do not.\n“Your brother Gavin was more like me than even I am. He was hard and\ncold and egocentric. Charismatic, too. Better looking than you, a little. But\nwith no sense of others. Like a baby who forgets you exist when you play\nhide-and-peek and is surprised each time when you reappear, Gavin forgot\nto care about people unless they were directly in front of him. Everyone\naround him thought they were the center of his world whilst they were\naround him, but as soon as they walked away—usually having given him\nwhat he wanted—he forgot about their concerns. About his promises to\nthem. I chose Gavin to become the Prism, Dazen, because he was very good\nat getting what we needed. But I also chose him for another and far more\nimportant reason.”\n“And what’s that?” Gavin asked bitterly.\n“Because usually, after seven years, the Prism dies.”\n“What?” Gavin breathed.\n“By choosing your brother, I was consigning him to death, so I swore I\nwould spend as much of his last seven years with him as possible. Dazen, I\nchose him to die because you were my favorite. You always were.”\n“You’re lying.” Gavin’s knees weakened, and he crumpled to the floor.\n“You had all the strengths of your mother, and most of mine. You were\nthe me I would have chosen to be.”\n“You ignored me. You despised me.”\n“Your brother was dangerous. He needed me if he was to have any\nchance of becoming a moral leader or even a decent human being. You, on\nthe other hand, were destined to be upright. You erred, but you were always\nthe son who ended up doing the right thing… had not the madness taken\nyou. Had I understood what black luxin would do to you, I would have\ndone everything differently. Perhaps I would have chosen you to be Prism\nfirst, and let you die young and pure, before this madness took you. I did the\nbest I could with what I knew.”\n“I hate you,” Gavin said.\n“And I loved you, Dazen. And you betrayed me. Hiding your identity\nfrom me? For all those years? Every day was a twist of the knife, another\ningratitude heaped on the rest. Another day of spitting on my sacrifices. But\nI was right about you. You’re useless, broken, worthless, and used up now,\nbut for a long time, you were magnificent. You were the greatest Prism this\nworld has known.”\n“Strike him down. It’s our last chance,” the dead man begged.\nGavin’s breaths came like little fires into his lungs. The black luxin was\nright there, burning molten under his fingertips. He could use it now.

Even if he lost a little piece of himself, what was\nlosing a few memories against losing his very life?\nAndross lifted the lantern and stared at Gavin as he readied himself to\ngo.\n“You can still draft black luxin, can’t you?” Andross asked.\n“Yes,” Gavin hissed. It was so close.\n“Kill him! Kill him!” the dead man screamed.\n“And yet you haven’t,” Andross said.\nSurely next there would be some gibe about Gavin’s weakness, his lack\nof will. All of Gavin’s hatred and fear and the long years of resentment\nagainst his father raced to his fingertips, but they were outrun by pity. A\nman who has strength but no love is worse than dead.\nAndross Guile shook his head, astounded. Each word clear and slow, he\nsaid, “Imprisoned. Dying. Furious. And yet you won’t use the black. Not\neven against me.”\n“This is death. His or yours,” the dead man said.\n“You see?” Andross Guile said with a sad little quirk toward a grin. “I\nwas right about you.”\nThe lantern snicked shut, and Gavin was plunged into the final darkness.\nChapter 66\nBy the time Tallach and Kip made it to the Blood Robe camp, the battle was\nvirtually over. But battles don’t end at all the way Kip had once imagined.\nHe’d thought battles ended all at once: there’s a winner, the losers run away,\nand the winners pick the corpses clean of loot.\nIt wasn’t like that. This battle was over. The day had been won. But\nthere was still a lot of killing and dying to do. There were even heroics.\nKip could see that a Blood Robe soldier with a spinning spear was\nfacing off against a dozen of the Nightbringers, and had them down to a\nstalemate. The bodies of four of their comrades lay on the ground, two still,\nand two still writhing.\nKip gestured, and Ben-hadad rode over to take care of it. Ben-hadad\nlofted the double crossbow he’d designed. It was a fearsome weapon. The\nbows were made of scrimshawed sharana ru: sea demon bone.\nAside from its scarcity, sea demon bone was hard to work with because\nwill was necessary to its use, and will itself was so variable, so bows made\nentirely of the stuff were impossibly inaccurate. The bows that did use it,\nlike Winsen’s, used it as one compound of several, and used will only to\nmake it easier to string the bow, not during drawing or firing. At the same\ntime, using a crossbow from horseback was usually stupid because drawing\nthe string required either a crank, or a lot of strength and a stirrup: a crank\nwas slow, and bracing a stirrup against the ground to draw was\nincompatible with riding.\nBen-hadad had surmounted both difficulties by bringing them together.\nHis will softened the sea demon bone bow while he drew the bolts back.\nFor the next step, he’d designed a pressure gauge. Using his will, he\ntightened the bow until the gauges turned blue. With this, he could shoot ten"

With this, he could shoot ten\nto fifteen bolts in a minute, and he thought he would get better with\npractice.\nWinsen had scoffed at such speed, until Ben-hadad pointed the loaded\ncrossbow at him. In a blink, Winsen nocked and drew an arrow, pointing it\nat Ben-hadad’s forehead.\nOne didn’t want to get in an insanity fight with Winsen.\nBut Ben-hadad merely stared at him, unblinking. The moment stretched.\nWinsen’s arm started trembling from holding the incredible tension.\nThen his whole back and shoulders shook from the pressure of holding the\narrow drawn. Winsen wasn’t tall, but his bow, of which he was a master,\nrequired incredible draw strength.\nThen Winsen lowered the bow to let out the tension with a grunt. “Point\nmade,” he said. “I suppose there are times a crossbow could be handy.”\nThen he grinned at Ben-hadad.\n“You can call her Grace,” Ben-hadad said.\n“Grace?” Kip had asked. “Why not the Mighty Thruster?”\n“You all are never going to let that go, are you?” Ben-hadad said.\n“Never,” they said in a chorus.\nBut this day, Ben-hadad offered Grace to the heroic Blood Robe\nsurrounded by the dead and wounded and impossible odds—offered it by\npointing it at his face and speaking first. “Put down the spear, and live a\nslave,” Ben-hadad said. “Or hold it and die. You have a count of five. Four.\nThree. Two.”\nThe man screamed and charged. “Light cannot be—”\nBen-hadad’s heavy bolt punched through his armor and he pitched\nfacedown.\nOne of the Nightbringers behind him in the circle went white as a sheet\nand grabbed his groin.\nBen-hadad cursed. “You thought it would be a good idea to stand\ndirectly behind a man attacking me? Nine hells, man!”\nBut the man didn’t crumple as a wounded man would. Instead he pulled\nat his tunic and trousers, and found a hole. He let out a little uncertain\nlaugh. “Shaved my balls!”\nHis friends laughed. Ben-hadad just shook his head. “Be happy I didn’t\nuse the fire bolt.”\nHe left them to their japes. War is absurd. Those men had lost friends in\nthe last five minutes, and yet had forgotten it for a moment: woodsmen and\nfarm boys once again, joking now about whether their friend’s balls had\ndropped.\nAnd everywhere it was similar. People were playing out what were\npossibly the last moments of their lives as if they didn’t even matter. A\nwoman darted past one of the mundane warrior Nightbringers under\nAntonius Malargos’s command. The warrior was smeared with blood, and\nhe’d just sprinted across the fields to get to this chaos, death all around. His\nbloodlust was running high.

And he would be changed\nforever by this fraction of a second.\nHe would know himself to be the kind of man who murdered unarmed\nwomen, or the kind of man who hesitated where others did not.\nHe hesitated—and two souls were saved.\nBut everywhere it was the same. As if something in the human heart\nlongs for chaos and finality, however violent.\nThe dregs of the Blood Robe army and its camp followers had been\npushed into the river, and were still being pushed as Kip and his men\napproached.\nThe once-pristine water ran brown and red, churned mud and men\nreturning to mud. The bank was so clogged with bodies you couldn’t see the\nground for a hundred paces. Many men can’t swim, and almost none can\nwhen you strap half again their weight in armor to their bodies. Most of\nthem had realized it when they reached the riverbank. But others panicking\nbehind them had pushed, pushed relentlessly.\nThey’d shoved and stabbed and slashed and trampled each other.\nAnd the Nightbringers had fallen on them pitilessly—desperate for\nvengeance on all these men who’d tried to kill them, who’d taken their\nhomes and livestock and neighbors, who’d killed and pillaged and\ndespoiled their hard and happy lives. Kip’s army fell on all these men, most\nof whom had thrown away their own weapons in order to run away faster,\nonly to find no escape. All these men—but not men only.\nThe camp followers were huddled here, too: the crippled and sick and\nold and the traders and the merchants and the wives and lovers and their\nchildren and all who hope to live on the leavings an army produces.\nIt is impossible to spare the innocent and the partly innocent hidden at\nthe back of the mob when you’re pushing the whole damned lot into the\nriver, stabbing and trampling any who resist. Hard to spare them, even if\nyou’re trying. Kip wasn’t sure most of his men were trying.\nSome of the camp followers, not weighed down by armor or greedily\nhanging on to goods, would escape by swimming. But many had drowned\nalready. It was only Kip’s arrival and a massive roar from Tallach that\nbrought a relative quiet.\nFinally Kip’s officers could make themselves be heard and obeyed. With\na few moments to breathe and think, the survivors surrendered and Kip’s\nmen left off their killing.\nThe survivors were seized and enslaved.\nThe Blood Robes and their followers looked no different from much of\nKip’s army, and Kip’s men had a cast to their faces that said they’d be\ndamned if any of these captives slunk away in the night and turned up at\ntheir fires later, claiming to have been on their side all along. So they\nnotched their ears immediately, here, over the bodies of their comrades.\nSmiths would later cauterize the flesh.

They would gladly become spies against their new\nmasters.\nBut the Nightbringers wouldn’t be able to get rid of all of them. There\nwere exceptions; there always were. One of Kip’s men would come\nforward. He had four children. His wife had been killed by the pagans. His\nextended family killed. He needed a new wife if he was to keep fighting,\nwould take a slave if she hadn’t been roughed up too much.\nThere was no saying no to that, not without Kip’s alienating his own\npeople. You could ask a man to die, but when he bared his heart to you, you\ncouldn’t deny him what he and his fellows saw as justice.\nAs the dawn yields to day, one exception gave rise to others. One\nattempt at justice gave a hundred excuses for injustice. Other men need\nwives, too, sure, milord!\nForbidding the rape of captured women had taken a number of hangings\nto enforce—those hangings had raised eyebrows, too, letting Kip know he\nwas treading a dangerous line. It had come down to explaining that they\nweren’t being hanged for raping slaves, but for disobeying a direct order.\nThat made sense to the men in the nonsense that was war.\nBut a leader can get away with only so many nonsense orders before his\nmen doubt his judgment, and that was poison.\nAnd the unintended consequences piled up.\nHaving forbidden the rape of the slaves only made them more appealing\nas wives. One man somehow got permission to marry a slave wife four\nseparate times. No one was sure what happened to the first three; Kip\nsuspected murder but couldn’t prove it. Kip had the man gelded and\nrelieved of his hands, then notched and sold.\nKip was revered. It made him uncomfortable. It was a fool’s gold. It\nwasn’t real. It was an image they projected onto him. But some images are\nmore helpful than others. They still saw how young he was, some of them.\nKip couldn’t let himself be revered as some kind of holy child. Children\ncould be fooled. Those who were too coarse to understand how love and\nobedience can be paired needed to learn fear.\nSo Kip had reinstituted the old tradition of the Year of Jubilee. It had\nbeen subverted before by the Ilytians and thence in the rest of the satrapies,\nbut it was at least an established principle—it had a history—and the good\nor ill of it all came down to enforcement.\nIf one is to barter against human nature, one might as well make the best\ndeal one can. The Year of Jubilee came every seven years, at which time\nslaves were freed.\nThey’d found a mention of which year it had last been celebrated and\nfrom there decreed that the tradition had lapsed rather than been broken.\nThus, a slave-wife taken now would be freed five years hence on Sun Day.\nAs a free woman on that day, she would be free to divorce her husband\nthen. Any children she bore would be hers to take with her, and the husband\nwould be liable to give her one-tenth of what he made in a year or a goat,"

Each slave’s contract now stipulated they would\nbe in servitude for only five years. Every trader used that fact to bring the\nprice down, though Kip knew that none of them intended to free the slaves\nin five years. He couldn’t free the slaves immediately lest they take up arms\nagainst him again; he couldn’t keep the slaves himself; but the slaves he\nsold would be slaves forever—unless Kip lived, and unless he won, and\nunless he was around in five years with enough power to enforce his will.\nHow did I become a slave trader?\nAnd why was he so idealistic, when Jubilee had been tried and had\nfailed before?\nIt wasn’t just that Kip had grown up in Rekton, where they had no slaves\nand the institution didn’t seem to fit naturally with all the people under\nOrholam’s being equal. It was more than that. Every slave woman he\nlooked at reminded him of his mother: bereft, cast off, disgraced, despised,\nvulnerable to abuse and thereby somehow a lodestone to those who would\nabuse her. Her saw her in every enslaved woman’s face.\nI couldn’t help you, mother. I couldn’t heal you. But maybe I can keep\nthese women from being hurt as much as they would be.\nTallach snorted, and Kip realized they hadn’t seen Lorcan yet, though\nsigns of his passage through the Blood Robe camp were evident in the\ndestruction everywhere. Doubtless Conn Arthur wanted to see if his brother\nstill lived.\nKip dismissed Tallach. He and Cruxer got down into the mud and blood\nto do more work.

We had to throw them down\nto mum the panic back there.”\n“Love that spear,” Cruxer said.\nIt was best to get the will-casters out of the night mares as quickly as\npossible, but there were armed men facing off at the gate.\nKip jogged over there. It wasn’t the most majestic entrance he’d ever\nmade: one unarmed man on foot surrounded by drafters mounted on great\nelk and weird horses.\nBut the city’s forces weren’t terribly impressive, either. The conn was\nmounted on an emaciated stallion that looked exhausted just holding him on\nits back. No one else was mounted, but they did have weapons, and there\nwere several hundred of them from what Kip could see.\nKip’s men, despite not having any orders, hadn’t let the conn or his\npeople through.\nBless ’em for having sense and feeling empowered to make tough calls.\nAt the sight of the night mares and the Mighty, Kip’s men moved back.\nKip went to stand before the columns. “Conn Ruarc Hill, is it?” he\nasked.\n“So I am. And you are?”\n“Really?” Kip asked.\nThe man licked his lips. He looked well fed, though he had bags under\nhis eyes. His men looked starved.\nKip didn’t judge him for that, though. A starving leader could make bad\ndecisions, so when numbers were large, it was a pretentious suffering to\nstarve alongside your men. He did judge him, however, for being an asshole\nto men whose weapons were still bloody and bloodlust high—men who\nwere here to rescue him, no less.\n“Glad you came to greet us, but you didn’t need to bring all these men,”\nKip said. His own men had been smart enough to stop the column before it\ngot out of the gates. If Conn Hill was going to attack, he was going to have\na bad time of it."

Hard to hunt those who are faster than you.”\n“Perhaps, then, we could help with those tasks that are nearer the walls,”\nConn Hill said.\n“Ah, you mean the claiming of slaves and plundering the camp,” Kip\nsaid. “The meager rewards for the blood my men have spilled while you sat\nsafe behind your walls.”\nThe man went red. Desperate, then, perhaps not entirely an asshole.\nThe conn said, “We have a claim to the takings here. We have suffered.\nYou fought them for one morning. We’ve fought—”\n“Go back into your city, Conn Hill, and—”\n“This is outrageous! I am conn of the most revered city in Blood Forest,\nand you are what? A bastard son with a few soldiers? I demand—”\nNope, not just desperate. Also an asshole.\n“Conn Hill! Let me remind you…” Kip interrupted.\nThe Mighty’s rage had been fading like the last thrumming notes of a\nlute’s battle song. But impudence and insolence and insult to their Kip\nthreatened a reprise of their favorite bloody verse.\nKip walked close to the man and lowered his voice so none could\noverhear it. The man himself had to bend over in his saddle to the\nunmounted, vulnerable Kip. Kip sometimes liked subverting power\ndynamics. “Let me remind you, there’s more than one way to liberate a\ncity.”\nThen Kip turned his back on him. He didn’t look back, but he was no\nfool. He looked at Cruxer’s eyes. They would signal of an impending strike.\nNone came.\nKip turned and mounted one of the great elk gingerly.\n“Go back into your city!” Kip shouted. “Go talk it over with your elders\nor just take a good long drink of water, and come back here and try again.\nThink about flies and vinegar versus honey. Oh, and one thing, Conn Hill.\nMy army is many things: bold, unconventional, fierce, fleet, frightening…\noh, and not least, victorious.”\nThe Nightbringers within hearing roared at that.\n“But one thing we are not, and this is very, very important: we are not\nheathens.”\nConn Hill snarled and sawed on his reins savagely, nearly making his\nhorse trample his nearby men. The rest of his threadbare army withdrew\nbehind the walls with him.\n“What was that last little bit?” Cruxer asked. “Not heathens?”\nKip said, “Dúnbheo is actually where the Chromeria got the idea of\nvoting in a promachos in times of crisis, except they call him a conn, a\nchief.

You’re\nchanging, Breaker,” Cruxer said.\n“And not only in good ways,” Kip said.\n“The old Breaker never would have made an enemy for no reason.”\n“Not for no reason,” Kip said. “Sometimes the quickest way to make\nfriends is to make the right enemies.”\n“You’re not telling me this was all part of some grand plan?” Cruxer\nsaid.\n“Not grand. Not even really a plan. I just saw an opportunity. And he\nwas being a flesh protuberance.”\n“That’s my old Breaker,” Cruxer said with a smile.\n“This’ll be a few hours,” Kip said. “Have the men keep a watch. Ghosts,\nyou can dis-integrate. Mighty, with me, I’m afraid there’s a bear we need to\nhelp bury.”\nChapter 67\n‘Iron White’? What a load of shit. She ought to cross that one off her list\nright now. Karris didn’t even dare lift her teacup, lest Teia see her\ntrembling. The debriefing about the assassinations and Ironfist’s fury had\nleft her more fragile than her own porcelain. Ironfist!\nIronfist, either dead now or made an enemy. Either was unspeakably\nterrible. Ironfist’s brother Tremblefist had, before all his training with the\nBlackguard, once killed five hundred men in a night and earned the moniker\nthe Butcher of Aghbalu. Ironfist had bested that man in single combat. Him,\nas an enemy?\nYet how could Karris hope instead that one of her best friends had been\nkilled in the tumult she’d triggered in Paria?\nFor Teia’s part, the young woman sat with her legs crossed like a lady,\nback straight, daintily holding her cup without a hint of nerves. Before,\nKarris swore she’d always sat like a man, legs planted wide, ready to launch\ninto action. Now she’d figured out that presenting oneself as a lady is\nsimply another game, and she was playing it as a mock.\nA mockery of Karris herself? Or was it the more innocent mockery of\nthe fine furniture and fine porcelain and, yes, even fine tea?\nBut the young woman’s eyes were terrible. Teia was changing before\nKarris, a shaking chrysalid, and Karris guessed that both of them feared\nwhat was going to emerge from that black cocoon.\n“You can be mad at me for fucking up,” Teia said. “I did. But don’t you\ndare—don’t you dare—flinch after what you had me do.”\nSomething about her combative tone actually settled Karris.

The\nmask slammed back in place. “Sugar?” she asked, lifting tiny tongs from\nthe tray. “The Ilytians use superviolet lattices to craft a single large crystal\ninto fanciful shapes for the decadently wealthy. This kind is called a halo.”\n“Thank you,” Teia said, confused, offering her cup.\n“I think it looks like a puckered arse.”\nFrom ladylike and pretentious to vulgar. It was a verbal hip throw. Teia\nseemed to have no idea what to do with that.\n“Which is how I feel every day, Teia. I’m making big gambles all the\ntime. Not because I’m reckless. I’m not. But because we’re weaker than\nanyone knows. You loused up? Fine. Maybe so did I.”\n“Who was it?” Teia asked. It was as if Karris hadn’t said anything. The\ngirl really was battle shocked.\n“Watch Captain Tempus requested you for this mission when I said I’d\nlike you to be here. He seemed nervous, insistent.”\n“Guilty, you mean,” Teia said. Then she swore quietly. “I liked him.\nOrholam blind him.”\n“Teia, we don’t know if he’s in the Order himself. He might have been\nblackmailed. If we can… Teia, if we can, show mercy.”\nFor the first time, Teia actually looked angry. “When I trained under\nCommander Ironfist, and Trainer Fisk, and Tremblefist, they told me never\nto point a musket at a man I wasn’t ready to kill. Were you trained so\ndifferently?”\n“Being ready to kill doesn’t mean you kill regardless. Point the gun, but\nkeep your finger outside the trigger guard until you’re certain. I’m asking\nyou to use discretion, that’s all,” Karris said.\nIt wasn’t fair of her. As if Teia wouldn’t use her discretion.\nTeia took the rebuke, though, unfair as it might have been. She simply\nlooked sad. “Tempus has done what the Order commanded once, how can\nyou believe that he won’t do it again at some critical moment? A man sworn\nto guard your back who betrays you even once is a cancer in the\nBlackguard. It doesn’t matter if he’s taken oaths or not, or if he attends the\nOrder’s secret meetings. If he obeys them, he’s one of them.”\nKarris bowed her head. She’d known Captain Tempus for twelve years.\n“Do what must be done.”\nTeia turned to leave, but as she got to the door, Karris called out to her.\n“Adrasteia, we have all of us fallen short.”\nThe young Blackguard assassin looked at her, and she was pitiless.\n“Some fall farther.”\nChapter 68\n“They were littermates,” Conn Arthur said.\nHe was sitting in a charred, muddy circle of ground next to the giant\ngrizzly’s corpse when Kip approached.

Though the corpses had already been dragged away, the\nground was muddy with the blood of those Lorcan had killed before dying.\nFrom the look of things, the bear had sought out Amrit Kamal’s\nbodyguard and his drafters. Nearby were four dead wights, a number of\ndrafters, and several dozen finely equipped men and horses. They were\nalready being stripped of their goods by Kip’s gleaners, who kept\nuncharacteristically silent as they went about their work.\nLorcan had not only been the distraction Kip needed, he had also wiped\nout much of the Lord of the Air’s leadership and protection here. The battle\nwould have gone quite differently without him.\nAnd the bear bore the signs of it on his body. Blood matted his fur from\ndozens of unseen wounds, many arrows stuck out from his hide, he had\nsinge marks, and part of his jaw was blown off.\nThere was no sign of Tallach. Conn Arthur must have banished the great\nbear. No one wanted to see a giant grizzly feeding on men.\nInstead the conn sat alone. There were no tears on his cheeks. He looked\nlike a man concussed.\nKip said nothing, and the Mighty said nothing. Kip gestured and they\nmoved away, some setting up a perimeter, checking the dead—the scene of\na just-finished battle was not a safe area. Cruxer stayed nearest, but only\nclose enough to protect him, not close enough to listen in.\nAfter a time, Conn Arthur found words again. “My father was a great\nhunter. After we were born, my mother had something burst in her head and\nwas sickly as long as we knew her. She got pregnant again when me and\nRónán were six. Twins again, boys again, identical again, but she had not\nthe strength for it a second time. Or perhaps we’d broken her somehow.\nThey lived for a while, but she could give no milk, and they refused cow’s\nor sheep’s or goat’s milk no matter what we did. My father rode many\nleagues to find a wet nurse, but they refused her, too. Perhaps they were\nwiser than us.”\nKip said nothing. “After that, things were different. We moved with him\nfrom our village to a little cabin in the Deep Forest. Father took Rónán and\nme with him one day and let me take the shot at a magnificent stag. I only\nwounded it, though. We tracked it to a thicket and my father went in.\n“He surprised a great she-bear. She protected her cubs and he protected\nhis. It was a fight such as none I’ve ever seen. They both died of their\nwounds, and the four of us were left orphans. No one in our village believed\nus when we said our father had fought a giant grizzly, much less killed it.\nNone had been seen for a hundred years, two hundred maybe. They thought\nwe were lying to make our father seem a hero. We took in the cubs. What\nelse were we to do? Rónán and I were thirteen years old then. When our\npowers awakened, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to reach out\nto them.”\nKip said nothing."

When our\npowers awakened, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to reach out\nto them.”\nKip said nothing.\n“You have to understand. They’re still wild animals. Predators. I’ve\nknown from the first time I touched Tallach’s mind that I might step wrong\none day, and he interpret me as a threat, and he’d kill me that day. Without\nmalice. To call it betrayal would be to call the rock you stumble on a\nvicious rock.\n“And yet we loved them as one loves nature itself. He loves me, too, but\nI can’t guarantee that he wouldn’t feed on my body if he found me dead\nwhen he was hungry. Like the world, he is hard but not cruel. I have buried\nmy mother and my father. We most of us bury our parents, unless our lot is\nworse and we bury our children. I’ve buried my baby brothers. Children\nborn too soon often die. And now I’ve buried my brother and will bury\nLorcan. There is nothing unique in my suffering. A thousand within\nshouting distance have suffered worse. The world is hard.”\nAnd Kip knew then he had lost him.\n“But I am not,” Conn Arthur said. “Luíseach, I lied to you and you\nforgave me. You deserve my loyalty, my service, my life itself. But I have it\nnot to give. At the end of all things, Tallach is just a goddam bear. But I’ve\nseen everyone else I love die, and I can’t see him leave me, too. I can’t risk\nhim in battle one more time. I… can’t.”\n“I won’t ask you to—” Kip said.\nConn Arthur interrupted, “I have broken faith already. I have just\nbanished Tallach. I will-cast him, compelling him to go to the deepest part\nof the forest, and to avoid men for the rest of his days.”\nA cloud descended on Kip. It wasn’t as if it were the first time he’d seen\nsomeone succumb to battle shock, but Conn Arthur? The great, hairy,\nmuscular colossus seemed the very epitome of strength.\n“Conn Ruadhán Arthur,” Kip said quietly. “I release Tallach. He’s done\noutstanding service to our fight, and he’s free to go. At the end of all things,\nas you say, I don’t need him. I do need you. Your people need you here.\nYour friends need you. You’re more than your magic. Your service, your\nknowledge, your fierceness, your strength is needed here, and I don’t\ndismiss you.”\nConn Arthur didn’t look up from his seat in the mud. He shook his head.\n“I’m finished. Call it a resignation or call me a deserter, you decide. Hang\nme or give me a pack. I’m done.” He stood and looked at his hands, bloody\nfrom where he’d been holding Lorcan’s fur. “I’m sorry to cast a pall on your\ngreat victory, my lord. You’ve much to do, I know. Here’s your wife now.\nWith news and pressing duties, no doubt. I’ll not undercut your authority by\ndefying you in front of your men. I’ll await your verdict on the morrow.”"

I’ll await your verdict on the morrow.”\nTisis rode up on her little roan. She took in the scene quickly and her\neyes softened, but she turned to Kip. “I’m sorry, my lord, but the gates are\nopening. There have been stories of some sort of conflict between you and\nDúnbheo’s conn earlier? Your men are spoiling for a fight. Theirs seem to\nbe, too. We need you. Now.”\nDamn and double damn.\nChapter 69\nThe sky hammer came down in a crackle of lightning and fire and\nearthshaking thunder.\nA moment before it struck him, Gavin jerked awake. He gasped, and fell\nfrom his cross-legged sitting position onto his back.\nHe sucked in great breaths, lying there in the darkness, his legs slowly\nuntangling.\n“Eat the poisoned bread,” the dead man said. “It’s your last hope. Go out\nlike a man before you fade into your insanity.”\n“What woke me?” Gavin asked.\n“Holding out hope? You?” The dead man laughed. “Die, Dazen Guile,\nand may those you’ve harmed curse you into eternity.”\nSome comfort you are.\nHe groped around in the darkness until he found the bread.\nThere had always been some part of him certain that he would escape.\nThings had worked out for him, always. He was a falling cat, destined to\nland on his feet. But this time he’d been dropped from too great a height.\nLanding on your feet didn’t mean anything when the fall pulverized your\nlegs.\nThe pressure on his chest was suffocating.\n“Do you remember your seven great purposes?” the dead man asked\nhim.\n“Uh-huh.”\n“No. Really. Do you remember them all?”\n“To tell Karris the truth about me, about Gavin and Dazen and Sundered\nRock, that was the first one. To finally free Garriston, that was the second.\nAfter all I’d let happen to it.” He’d failed to save the city, but he’d\nsucceeded in saving the people. It counted, maybe.\n“Go on.”\n“Several were for war. I knew there’d be war again. So the third was to\nget an army loyal to me.”\n“Of course. The people of Garriston, with your old General Corvan\nDanavis at their head. And you held them off the table like a card to be\nplayed when no expects it.”\nGavin nodded. Seers Island seemed so distant to the conventional\nthinking, but it wasn’t distant anymore, because of the next goal. “The\nfourth was to learn to fly. That worked for me for a little while, but I\ncouldn’t ever make a condor that could move supplies and troops across the\nseas. Nonetheless, in my failure, I created the skimmer, which does what I\nwanted anyway: I can move troops to places no one could imagine they’d\nshow up. Perhaps as importantly, I can communicate more swiftly than any\nfoe. The fifth goal was to undermine the Spectrum and get myself named as\npromachos again. That almost worked.”\n“What’s number six?”\n“To kill all the color wights. All of them, in the entire world.”\n“For Sevastian?”"

What, do you think you’re talking to yourself? You’re\nnot that crazy. Not yet.”\n“You aren’t a young version of me I will-cast into this cell to comfort\nmyself. You’re something else.”\nSilence for a time.\n“You underestimate your old self.”\n“Enough of that.

But ?” And you lied about white luxin, but Gavin\ndidn’t need to tip that card yet.\n“Eh, I worried about that. I was angry. I made a mistake. I hoped you’d\nmissed it.”\n“So what are you?” Gavin asked.\n“Oh, Dazen Guile. Come now. Isn’t that your seventh goal? To join us?”\nGavin shivered. ‘Us’? Every word was likely a lie. Every word had been\na lie so far.\nBut what did that mean?\nOr was this a hallucination? Was this conversation even real? Or was\nthis madness in truth?\nDear Orholam, I am finally losing it. Conspiracies and spirits? What’s\nnext?\nWhat could you do when you couldn’t trust even your own mind?\nHe tore a hunk off the bread. He wadded up the dough, rolling it in his\nhands and compressing it until it was a starchy bullet. He opened his mouth\nto toss in the bullet all nonchalant.\nWait, a quiet voice said to him.\nHe closed his mouth.\n“What was that?” the dead man said. “Who was that? You can’t touch\nhim! You can’t speak to him! That’s not how it works. That’s not the rules!\nUnless…”\nGavin was about to say something aloud, but whatever it was, he forgot\nit immediately when he heard a sound. Something from outside the cell.\nNo! I’m in here for months and months and nothing happens, and then\ntwo vitally important things happen at the exact same time?\nThe air changed and light streamed into the black cell like a sledge\nsmashing Gavin’s good eye. Gavin blinked against it, putting out a three-\nfingered hand to block the assault, and the man turned down his lamp. Then\nhe set it on the floor.\nGrinwoody.\nChapter 70\n“In the circus when I was growing up, we had this act,” Big Leo said, as the\nMighty followed Kip toward the Dúnbheo gate.

Bigger. We had these funny illusions where we pitted him against\nmy father in feats of strength, and somehow he won every time. And at the\nfinale, my father pretends to be furious and picks the skinny guy up and sets\nhim on a teeterboard, determined to bounce him out of the place. He jumps\non his side of the teeterboard—and just slowly rises, not even fast enough\nto bounce him. Then my father looks at the teeterboard like it’s got to be\nbroken. Picks it up, moves it around, sees that it’s just a plain old\nteeterboard: one piece of plain wood over a fulcrum.”\n“Tell me this story is ending soon,” Winsen said. “The awesome\nwonders of the circus are too much for my provincial mind.”\n“It’s going somewhere, all right? It got a little longer than I was\nexpecting, but—”\nTisis gave a significant glance to Kip—‘Not too long, okay?’—and said,\n“I’ll go stall them.” She flicked the reins of her horse and darted away.\n“He’s right at the climax of the show, Win, I want to hear what\nhappens,” Ferkudi said.\n“What happens? Like it’s still going on? Big Leo’s parents and that\nwhole damn circus were killed, Ferk,” Winsen said. Always was the\ndiplomat. “It’s not what happens. It’s what happened.”\n“Thank you, High Lord Pedant,” Ben-hadad said. “We don’t know the\nstory, so we don’t know what happens next in the time stream of the story.\nYou can put it in any tense you want. It’s like it lives in a hypothetical fairy\nstory land where anything may or may not happen. And we just want to find\nout what that happening is.”\n“What? Hypothetical what?” Winsen said. “It’s a true story. Something\nreally did happen. And it’s over, so it happened.”\n“I have to admit,” Big Leo said, “it does kind of sound like you’re\ntalking out of your ass with that hypothetical fairy story whatever, Ben-\nhadad.”\nBen-hadad threw his hands up. “So it’s a true story composited from\nmany instances of a mummery act facilitated with illusions, fine. That’s\ntotally different.”\n“Yes,” Winsen said.\nBen-hadad nearly shouted, “No, it isn’t! It’s a fucking story for the\npurpose of illustration! It doesn’t matter if it even actually—”\n“Shut it, Ben. I was damn near getting to my point,” Big Leo said.

Bear it?”\n“Balls, Ferk,” Ben-hadad said. “You think it’s appropriate to make jokes\nwhen a man bares his soul—”\nThe rest of them groaned.\n“Jokes aside, I hear you,” Winsen said. “It does seem like a bit of an\noverreaction. When my cat Fluffles died, I grinned and bore it… Damn.\nThat didn’t really work, did it? Grinned and beared it?”\n“Now you’re beating that joke like a dead—” Big Leo said.\n“Don’t…” Cruxer said.\n“—bear,” Big Leo finished. “Oops.”\n“You motherfuckers!” Kip seethed, rounding on them. They didn’t\nknow. They didn’t know, but he went red. “You shut your fucking shitholes,\nor I’ll—”\nThe conversation broke like ice over a puddle on a cold fall morning.\nThey plunged into the mud beneath, the grime that was Kip.\nHe’d never spoken to them in anger. Not once in the year and a half—\nthe lifetime—he’d known them. And it was going to shatter their friendship."

And it was going to shatter their friendship.\nAll because Kip couldn’t control his mouth. Kip the Lip. God. Damn.\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said quietly. “They don’t mean anything by it.”\n“It wasn’t even Conn Arthur’s bear,” Ben-hadad complained. “I know\nhe’s a moody—”\n“Stop,” Kip said, looking away. He turned his back, but didn’t keep\nwalking to the gate. Not yet. “You’re done.”\n“Don’t you turn your back on us, you asshole,” Winsen said.\n“Don’t,” Cruxer warned Winsen.\n“No. Shit gets awful, we have a few laughs. You’ve joined us every\nother time. Now you pull high ground on us? Go fuck yourself. What’s your\nproblem, boss?” Winsen demanded.\n“Let’s forget it,” Kip said.\n“Sure. We can joke about that guy’s head we found two hundred paces\nfrom his body back at that wagon ambush, but some fuckin’ bear is beyond\nthe pale. Sure, boss, you get to decide what’s funny, too. Because you’re the\nLightbringer.”\n“I’ve never said that,” Kip said.\n“Yes, he is,” Cruxer said at the same moment. But he went on, “And if\nyou doubt it at this point, what the hell are you still doing here?”\n“I like the food,” Winsen said. “And I get to kill people.”\nAside from Kip, the rest of them chuckled, but it was forced. They’d all\nknown Winsen long enough to know that the first half was probably a joke\n—it should be; any spices the cooks laid their hands on had to be sold for\nactual necessities. But the second half probably wasn’t a joke, and they’d all\nknown him long enough to be uneasy about that.\nLong enough, not well enough, because it didn’t seem that any of them\ndid know him well. If there were hidden depths to Winsen—and one\nexpects depths—they remained hidden. He seemed unaffected both by the\nphysical difficulties of a life at war and the moral ones.\n“Bad people,” Ferkudi amended for him. He was probably the only one\nof them who wasn’t a little unnerved by Winsen from time to time.\n“Huh?”\n“You get to kill bad people.”\n“That’s a bonus,” Winsen said. He grinned at their drawn faces. “I am\njoking, guys.”\nBut Kip didn’t believe him. Winsen was on their side, but he didn’t\nactually care. He liked the excitement. When religious or moral\nconundrums came up at the campfire, the look on his face was akin to the\none Kip imagined his own must wear when Tisis talked about fabrics for\nher eventual ‘real’ wedding gown.\nKip didn’t think Eirene was going to spring for the big wedding. He also\ndidn’t think they were going to live that long, so it was a moot point.\n“Oh shit,” Ben-hadad said. “That wasn’t just his brother’s bear, was it?”\n“It’s over now,” Kip muttered. “It doesn’t matter.”\n“What are you talking about?” Cruxer asked.

When Kip started walking\nwithout answering, he asked it again, this time of Ben-hadad. Of course it\nwas Ben who’d figured it out.\n“You all didn’t stop to think how weird it was that a non-will-cast bear\nattacked at just the perfect place and time? What? He was just trained that\nwell?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“Hadn’t really thought about it,” Ferkudi said.\n“That wasn’t Lorcan,” Ben-hadad said. “That was Rónán in Lorcan.”\n“Oh shit,” Cruxer said.\n“Orholam’s beard, I’m so sorry,” Big Leo said. “I didn’t mean…”\n“So wait,” Winsen said. “That was really his brother? In the bear? Didn’t\nhis brother die before we even met him?”\n“You’re talking soul-casting. That is… not just a little bit forbidden,”\nCruxer said carefully. “I’ve come to appreciate that the Chromeria is\nsometimes overcareful with these magics. But even the Ghosts absolutely,\ncategorically forbid soul-casting.”\n“Yes,” Kip said. “And yet he saved us all today. Which makes him a\nheretic and a hero at the same time.”\n“You knew,” Cruxer said.\n“And you gave Conn Arthur an ultimatum,” Ben-hadad said. He\ngestured around at the destruction the bear had wreaked. “To do this.”\n“Because Conn Arthur couldn’t bear to kill him?” Ferkudi asked. He\nsaw the disbelieving, outraged looks of the others. “Oh no! That one wasn’t\non purpose, I swear!”\nIgnoring him, Cruxer said to Kip, “He lied to you, he said so. About\nthis?”\n“I suspected it from the beginning. What would you have had me do,\nCrux? Put Conn Arthur in front of a tribunal right after the will-casters\njoined us?”\n“That’s the law among their people.”\nBen-hadad scoffed, and the others looked uneasy. It would have been\nimpossible, of course. Even if they’d held the tribunal—not a sure thing,\nwith how much the Ghosts revered Conn Arthur. Even if they’d found him\nguilty—and how would they, unless he confessed? Even if it had all gone as\nwell as it could, Kip would have lost the Ghosts. They would have exploded\nor melted away into the forest.\nAnd without them, these victories would have been impossible.\n“Does the scripture say, ‘Do the law, and love meting out its\npunishment’?” Kip asked.\n“No, it says, ‘Do justice and love mercy,’” Ferkudi said.\n“Thanks, Ferk,” Big Leo said. “He knows.”\n“Oh, it was one of those rhetorical…”\n“Yeah. One of those.”\n“The laws are there for a reason,” Cruxer said stubbornly, but\nweakening. “Every time we ignore the law, we end with tragedy.”\n“Oh, look,” Kip said, “here we are.”\nThe Nightbringers who’d been in a mob in front of the city’s gate were\nnow arranged in orderly lines and files.

It was more formal, but they also all\nhad their weapons close at hand.\nBut even as they snapped smartly back rank by rank to let Kip and the\nMighty pass, someone high in the city wall unfurled several great, festive\nbanners, and Kip knew everything was going to be fine.\nThe will-cast animals had all been released, so someone—Tisis, no\ndoubt—had procured the remarkably docile black stallion Kip rode when\noccasions required it. He swung into the saddle less than gracefully. To the\ngeneral merriment of the Mighty, he was still a rather poor rider.\nBeside Kip, Ben-hadad asked Winsen out of the side of his mouth,\n“Fluffles? You named your cat Fluffles?”\n“What? Great name for a cat,” Winsen said. “If I ever do or don’t or did\nget one, I definitely may or may not have named it that. In some\nhypothetical fairy story land—or the real one—it may have happened. It’s\njust for the purpose of illustration.”\n“You’re a dick, Winsen,” Ben-hadad said. “I love you, man.”\n“Hairless cat,” Winsen said.\n“Hairless? They come like that?” Big Leo asked.\n“Oh, of course,” Ben-hadad said, light dawning. “Fluffles. The hairless\ncat. Not hypothetical, then.”\n“Odd texture. Feels like foreskin,” Winsen said.\nAnd that was how ‘petting the hairless cat’ entered the Mighty’s lexicon.\nChapter 71\n“Andross, you motherfucker.” Karris had waited a week to say those words\nso she didn’t reveal she knew exactly what had happened in Paria\nimmediately, but checking off “Curse out promachos” wasn’t quite as\nsatisfying as she’d hoped.\n“Yes?” he said, as if she’d simply called his name. He’d come into her\nroom carrying two cups. “Kopi?” he asked, proffering a delicate cup.\n“I thought we were working together,” she said. She didn’t take the cup.\nHe raised his eyebrows. ‘Go on,’ his expression said. He lowered the\nproffered cup.\n“That was no suicide. You killed the Nuqaba, didn’t you?” she\ndemanded.\n“Yes.”\nShe hadn’t expected him to admit it. Crafty old rat. “You… you ass!\nAfter all you and I went through drafting that ultimatum, you just\nassassinated her? She didn’t even have time to respond. I hated her,\nAndross, but she unified the Parian people. She could have led them to our\ndefense. This is betrayal, Andross. Assassinating a Nuqaba? Are you mad?\nWith how much we need Paria and how fraught the relationship between\nthe Chromeria and the Nuqabas has always been?”\nHe put her cup down on a table. He sat in one of her chairs, taking his\nease. He sipped his kopi.\nWhen the silence stretched on, he looked up. “Oh! I’m sorry, I thought\nthose were rhetorical questions. Done ranting? So soon?”"

So soon?”\nHe made her feel powerless. Foolish. Like a child.\nUh-uh.\nHe moved to take another sip, as if thinking, and Karris’s foot flashed\nout. If she’d paused to think about what she was attempting, she wouldn’t\nhave tried it.\nHer foot swept between his seated legs, pushed forward, and kicked only\nthe delicate cup as he tilted it to his lips. The cup popped into the air, jetting\nsteaming kopi into Andross’s face and hair and across his chest.\nAndross roared, blinded and burnt, but Karris was still moving. The\nkilling instinct imbued by so many years of fighting had taught her never to\nwound a foe without following up to kill immediately. Karris kicked off\nhalf of the sole of her right boot, and, before he could lurch out of his chair,\nshe stood balanced easily on her left foot with the blade of her right foot—\nnow lined with an actual blade—pressed against his neck.\nShe caught the kopi cup.\nThe blade along the edge of her boot was thin. It had to be to be small\nenough to conceal in her boot sole and not interfere with walking, but\nagainst his neck it was plenty big enough.\nAndross sat back down, but the rage didn’t leave his eyes. He raised one\nberinged finger and pushed her foot aside. She pivoted easily and brought\nher foot down, but stayed ready for an attack.\n“That, my dear, was a miscalculation,” he said. His eyes flicked to the\nempty cup she’d caught in her hand.\nShe hoped it was because he was impressed. It had been damn lucky.\nBut she couldn’t back down. “I’ll decide that.”\n“Oh, I didn’t mean for you. I meant for me. You took me by surprise. It\ndoesn’t happen often.” He looked about for a cloth with which to dry\nhimself, and, not finding one or a slave to hand him one, he made an\nexpression as if to say, ‘What am I, among barbarians?’\nHe picked up a priceless lace pillow with a tiny shrug as if to say, ‘Oh\nwell, when among barbarians, do as barbarians do.’ And he wiped his face\nand neck dry with the pillow.\nIt was a pretense, all this calm. The rage never left that deep corner of\nhis demeanor.\nCall that a victory, then.\nThe skin on his face was burnt. She couldn’t tell how badly yet.\nBut there was no retreat. A burnt face? He’d murdered that woman. Teia\nhad damned herself in her own eyes because of this man’s orders. Karris\ncouldn’t feel remorse.\n“So,” he said, “any news on your hunt for Gavin?”\nNo no no. He was not going to get her derailed. Especially not into that.\n“Did you kill Satrapah Azmith, too?” she asked.\n“Clearly not,” he said. “As she wasn’t a satrapah when she died.”\n“Is that a yes?” she asked.

My sources say she had a\nparoxysm when the Nuqaba told her she might not back her claim against\nus.”\nSo he hadn’t known Azmith was the Parian spymaster. Or—dammit!—\nwas merely pretending not to. She said, “My sources suggested it might\nhave been because we stripped her of her position, that she had a heart\nattack then. I thought her death might be on us.”\n“I imagine the pressures of working with that lunatic Haruru for years\nhad more to do with it.”\n“Why kill her, Andross? If your assassin failed or had been discovered,\nyou’d have plunged us into a war with two fronts. You’re not so rash.”\nAndross gave a sour grin through his pain. “You didn’t know me when I\nwas young, before I gave up drafting red for the same reasons you did.\nBack to using again, are you?”\nDamn her light skin. Her blushes were obvious, and so was the light\nstaining from using red again.\nThe truth was, she’d been drafting to try to spur on some feeling in her\nheart toward her son. She and Zymun had gotten off on the wrong foot, and\nthings still weren’t going well, this many months later. He’d continually\nstruck her as somehow off—no doubt that was an artifact of the abuse he’d\nendured. Her fault. Raised without a mother’s love, abandoned and abused\nby those who’d taken him on. Any flaws he had were on her. But she’d\nfinally admitted to herself that she didn’t like him.\nWhat kind of mother doesn’t like her own son?\nShe’d been trying to train herself to have good feelings around him, so\nthey had wonderful food for dinners together, excellent wine, and she\ndrafted red and what sub-red she could: all the things that could provide\nperfect soil for a new relationship. But she was a stone. It hadn’t worked.\nNot yet. And when he kissed her on the lips in greeting, she flinched away\nfrom his innocent gesture.\nShe couldn’t reject him, not after all she’d done.\nShe hadn’t answered, and Andross took her silence as assent. He picked\nup the kopi he’d brought for her, and sipped it as if nothing had happened.\n“We were working together, High Mistress. If the Nuqaba were going to\ncomply, I’d given orders that the assassination be called off.”\nA lie, almost certainly. Teia hadn’t mentioned any way for her orders to\nbe canceled, and no one there from the Order could have gotten orders in\ntime to stop her regardless, because they didn’t have skimmers. Unless\nAnjali Gates belonged to Andross?\nDamn! Yet another person to put in the file of those who might be\nAndross’s.\nInvestigate Anjali Gates.\nBut Karris couldn’t let him know that she knew the possibility of\ncanceling the answer to be a lie.

        "text": "all this straight!\n“As it was,” Andross continued, “we were able to establish how hard\nyou are, and how dangerous it is to cross you. Your ultimatum drove a\nNuqaba to suicide—which it only would have if she’d already been\nplanning to commit treason. And because she died before she could come\nout against us, none of the people who would have joined her had done so\npublicly. Think of it this way: if things are close and the tribes aren’t sure\nwho to side with, if they’d followed her and then we killed her, they would\nfear you’d hold it against them. So all things being equal, they would then\nhave to join the White King. This way, they still have the possibility of\njoining us.”\n“Why would they fear me if they hadn’t acted yet? I’ve shown myself to\nbe forgiving when possible.”\n“Ah, but you see, men never believe others are more good than they are.\nBad men see mercy as weakness. Smart men see it as shrewdness. Saintly\nmen might see the truth of it, but sadly there are few saints among those\nwe’re trying to convince to join us.”\n“And you’ve guaranteed that,” she said, though she couldn’t argue with\nthat much. She had dossiers on all the tribal chiefs, and she knew all the\nsatraps and Colors herself. No saints among those, and few enough even\namong the High Luxiats. “Because of what you’ve done, we’ll have people\njoin us who have only the barest loyalty. We may be inviting traitors into\nour midst.”\n“A truth every time one recruits. Would you forego allies altogether?”\nAndross asked. “I’ve seen you down at the yards, watching the training.”\n“What of it?”\n“You’ve accelerated the training. How many drafters have died because\nof that?”\n“I don’t know,” she mumbled.\n“Horse shit.”\n“Twelve,” she said.\n“Twelve dead, to save some number you’ll never know. That’s our\nbusiness here, Iron White. Trading blood now for what we pray is less\nblood later. Stop looking back.”\n“Who’s to say the tribes who join us won’t turn when we get to battle?”\nshe asked.\nAndross grinned smugly. It was a cold mirror of Gavin’s happy self-\nsatisfaction when he did something clever. Gavin’s delight made you want\nto join him; Andross’s made you hate him more.\nHe said, “That’s why I blooded the Parians and Ruthgari early at the\nBattle of Ox Ford. It’s hard to join up with an army after they’ve killed your\nsons and brothers, even if it is in your best interests.”\n“You’re saying you sent them to die on purpose?”\n“I wasn’t hoping they’d be massacred like total incompetents, if that’s\nwhat you’re asking. But I sent them to what I knew would be a hard fight,\nyes. The Parians in particular used to have a reputation to be exactly the\npeople for that. That their losses would be another thing to keep them on\nour side if things went poorly was part of my thinking, yes. I knew the\nNuqaba was crazy, but I didn’t think she was insane.

But if she’d tried\nto join him and instead started her own civil war, that wouldn’t have helped\nus, either, would it? Not in time.”\n“So you had reason to think that Satrapah Azmith would join us?”\n“Weak people like Azmith don’t lead rebellions. They fall back to doing\nwhat they’re supposed to do. At worst, she would have dragged her feet,\nand another visit, this time by you or me personally, would have been\nsufficient to regain Paria once and for all. Of course, the Parians have the\nsame problem that afflicts every fighting force subjected to protracted\npeace.”\n“And what’s that?” Karris wasn’t sure they were done talking about his\nassassination, but Andross slid from one thing to the next like an eel.\n“Do you know the true genius of my second son?”\n“What?” What did Dazen have to do with this? Gavin. Oh hell.\nYes, she did know Gavin’s genius quite well, thank you.\n“Dazen was brilliant. Smarter than Gavin, but Dazen had his mother’s\n—” Andross cut off suddenly, overwhelmed with emotion.\nHe’d really loved her.\nAnd instantly, Karris felt the ice of her hatred for this man shiver, and a\ncrack run right down the middle of it. If he could love Felia, then he could\nlove.\nUnless this, too, was a game. Was Andross so vile that he would use his\nown wife’s death to manipulate Karris?\nAndross cleared his throat. “He had this ability, a perishingly rare ability\nfor those who are good at practically everything they do. He knew where he\nwasn’t the best, and it didn’t bother him. He led his people, and he fought\non the front lines, but he put another man in command of his armies. You\nmet the man he chose. And he was not a choice anyone else would have\nmade. At the time, Corvan Danavis was the last living son of a shattered,\nonce-great family.”\nKarris had met Corvan, but her own memories of any time before the\nFalse Prism’s War were dim and tainted with grief and self-recrimination.\n“Corvan was bookish. He’d gone along on some raids with his brothers\nbut had never fought. He was too young. As the youngest of ten brothers, he\nnever dreamed he would lead, nor did they. Then the Danavises got swept\ninto the death orgy that was the Blood Wars. Corvan’s brothers tried to take\na shortcut through a swamp to surprise their enemies and were captured and\nflayed.”\nNow that was something Karris hadn’t known.\n“Do you know what happens to a drafter who’s been flayed?” Andross\nasked.\nKarris’s distaste must have shown on her face.\n“Same thing that happens to any man. Incredible pain and flies and\ninfection and fever and slow, horrendous, inevitable death—unless he crafts\na luxin skin for himself. There was a law at the time that any man who\nturned wight forfeited all his family’s belongings. So Grissel Spreading Oak\n—yes, Bran’s older brother—flayed all seven of the Danavises he captured."

One bribe later,\nand the Spreading Oaks took four-fifths of the Danavis properties, and the\nMagisterium one-fifth.”\n“Orholam have mercy,” Karris said. That was sweet Bran Spreading\nOak’s brother?\n“I know. I would have negotiated for at least half,” Andross said. But he\nsmiled slyly. He knew what she meant. “Anyway, according to my sources,\nCorvan wasn’t even an officer when he joined Dazen. He’d fought for half a\ndozen mercenary companies since his brothers died. He was a brawler and\nan angry drunk, and every time he got promoted, he got fired again. When\nhis people’s lives were on the line, he couldn’t stand incompetence, and he\ncouldn’t keep his mouth shut. He joined Dazen immediately, but the old\nguard wouldn’t give him so much as a squad. That is the problem of\npeacetime militaries: most of them train for peace, and they produce\nofficers good at peacetime activities. Smiling sycophants mostly. Men who\nlook good at balls, rather than men with balls.\n“Dazen apparently saw Corvan lingering one day over the maps after his\nsuperiors left. He quizzed him, thinking he might be a spy—he was wrong,\nof course. For several months I had no spies at all in Dazen’s army, he\ninspired such devotion. Dazen was so impressed by Corvan’s answers, and\nhow keenly he saw things, that he put Corvan in charge immediately. The\naudacity! And then they led together, Dazen bringing Corvan up to speed\nand Corvan showing a preternatural gift for strategy. They worked hand in\nglove. If he’d come in earlier, or if it weren’t me they opposed, bleeding off\nallies who might have joined them, they might have won the war. The only\nmistake they ever made was letting themselves be drawn into a full-scale\nbattle at Sundered Rock. Of course, they say Corvan was deathly ill at the\ntime. Hmm.”\n“This is going somewhere,” Karris said.\n“I’d intended to have Corvan take command of the Parian armies.\nIndeed, all of our armies. If he was willing to join Gavin after having fought\nagainst him, apparently his loyalty to the Guile line is strong. Or he simply\nlikes fighting. Doesn’t matter to me. My son was right about Corvan; I’ll\nnot be too obstinate to admit it.”\n“This is all fascinating, and I’m not against Corvan leading our armies,\nat least not in principle. But we’re not finished talking about your\nassassinating one of the most important people in the Seven Satrapies\nbehind my back.”\n“Karris. Dear. I’ve done nothing but amplify your power.

We can be feared together, like Corvan and Dazen.\nHand in glove.”\n“With me as the glove,” Karris said. “And you the hand. I thought we\nwrote that letter together to show a united front. But really it was so your\nname would be attached to this.”\nHe didn’t deny it. “People need reminders. Just because there’s a new\npower in the game doesn’t mean all the old ones are gone. Besides, I did do\nall the work. I’m sharing my glory with you, not the other way around.”\n“How did you do it?” Karris asked. She didn’t expect an answer, but it\nwas a question she would ask if she were as in the dark as she was claiming\nto be.\n“I’m not telling you that. I’m the promachos, and I go before us to fight\nin the ways I deem best. Now, your options are varied, but simple. You’ve\nyelled at me; you’ve questioned my sanity; you’ve made certain that I knew\nwhat I was risking; you’ve expressed how you wished I’d tell you things\nbefore I did them… and you’ve spilled my drink. Now you simply have to\ndecide if you’re going to try to remove me from my offices, if you’re going\nto try to kill me, or if we’re going to get back to the delicate work of trying\nto save the satrapies. Because my plan worked, insofar as I could have\npredicted. Azmith’s death, however, leaves us with some very particular\ndifficulties.”\nHe looked at her, questioning, waiting, and apparently not the least bit\nworried.\nShe’d been outflanked. Again. And this was what it was like to have\nAndross Guile as an ally. Damn him.\n“So, can we move on now,” he said, “or are you going to ask the\nBlackguards to seize me? Will they, I wonder? Technically, they answer to\nthe White… unless there’s a promachos appointed. Hmm. I know what a\nstickler like Commander Ironfist would have done, much as it might have\npained him, but maybe Commander Fisk would be overwhelmed by his\npersonal loyalty to you instead.”\nWhat was she going to say to salvage her dignity? ‘Don’t do it again’?\nHe’d do it again in a heartbeat.\n“This was not the partnership I was looking for,” Karris said.\n“That makes two of us. I would prefer you to be completely\nsubservient,” Andross said.\nWas that a hint of a smile?\nKarris pursed her lips. “So where do we go from here?” She wondered\nwhich of them had been more wrong about Paria. Had she destroyed\neverything by killing Satrapah Azmith, or had she saved them from ruin by\nfrustrating Andross Guile’s plans?\nThe intelligence she was getting from Azûlay was fragmentary and\ncontradictory at best. Maybe the whole country would dissolve back into its\ntribes. And of Ironfist, she’d had no word at all."

And of Ironfist, she’d had no word at all.\nAndross said, “Well, obviously, the first thing we need to do is send a\nletter. The tricky part is what to say, and for that, I was hoping your lighter\ntouch might be helpful.”\n“What do you mean? Whom are we sending the letter to?”\nAndross smiled, superior again. “Why, to the only person who matters in\nParia now, of course: King Ironfist.”\nKarris was ashamed that her first reaction wasn’t joy that her old friend\nwas alive, or that he was free, or that he was in charge.\nIronfist hadn’t claimed the title satrap. He hadn’t become Nuqaba.\nIronfist is calling himself king.\nChapter 72\n“I can’t decide if I’m going to be moved to tears or throw up,” Cruxer said.\n“There’s a good reason for that,” Tisis said.\nThe procession into the city wasn’t what Kip had expected. He wasn’t\nsure what that had been; it wasn’t as if he’d fantasized about being a\nconqueror. But as his army snaked in through the streets toward the Palace\nof the Divines, they saw that the city was in a horrific state. It was far worse\nthan they’d been led to believe.\nWhich made sense, Kip realized. A besieged city had every reason to\nhide how bad things were.\nGaunt men and women holding sickly children and limp babies cheered\nas if to make up with enthusiasm for lacking any tangible way to show their\nappreciation. But there was a troubling undercurrent here, too. A look on\nsome faces like that of a beaten dog cowering under a raised fist.\n“They’re afraid of us,” Kip said suddenly. It was what Tisis had been\nhinting.\n“What?” Cruxer asked in disbelief.\n“If you let a strange army into your city, how do you stop them from\ndoing whatever they want?” Tisis asked.\nKip looked around, sickened. Sad excuses for little banners of welcome\nwaved from open windows and balconies. Instead of the famed living wood\nthat the city was famous for, most of the buildings were built of the white\ngranite that was so plentiful in the area. Everywhere, though, Kip saw the\nForesters’ art, from carvings of intricate zoomorphic dogs and tygre wolves\nto the more typical infinite knots, plaits, braids, spirals, and step-and-key\npatterns for love, for husband and wife and children and clan, for eternal\nlife, for the relations of nature and man and their gods, for life above and\nlife below and for life and death and renewal.\nDespite its power at the time, this civilization had converted with little\nor no force. Lucidonius’s teachings had made sense to these people, as if his\nideas filled in the gaps that had left them puzzled, and contradicted only\nthose things in their own practices that had left them uneasy. They had\nalready revered the number seven: not only did they see it in their colors,\nbut they arranged the world into what they called the seven creations: man,\nmammal, fish, reptile, bird, insect, and plant."

Starving\npeople had not the energy to clean their homes and streets or even\nthemselves. Rubbish heaps had been plundered and the detritus left\nscattered about, not least on the faces of these walking skeletons in their\nrags.\n“The city wasn’t under siege that long,” Kip said. “It shouldn’t be this\nbad. Are those burn marks on the walls? Were there riots here?”\n“My spies haven’t reported yet,” Tisis said. “I don’t know what\nhappened.”\nKip looked back at his lackluster parade: men and women literally\nbloodied, the grime and sweat and soot of the battlefield still on them, some\nlimping, some still bleeding after refusing medical care because they didn’t\nwant to disappoint their leader or leave their friends… all marching to\nimpress whom? A starving crowd? The city leaders?\nThese people didn’t need to be impressed. They needed to be fed.\n“What are we doing?” Kip said. “A military procession to the heart of\nthe city? Why? Because that’s what people do? None of the people here\nhave ever done it or ever seen it. There’s a place for spectacle, but it’s not\nhere.”\nKip threw a flare into the sky to signal a stop.\nIt takes some time for an entire army to stop, though, and while the\nappropriate people got in their places for further orders, Sibéal Siofra said,\n“I know what you’re going to do, and while I admire the heart behind it,\nLord Guile, it’s not a good idea. Think about the logistics—”\n“I’ve thought of them,” Kip said. But he didn’t explain.\n“What’s he going to do?” Ferkudi tried to whisper.\n“He’s going to give away our food,” Cruxer said.\n“He’s not going to give our food away,” Ben-hadad said. “Because that\nwould be idiotic.”\n“I’m giving our food away,” Kip told Ferkudi.\n“Kip,” Ben-hadad said, “if you give away our food, the army stops.\nPeriod. We go nowhere, we do nothing, people start leaving within a couple\ndays. If the army stops, the Blood Robes can kill as many Foresters as they\nwant, including everyone in this city. In the long run, it’s not a mercy to—”\n“Give away the food!” Kip commanded. “All of it. Section commanders,\ncarry out the original plan, but begin now, and take all of our food rather\nthan what we’d apportioned before.”\nSibéal huffed and Ben-hadad lifted his heavy spectacles and rubbed the\nbridge of his nose. “Tell me you’ve got a plan,” Ben-hadad said. “Please.”\n“Drafters, cavalry, and the Mighty with me,” Kip said. “I want our camp\nfollowers in here mending and washing clothes and cleaning streets.\nAnything that needs to be done and can be done in two days, do it.

Remind them to go in teams. Even killings in\nself-defense will be considered murder if there aren’t two corroborating\nwitnesses.” Last thing Kip needed was some young assholes to antagonize\nthe whole city.\nThe army didn’t dissolve at once, of course. But commanders began\nbooming out orders, filling in their people on what they were about to do,\nand messengers exploded from the column like hornets from an upended\nnest.\nKip gave the signal, and the column began moving again, but now, as it\ngot deeper into the city, sections broke off, each with its own wagons of\nprovisions. It took a lot of work to give away something properly.\nGradually the signs of the city’s impoverishment cleared until they\nreached the great gate into the part of the city called the Sanctum of the\nDivines. Here there were undeniable scorch marks from at least one earlier\nriot. The great gate was now open, though.\nHere, as at the wall, the posts of the gate were trees. But these weren’t\nsabino cypresses. They were atasifusta, though sadly no longer living. Kip\nhadn’t known that there were any left standing in the world. Atasifusta were\nthe only known plant that converted sunlight into something a lot like red\nluxin. Except it was a more potent red luxin than man had ever drafted. A\nsingle stick of the stuff would burn for many days without being consumed.\nIts usefulness had doomed it to extinction. Families still passed down single\nsticks of the stuff. A few shavings made a perfect fire starter, or the whole\nstick could be set alight to help light damp wood, and then extinguished\nwith no appreciable loss to its mass. It had found worse uses in war, the\nsawdust being a precursor to black powder.\nHere, knot work had been carved into the entire surface of both trees,\nand the rest overlaid with some clear glaze so the designs stood out in black\non bone-white wood. Clearly the designs were set alight for special\noccasions. Kip was somewhat sad that his arrival didn’t rate.\nA dozen guards stood at the gate, but they said nothing. A single rider on\na white charger in ceremonial white-and-gold armor and carrying the white-\nand-green triangular flag of the city nodded to them from his wolf helm and\nrode before them, leading them to the Palace of the Divines.\nHere the buildings were older and grander by far. Living wood made the\nframes of these buildings, with a few supporting enormous stained glass\nwindows between their branches, mostly hidden now by fresh green leaves,\nbut no doubt glorious in autumn and winter.\n“How the hell did they do that?” Ben-hadad said. “Do they will-cast the\ntrees? How do you will-cast a tree? They don’t grow fast enough. How do\nthe windows not shatter when the branches grow year by year? How do\nthey keep the trees alive? It’s not possible.”\n“It’s a great disgrace for any family to let their heartwood die,” Tisis\nsaid. “That said, perhaps we should focus on more immediate matters.”\n“Such as?” Kip asked. He stopped. “Oh.”"

He stopped. “Oh.”\nA gallows had come into view. Ten ragged corpses bedecked with rags\nand carrion birds (rioters, no doubt) were hanged beside a familiar man\nwhose trousers alone would have fed those rioters for a month.\n“They hanged Conn Hill?” Cruxer asked. “But why?”\n“Because he offended Kip,” Tisis said, shocked. “They’re that\ndesperate.”\nKip felt a sudden wave of guilt, as when he’d not hidden the money well\nenough and his mother had found it and gone on another binge. After she\nsobered, she’d berate him for failing her.\nConn Hill had been an asshole. Kip had wanted the man out of his sight.\nHe’d guessed the Council of Divines would strip him of his position as\nconn. But this?\nWhat had Kip done?\nThey entered a glorious plaza nearly the size of a hippodrome. It was\npaved with flawless white granite cobbles, and stately buildings in green\nand marble embraced by living wood rose on each side of the square. The\ngrandest was the Palace of the Divines, which lay at the top of thirty wine-\nred marble steps like a pale bloated dictator in his palanquin.\nThe Divines, septuagenarians all, stood at the top of the steps in a\nsemicircle.\nKip was clearly expected to dismount and climb the steps.\nHe rode up the steps.\nDon’t fall off the damn horse. Don’t fall off the damn horse.\nThe horse was sure-footed, though, and it deposited Kip at the top of the\nstairs in the midst of seven scandalized old men and their retinues. The\nMighty had dismounted, and flowed up the steps like a black tide.\nHaving made a small point about how he might not do what they\nexpected, Kip undercut it by striking a demure attitude.\n“Greetings, my lords,” he said with only a tiny smile.\n“Greetings, Lord Guile, Savior of Dúnbheo, Defender of Blood Forest,\nand loyal son of the Seven Satrapies,” an officious, nasally man at one end\nsaid. Kip thought it was Lord Aodán Appleton from Tisis’s briefings. He\ndecided he didn’t like the little stuffed turd.\nThe others echoed him. Several looked openly hostile. Good, those he\ncould trust. They also stood together, like amateurs, like cattle herding close\nto ward off harm. A faction, then.\nAfter dealings at the Chromeria, it was actually refreshing to see one’s\nfriends and enemies do something so kind as to line up so you could tell\nwho was who.\nTime to stir the pot.\nThere were thousands of people gathered in the square, watching,\nthough of course they wouldn’t hear anything that Kip said to the assembled\nlords. Then again, Kip supposed that after weeks and months under siege,\npretty much anything would seem fascinating. Perhaps he couldn’t fault\nthem for looking even to him for entertainment.\nMight as well start out by putting them off balance."

I see\nyou’ve hanged that asshole, um, what’s his… Hill. Conn Hill, wasn’t he?\nWas that for me?”\nThey looked at each other, and some of the gazes were hateful. The\nhateful three of the wimpy herd were Lord Ghiolla Dhé Rathcore (nephew\nof Orea Pullawr), Lord Breck White Oak (third cousin of Karris White\nOak), and Lord Cúan Spreading Oak (grandson of Prism Gracchos\nSpreading Oak and a kitchen maid). Kip guessed that they’d been allies of\nConn Hill. With him dead, their majority on the Council had dissolved.\n“We simply respect you so much that we wished to make your time here\nbefore you take your army to Green Haven as easy as possible, my lord,”\nLord Culin Willow Bough said. He did an unconvincing job of looking\nmournful at the demise of his rival.\nOrholam’s beard, I really am in a backwater. This is what passes for the\nnobility here?\n“I appreciate that,” Kip said. “He was a bastard. I don’t know if I could\nhave worked with him. I’d like to reward whoever’s idea it was. I imagine\nConn Hill had some lands and titles one might redistribute to the worthy?”\n“We don’t often punish a whole family for one man’s miscalc—” Lord\nCúan Spreading Oak said.\n“You don’t often do a lot of things. I think good work should be\nrewarded fairly. Don’t you agree?” Kip asked.\n“We… we all agreed it should be done,” Cu Comán said, speaking for\nthe first time. He was white haired and pale as the dead, a look accentuated\nby a figure as lean as a rapier.\n“Well, I’m not going to split up lands that have a history and a people.\nSatrap Willow Bough will already be irritated with me for this redistribution\nwithout his consent. He and I have bigger things to discuss, but I needn’t\nrub it in his face. I know it wasn’t any of them,” Kip said, pointing to the\nhuddled three. “They look angry and scared, friends of his, no doubt.”\n“Not friends, per se,” Lord Breck said. The others glared at him.\n“It was my idea,” Lord Cu Comán said.\n“He’s not jumping on the credit where he oughtn’t, is he?” Kip asked\nLord Willow Bough and Aodán, as if it were funny.\n“We agreed readily,” Lord Aodán said.\nLord Cu Comán came from the smallest and weakest family on the\nCouncil of Divines. He had no doubt seen this as his big chance to move up.\n“This wasn’t part of some internal politicking, was it?” Kip asked. “This\nwas really for me?”"

A flicker of doubt crossed his face,\nbut it was too late. “A gift.”\n“Hang him,” Kip said.\nThe words hit the rest like a grenado in the face, as the Mighty grabbed\nthe man.\n“Irritating me is not a hanging offense!” Kip bellowed. “But murder is!”\n“What are you—you can’t do this!” Lord Cu Comán said. “What, do\nyou think you’re Gavin Guile himself? You’re just a goddam child! You\ncan’t do this!”\nKip tilted his head. “Funny,” he said, “this city must be special indeed,\nbecause I hear a dead man speaking.”\nBig Leo and Ferkudi dragged the lord down the steps bodily.\n“Stop!” Comán shouted. “Fine! It wasn’t for you! We had a feud with\nthe Hills. Colm had ruined my sister ten years ago. They were engaged to\nbe married and, and, and! He could have made peace, but instead he—”\n“And you thought to use my coming as a cover for your vengeance,”\nKip said.\n“It was my only chance! The Hills were stronger than us. They were\ngoing to get away with it!”\n“Like you almost did,” Kip said from the top of the steps. Everyone\nalways has a good reason why the law shouldn’t apply to them. Quietly, he\nsaid, “Lords Appleton, Willow Bough.”\n“Yes, my lord?” they said quietly.\n“You lied to me.”\n“We said nothing!” Lord Willow Bough said.\n“Indeed,” Kip said. “You let him lie to me, and you stood by silent and\nhoped it would benefit you.”\n“We—we weren’t really lying?” Lord Appleton said.\n“Oh? Let me guess: you were just pulling my leg.”\nThey said nothing.\n“Then now you can pull your friend’s leg. One on each side.”\nThey looked at each other like they didn’t understand.\n“Go,” Kip said. “Pull his legs to help him strangle quickly. He almost\nmade you richer and more powerful; it’s the least you can do in return.”\nLess than a minute later, in utter silence, a noose was thrown over the\ngallows and tied to a saddle. With his hands bound behind his back, Lord\nCu Comán was lifted from the ground by his neck. His legs kicked and\nflailed until Lord Willow Bough and Lord Appleton each grabbed one and\nhugged it to their chests.\nLord Comán tried to kick them free. The body wants to live. But they\nheld on, throwing all their weight into it, and his neck cracked and\nelongated.\nA dark stain blossomed at his groin and spread down to where the lords\nheld him, eyes clenched shut as if they hadn’t felt all the fight go out of him.\nNor did they feel the warm wetness for several long seconds.\nThey stepped back, revulsion and horror painting their faces, and then\nagain as they took in Comán’s head bent too far to one side, his neck\ninhumanly long."

Not that it would have\ndone them much good, but these nobles were men who couldn’t even\nconceive of their privileges being abrogated, or on what those privileges\nrested, so they had no mental recourse when they were.\nThe lords rejoined the circle, holding their hands out, disgusted by the\nfoulness they’d touched and done, but unwilling to wipe them on their\nclothes. Rich men, then, but not so rich as to defile their finest clothes.\nKip said, “I’m going to tell you how things are going to be, and you are\ngoing to surprise me with how quickly you make them happen. Do we\nunderstand each other?” He didn’t wait for an answer. “Here’s what’s first.”\nAnd on Kip’s orders, the family of each of the Seven brought forward its\nchief accountant or secretary. Kip had fourteen horses saddled and waiting.\nIn front of him, so that the lords could send no secret message, each was\nordered to go to his employer’s home or business and retrieve all his\naccount books. He gave no more detail, and each was paired with a trained\naccountant from Kip’s camp.\nWith no idea exactly what Kip was looking for, and no time to forge\naccounts, it would at least minimize the ability to obfuscate. Before the\naccountants left, Kip said, “Oh, and if you’re not back in one hour, both you\nand your lord hang. No excuses.”\n“This, this is preposterous!” Culin Willow Bough said. He was a distant\ncousin of the satrap’s.\n“Yes, that I should need to do this is an outrage,” Kip said. He turned\nsharply to the accountants, who were frozen, wondering if his command\nwould be called off. “One hour, minus one minute,” he said. “Shall I shave\noff another five minutes for impertinence?”\nThey galloped off in every direction.\n“This is… most upsetting, Lord Guile,” Lord Golden Briar said. His\nmoron son Dónal had set a trap for the Blood Robes at the Earthworks of\nMartis. The ambush had been turned back on them, and five thousand of his\nmen were massacred in the muddy maze. He was new to the Council of\nDivines, brought in only hours ago to replace Conn Hill. Doubtless he was\non the side of Willow Bough, Appleton, and Comán, but he hadn’t been\naround long enough for Kip to hold him responsible for anything.\n“For that I apologize,” Kip said. “But the problems here are significant,\nand you seem to be a people who appreciate the value of sharp action, are\nyou not?”\n“I… I suppose,” Lord Golden Briar said uncertainly.\n“Your friends hanged a man within a couple of hours so you could be"

That’s\nsharp action,” Kip said.\n“Yes,” Lord Golden Briar admitted. “It is, my lord.”\nHe didn’t look afraid, and Kip wondered for a moment if he’d hanged\nthe wrong man. But then, Comán had confessed to murder, and you can’t\nhang men simply for being dangerous.\nOr you can, but you have to give up any pretense of morality if you do.\n“I want to know where all the food is,” Kip said.\n“Food?” Lord Appleton asked, as if he hadn’t gotten it through his head\nyet that Kip wasn’t a moron.\nKip said, “I understand hoarding food to take care of your own family\nand household in uncertain times. At some point it gets venal and cruel to\nyour neighbors, but I understand it. But when you’ve got so much set aside\nthat you have no fear of starvation but instead you’re using that food to\nenslave your neighbors—making them trade their own children and their\nown bodies for a crust of bread—for that I have no patience.”\n“There’s no law against being wise enough to buy food before a siege.”\n“No,” Kip said, “but I daresay there are laws against hoarding it and\nthen using your votes as councilors to buy it back from yourselves at ever-\ninflating prices. We call that corruption where I’m from.”\n“We’ve done nothing illegal,” Lord Culin Willow Bough said.\n“Considering that you’ve written the laws in this city and that Satrap\nWillow Bough is probably incapable of providing oversight on the lacing of\nhis boots, that may actually be true,” Kip said. “Your ledger books will tell\nus that.”\n“Those books are private,” Lord Willow Bough said.\nIt had been Tisis who’d given Kip the idea of inspecting their books\noriginally—they’d planned to do that regardless. A marching army needs\nfood and supplies, and the nobles they liberated would have every incentive\nto underreport what they had available. It was Ferkudi who’d been puzzled\nby the scouts’ reports that the city was desperate. This was a rich area that\nhad had a long, long time to prepare for the Blood Robes’ arrival.\nKip had been shocked only at how bad things had gotten, how callous\nthese rich men had become to the suffering of their own people. The plan\nhad always been to spring these changes on the Divines as if Kip were\ncoming up with them off the top of his head—that was the only way to\nmake sure they got no word of it beforehand.\nThey wanted to see him as young and impulsive? He’d play that happily\nenough with one tiny twist—he was young and impulsive and therefore\ndangerous.\n“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Kip said. “You’re going to give me all\nthe food you’ve stockpiled, and half the coin.”\n“Ha!” said Lord Golden Briar. “You’ll have to hang all of us before we\nagree to this outrage!”\n“Oh, I’ll hang you if I must,” Kip said. “But first I’ll let it be known to"

He believed Kip now. “We\nwould never put ourselves at such risk—”\n“But thousands of starving, angry people won’t know that, will they?\nThe mobs will tear apart your homes, steal everything they can lay their\nhands on, and then likely burn them down when they find no food. I should\nthink your families and any servants on the premises won’t fare well, either.\nHeart trees will be cut down before your eyes. In the aftermath, new noble\nfamilies may well have to be chosen.”\nAnd finally, finally, true fear began to trickle into their piggish little\neyes. “You wouldn’t,” Lord Willow Bough said. “You’re one of us. You\nwouldn’t turn your back on fellow lords.”\n“One of you? I’m one of them,” Kip said, pointing to the starving\nhordes, “just in nicer clothes. The entire reason your class exists is so that\nwhen your city falls on hard times, you’re there to feed the starving and\nprotect the vulnerable. In return for that, in peacetime and in plenty, you’re\nallowed to enjoy the fruits of excess. But you’ve not kept your bargain.\nYou’ve not just failed your basic purpose, you’ve betrayed it. You’ve torn\ndown this city and exploited its people when they needed you most. So\nthis… this is my mercy. And it’s the last mercy I’m going to offer you.”\nAnd like that, they were broken. Cúan Spreading Oak and Lord Ghiolla\nDhé Rathcore actually looked ashamed of themselves. But it was Lord\nGolden Briar, the conniver, who hit his knees first.\nEven connivers have their place.\nThe rest dropped to their knees in submission. And Kip pressed on,\nbecause Andross Guile had taught him something: a hard push does the\nmost when a man is already stumbling backward.\n“And here’s my first decree,” Kip said. “Don’t stand until you consent.\nAnyone enslaved in the last ninety days will be freed, immediately. In\naddition, we’re now enforcing the old Slave Code. Anyone caught taking a\nslave or snipping a child’s ear will face death. Families will not be split.\nChildren born to slave parents will be born free and entitled to a freedom\nprice when they reach majority. If you can’t produce papers for any slave\ncurrently owned, they’ll be manumitted. Period. Of those still in bondage\nafter all this, their papers will be revised to show that on the seventh year,\nthe Year of Jubilee, they’ll be granted freedom. That’s five years from now,\nin case you’ve forgotten. Plenty of time to adjust to the new reality. Copies\nof the new contracts will be signed and witnessed by a magistrate and a\nluxiat and be filed here and with the Chromeria.”\nLord Golden Briar, still looking at the ground, whispered, “Are you\ninsane?”\n“Idealistic.

The Luíseach is supposed to be a\nuniter.”\n“I’ve never claimed that title,” Kip said. “I’m just another man trying to\nprotect his people… But others have claimed that name for me, and imagine\ntheir fury at you if you try to tarnish it.”\nA silence stretched out. Then, like a weed too long in the pitiless sun, the\nman shriveled and wilted. “My lord,” Lord Golden Briar said, and he\nreached out his hand to touch Kip’s foot in submission.\nAnd just like that, Kip had a city, and his army had food.\nChapter 73\n“I had hoped to find you in better condition,” the man said.\n“Grinwoody?” Gavin asked, incredulous. “Is that you? Did my father\nsend you? Did something happen to him?”\nThat was the only thing Gavin could guess: that his father had had a\nchange of heart, and sent the old slave to stop Gavin from eating the poison.\n“You may stand, but don’t move forward.”\n“Grinwoody, stop this nonsense.”\n“I’ll kill you if you move toward me, and that would be terribly\ninconvenient for both of us.”\n“What?” Gavin said.\nGrinwoody slid a basket across the ground. There were thin-sliced ham\nand bread and olives and a wineskin inside. Gavin fell on it like a wild\nanimal.\nAfter a few minutes of paradise, as Gavin tried to fight the urge to gorge\nhimself and mostly failed, Grinwoody said, “It turns out I need someone\nwith your particular gifts, Gavin Guile. Or should I say Dazen?”\nThe shock of hearing his real name on the lips of one who shouldn’t\nknow it should have worn off by now, but it still tightened Gavin’s chest.\nSome secrets sink their claws so deep that the shock of their revelation tears\nthose claws out of flesh and leaves scars forever.\n“I should like to talk to you someday,” Grinwoody said, “about\npretending to be someone you’re not. For years and years, pretending. We\nare none of us who we pretend to be. But you and I… we took it to an\nextreme that few people could even imagine, did we not? But the pretense\nchanges you, doesn’t it? I wonder how it changed you, Dazen.”\n“Who are you, then?” Gavin asked. Olives. Dear Orholam, he’d nearly\nforgotten how glorious an olive was. It was impossible to eat and think at\nthe same time.\nWhat in the hells was Grinwoody talking about?\n“I come with a deal for you, Gavin Guile—I presume that’s how you’d\nlike me to refer to you. So much easier that way, isn’t it? Unfortunately, if\nyou don’t take the deal, I’ll have to kill you. I would much prefer to give\nyou a real choice, but perhaps death was the road you were going to choose\nanyway, mm?” He gestured to Gavin’s hand and to the bread hollowed out\non the floor.\n“Death threats!” Gavin said. “How original.”"

Careful not to let it touch\nhis skin, Grinwoody held forth a small jewel of living black luxin, barely\nvisible in the greater and lesser darknesses of the cell. It was attached to\nstraps, somewhat different from the choker band it had sported when Gavin\nfound it.\nAnother hammer blow of fear.\n“That’s the black jewel I recovered from the blue bane, isn’t it?” Gavin\nsaid, voice even.\n“Put it on.”\nGavin didn’t, of course. “What is this?”\n“The White King has learned a little mastery of black luxin, Gavin. And\nwe learned it from him. He says that he can control black luxin everywhere\nin the world. He may even believe it, but it’s a lie. He learned to will-cast\nsimple commands into the black, and we learned from him. Thus, after you\nput it on, if you remove it, it will kill you. Or if you say my name or act\nwhile willing that I be exposed, or if I say the word, or trigger it in a\nnumber of other ways that I won’t bother to tell you, it will kill you. This is\nmy guarantee of your obedience, your compliance with the deal I’m about\nto offer you.”\n“Who are you?” Gavin asked.\n“Upon my majority, my people named me Amalu Anazâr, the Daring\nRebel in Shadows, the Dark Defiant One. More know me as the Old Man of\nthe Desert.”\nGavin almost broke out laughing.\n“Not the response I was expecting,” Grinwoody said. “But then, you\nhave been down here a long time, haven’t you?”\nHe didn’t ask what was funny, which was just as well. Gavin wouldn’t\nhave told him. Both he and his father had unknowingly brought spies as\nclose to themselves as possible—his father an old, withered man, and\nhimself a young, beautiful girl. But both slaves, like a dark and a light\nmirror, had been spies on the Guile men, father and son. Spies serving in\nplaces no one would dare, serving quietly, serving well, and serving\ntraitorously. Both Guiles had been blind to those closest to them.\nPerhaps not funny after all. Perhaps not coincidental, either. Like father,\nlike son. Except Gavin had been protected by the White and his mother.\nThey had chosen a good traitor, in both senses of the word.\nBut that Marissia should be dead while this vile thing lived on was milk\ncurdling in his mouth.\n“So, Old Man. What is it you want?”\n“I direct assassins, Gavin Guile, what do you think I want?”\n“Ha. You. I’m still having a hard time… Who would you want me to\nkill?” Gavin asked suddenly. Who out there would require a washed-up\nformer Prism to kill them?\n“In return for your freedom and your life, you go to White Mist Reef,\nclimb the Tower of Heaven, and kill Orholam.”\nOh, come on, I thought I got to be the crazy one in this room."

Orholam only knew when he’d\nget another chance.\n“I know your seventh goal, Dazen. Maybe this will allow that. Unlikely,\nbut possible.”\n“Are you mad? It’s impossible. All of it. Legends and idiocy.”\n“And yet you’re more irritated that I know your seventh goal.”\nGavin sneered. “I’ve never said it aloud. Never written it once. Barely\neven thought it.”\n“It’s impossible for you not to think it. Great men dream of being the\npromachos. Great drafters dream of being the Prism. What does the greatest\npromachos and Prism of all time dream of?”\nGavin said, “Even if it were true, it’s impossible.”\n“Improbable. But I believe in taking long-odds wagers, and in following\nthem to their end. I’ve arranged everything to give you this one chance.\nAnd, of course, if you choose death, all my work will have been for\nnothing.”\n“And how am I supposed to kill Orholam? With very sharp words? The\ncutting edge of my disbelief? The poison of a Prism’s hypocrisy?”\n“Put this on.” Grinwoody extended the jewel toward Gavin. “Or die.\nNow.”\nThe old Gavin would have taken the opportunity to attack while the\nslave-king had one hand occupied. But Gavin had no strength and one\nclumsy half hand, and he’d seen the old man move. Though aged,\nGrinwoody was a martial artist, and Gavin could barely move. Worse, with\nthe rich food in his stomach, he’d probably just throw up.\nGavin took the jewel.\nAt first glance, he’d assumed the setting had been changed simply so he\ncould wear the jewel lower on his neck than a choker would allow. He’d\nbeen wrong. There were too many straps for that, and they were too short.\nThe glittering black jewel was set through the middle of an eye patch. It\nlooked like a veritable eye of darkness.\n“I took some liberties from the original design,” Grinwoody said. “It\nwill still kill you if you try to remove it. When you bathe, you can hold it in\nyour hand. Just make sure it never loses contact with your skin.”\nGavin put it on. It snugged against his left eyelid tight enough that it\npressed skin into the divot where his pupil lay, lensless. A chill went down\nGavin’s spine, and he wasn’t sure it was entirely natural.\nGrinwoody’s demonically gleeful look of triumph made Gavin want to\npunch him in the face.\n“It’s a good look on you. Follow me,” the old man said.\nHe turned his back on Gavin, utterly dismissive of what had once been\nthe most dangerous man in the world.\n“Guile,” the dead man said. But now he didn’t speak with Gavin’s voice,\nbut what might have been his own guttural growl. “Take me. I’m the only\none who can save you. Touch that black stone in your eye patch to the wall,"

Touch that black stone in your eye patch to the wall,\nand I will make you emperor of this world in truth.”\nGavin could swear that in the black-on-black he could make out a pair of\nhateful gleaming eyes.\nHe smiled into the darkness. “What kind of a raka do you take me for?”\nExpecting claws to dig into his head and pull him back into hell at any\nmoment, Gavin slowly stepped out of the cell.\nAnother step. Another.\n“This way,” Grinwoody said after he swung the door to the black cell\nshut. “There’s… old superstitions among the Braxians that there’s\nsomething terrible below the Chromeria. Like about how you can’t take\nanything out of there, or something cataclysmic would happen. Andross\nwas always very careful to strip and wash before he came out of here. I also\nput an emetic in that food. Just in case. Sometimes old traditions and old\nfears do hide wisdom.”\n“What?” Gavin said. But he already could feel the answer to that in his\nbelly. Orholam have mercy, what did the man think, he’d swallowed a\nstone?\nGrinwoody came to a stop in a small chamber. The Old Man was already\nstripping off his own clothes and washing himself. He gestured to a basin.\nGavin staggered over and was messily sick. But apparently it wasn’t an\nemetic only.\n“Can’t take any risks that you swallowed something,” Grinwoody said.\n“I have somewhere to be. I’ll be back with clothes and real food. Don’t\nforget: you try anything—and I mean even yell—and that black crystal will\ngo straight through your skull.”\nBut Gavin was too busy being sick to even think of escape.\nChapter 74\n“Your lady awaits in the honeymoon chamber, my lord,” Cruxer said.\nThey were not, perhaps, words that should have inspired dread.\nKip blew out a breath. He and Cruxer were virtually alone in the\nCouncil’s chamber, which they’d converted to a war room. It was late. Big\nLeo was the only other person in the room, and he was propped against a\nwall, reading a book.\nThe first night in Dúnbheo, the Divines had either been in disarray or\nhad intentionally snubbed Kip by not having a room made ready. Kip and\nTisis had worked so late they’d simply grabbed the nearest defensible room\nand slept. He didn’t actually care, but he’d known that other people would\n—and that they would take his acceptance of an insult as a sign of weakness\nor barbarity—so he’d made a passing comment about how it was strange a\npeople so famed for their hospitality could make such an oversight.\nTisis had helped, musing that maybe hospitality was more a virtue of the\nrural areas. The palace staff had been mortified. Outclassed by bumpkins?\nUnthinkable.\nThe conveniently dead Lord Comán had been blamed, and the staff had\nbeen almost painfully punctilious. Tonight they had prepared a room that\nwas apparently not simply the city’s finest, but a cultural treasure of some\nsort.\n“Breaker?” Cruxer asked."

Death isn’t the only way we lose people in war.”\nContrary to his promise, Conn Arthur had left immediately, slipping\naway while the rest of the Nightbringers marched into the city. No one had\nseen or heard from him since.\n“It’s not just him,” Kip said. “Sibéal’s gone, too.”\n“Gone? No note?”\n“Nothing,” Kip said. “I don’t know if she went after Conn Arthur or if\nI’m looking at the beginning of a general desertion by the Ghosts.”\n“That’s impossible,” Cruxer said. “Why would they?”\n“Maybe they think if we save Green Haven they’ll be back under the\nChromeria’s thumb and it’ll be the end of them. I don’t know,” Kip said.\n“No. Not gonna happen,” Cruxer said with total certainty.\nKip loved him for that.\n“And this is not something you need to worry about tonight. Sometimes\nyou move heaven and earth, Breaker, and sometimes you just go to bed and\nlet your wife make you happy. Very happy, if the gleam in her eye tells me\nanything.”\n“You’re a moron to keep her waiting,” Big Leo said from the corner,\nspeaking for the first time in hours.\nBut Kip didn’t move. That damned map.\n“There other problems?” Cruxer asked quietly enough Big Leo wouldn’t\noverhear. “I mean, between you and her?”\nKip met his eye and was tempted to tell him everything, but how could\nCruxer understand? And was it any of his business, anyway? “Nah, it’s, it’s\nfine. It’s great.”\nCruxer saw straight through the lie. Kip could tell. But he seemed to\nforgive it immediately. There are things a man just doesn’t want to share\nabout his marriage. “Well, uh, even if there were some, uh, tough things\ngoing on, she didn’t seem in a mood to fight tonight.”\n“Thanks,” Kip said. “I mean, thanks, really.” For putting up with a lie.\nThat wasn’t worthy of me.\n“Nah, I’d say she was in a different mood altogether,” Big Leo said from\nhis corner. Apparently they hadn’t been speaking quietly enough.\nBut that damned map. Tisis had been working with the refugees from all\nover the Forest, all day long, to fill in more reports about the White King’s\nmovements. Kip rewound it and watched the light blossom again,\neverything they had since Ox Ford and even before up to the present.\nHe was missing something.\n“Well, don’t thank me, get a move on,” Cruxer said happily.\nBut Kip didn’t move.

He needed only to make the spear point\nnow, and he wasn’t certain that luxin would make the best material for it.\nHe’d thought about tying a tassel to the spearhead to distract the eye or\nperhaps filling it with off-spectrum brightwater so it would shimmer and\ngleam as it moved, but he hadn’t decided yet.\n“Two things,” Cruxer said.\nKip looked at up at his friend. Cruxer drew a black spearhead from a\nbag.\nNot just black, hellstone. He handed it to Kip. A setting of blackened\nsteel graced the base of the blighted leaf-blade. Kip examined it and then\nthe mantle of the rope spear. They snapped together perfectly.\n“You want to explain this?” Kip asked.\n“The hellstone came from the treasury here.”\nThat wasn’t what Kip was asking, and Cruxer had to know. “Ben-hadad\ndo this?” he asked.\n“We sort of all thought it was about time you were done with that damn\nthing,” Big Leo said, still without looking up from his book.\n“What are you talking about?” Kip asked.\n“Permission to speak bluntly, my lord?” Cruxer asked.\n“Of course.”\n“I mean, really bluntly.”\n“Come on,” Kip said. As if he’d take offense.\n“I figure a good friend gets one free chance to tell you you’re being an\nasshole in your life. And if he’s right, he gets one more.”\n“That is an excellent introduction into whatever you’re about to tell me,”\nKip said.\n“Are you just tolerating that amazing fucking woman down the hall\nthere, hoping you can trade her for Teia someday? Grow some balls, man.\nMake a choice. You know we all love Teia. You know we do. But you’re\nbeing an asshole to a woman who is better than I think you appreciate.”\n“I appreciate her!” Kip protested.\n“The question, Breaker,” Big Leo said, looking up from his book, his\nfeet still propped up, “isn’t if you appreciate her. It’s whether you’re an\nasshole or a moron.”\n“What are you talking about?” Kip said. “Wait, is this about the rope\nspear? Are you joking? You think I’ve been making this for Teia?”\nBig Leo closed his book, sighed, and walked toward the door.\n“I’m glad you all have been so thoroughly won over by my wife,” Kip\nsaid to Cruxer. “But you’re sadly mistaken about the whole rope spear\nthing.”\nCruxer looked at him flatly. “Yes, my lord.”\nKip looked at him, peeved. Of course, if they’d been mistaken, then\nmightn’t she…\nAnd then he thought of all the times Tisis had seemed disappointed or\nhurt when he’d pulled out his little project to work on. Surely she couldn’t\nhave made the same mistake.\nOh hells. She thought he hadn’t really chosen her.\nHadn’t chosen her? Come on!

It was an\nimpressive distance from the mirror room, farther than she’d thought\npossible. Either Murder Sharp had just arrived, or he was a better paryl\ndrafter than she had known.\nShe rubbed her face with her hands, as if she could scrub away fear as\neasily as she could rub fog off a window. It was about as effective. She\nchecked quickly that no one could possibly see her in the stairwell, but of\ncourse the path to the mirror room was abandoned on the night of a new\nmoon. Seeing it was safe, she made the sign of the seven, splaying her\nfingers to touch forehead, eyes, and mouth, then tapping them to heart and\nhands. The deeper she’d gotten into the secrets of the Order through the\nwinter and into this spring, the more she needed to make an outward show\nof her own beliefs. The deeper she fell into the pits of heresy, the more\northodox she was becoming. But fear fogs the windows again at any\nhesitation, so there was time for only one sign and one breath prayer.\nOrholam, let your light guard me in this darkness.\nIt didn’t seem to do anything, but she kicked through the trip wire\nanyway. She walked down the hallway quietly, as if she didn’t know her\nentrance had been announced. There was another trip wire outside the door.\nShe paused, then stepped over it, opening the door slowly.\nThe door squeaked. Of course it did.\nShe let out a cloud of paryl from her fingertips.

Having will touch will unexpectedly was\nlike having a stranger walk up to you and caress your face with both hands\n—not violent, but still violating.\nHe was invisible again. Heart straining, chest tight, she strained to hear\nthe whisper of cloth on cloth that would be her sole warning of his attack.\nBut then the figure shimmered into visibility, and Murder Sharp flung\nback his hood.\n“You made one mistake,” he said.\n“Mistake?”\n“When I was a younger man,” Sharp said, “I fancied myself to be\nformidable. I flattered myself that I was scary.”\nSharp had changed again in all the months he’d been gone. His hair had\ngrown out and, while still short, had been trimmed neatly in a swept style\npreferred by some young nobles, and it was dyed to auburn from its\nprevious fiery red. His naturally golden eyes had been colored somehow to\nbrown—lenses that sat on the eye itself? Was such a thing possible? The\nscleras of his eyes were red from the irritation of wearing them, but no more\nthan a haze smoker’s.\nWorse, he wore the white uniform and gold insignia of a Lightguard\ncaptain.\n“I had to be reined in,” he said. “Violently. I was bitter about it for a\ntime, but now I see that every gem needs to have its rough edges chipped\naway before the stone can be polished to gleam.”\nHe reached up to his mouth, fingering his immaculate teeth. And then he\npulled out the dentures with a sucking sound and a dribble of spit. He\nexamined the human teeth on his dentures with a craftsman’s eye, scrubbing\nat some imperceptible imperfection on the dogtooth, then tucked the\ndentures away in a special box.\nFrom a pocket, he produced another box, but he didn’t open it\nimmediately.\n“But you. You, Adrasteia, I don’t think the Old Man will be as gentle\nwith you as he was with me.”\nHe smiled at her then, revealing his natural, broken teeth. Like an\nancient circle littered with toppled stones where once there had been\nsymmetric perfection, half incisors and dogtooth nubs slumped in front of\nshattered and missing molars.\n“Only pain makes us sharp,” Murder Sharp said. “Only pain makes a\nSharp.”\nHe opened the other box he’d taken from his pocket and lifted a new set"

Fox\nfangs here. Quicker than weasel-bears, and can hide in plain sight, despite\nthat ginger coat.” He smiled his ruined smile again. “And all the rest are\npiranha fangs, from the rivers of Tyrea that flow into the far ocean. Piranha\nare frightening by themselves. River pugilists. Jaw like a bare-knuckle\nfighter. But nothing wants to tangle with ’em when they swarm. That’s the\nOrder, Teia. A river full of piranha with weasel-bears on the banks and\nfoxes in the rushes.”\nHe tested the edges of the weasel-bear fangs.\n“There’s this rare fish in those waters. Damn thing feeds on piranhas.\nFront fangs this long. Gorgeous, gorgeous fangs.” He sighed. “But too long\nto fit in a human mouth, sadly. I tried. Bloodied my mouth half a dozen\ntimes before I learned. So I settled for the piranha fangs instead. Thought it\nwas appropriate, the predator that everyone fears in turn fears one—only\none.”\n“The Old Man.”\n“The Old Man,” he agreed.\n“Are you going to break out my teeth like he broke out yours?” she\nasked, gulping against the bile rising in her throat.\nHe laughed softly, exposing those weathered plinths and jagged spires of\ntooth stumps again. “You think he did this to me?”\nMurder Sharp took out a handkerchief and bit down on it. Methodically\nhe worked it around his mouth, keeping his lips back, drying his teeth. He\npulled back the blue luxin protective strips from an adhesive lining and then\ncarefully fit the fang dentures into his mouth. He moved his jaw back and\nforth and took a few experimental bites to see how the fangs meshed,\ncareful to keep his lips clear. His eyes clouded over with something like\nbliss.\n“No,” he said several moments later. “He told me he’d found my\ndisobedience. He told me only pain makes us sharp. Then he gave me the\ntooth breaker and told me to get out.”\nYou broke out your own teeth?

She’d been so focused on Sharp, she hadn’t even\ndreamed there could be someone else up here. It was he.\n“He came back swollen, and bloody. But he came back with the job\ndone.

Why?” she asked, not able to keep the surprise from her voice.\n“The White paid all his debts, right around the time you became a\nBlackguard. She had no reason to do that.”\nThere was no pretending ignorance, not with the Old Man. No\ndeflection. “She told me it was normal to look into Blackguard scrubs’ lives\nto see if there were any ways enemies could exploit them, turn them. I was\nshocked, too. But she said she was dying and had no heirs, and her wealth\ncould at least do some good.”\n“You never told the other Blackguards about it.”\n“Well, none of the ones on your payroll, apparently,” Teia said. She\nsounded like a snotty kid even to herself.\nMurder Sharp tensed at her disrespect, and she made a soothing gesture.\n“Easy. Sorry. Look, I didn’t tell anyone. Look.” She took a breath. “We\nall came from different places, and some of us talk about our pasts and\nsome don’t. They can see my ear. They know I was a slave. A fair number\nof the girls who came from that life… well, we don’t volunteer much, and\nthe others don’t ask. There’s everything from orphans to nobles’ children in\nthe Blackguard. I thought that by telling what she’d done for me I would\nsound like I was bragging. But yes, absolutely, it meant the world to me.”\n“Enough to buy your loyalty?”"

But yes, absolutely, it meant the world to me.”\n“Enough to buy your loyalty?”\n“As a slave, I’m pretty attuned to people trying to buy me, thanks. It\nwasn’t that. She wasn’t using her money to put me in her debt, not\nprecisely. To her, the money was negligible. The effort and the care were\nthe real expenses. She was a great woman, and she was kind to me. I know\nshe was clever, too, but I saw no falsehood in it.”\n“But it was enough to buy your loyalty all the same,” the Old Man said.\n“If you have to put it like that, yes. Like you ‘bought’ mine by melting\ndown all those silver items I stole that Lady Crassos was using to blackmail\nme, I suppose.”\nHe chuckled and wagged a finger. “Point. Very clever, very true. Did it\nwork?”\n“It did, until now,” she said gloomily. No, it had never worked. It had\nalways been clear to her that she was working with monsters.\n“We killed Orea,” the Old Man said. “Specifically, Murder did. Your\nmaster. That a problem for you?”\nTeia flinched. As soon as the old woman had come up, she’d been\ndesperately searching her mind for any time Murder had mentioned her, and\nif she was supposed to know that the Order had killed her—but all her\ninformation had come from sources the Order couldn’t—shouldn’t—know\nabout. “I suspected as much,” she said.\n“But you never asked. Despite feeling loyalty to her,” Sharp asked\nskeptically.\n“I cared about her, yes. But she was old, dying already. I wasn’t going to\nask about it until I knew you trusted me. I look forward. Why risk my own\nneck for someone who’s already dead?” It seemed so easy, somehow, here\nin the darkness, to talk and think like those who were empty.\n“This,” the Old Man said. “From a girl who likes to hold grudges?\nYou’re not angry at me or Sharp?”\n“Oh hell yes! I’ve got a list of things I’m furious at you for,” Teia said.\n“But I’m not an idiot. Being mad at you isn’t like being mad at your\nneighbor who gets loudly drunk every night after you go to bed; it’s like\nbeing mad at the weather. Raise your fist to your neighbor, you might\nchange things. Raise your fist to the sky, and you’re a fool.”\nHe seemed to appreciate the flattery. But then he walked over to one of\nthe great mirrors on the east side of the tower. It was blackened, burnt—not\njust soot on the glass, but the silver backing itself was mottled and melted,\nruined. “I asked you to meet us here for two reasons: The lightwells are\nhandy to dispose of a corpse if necessary—we can’t disappear a\nBlackguard, and slipping down these is easy enough that it could be\naccidental. Second, for this. I like physical illustrations when I can afford\nthem.” He patted the mirror. “Do you know how this happened?” he asked.\n“Sir? No.”\n“No one does. It happened during the executions on Orholam’s Glare—"

It happened during the executions on Orholam’s Glare—\nwhich is when anything would fail, one imagines. The intensity of that light\nscared off no few of our newest members. The caretakers of these mirrors\nare slaves, of course, but highly prized, intelligent, taken excellent care of,\nlike the Blackguards themselves. They swore it must be sabotage, for they\nwould never, never leave so much as a smudge on one of the great mirrors,\ncertainly not before such a grand occasion. Others claim it was the djinn\nhimself who reached his will up and smote the mirror, but that he couldn’t\nbreak even one before he died.\n“Carver Black himself hasn’t been able to replace it. The backup mirrors\nappear on their lists of inventory they purchased years ago, but not in their\nstorehouses. Not our work, actually, just old-fashioned corruption—\nsomeone long ago lining their pockets. Creating new mirrors of the quality\nneeded to replace this one has been impossible because of the war. They\nrequire Atashian or Tyrean glass and silver from the Karsos Mountains\nbonded by one of three lens makers in Ru. So here it sits, long months after\nits failure. Marginally useful, kept in place mostly because the other mirrors\nneed the counterweight, not because it does much of anything. It failed its\npurpose. Perhaps it never should have been put in service in the first place.”\nHe stepped away from it. “I don’t want you to fail me, Adrasteia. I won’t\nallow it. So I will test you to your limit, and perhaps beyond.”\nHe took a breath, studying her, and she held herself still and reflective as\nsilver. Let him see only himself in me, she thought.\nThen he said, “Your father is here. On the Jaspers.”\nAnd suddenly the cloud of danger suffusing the room like paryl gas\ncrystallized in Teia’s chest, choking her heart. Father? Here? He’d\nmentioned coming to the Jaspers in that letter last year that Orea Pullawr\nhad shown her, but Teia’d never imagined he’d actually follow through on\nit.\nAnd the Order had known about him before anyone.\n“I want you to prove yourself. I want you to earn my trust like Elijah\nhere did.”\nNo, no, no.\nThe Old Man said, “Only pain makes us sharp. Only pain makes a\nSharp. Are you ready, Teia? Ready to become a Shadow? Ready to become\nmy left hand as Murder is my right?”\nMurder Sharp’s eyes were orbs of midnight. Teia couldn’t expand her\nown eyes without his seeing it, couldn’t look for the paryl that she knew\nmust be around and through her right now like a choking cloud. Any move\nthat so much as smelled like hostility would mean death now. “We’re your\nfamily now, Adrasteia,” Sharp said.\n“To become Teia Sharp, you must sever the last link of your loyalty to\nany other before us,” the Old Man said. “You’ll be given one hour to say\nyour goodbyes, and then you’ll kill your father. You’ll be well paid for this.\nThe rest of your family will be taken care—”"

You’ll be well paid for this.\nThe rest of your family will be taken care—”\n“Fuck you,” Teia said. “No. Never.”\nMurder Sharp growled, bestial behind his fangs, but the Old Man held\nup a gloved finger to him. “Refusal is failure. Refusal is death, child.”\n“Then kill me,” she said. She turned her back and started walking away.\nIt was the longest walk of her life, those steps to the door. They stretched\nout as if she were trekking across the great deserts of the Broken Lands,\nhope as distant as water.\nBut nothing happened. It was a torture in itself. She reached the door\nand put her hand on the latch.\n“Stop,” the Old Man said softly.\nShe turned. He could have stopped her easily enough with Sharp’s skills.\nApparently the Old Man was used to the force of his personality doing more\nthan any magic could.\n“There are only two kinds of people who will agree to commit patricide\n—unless they are victims of horrific abuse, in which case all bets are off.\nBut we know your father was no abuser. Those willing patricides? Spies\nwho have no intention of obeying, and those soulless folk who are willing\nto betray anyone because they are only capable of feigning loyalty, not\nfeeling it. The Order excises both kinds of cancer without remorse. You see,\nAdrasteia, the thing that makes the Order great is that we are able to do the\nmonstrous without becoming monsters. A girl who will kill her father for\nnothing more than her own ambition is a viper, and anyone who takes a\nviper to his breast deserves the bites he gets.”\n“You’re telling me this was another test?” Teia asked. “Are you f—” She\nwrestled the words down. How many could she pass? What kind of lunatics\nwere these people? How many times could she gamble her life before she\nlost just once?\n“And your tests aren’t finished,” the Old Man said.\n“I can’t do this forever,” Teia said.\n“One more. One last test. One test that will make you a Sharp. One I\nwould entrust to no one else.”\nHow many Shadows do you actually have? Teia suddenly wondered.\n“So what is it? What do you want me to do?” she asked.\n“Perhaps it just got old. Perhaps it simply… gave up.” He stared again at\nthe blackened mirror, and then he put a gentle hand on it. “The backbone of\nthe Order’s rising power is the shimmercloaks, Teia. Our assassins are\nfrightening, where we have them, but the Shadows are terrifying. No one is\nsafe from you. That power has two limits—there are few paryl drafters,\nthough more than you might think—and fewer shimmercloaks. It means I\nhave to think long and hard before sending Shadows on truly risky\nmissions, because while the men and women wearing them can be replaced,\nthe cloaks cannot.\n“There’s a man, Teia, who’s going to go do something vitally important\nfor me. You’re to help him in any way you can. Then, after he’s done it,\nyou’re going to recover whatever weapons he’s carrying, and you’re going"

Just in case he fails—or succeeds in a way I’ve not foreseen.\nYou’ll kill him with this dagger, and you’ll do it while he’s awake. Not\ndrugged, not asleep. Only awake will this dagger capture his will. You will\nstow away in his ship, and you will be given the Fox cloak to help you.\n“You’re going to kill a man after he’s served you?” Teia asked.\n“A poor thanks indeed, I agree. But this man is far, far too dangerous to\nbe allowed to live. He would, after this service, hunt us all.”\nAnd then she had a stomach-turning intuition. Who had served the\nOrder, and was now too dangerous to be allowed to live? Ironfist.\nBut Ironfist wasn’t here, was he? She’d heard some rumor that he’d\nbecome King Ironfist. Another that he was coming to the Chromeria for\nsome diplomatic discussion.\nCould he have come already? By skimmer?\nAnd what? Been kidnapped by the Order, just like that? Sure, they’d\ndone it with Marissia, but Ironfist?\n“If you succeed, you will keep the Fox cloak permanently, and I will\nreturn your father to you. He will not only be allowed to come or go as he\npleases, he will go home with papers of membership in some very\nimportant traders’ blocs with some very important monopolies. In short, he\nwill go home a very wealthy man.”\n“Or not at all,” Teia said. “If I disobey.”\nHe brought his fingertips together and nodded. “And as for you, I’ve\nalready prepared how to explain your absence. You will return to the\nBlackguard seamlessly, with very few questions asked.”\n“My absence?” Teia asked.\n“Only pain makes a Sharp, Teia. You’ll understand when you see who\nyou’re being asked to kill.”\nSo it was Ironfist. Please, Orholam, no.\nTeia was that damned mirror. This was her great test, and the heat was\ntoo much for her. She was deforming, chipping, cracking. Or this demon\nbefore her was smashing her with his will. In all the time she’d had, she\nhadn’t tracked down the Order’s membership, hadn’t retrieved the secrets\nbound up in ribbon, hadn’t found the Old Man’s office, much less broken\ninto it. She’d murdered all those slaves for nothing.\nHer father’s life against the life of someone who was serving the Order?\nSome traitor?\nWhat if it was Ironfist? But Teia couldn’t save Ironfist if she wanted to.\nShe couldn’t save herself, now.\nBut she could save her father.\n“There’s a ship, The Golden Mean. You get aboard secretly and then\nhide belowdecks until you’re well under way. The crew all belongs to me,\nbut Captain Gunner is… unpredictable. You come back as Teia Sharp, or\ndon’t come back at all,” the Old Man said. He held forth a slender black\nknife that looked like writhing smoke in his hand.\nShe took the black dagger.\nChapter 76"

He held forth a slender black\nknife that looked like writhing smoke in his hand.\nShe took the black dagger.\nChapter 76\n“Ah, good, you live.” Grinwoody came in the room with fresh clothes and a\nbasket of food.\nGavin was quivering on the floor. The vomiting had turned to dry heaves\nquickly enough, and the stomach cramps from the diarrhetic had passed\nsome time ago. He’d been weakly sponge bathing himself since then. He\nwas mostly clean now, for all the good that did him.\nGrinwoody gave him water first. Gavin rinsed his mouth of the residual\ntaste of vomit and spat it out. Then real food and clothes.\nNor did the old man rush him. But finally, when Gavin was feeling\nwarm and full for the first time in a year, and a little tipsy from what could\nhave only amounted to a single cup of wine, the counterfeit slave motioned\nit was time to go.\nThey left everything. “I’ll burn it later,” Grinwoody said.\nWithin a dozen paces out into a dim hall, he pushed against a section of\nwall, and a secret door opened on unseen hinges, silently.\n“What’s this?” Gavin asked.\n“I made another gamble, months ago. I bet that you would end up in the\nblack cell eventually, because I know your father.”\nThe narrow tunnel ascended sharply, barely wide enough for Gavin’s\nturned shoulders to pass, and so short that he had to stoop to walk. But there\nwas no stopping. He felt as if the darkness were chasing him with eager\nfingers.\nIn minutes, they emerged into an empty little hut with curtains drawn. In\npiles, and hanging from hooks, and standing in towers, were pitch and\nscrapers and lines and buoys and more lines and lanterns and various other\nimplements for the keeping of ships. Gavin guessed it was one of the boat\nkeepers’ shacks at the Chromeria’s back dock. It was still dark out, but a\nhint of light trickled around the cracks in the walls and around the curtains,\nhinting at coming dawn.\nGrinwoody picked up a wrapped bundle. “You asked before how you’re\nto do it.” He grinned. “If one is to kill a god, one must be properly armed.”\nThen Grinwoody—the hidden Old Man of the Desert, Anazâr—unwrapped\na sword that was not a sword. Its blade was long, light, thin, with twin black\nwhorls crisscrossing around each of seven shining jewels, one for each\ncolor, though to Gavin’s eye they were a uniform brightness and tone.\nAlong its spine was a thin musket barrel, except for the last hand’s breadth,\nwhich was only a sweeping blade that served as both sword point and\nbayonet. The Blinding Knife.\nTo cover his sudden fear, Gavin said, “You old bastard. You know my\nfather wants this more than anything in the world, right?”\n“Of course.”\n“And what do you think happens when I pass the impassable reef, climb\nthe tower that’s probably just a trick of the light, climb the footstool of the\nLord of Light himself, and stab him with this?”\nGrinwoody grinned an arrogant grin. Shook his head. “Are you really as"

Knowing what\nyou know? Having done what you’ve done? Orholam is no god. It is merely\nthe nexus of this world’s magic. It’s not sentient. It’s not a person or a\ngodhead. It is the wobbling, unbalanced axle around which all magic\nrotates. It is the center that cannot hold.\n“If you destroy this nexus men call Orholam, you kill magic itself. It\nwill be an end of the tyranny of the Chromeria and an end to the magical\nstorms that have devastated our world for millennia beyond counting. It will\nend the world putting one man in power while another is his slave—merely\nbecause the first can do magic. For that hope, for that hope for justice, I\nhave wagered everything.”\n“Regardless of the cost?” Gavin asked.\n“The cost to do nothing is greater.”\n“You really think the Blinding Knife will blind God himself.”\n“This is the problem with erasing your own history, as the Chromeria\nhas done, never trusting its own with dangerous knowledge: sometimes the\nmost dangerous things are exactly what you need to save yourself.”\n“What are you talking about?” Gavin asked. Erasing history? Was this\nsome kind of Order conspiracy theory?\n“How I would love to sit and talk with you for an afternoon and tell you\nall the parts of your reign you owe to me, and all the things you\nmisinterpreted through the decades. It would be better if your father were\nthere, too, for he’s been the more substantial foe by far. But we have little\ntime. Dawn comes, and light waits for no man, am I right?” He peeked out\nthe curtain, then dropped it back in place.\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about. What are your demands?”\n“Do you remember this?” Grinwoody asked. He upended a black velvet\nbag into his hand, and a jewel the color of midnight dropped into his hand.\nIt somehow radiated darkness, or sucked light into itself. It was living black\nluxin, but it was something more. If the black luxin in Gavin’s eye patch\nwas a child of eternal darkness, this was Mother Night herself.\n“The black seed crystal,” Grinwoody said. “You remember now?”\n“I have… no memory of that.” Except that he felt an instinctive fear and\nrevulsion at the sight of it. It was too painful to even behold.\n“You created this. At Sundered Rock.” Grinwoody pushed back a curtain\nfrom a window and looked out at the water. Then he turned again to Gavin.\n“Or perhaps this is an older one. You see, the Chromeria used to deny that\nseed crystals exist—even while they hoarded them. The seed crystals call\ntheir color of drafters to themselves—which is why, unknowing, drafters\nhave always come here for their teaching. But uncontrolled, unchecked,\nthey create the bane, and the bane call wights much more powerfully.\n“The Chromeria likes to believe that there’s only one seed crystal of\neach color. As if one can wish that there should be only one volcano, or one\nhurricane, or one earthquake—because one is devastating enough. The truth"

The truth\nis, any sufficiently powerful drafter can create one, like you did at Sundered\nRock. Or they can spontaneously appear, as they have recently, if there’s too\nmuch of their color. Maybe it’s random, maybe it coalesces around a drafter\nof that color, like the first crystal in a freezing pond—what does it matter?\nWhen you create the right conditions, the bane appears. And the conditions\nnow? Without you balancing? It’s like all magic is a pond below freezing,\nwaiting for that first crystal. Only death can follow, Dazen Guile.”\n“Oh, good, here I was thinking things looked grim.”\nGrinwoody stared at him, unsmiling. “Apparently that irreverence has\nhelped keep you alive and sane. I hope it continues to work for you.”\nGavin swallowed, flippancy gone. “So what does the black do? Does it\nmake a black bane?”\n“I’ve never heard of such a thing, but then, they’d have erased that, too,\nif such didn’t spontaneously erase themselves from men’s memories as your\nconflagration at Sundered Rock did. No, Dazen, I’m not going to tell you\nany more. All you need to know is this…”\nHe balanced the sword on the floor, tip down, and set the black seed\ncrystal on its pommel. It sank into the pommel, melted, and a change rushed\nover the entire surface of the sword. What had been black and white\nentwined now shimmered with darkness. As Grinwoody turned the blade,\nentire sections dulled in the light as if they were a polarized lens.\n“… you find the nexus of magic, and you stab the Blinding Knife into it.\nI don’t care if it’s a thing or a person or God himself. You kill it, and our\ndeal’s complete.”\nSimple.\n“Why me?” Gavin asked. “You’ve got dozens? Hundreds? of people\nloyal unto death to you.”\n“The Blinding Knife’s powers can only be activated by a Prism.\nClimbing the tower was once a pilgrimage open to all, but after Vician’s\nSin, the priests at White Mist Reef created magical locks on the tower to\nkeep drafters from reaching the top—to protect the nexus, you see? There’s\na magical lock at each level, a blue lock to block blue drafters, a red to\nblock reds, and so forth. So only a non-drafter will be able to reach the top\nof the tower.”\n“How do you know this?”\n“The Chromeria has always tried but failed to gain a monopoly on old\nknowledge. We Braxians have protected our own histories.”\n“But if there are locks, surely there’s one for black.”\n“Not according to the records. Either black resists being formed in such\nways, or the priests felt black defiled them to use. That’s why they formed\nthe reef instead—failing to keep out the worst, they decided to keep out\neveryone.”\n“But you don’t know if this will work.”\n“Of course not. But I do know that you’re the only person in the world\nwho has a chance,” Grinwoody said. “Only a non-drafter can reach"

It was like staring\ndown an infinite chasm now, where before it had been like staring at the\nsun. Each was too terrible to behold for long.\nIt felt hungry.\n“So let’s pretend I’m an enthusiastic participant,” he said. “How am I\nsupposed to get through White Mist Reef? You have drafters who can\nhandle a skimmer?”\n“I sent a skimmer already. It shattered in the stresses passage through the\nreef put on it. I’m sending you on a normal ship.

Gavin followed him out onto the\nChromeria’s back dock. In the lightening gray of dawn, a magnificent white\nship with a glimmering sheen was docked at the quay, but Gavin barely had\na moment take it in.\n“My friend!” a voice boomed out of Gavin’s past. The human avatar of\nbraggadocio ambled down the quay in an open jacket with no tunic beneath,\nwild hair, baggy trousers, and a huge, crooked-toothed grin.\n“Gunner,” Gavin said. “Of course it’s you.”\n“You look worst hand lass time,” Gunner said. Gavin thought it was a\ncrack about his missing fingers at first, but then he translated: ‘Worse than\nlast time.’\nBut then Gunner stopped suddenly, stricken. His eyes were fixed on\nGavin’s eye patch as if it were a serpent that might strike him. “What’s with\nthe evil eye? Is it bad luck?”\n“Only for our enemies,” Grinwoody said.\n“Indeed?” Gunner asked Gavin, still disconcerted. The man could be\nchildlike in his superstitions.\n“Troth,” Gavin said.\n“Diggity.

I’ll keep my\ndeal,” he said, recovering his swaggering tone. “Gunner abides his bets.”\nGrinwoody lifted his eyebrows at the man’s insouciance, but said\nnothing.\nGavin said, “You gambled for this?”\n“Nah… Sorta… I s’pose you could say… Yes. So you see, arter I lost\nthe first time—my ante the gun-sword, his the ship yonder—he asked me if\nI wanted to go double or nothin’.

That was one way to put it.\n“Not so loud, please,” Grinwoody said, glancing back toward the\nChromeria looming above them all.\n“Can’t wait to show you my new girl!” Gunner said. “Guile! Brother! If\nwe pull this off, we’ll be legends!”\nGavin sighed. “Gunner… we’re already legends.”\nGunner winked. “That’s Cap’n Gunner to you.”\nGavin looked up at the Chromeria looming above him. Somewhere up\nthere was Karris. She was this close. She was on this island, greeting this\ndawn, and she would never know he was here.\nHe was about to get on a ship and leave—going to his death, no doubt—\nand she would never know he’d been this close.\nAll that stuff about controlling the black luxin in Gavin’s eye patch\ncould be a bluff. Could be. But the Order was here, armed, unstoppable,\nstanding behind everyone and everything he loved.\nGrinwoody laid the Blinding Knife out over his palms. “Let me make\nsomething clear, Guile. I have watched you for decades now. I have seen\nyou prevaricate and charm. I have seen you baffle and obfuscate. I have\nseen you stand steady as a mountain and then dodge the inevitable with the\ngrace of a bull dancer. I have seen you appear to lose, only to emerge\nquietly victorious years later. Some would see you as diminished by the loss\nof your drafting. I don’t accept that. So let me tell you this, as a man who\nfully appreciates the powers of his opponent, and the dire position I’m\nputting that resourceful man in: I don’t know if Orholam can be destroyed,\nbut I expect you to find a way to do it. I expect you to turn your whole heart\nand mind and soul to accomplishing it. If you fail, I will kill everyone you\nlove. Her first.” He cast his eyes up toward the Prism’s Tower where Karris\nmust be. “If anything happens to me or you reveal me, she dies. If she\ndisappears, one of those she trusts enough to take with her will be mine, and\nshe will die. If any of a hundred things happens that is not your obedience\nand success, I will take away every bright and happy thing in this world that\nyou know.\n“On the other hand,” he said, his voice taking on a happy tone as if he\nhadn’t been threatening Gavin a moment before, “if you succeed, you will\nbe the man who changed the world forever. Who, indeed, saved the world.”"

Or a chance?”\nLooking into Grinwoody’s black orbs—no, Anazâr’s, there was nothing\nof the sniveling slave in this man—Gavin believed him completely. There\nwas no weaseling out of this. No third way. No drafting something so\naudacious that no one else had ever dreamed of it to escape.\nPerhaps it was a measure of Gavin’s stubborn arrogance, even here, even\nnow, reduced to this, that his thought wasn’t of how impossible it all was.\nHe thought, But what if I succeed?\nMagic was lost to him, but that was very different from killing magic\naltogether. Everything he’d done and built and dreamed and created had\nbeen because of and with magic. The whole society. His family’s wealth\nand privilege. His living while his brother died. The skimmers. The condor.\nGrinwoody couldn’t be right… but what if he was?\nWhistling a melodious little trill, Gunner nudged him. “C’mon, what’ll it\nbe? Death or glory?”\nGavin rubbed the eye patch, and the touch of the black luxin jewel sent\nunpleasant tingles through his fingers and down his wrist. He pulled his\nhand away. As the snowy-fingered dawn reached across the sky like a thief,\nhe grabbed the dark Blinding Knife and said, “Let’s sail. Death and glory,\nCap’n Gunner.”\n“Death or glory. Or,” Gunner said.\nNot likely.\nHe cast his eyes up at the tower. Goodbye, Karris. Farewell, my love.\nChapter 77\n“We’ve got a skimmer of Blackguards back, High Lady,” Samite reported\nas she strode into Karris’s staterooms. There was none of the usual levity\nfrom the square-shouldered woman. “There are casualties.”\nKarris broke off another damned negotiation for black powder with\nrepresentatives of the Ilytian pirate kings—now with a pirate queen added\nin for variety—and left immediately.\nIn minutes they were in the infirmary. Chirurgeons and luxiats bustled\nthrough a ward of gleaming white stone. The infirmary was ablaze with\nlight all hours of the day and night. The sun’s rays were believed to have\nhealing properties. Because that meant it was substantially warmer than\nother floors of the Prism’s Tower, it was held that the servants and luxiats\nhere were allowed shortened sleeves and hemlines because of the heat.\nThe truth was grimmer, told in the runnels and gutters in the infirmary\nfloor: short sleeves and hems don’t drag in blood. In its long history, the\nChromeria had seen its share of war and pestilence.\nKarris composed herself as she walked.

She must be a pillar for\nothers to lean on, never needy, never surprised, never weak. Iron.\nThe rooms were surprisingly sedate. Karris hadn’t been down here since\nthe last training accident more than a month ago, when two teenaged nunks\nended up with scars across their faces from an explosive they’d created—\nwith one blinded permanently.\nThese days the infirmary was double staffed—evidence of Carver\nBlack’s early preparations for the war—but it faced hardly more than the\nusual number of injuries, even as the war training of drafters had continued\nthrough the last year.\nGiven the scarcity of other patients and their elevated status, the\nBlackguards had been given their own room. Most of the injuries were\nminor: a burn that had seared Gill Greyling’s sleeve to his bicep, a cut\nacross Jin Holvar’s back, an arrow stuck in Presser’s buttock that would be\nfunny someday if it didn’t get infected. But for once, there was no humor,\nno attempts at levity.\nGavin Greyling lay on a table surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\nNot a one didn’t have a hand on him. He was stripped to the waist, but\nKarris saw no wounds on the teenager.\nKarris came to stand by his head and put a hand on the dark, sweaty skin\nof his chest. She looked to his elder brother Gill, who winced as a\nchirurgeon ripped the fabric away from his own wound and pressed a\nbandage to it. The young man never moved his reassuring hand from his\nbrother’s arm. So what was Gavin’s wound?\nWith a groan, Gavin Greyling opened his eyes to see who had just\ntouched him. And Karris knew.\nThe sclera of his dark eyes were littered with the glowing blue\nfragments of his broken halos.\n“Ah fuck,” Karris said, forgetting everything she’d just prepared.\nIt seemed to be the right thing to say, though. The Blackguards nodded\nand grumbled, and Gavin Greyling smiled weakly at her.\n“Broken, huh?” he said. “They didn’t want to tell me. I could feel it,\nthough. Something wrong, something let loose in me. Shit.”\n“Shit,” Karris agreed. The cat was out of the bag now. What did it\nmatter? These were her people: they would forgive her for remembering\nshe’d been a Blackguard first.\n“Ambushed us,” Gavin Greyling said. “We were looking for\nPromachos.”\n“Of course you were,” Karris said. Orholam have mercy. They’d been\nlooking for her husband. Quietly.\nOfficially, Andross Guile had stopped sending out Blackguards to look\nfor Gavin. They were overworked already, and didn’t need their deaths\nhastened by drafting more. Other eyes and ears had taken on those duties,\nsearching foreign capitals and rival houses for any whisper of him.\nThe Blackguards were professionals. They weren’t supposed to have\nfavorites.\nBut they’d loved Gavin Guile. Quietly. They’d loved him. They would\nnever give up on him.\nShe had to hold back sudden tears.

Gavin Greyling was only eighteen\nyears old. He’d been named after her husband. He’d lived to protect him.\nNow he was dying for him.\nShe didn’t ask if they’d found anything. Of course they hadn’t. Asking\nwould only drive home the waste of it. This young man was dying for\nnothing. But his intentions had been good. Heroic, even. War cared nothing.\n“You’re entitled to have the Prism-elect perform your Freeing,” Karris\nsaid.\n“Fuck him,” Gavin said. “Damn. It feels kind of good to be able to say it\nfree and clear. Sorry, Gill. Sorry, brothers, sisters. But fuck him. I know he’s\nyour son, High Mistress. But you got a blind spot where he’s standing. He’s\nnot a good man, High Lady. No one wants to say it to you. No one can tell\nyou the truth. I can now. Because you have to listen to a dying man, don’t\nyou? He did the Freeing last year, and we were there. We’ve been at\nFreeings—not me, but this brotherhood—we’ve been there with Gavin\nGuile every time he had to do the Freeing. We saw how a good man\napproached that day. We saw him steeling his nerves. We saw his vomit in\nthe chamber pot the morning of. We saw his steel spine all day. We saw his\ndrunkenness the night after and the endless baths and the hands bloodied\nfrom him scrubbing them over and over. That’s how a real man takes having\nto kill seventy or a hundred or two hundred friends. Your son did none of\nthat.”\nHer heart caught in her throat. This was the blathering of a madman, the\nraving of the dying. But to cut him off would be a cruelty the Blackguards\nwould never forgive. She had to listen to his words, no matter how vile.\n“Your son enjoyed killing seventy men and women. Enjoyed it. And\ndon’t you dare excuse him as a true believer who thought he was sending\nsouls to a better place, to their just reward. He barely prayed the prayers his\nposition demands. He giggled. He killed women before they’d finished their\nconfessions. He stabbed them through the stomach first. Or the loins. He did\nit for fun.”\nAnd her heart sank. And her heart died. Her son. Her son was inhuman\n—and she’d known it for long and long.\n“Perhaps you can’t hear this. Perhaps telling you the truth will only gain\nyour condemnation and his. But I live to serve you, Karris White Oak,\nKarris Guile, Karris White, my Iron White.” And now tears spilled from\nthose broken eyes. “I have adored you, always been in awe of you, and I’ve\nnever known how to tell you that this shadow grows in your very house. I\nhave nothing to gain from this, but Karris… he is poison. He may be the\nflesh of your flesh, but he is not the flesh of your spirit. He is nothing like\nyou. You are so good, and so worthy.

But for now, enough.”\nIt was as if the jaws of her mind were being pulled open until the corners\nof her mouth tore open, and her throat were being stuffed with putrid meat\nfaster than she could swallow. Make it stop. Just make it stop. “Are you\nready?” Karris asked, cold as iron is cold.\n“I am,” he said.\nThey helped him sit, and then stand. He looked at his compatriots, this\nboy of eighteen summers. He whispered words in the ears of some, nodded\nto others. He acted with a gravitas far beyond his years. A few of the\nBlackguards rushed from the room, unable to contain their weeping though\nthey were supposed to stand strong.\nTheir weakness was forgiven.\nMoving slowly—a wight must move slowly amid the Blackguard—\nGavin Greyling approached Karris last.\nHe knelt. First he looked to his brother Gill. “I’m sorry, brother. You told\nme to take more care a hundred times. I never listened.”\n“I should—”\n“It’s not on you,” Gav said. He squeezed his brother’s hand. “Brothers,\nsisters, I’m sorry to leave you before the final lap of the race.”\nCommander Fisk was weeping. He said, “One cannot give more than all.\nYou have finished your race, Blackguard. You may put your burden down.”\n“Permission for an extended absence, sir,” Gavin said.\nCommander Fisk cleared his throat twice trying to find his words.\n“Permission granted, soldier.” He snapped to attention, and all the\nBlackguards followed. The commander drew an ancient dagger from his\nbelt, said to have been passed down from Karris Atiriel herself and the first\nBlackguard. He spun it in his hand and presented it to Karris.\nThen he snapped back to attention with his Blackguards. Some met\nGav’s eyes as he looked from face to face. Others couldn’t bear it. Gill was\nshaking like a leaf trying to keep his composure.\nThe ward fell silent, even other patients hearing the hushed flap of\nimmortals’ wings.\n“I shall miss your jokes,” Karris said. “I shall miss your light and easy\nspirit.” Her own was as heavy as a millstone.\n“Let’s not stretch this out longer than I can take,” Gavin said. He pulled\nthe skin of his chest tight against his ribs to show the chinks between the\nbones. He stared at his brother’s face and squeezed his hand hard.\n“Well done, good and faithful servant. Orholam take you to your rest,”\nKarris said.\nThen she stabbed him in the heart, sliding the dagger home hard, and\nthen pulled it out quickly.\nGill held Gav’s hand until the light went out of his eyes, and then\nlowered his brother’s body onto the table and fell across him, weeping.\nKarris fled, all her ideas of dignity and position forgotten, until she\nfound herself on a rear balcony, in the shadow of the Chromeria, looking"

She gripped the\nrail unseeing.\nShe had always thought that heartbreak would arrive with tears and\nwailing, disconsolate flopping about and shutting oneself in one’s bed\nchamber. Not eating. Not sleeping. Looking gaunt and pale, like in the\nstories.\nFor her, the sound of her heart cracking was simple and sharp and\naccompanied by nothing other than silence. It came in one sentence, pitiless\nand plain, stilling all argument and complaint:\nSo this is what my life is now.\nGavin, are you out there somewhere? She would know if he were dead,\nwouldn’t she? She would have a feeling, right? Why did he feel so close,\nafter all this time?\nBut that was only a stubborn, stupid denial.\nShe couldn’t afford to lie to herself anymore. She couldn’t let any more\ngood kids die for her willful blindness.\nThe Third Eye had told her, Orholam will repay you for the years the\nlocusts have eaten.\nBut God either didn’t see, or didn’t care, or didn’t save. The husband\nshe’d longed for was gone; the son she’d longed for was rotten; the stepson\nshe should have kept she’d driven away. God was a liar.\nHer fields were barren and sere, picked clean. Her story was over. Now\nshe would merely survive. She would do her duty. That was all there was.\nThis is my life now.\n“Commander,” she said, not turning.\n“High Lady?” Of course he had followed her. In all the ways that didn’t\nmatter, she was never alone.\n“I know they were motivated by love, but there will be no more\nexpeditions to search for my husband. I forbid them. He is gone. Let us live\nfor the living, not die for the dead.”\nShe straightened her back and squared her shoulders, and, with an iron\nheart, she finally did what she’d sworn she would never do.\nFind Gavin.\nBelow, the bone-white ship cast off from the quay. As the sun slowly\nrose, Karris watched it sail away until it disappeared into the horizon.\nChapter 78\nLiv reached the crest of the hill unseen, of course. Her mastery of her new\npowers had grown greatly in what was now almost a year since she’d\nascended. Now, when people weren’t paying attention, she was able to\nimpose order on their very thoughts.\nAs she worked, the ambling circuit of a guard’s watch went from routine\nto clockwork, superfluities excised, perfect efficiency aspired to. But when\nyou know patterns and can internalize others’ and create your own to\nexploit them, you can walk twelve unhurried steps, pause by a shrub, and\nwait for the man with the infection in his groin to scratch, and then move\non.\nNot that all men or women were such automata. There was some twitchy\nwoman who reacted violently even to the lightest touch. Liv simply gave\nher a wide berth.\nShe reached the top of the hill overlooking Azuria Bay on the Blood\nForest coast, and her breath was taken away."

Liv simply gave\nher a wide berth.\nShe reached the top of the hill overlooking Azuria Bay on the Blood\nForest coast, and her breath was taken away.\nThe bane lay below her. All of them, and all of them massive. Sub-red\nsizzling in the waves. Red smoldering. Orange placidly floating. Yellow\nawash in men and wights, every line perfect. Green bobbing wild. Cool blue\nmelding with the color of the waves. And even the true prize, her\nsuperviolet bane, sitting invisible to most human eyes, known to most only\nby the odd bowl-shaped depression it made in the waves, waiting for her.\nThat had been the White King’s bait. She had the seed crystal, but he\nhad the bane, her temple. Attuned to her powers, it had called to her and\nBeliol all these months. Calling, waiting to grant her her full power, for her\nto take her place as a goddess.\nHad she really finished her work, and decided rationally to come here?\nOr had she been pulled along, manipulated like a drunk to his only source\nof wine, swearing he’d chosen it—yet every day, despite decay and wreck,\nhe chose it again.\nWasn’t there one last place she was supposed to go to fulfill her mission?\nOne place… near here? Something to do with Kip?\n“We will be safe, Mistress,” Beliol said. “I shall know the very moment\nthe least of them thinks of betrayal.”\n“And I can trust you, of course,” Liv said. She’d been careful not to\nvoice her suspicions to him before, but now it slipped out.\n“I’ve no wish to be chained, either, goddess. What would the Yokeless\nOne be if he were chained?”\nNo, that made sense.\nHer body pulsed with superviolet, of her accord, and she felt at peace\nand focused again. “You can do this,” Beliol said. “Really, you must do it.”\nThe bane below were ready to sail to the Chromeria, loaded with\nsupplies and an army and their drafter-paralyzing powers. They were going\nto win. They would cast off within a day or two at most, and Liv felt no\narmies within that distance coming to stop them before they could assault\nthe Chromeria itself.\nSo Kip hadn’t figured it out. Sad.\nThe Blood Robes couldn’t be stopped, then, and the Chromeria was\ndoomed. There was nothing to be gained by joining the losing side now,\nwas there?\nAh well. At least that made her decision easy.\nReleasing the fine superviolet shielding she’d developed to hide herself\nfrom the other gods, she whistled a little tune and started down the hill to\njoin the White King.\nTo be worshipped, she thought, would be very fine.\nChapter 79\nSome time later, Kip found himself washed and shaved and somehow,\ndespite all his loitering, still waiting for his wife to appear.\nAnd then she did.\nWere they any other couple, Kip wouldn’t be thinking at all right now.\nCandles, perfumed water, flower petals across a bigger bed in a more\nbeautiful room than Kip had ever seen.

On the trail or in a palace, wearing\ntrousers or a nightgown or nothing at all, a beautiful woman is a beautiful\nwoman. Or so Kip had thought.\nBut somehow what was becoming familiar had been made new, and\nwhat had continually delighted him now left him agog.\nFor an unutterably beautiful long moment, Kip didn’t think at all. He\nbasked in the revelation of her as if it were the sun on a cold morning when\nthe chill wind dies down and the winter fades.\nBut then that moment trembled and faltered and fell, and they saw it\nmirrored in each other’s eyes. They were not merely a husband and wife\neager for each other—they were they, and what should be an unalloyed\ngood was instead a battlefield.\nFor all the times this past year that they’d gone to bed without thinking\nof their problem, it was impossible to ignore it in the honeymoon chamber.\nNo honey for us.\nHe wished he could simply enjoy looking at how she brought light and\nlife to the silken curves of her celadon nightgown, but now Tisis had that\nlook on her face that Blackguard scrubs got during the puke circuit, that last\ntime through any physical conditioning exercise where success was\nmeasured by puking only after you finished, rather than before.\nCan’t anything be easy?\n“No eye makeup,” Kip said. So she was already figuring she’d be\ncrying.\n“Thought there was no need to stain the sheets.”\n“I think they’re actually prepared for that. You know, honeymoon\nchamber.”\n“Kip, I meant—” she started, irritated, then saw that he was joking.\n“Come here. Sit with me.”\nHe drank her in as she came across the chamber. Part of him thought, Of\ncourse I can’t make love with her. She’s far too beautiful. Something had to\ngo wrong with me in the picture.\nBut he ignored that voice and simply enjoyed her.\nShe said, “When you look at me like that… I feel so loved… and so\nwretched. I feel so betrayed by my own body, like you’re starving, and I’m\nwithholding food from you. But I’m not doing it on purpose, Kip!” She sat\ndown heavily.\nHe took her hands. “I don’t blame you,” he said. “I’m not angry at you\nfor what you can’t control. That wouldn’t even make sense.”\n“Angry doesn’t have to make sense. Anger. Whatever. I know you’re\nupset.”\n“I am.”\n“You’re disappointed in me, in us, in this sham marriage.”\n“No, no, no, and yes. This isn’t what I expected. But I’m not\ndisappointed in you, and our marriage isn’t a sham. But yes, I am\ndisappointed.”\n“You’ve been holding something back. I can tell.”\nShit.

How do you expect me\nto remember—”\n“‘Not again,’” Kip said. “You said, ‘Not again.’ Can you explain that to\nme?”\nShe couldn’t cover the guilty look that flitted over her face for the barest\nfraction of a second. “No,” she said, “I’m sure that wasn’t it, I was\nfrustrated, and I said, ‘Dammit, let’s go again.’”\n“Tisis,” Kip said gently.\nThere was a long silence. Then, not moving her eyes from the floor, she\nsaid hollowly, “There was a boy. Almost two years ago now. I wasn’t even\nthat interested in him, but I was furious with Eirene. My sister was sleeping\nwith every willing woman in three satrapies, and she wanted me to be the\nperfect virgin. She said since she was never going to marry, I had to carry\nthe family honor. It wasn’t a religious thing. Eirene doesn’t believe in\nanything but honor and money. But I had to act virtuously so I could be sold\nlike a pillow slave to the highest bidder. I love my sister, and she’s\napologized to me a few times when she’s been drunk, but the apologies\nnever changed the deal. She insisted I had to do this one thing—like it’s\nsimple for me. She has to do all the hard stuff in every other aspect of her\nlife, she said, so it’s only fair she gets to relax in her private life.\n“Anyway, I was with this boy, and we were pushing the boundaries one\nnight, sort of daring each other to go further, but I kept thinking about how\nfurious Eirene would be, and we tried, and… when he couldn’t get in, he\ndidn’t take it as gracefully as you did, Kip. He, he said I wasn’t a real\nwoman. That I was a freak. And I said some pretty terrible things, too. I said\nif he ever spoke of it that I would tell everyone how he didn’t even last long\nenough to get inside me. We never spoke again, and every time I would see\nhim, my stomach would knot up all over again. I thought maybe because I\nwas older now, it would just work with you, but I was afraid, too. I expected\nyou to reject me if it happened… and then it did. I sort of still do. Expect\nyour rejection, I mean.”\nKip sighed. He had two thoughts at once, and one was terribly selfish.\n“Tell me about this ceiling. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n“The… ceiling?” She was incredulous.\n“Please.”\n“What?

I am trying to\ngive us a chance—\nBut another part of him said, God, how she’s hurting. And that voice,\nslower and softer, utterly silenced the first. Peace, Kip, peace.\nThe muscles in her cheeks clenched, but she silently surveyed the\nundulating, burnished wood that formed the ceiling. “I can’t remember the\nname of the woodwright, but there are treasured examples of his work all\nover Blood Forest. Few are so large, though. It’s called Túsaíonn Domhan,\nit means ‘A World Begins.’ It’s supposed to represent a pond where a single\nrock has been thrown. These are the waves expanding from the center. At\ndifferent times of the year and different times of day, two people can lie\ndown head to head right below the center and see different colors and even\nvisions, some claim. Apparently, getting all these beams to match in color\nand curvature is considered impossible now, and it’s endured like this for\nthree hundred years.”\n“What about the gold… stars? The knotholes?”\n“Oh, that’s an old tradition. In woodworking like this, knots in the\nlumber are a tremendous challenge. You can’t get beams this size without\nthem, of course. They’re a problem when you’re felling the trees because\nthe saws bind in the knot, and then when the lumber is cut, the knot\nbecomes a weakness in the structure. In every way, the knot is a flaw, an\nembarrassment that must be worked around, glued or minimized or covered\nover as well as possible.\n“But there was another school of thought. Instead of ignoring the flaw,\nthey highlighted it instead. It’s called golden joinery or golden repair. Look,\nmaybe this is all just artists’ bullshit, right, but they say it’s not a celebration\nof flaws but an acceptance of them, addressed insofar as the structure needs\nit. Here, Phaestos—that was the woodwright’s name, just came to me—here\nin addition to the gold dust that would be mixed with the joinery glue to\nhold the knots together and make the starburst patterns, he also employed\nsome master drafter-artisans.”\nHer face had relaxed as she told Kip of her people, as he had hoped it\nwould. She was intensely proud of them.\n“But I’m boring you,” she said.\n“Not at all. Why masters? Slap some solid yellow in knotholes. Problem\nsolved, right?”\n“Structurally, yes, but these were women who’d been asked to work\nwith Phaestos himself. Well, we don’t know their names. It’s assumed they\nwere women because they were yellow superchromats. They were great\nartists, too. A true artist is one for whom there is no ‘good enough.’ They\ndrafted perfect solid yellow for the structural integrity, but then they filled"

A true artist is one for whom there is no ‘good enough.’ They\ndrafted perfect solid yellow for the structural integrity, but then they filled\nchannels so small we can’t see them or perhaps natural air pockets in the\nwood with a yellow luxin ever so slightly off spectrum so that on moonlit\nnights, some of the yellow would release into visible light. They say it was\nlike seeing the moonlight shimmer on the undulating waves.\n“The downside, of course, is that when you have luxin decaying, no\nmatter how slowly that is, it eventually disappears. They say the\nshimmering luxin lasted more than a hundred years. Some say there is a\nlesson there about the longevity of what is made by magic and what is made\nby hand, and what endures—Phaestos’s work remains while theirs is gone.\nPersonally, I think a century is pretty good.”\n“No one could fix it?” Kip asked.\n“It’s not like sending gleams to refill the lanterns at the Chromeria, Kip.\nThey tried. They failed. There are some things that pass from the earth and\nare simply lost.”\n“Huh.”\nThey sat together for a time, looking at the salving curves and basking in\nthe soporific natural wood tones.\n“Do you buy it?” Kip asked finally.\n“That they used the luxin for art?”\n“No, the bit about golden joinery.”\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I mean, it’s one thing when you see the\ntechnique used on a bowl or plate. The woodwright could have simply\ntossed out a piece of faulty wood and made something perfect with another\npiece, so you know that incorporating the flaw was a choice, right? But on\nsomething this massive? There wasn’t a choice. Orholam only knows how\nmany trees they must have gone through to get the perfect tones and\npatterns already. Maybe the flaws came first and the justifications came\nlater, like this is what they had to work with, so they made the best of it.”\n“Regardless, they did a helluva job with it, didn’t they?” Kip asked. “I\ncan imagine the ceiling without those golden stars reflected in the rippling\nwaves, but they add something beautiful, don’t they?”\nHe saw a wave of gooseflesh go over Tisis’s skin. Perhaps it was merely\nbecause the room was cold.\n“You bastard,” she said, but she wasn’t angry. She turned and looked at\nhim. “You already knew about golden joinery, didn’t you?”\nHe was quiet for a moment. “Actually, I was hoping we could learn\nabout it together.”\nHer body tensed and she sucked in a breath, and then tears blossomed in\nher eyes.\nHe saw her, in that single moment, fall in love with him.\nIf their brokenness were anything else, they would fall into each other’s\narms and let their bodies now speak with wordless urgency the vows they’d\nmade long ago. But where bodies fail, words must stand.\n“I will not leave or forsake you,” Kip said. “This is something we need\nto fix; it does weaken us, but someday, it will be a source of our strength.”\nTisis fixed intent eyes on him. “Kip, I’m going to cry now, and I need"

It’s the good kind of crying.”\nThere’s a good kind?\n“And then,” she said. “To the best of my ability, I am going to ravish\nyou.”\nAnd so she did.\nAfter they had pleased each other, and laughed, and held and been held, in\nthe moment where Kip was torn between ramping up the passion again or\nmaybe just admitting it had been a damn long day and maybe they could\nmake love again in the morning, Tisis said, “I need to talk to you about\nsomething.”\n“You can’t,” Kip said. “I’m asleep.”\nVery subtly, he wiggled deeper under the blankets.\n“Kip,” she said plaintively.\n“Oooh, what have we here?” he asked her chest.\n“Kip—oh! Kip, I’m—mm… serious.”\nHe sighed. If he was learning anything about marriage, it was that talks\nmust come. Putting them off did nothing good.\nHe poked his head back above the covers.\nShe looked mildly disappointed—not fair! But then she gathered her\nwits. “Um…” She blew out a breath. “Kip, I want to make love tonight. I\nmean, I want to try again.”\nKip dropped his head onto his pillow with a groan. They had fresh bread\nand fine cheeses, and she was going to complain that they didn’t have wine?\n“Tonight? When everything is so perfect? You’re doing this now?” Eat the\nfucking bread and cheese, woman!\n“I want—”\n“We’ve talked about this! We agreed! Can’t you just leave well enough\n—”\n“I knew you were going to do this,” she said.\n“Hold you to your word?!” he said.\n“That is not fair!”\nYes, it was. But Kip bit his lip.\nA man who’d just been pleasured by a woman so beautiful shouldn’t feel\nthe depths of rage Kip felt now. “I have made my peace with this,” Kip\nsaid.\n“I haven’t,” she said.\n“Well, you’ll save yourself more heartache the sooner you do,” Kip said.\n“This is how things work in my life. Nothing can be all good; there always\nhas to be birdshit floating in the mead. If I have a friend, I have to know\nhe’s going to die. If I love a girl, she’ll fall for someone else. If—against all\nodds!—I have something as good as what you and I have, there’s no way it\ncan be whole. This is as good as it gets.” He waved a hand at the rippling,\npolished grains of the masterpiece above them. “I don’t understand why the\nhell you’re looking at this marriage and calling it a dead ceiling.”\n“Oh, Kip,” she said, but she couldn’t find words.\nThey lay beside each other, still in the midst of wealth and beauty, but\nKip felt as if all the mud and shit at the bottom of Kip Pond had been\nswirled back up, and he didn’t trust himself to find words that didn’t reek of"

He just needed time for all that shit to settle down again. Just let\nit be.\n“Maybe, maybe you’ve noticed me working with Evie Cairn?” she\nasked, still lying on her back, speaking as if to the ceiling.\n“Yes?” The healer?\nShe rolled her eyes. “And here my first plan was to wait until you asked\nme about it.” It was an attempt at levity, but a weak one.\nKip didn’t say, ‘You meet with people all day long, and most of them are\nyour sources for something or other, why would I even—’ Instead he said,\n“So, honey, why were you meeting with a healer?” It was an attempt at\nsincerity, but a weak one.\nAnd lo and behold, that question didn’t lead to a fight.\nDamn, this controlling-his-tongue thing was seeming like a better and\nbetter idea all the time.\n“She said she’d seen this before. Especially in girls under incredible\npressure or who’d had bad early experiences.”\nKip wasn’t understanding. He propped himself up on an elbow.\nTisis continued, “Or women who have a lot of negative attitudes about\nlovemaking, but obviously that’s not really my case, ha. But the first two…”\n“What? What?”\n“So I’ve been talking through some things with her,” Tisis said.\nKip felt like the time when Ramir and Sanson and Isa and he had gone\nswimming. Ramir’s idea, of course, and when Isa had balked at taking off\nher tunic by pointing out that Kip was wearing his, Ramir had been furious\nwith him. He’d cornered Kip, and forcibly stripped off his tunic. Then he’d\nmocked Kip for being fat, as Kip had known he would.\nThat sensation of being stripped naked for someone else’s commentary\ncame rushing back. “You’ve been telling some stranger about what we do\nand don’t do in our bed—”\n“Kip, dammit! You think it was easy for me? Don’t you trust me at all?\nAnd she’s not a stranger now.”\nIt wasn’t just embarrassment, it was bigger than that. “Do you realize\nwhat could happen if my grandfather or your sister finds out? Orholam’s\nballs, Tisis, your cousin could take a quarter of our army away—”\n“I wasn’t thinking about them! I was thinking about us!”\nHe didn’t say, ‘And you put everything at risk to do so!’\nHe didn’t say, ‘That’s the problem, you didn’t think at all!’\nInstead he took a breath.\nAnd in his momentary hesitation, she spoke again. “It was supposed be a\nsurprise. A good thing, Kip. I can’t—I can’t live like this. I’m sorry you’re\nangry, but I’m not sorry I did it.”\n“Great. So you’ve risked the entire war so that you can have girl talk\nwith someone who—for all we know—could be an enemy agent. Do you\nfeel better after talking it out?” Kip demanded.\nHe was being an asshole. He knew it; he couldn’t stop it."

I don’t understand you at all sometimes. I don’t know how you\ncan be that magnificent giant I see bending the world to his will one day and\nthen the next day be this, this dwarf.”\n“Oh, come, look at it another way,” Kip said. “If I were smaller—much,\nmuch smaller—we wouldn’t be having this problem at all.”\n“Orholam dammit, Kip!” she said. “I don’t know why you’re\nembarrassed. You feel exposed, ashamed? It’s not even your fault! She told\nme all the things men often do and say that make it even worse, and you’ve\ndone none of those. You’ve been perfect. This is all on me.”\nAnd she was silent, and she was hurting, and Kip’s heart opened to her\nbecause he knew what being silent and hurting and trying to suck it up and\nnot complain felt like when it seemed everything was your fault.\n“Don’t be like that. Don’t do that,” Kip said.\n“What?”\n“There’s no your problem or my problem here. There’s only our\nproblems. There’s only things we each have to do for our marriage to\nthrive.”\n“Yeah?” she asked.\n“Yes,” he said.\n“I’ve been trying. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but… I thought you’d\nforbid it, and we’d just have to endure good for the rest of our marriage. I\ndon’t want good with you, Kip. I want amazing. I won’t settle for less than\nthat.”\n“I just don’t…” He stopped. Tried again. “I appreciate that. And you’re\nright. I would have been an asshole, and I would have tried to stop you,\nand… and I would have been wrong.” Because the entire fucking war is\ntotally worth risking for my personal happiness, right?\nShit.\nNo, it was because it’s never good to give up. He had, and she hadn’t,\nand he was wrong to ask her to be more like him in this.\n“So what now?” he asked.\n“So… I’ve been, um, practicing? Training?”\n“Practicing? Practicing—wait, with who?”\n“Orholam’s beard, Kip, no, come on! I haven’t been seeking out men\nwith small penises.”\n“Well, I… okay, maybe that was kind of stupid. What did you mean,\nthen?”\nShe looked awkward. “I don’t really know how much you want to know.\nI mean, some wine beforehand and olive oil and, uh, graduated cylinders.”\n“Graduated cylinders?” Then he thought of cones he’d seen in her\nluggage. And then he thought about them again. “Ooooh.”\n“And with your constant late nights, I haven’t had much privacy to work\non it.”\n“Oh. Uh, sorry? That does sound… awkward.”\n“You walked in on me once, don’t you remember?”\n“Was that when you had the coughing fit?”\n“And you came over to comfort me.

And she’d stopped herself from saying it because she was\nkind.\nSomehow the ice was melting, and more than that.\n“You do realize that I love you, right?” Kip said.\nIt was, now that he thought about it, actually the first time he’d ever said\nit. Somehow he’d thought his actions should have made it obvious.\nShe burst into tears.\nKip was no expert, but he didn’t think these were the good kind.\n“You big idiot,” she said through her tears. “That’s not how you tell a\ngirl you love her!”\n“I thought it went without saying!”\n“Those words never go without saying!”\n“Well!” he shouted. Then he got quiet. “Now I know.”\nShe hesitated, uncertain where he was going next.\n“First time I ever said it to anyone,” he said.\nThe future was a chasm, and her love was a plank, and he didn’t know\nwhere it ended. And he’d just run three steps blindly into the darkness.\n“You know I love you, too, right?” she said.\n“Well, now I know,” he said with a half grin.\n“I’ve said it before,” she said. “Pretty much.”\nYou won’t accept a tacit ‘I love you,’ but you want me to? But he didn’t\nsay it. It wasn’t exactly analogous anyway. “I didn’t believe it,” he said.\n“Oh, Kip, you make me want to take this big knot of all these feelings I\ncan’t even name and have gneas sáraigh.”\n“That was… not clear,” Kip said. He could memorize foreign terms, but\nhe didn’t think this was one he was going to want to ask anyone about.\nShe exhaled and reached under the covers. She grabbed him and\nsqueezed. Not softly or erotically, either, though there was something\ninescapably and confusingly erotic for Kip in having Tisis grab him.\nShe said, “I am so frustrated and I want you and I want to hurt you and I\nlove you and it’s all such a jumble—”\n“No, I think I’ve got the feeling pretty exactly. It was the phrase I didn’t\nknow. Ow.”\n“Oh.” She loosened her grip, but didn’t let go. Better. “Closest I can\ntranslate it would be ‘fucking it out.’ It’s when you make love after you’re\nangry and then you feel better. It’s different than caidreamh collaí feargach,\nwhich is just angry lovemaking, where afterwards you feel better because\nyou just had passionate sex, but you’re still mad at the other person.”"

I mean, the latter\nsounds not too bad, either, but only if after a few rounds of it you eventually\ngot to the former. So, uh, let’s do that—the former, I mean.”\n“I, um.” She cleared her throat. “I said I really wanted to—and I do! Not\nthat I can. Because I can’t. And if I get even a little bit nervous—well, we’ll\nfail. Again.”\n“Very… well…” Kip said. “You just tell me what to do that will make\nyou happy, and I’ll do that.”\n“Can you, like… hold all that grab-me-and-hold-me-down-make-me-\nquiver passion in your eyes, but not actually do anything to scare me?”\nNow Kip cleared his throat. “You’re asking a lot of a man.”\n“You are a lot of a man,” she said with a naughty little grin.\nIt was as if they were playing roles for each other, but all in all, being\nsilly and out of your depth was better than being angry and confused,\nwasn’t it?\nHe kissed her, and slowly, the inner turmoil vanished. Then, slowly—\nmore slowly than either of them wanted, but as slowly as was necessary—\nthey made love.\nIt wasn’t perfect, but it was good. It was halting, and it was asking\nquestions, and it was some answers that would not appear in one’s fantasies.\nBut Kip shut up and he began to listen, and once he began to listen, he\nbegan to hear snippets of her song, and then all he had to do was hear the\never-changing verses of her heart’s desire and sing them in a refrain to her\nbody.\nThough perfectly attentive, perfectly diligent, Kip was not a perfect\nlover yet. But love doesn’t demand perfection, only focus and time and\neffort. And before the night had passed, they had finally, joyfully,\nconsummated their marriage.\nIt was a beginning, and it was a promise, and it was love; it was what\nhad been broken fused together anew.\nAs the dawn rose, they lay head to head, staring up into the center of A\nWorld Begins, and Kip understood why this was treated as a honeymoon\nchamber. For a wedding was a world’s beginning, a start from which all was\npossible, and a couple would lie head to head like this only after the\nlovemaking and after the cuddling, after their desires were sated, and their\nhearts were full, and their minds at ease, and their bodies at rest, and now\nthey could be refocused together to a single purpose.\nAs the light rose like gold through the mirrors and lenses channeling the\nlight above, Kip felt open to all the world, at peace, and in that morning\ncolor, he intuited another truth, coded there in the luxin itself: even perfect\nrepairs must be tended.\nThe golden yellow was a mere hair’s breadth from perfect luxin yellow,\nand, seeing that, Kip looked for superviolet, and it too was there, and a\nsmidge of orange, and even the tiniest slivers of red and sub-red.

On centuries-old wood?\nBut he knew he could do this, and he couldn’t stop himself, not with\nbeauty so close, not with his gifts so fully engaged.\nIn a moment, in an hour, in an eternity, in a wink of Orholam’s eye, Kip\nfinished.\nTisis gasped, and Kip did, too. It was one thing for Kip to put the luxin\npaints back onto the palette of a great artist, it was quite another to see what\nPhaestos and the drafters had done with them.\nThe room lit. Sunshine shimmering on ocean waves, a mirror, in this\ndarkest forest, to the stars and then the rising sun. A world beginning. This\nlight was a gift of man and Orholam, once broken apart fused together\nanew, what had been flawed now rejoined in gold perfection.\n“Oh my God,” Tisis whispered, but in her hushed tone, that holy word\nwasn’t blasphemy but reverence. “Kip. Heart of my heart. You have brought\nlight.”\nAuthor’s Note\nVaginismus, as suffered by Tisis Malargos, is a real gynecological condition\nthat can cause painful intercourse or the inability to experience intercourse\nat all due to involuntary muscle spasms. It is also little understood and too\noften surrounded by shame, jokes, or disbelief. One woman I know\nconfessed to her (female!) gynecologist that she had been unable to\nconsummate her marriage. The doctor told her it was her own fault for\nbeing a virgin, and it wouldn’t have been a problem if she’d been sexually\nactive earlier, and offered no treatment suggestions other than, “Maybe get\nreally drunk?” (Nope.) Another had her marriage end over this.\nAmong my early readers, there was a woman who couldn’t believe that\nthis was a real condition and not some weird plot device. “A woman who\ncan’t have sex? What’s that a metaphor for?” That ignorance, that secret\ngrief, and that disbelief prompted this note, awkward though I feel to write\nit.

It is an\nuncommon privilege to be afforded the time and space and finances to\npursue a dream. You’ve given me that, plus encouragement and\nunderstanding when I say things like, “I know I said it was going to be four\nbooks. Um…” You’ll find my best efforts to honor your gift here, and in\neverything I put my name on.\nThank you to my superviolet drafters, Gleni Bartels and her colleagues\nand discipulae in production. Your work is invisible to the untrained eye—\nunless things go wrong! I have once again given you an unenviable task,\nwith a compressed schedule and a long book and odd demands like quirky\nfonts, checklists, and handwriting.\nThank you to my blue drafters. My copy editor, S. B. Kleinman, brought\nmy work into harmony with accepted grammatical and usage norms while\nhonoring my unique voice. Thank you for bringing a sensitive hand to your\nwork: for finding that one sentence with a semicolon and ten commas and\ninstead of asking me to break it up, pointing out that the sentence actually\nneeded eleven commas. After teaching English and with seven books in\nprint now, I really shouldn’t need to be corrected on when to use “like”\nversus “as if,” but apparently I do. For that and much more, thank you.\nThank you to my yellow drafters. Translation, like drafting yellow, is\nbringing logic and emotion into balance; it requires both analysis and\ncreativity, understanding what is happening in one language on several\nlevels, and then artfully bringing that into another language with different\nsyntax and vocabulary available. Noah Dauber, thank you for the quick\nlesson on ancient Hebrew. I totally understood some of it. Dr. Jacob Klein,\nit hardly seems fair that your reward for all your Friday nights of refusing to\nleave our dorm room to do something fun (“Just three more hours of\nGreek!”) is having me ask you to do my homework now, but I do appreciate\nit! My new friends Thomas McCarthy and Carla O’Connell, thank you for\nthe Irish translations of sometimes-awkward terms.

Thank you to Laura Fitzgerald and Alex\nLencicki, who do so much online and off-. Thank you to Clockpunk Studios\nfor making the webpage look so good. Thank you to Lauren Panepinto,\nSilas Manhood, and Shirley Green for the beautiful covers—and then going\nabove and beyond to help me with bookmarks or T-shirt designs or posters.\nBeyond my awesome professional partners, thank you to you booksellers\nwho—out of all the baffling array of books weighing down the store shelves\n—pick up mine and tell a prospective reader why they’ll enjoy it. That’s a\ndream come true for me.\nThank you to my paryl drafter,\nMost people will never see nor\nunderstand what you’ve done, but it’s changed everything.\nThank you to my chi drafter,\ncancer.\nThen there are the polychromes, those drafters who have helped me in\nways that defy singular categorization. John DeBudge, not just rereading\nand continuity checking and theory-crafting and encouraging, but for\ncatching some of the more subtle stuff—and being wildly wrong on a small\nnumber of his guesses! Elisa Roberts, you’ve been my right hand. Lasher\nwhen I want to get lazy, organizer of literal reams of lore, Guardian of the\nOfficial Timeline, transcriber of the unholy words, website keeper—“Can I\nget this icon in cornflower blue?”—and general mess cleaner-upper (and\noften spotter in the first place). You’ve been the one who reads the book one\nlast time, backwards, to try to catch those final typos. I’d say more nice\nstuff about you, but then you’d ask for another raise.\nEditor Devi Pillai was my White. Or maybe my White King. I’m still\nnot sure. In any large endeavor, someone has to make sure all the skills of\nher minions are well allocated and whip nurture the laggards project along.\nWhen I see the old canard, “Editors don’t edit anymore,” I think of Devi\nreading this book four times and giving advice all along the way. She has\nbeen taskmaster and advocate, and many things in between. Thanks, Devi."

        "text": "draft, the more powerful she is and the more sought after are her services. A\nfull-spectrum polychrome is a polychrome who can draft every color in the\nspectrum. A Prism is always a full-spectrum polychrome.\nMerely being able to draft a color, though, isn’t the sole determining\ncriterion in how valuable or skilled a drafter is. Some drafters are faster at\ndrafting, some are more efficient, some have more will than others, some\nare better at crafting luxin that will be durable, some are smarter or more\ncreative at how and when to apply luxin.\nOn Disjunctive Bichromes/Polychromes\nOn the light continuum, sub-red borders red, red borders orange, orange\nborders yellow, yellow borders green, green borders blue, blue borders\nsuperviolet. Most bichromes and polychromes simply draft a larger\nspectrum on the continuum than monochromes. That is, a bichrome is most\nlikely to draft two colors that are adjacent to each other (blue and\nsuperviolet, red and sub-red, yellow and green, etc.). However, some few\ndrafters are disjunctive bichromes. As could be surmised from the name,\nthese are drafters whose colors do not border each other. Usef Tep was a\nfamous example: he drafted red and blue. Karris Guile is another, drafting\ngreen and red. It is unknown how or why disjunctive bichromes come to\nexist. It is only known that they are rare.\nOn Outer-Spectrum Colors\nThere is a small and controversial movement claiming that there are more\nthan seven colors. Indeed, because colors exist on a continuum, one could\nargue that the number of colors is infinite. However, the argument that there\nare more than seven draftable colors is more theologically problematic for\nsome. It is commonly accepted that there are other resonance points beyond\nthe seven currently accepted ones, but those points are weaker and much\nmore rarely drafted than the core seven. Among the contenders is one color\nfar below the sub-red, called paryl. Another equally far above superviolet is\ncalled only chi.\nBut if colors are to be so broadly defined as to include colors only one\ndrafter in a million can draft, then shouldn’t yellow be split into liquid\nyellow and solid yellow? Where do the (mythical) black and white luxins\nfit? How could such (non)colors even fit on the spectrum?\nThe arguments, though bitter, are academic.\nOn Subchromacy and Superchromacy\nA subchromat is one who has trouble differentiating between at least two\ncolors, colloquially referred to as being color-blind. Subchromacy need not\ndoom a drafter. For instance, a blue drafter who cannot distinguish between\nred and green will not be significantly handicapped in his work.\nSuperchromacy is having greater than usual ability to distinguish\nbetween fine variations of color. Superchromacy in any color will result in\nmore stable drafting, but is most helpful in drafting yellow. Only\nsuperchromat yellow drafters can hope to draft solid yellow luxin.\nOn Luxin (with sections on physics, metaphysics, effects on personality,\nlegendary colors, and colloquial terms)\nThe basis of magic is light.

        "text": "On Luxin (with sections on physics, metaphysics, effects on personality,\nlegendary colors, and colloquial terms)\nThe basis of magic is light. Those who use magic are called drafters. A\ndrafter is able to transform a color of light into a physical substance. Each\ncolor has its own properties, but the uses of those building blocks are as\nboundless as a drafter’s imagination and skill.\nThe magic in the Seven Satrapies functions roughly the opposite of a\ncandle burning. When a candle burns, a physical substance (wax) is\ntransformed into light. With chromaturgy, light is transformed into a\nphysical substance, luxin. Each color of luxin has its own properties. If\ndrafted correctly (within a tight allowance), the resulting luxin will be\nstable, lasting for days or even years, depending on its color.\nMost drafters (magic-users) can only use one color. A drafter must be\nexposed to the light of her color to be able to draft it (that is, a green drafter\ncan look at grass and be able to draft, but if she’s in a white-walled room,\nshe can’t). Each drafter usually carries spectacles so that if her color isn’t\navailable, she can still use magic.\nP\nHYSICS\nLuxin has weight. If a drafter drafts a luxin haycart over her head, the first\nthing it will do is crush her. From heaviest to lightest are: red, orange,\nyellow, green, blue, sub-red,* superviolet, sub-red.* For reference, liquid\nyellow luxin is only slightly lighter than the same volume of water.\n(*Sub-red is difficult to weigh accurately because it rapidly degenerates\nto fire when exposed to air. The ordering above was achieved by putting\nsub-red luxin in an airtight container and then weighing the result, minus\nthe weight of the container. In real-world uses, sub-red crystals are often\nseen floating upward in the air before igniting.)\nLuxin has tactility.\nSub-red: Again the hardest to describe due to its flammability, but\noften described as feeling like a hot wind.\nRed: Gooey, sticky, clingy, depending on drafting; can be tarry and\nthick or more gel-like.\nOrange: Lubricative, slippery, soapy, oily.\nYellow: In its liquid, more common state, like bubbly, effervescent\nwater, cool to the touch, possibly a little thicker than seawater. In its\nsolid state, it is perfectly slick, unyielding, smooth, and incredibly\nhard.\nGreen: Rough; depending on the skill and purposes of the drafter,\nranges from merely having a grain like leather to feeling like tree\nbark. It is flexible, springy, often drawing comparisons to the green\nlimbs of living trees.\nBlue: Smooth, though poorly drafted blue will have a texture and can\nshed fragments easily, like chalk, but in crystals.\nSuperviolet: Like spidersilk, thin and light to the point of\nimperceptibility.\nLuxin has scent. The base scent of luxin is resinous. The smells below are\napproximate, because each color of luxin smells like itself. Imagine trying\nto describe the smell of an orange. You’d say citrus and sharp, but that isn’t\nit exactly. An orange smells like an orange. However, the below"

However, the below\napproximations are close.\nSub-red: Charcoal, smoke, burned.\nRed: Tea leaves, tobacco, dry.\nOrange: Almond.\nYellow: Eucalyptus and mint.\nGreen: Fresh cedar, resin.\nBlue: Mineral, chalk, almost none.\nSuperviolet: Faintly like cloves.\n*Black: No smell/or smell of decaying flesh.\n*White: Honey, lilac.\n(*Mythical; these are the smells as reported in stories.)\nM\nETAPHYSICS\nAny drafting feels good to the drafter. Sensations of euphoria and\ninvincibility are particularly strong among young drafters and those drafting\nfor the first time. Generally, these pass with time, though drafters abstaining\nfrom magic for a time will often feel them again. For most drafters, the\neffect is similar to drinking a cup of kopi. Some drafters, strangely enough,\nseem to have allergic reactions to drafting. There are vigorous ongoing\ndebates about whether the effects on personality should be described as\nmetaphysical or physical.\nRegardless of their correct categorization and whether they are the\nproper realm of study for the magister or the luxiat, the effects themselves\nare unquestioned.\nL E P\nUXIN’S FFECTS ON ERSONALITY\nThe benighted before Lucidonius believed that passionate men became\nreds, or that calculating women became yellows or blues. In truth, the\ncausation flows the other way.\nEvery drafter, like every woman, has her own innate personality. The\ncolor she drafts then influences her toward the behaviors below. A person\nwho is impulsive who drafts red for years is going to be more likely to be\npushed further into “red” characteristics than a naturally cold and orderly\nperson who drafts red for the same length of time.\nThe color a drafter uses will affect her personality over time. This,\nhowever, doesn’t make her a prisoner of her color, or irresponsible for her\nactions under the influence of it. A green who continually cheats on his wife\nis still a lothario. A sub-red who murders an enemy in a fit of rage is still a\nmurderer. Of course, a naturally angry woman who is also a red drafter will\nbe even more susceptible to that color’s effects, but there are many tales of\ncalculating reds and fiery, intemperate blues.\nA color isn’t a substitute for a woman. Be careful in your application of\ngeneralities. That said, generalities can be useful: a group of green drafters\nis more likely to be wild and rowdy than a group of blues.\nGiven these generalities, there is also a virtue and a vice commonly\nassociated with each color. (Virtue being understood by the early luxiats not\nas being free of temptation to do evil in a particular way, but as conquering\none’s own predilection toward that kind of evil. Thus, gluttony is paired\nwith temperance, greed with charity, etc.)\nSub-red drafters: Sub-reds are passionate in all ways, the most purely\nemotional of all drafters, the quickest to rage or to cry. Sub-reds\nlove music, are often impulsive, fear the dark less than any other"

Sub-red men are\noften sterile.\nAssociated vice: Wrath\nAssociated virtue: Patience\nRed drafters: Reds are quick-tempered, lusty, and love destruction.\nThey are also warm, inspiring, brash, larger than life, expansive,\njovial, and powerful.\nAssociated vice: Gluttony\nAssociated virtue: Temperance\nOrange drafters: Oranges are often artists, brilliant in understanding\nother people’s emotions and motivations.

Its main claimed use is\nnearly identical to paryl—seeing through things, though those who\nbelieve in chi say its powers far surpass paryl’s in this regard,\ncutting through flesh and bone and even metal. The only thing the\ntales seem to agree on is that chi drafters have the shortest life\nexpectancy of any drafters: five to fifteen years, almost without\nexception. If chi indeed exists, it would mostly be evidence that\nOrholam created light for the universe or for his own purposes, and\nnot solely for the use of man, and would move theologians from\ntheir current anthropocentrism.\nBlack: Destruction, void, emptiness, that which is not and cannot be\nfilled. Obsidian is said to be the bones of black luxin after it dies.\nParyl: Also called spidersilk, it is invisible to all but paryl drafters. It\nresides as far down the spectrum from sub-red as most sub-red does"

Descriptions of an earthly form of the\nstuff (as diminished from the original as obsidian supposedly is\nfrom black luxin) describe it as radiant ivory, or pure white opal,\nemitting light on the whole spectrum.\nC T\nOLLOQUIAL ERMS\nStudents at the Chromeria are encouraged to use the proper names for each\ncolor, but the impetus to name seems unstoppable. In some cases, the names\nare used technically: pyrejelly is a thicker, longer-burning draft of red that\nwill burn long enough to reduce a body to ash. In other cases, the reference\nbecomes precisely the opposite of the technical definition: brightwater was\nfirst a name for liquid yellow luxin, but Brightwater Wall is solid yellow\nluxin.\nA few of the more common colloquialisms:\nSub-red: Firecrystal\nRed: Pyrejelly, burnglue\nOrange: Noranjell\nYellow: Brightwater\nGreen: Godswood\nBlue: Frostglass, glass\nSuperviolet: Skystring, soulstring, spidersilk\nBlack: Hellstone, nullstone, nightfiber, cinderstone, hadon\nWhite: Truebright, starsblood, anachrome, luciton\nOn the Old Gods\nSub-red: Anat, goddess of wrath. Those who worshipped her are said\nto have had rituals that involved infant sacrifice. Also known as the\nLady of the Desert, the Fiery Mistress. Her centers of worship were\nTyrea, southernmost Paria, and southern Ilyta.\nRed: Dagnu, god of gluttony. He was worshipped in eastern Atash.\nOrange: Molokh, god of greed. Once worshipped in western Atash.\nYellow: Belphegor, god of sloth. Primarily worshipped in northern\nAtash and southern Blood Forest before Lucidonius’s coming.\nGreen: Atirat, goddess of lust. Her center of worship was primarily in\nwestern Ruthgar and most of Blood Forest.\nBlue: Mot, god of envy. His center of worship was in eastern Ruthgar,\nnortheastern Paria, and Abornea.\nSuperviolet: Ferrilux, god of pride. His center of worship was in\nsouthern Paria and northern Ilyta.\nOn Technology and Weapons\nThe Seven Satrapies are in a time of great leaps in understanding. The peace\nsince the Prisms’ War and the following suppression of piracy has allowed\nthe flow of goods and ideas freely through the satrapies.

        "text": "quality iron and steel are available in every satrapy, leading to high-quality\nweapons, durable wagon wheels, and everything in between. Though\ntraditional forms of weapons like Atashian bich’hwa or Parian parry-sticks\ncontinue, now they are rarely made of horn or hardened wood. Luxin is\noften used for improvised weapons, but most luxins’ tendency to break\ndown after long exposure to light, and the scarcity of yellow drafters who\ncan make solid yellows (which don’t break down in light), means that metal\nweapons predominate among mundane armies.\nThe greatest leaps are occurring in the improvement of firearms. In most\ncases, each musket is the product of a different smith. This means each man\nmust be able to fix his own firearm, and that pieces must be crafted\nindividually. A faulty hammer or flashpan can’t be swapped out for a new\none, but must be detached and reworked into appropriate shape. Some\nlarge-scale productions with hundreds of apprentice smiths have tried to\ntackle this problem in Rath by making parts as nearly identical as possible,\nbut the resulting matchlocks tend to be low quality, trading accuracy and\ndurability for consistency and simple repair. Elsewhere, the smiths of Ilyta\nhave gone the other direction, making the highest-quality custom muskets\nin the world. Recently, they’ve pioneered a form they call the flintlock.\nInstead of affixing a burning slow match to ignite powder in the flashpan\nand thence into the breech of the rifle, they’ve affixed a flint that scrapes a\nfrizzen to throw sparks directly into the breech. This approach means a\nmusket or pistol is always ready to fire, without a soldier having to first\nlight a slow match. Keeping it from widespread adoption is the high rate of\nmisfires—if the flint doesn’t scrape the frizzen correctly or throw sparks\nperfectly, the firearm doesn’t fire.\nThus far, the combination of luxin with firearms has been largely\nunsuccessful. The casting of perfectly round yellow luxin musket balls was\npossible, but the small number of yellow drafters able to make solid yellow\ncreates a bottleneck in production. Blue luxin musket balls often shatter\nfrom the force of the black powder explosion. An exploding shell made by\nfilling a yellow luxin ball with red luxin (which would ignite explosively\nfrom the shattering yellow when the ball hit a target) was demonstrated to\nthe Nuqaba, but the exact balance of making the yellow thick enough to not\nexplode inside the musket, but thin enough to shatter when it hit its target, is\nso difficult that several smiths have died trying to replicate it, probably\nbarring this technique from wide adoption.\nOther experiments are doubtless being carried out all over the Seven\nSatrapies, and once high-quality, consistent, and somewhat accurate\nfirearms are introduced, the ways of war will change forever. As it stands, a\ntrained archer can shoot farther, far more quickly, and more accurately.\nWe hope you enjoyed this book.\nWondering what to read next?\nDiscover other books you might enjoy by signing up for Orbit’s newsletter.\nYou’ll get the scoop on the latest releases, deals, excerpts, and breaking\nnews delivered straight to your inbox each month.\nSign Up\nOr visit us at www.orbitbooks.net/booklink\nCopyright"
