It was a tiny craft with low sides. Lying on his back like this, he’d\nonce almost believed he was one with the sea. Now the dome of the\nheavens above him was a lid, and he a crab in the cauldron, heat rising.\nTwo hours before noon, here on the southern rim of the Cerulean Sea,\nthe waters should be a stunning deep blue-green. The sky above, cloudless,\nmist burned off, should be a peaceful, vibrant sapphire.\nBut he couldn’t see it. Since he’d lost the Battle of Garriston four days\nago, wherever there was blue, he saw gray. He couldn’t even see that much\nunless he concentrated. Robbed of its blue, the sea looked like thin, gray-\ngreen broth.\nHis fleet was waiting. Hard to relax when thousands of people were\nwaiting for you and only you, but he needed this measure of peace.\nHe looked to the heavens, arms spread, touching the waves with his\nfingertips.\nLucidonius, were you here? Were you even real? Did this happen to you,\ntoo?\nSomething hissed in the water, a sound like a boat cutting through the\nwaves.\nGavin sat up on his skimmer. Then stood.\nFifty paces behind him, something disappeared under the waves,\nsomething big enough to cause its own swell. It could have been a whale.\nExcept whales usually surface to breathe. There was no spray hanging in\nthe air, no whoosh of expelled breath. And from fifty paces, for Gavin to\nhave heard the hiss of a sea creature cutting through the water, it would\nhave to be massive. His heart leapt to his throat.\nHe began sucking in light to draft his oar apparatus—and froze. Right\nbeneath his tiny craft, something was moving through the water. It was like\nwatching the landscape speed by when you’re riding in a carriage, but\nGavin wasn’t moving. The rushing body was huge, many times the width of\nhis craft, and it was undulating closer and closer to the surface, closer to his\nown little boat. A sea demon.\nAnd it glowed. A peaceful, warm radiance like the sun itself on this cool\nmorning.\nGavin had never heard of such a thing. Sea demons were monsters, the\npurest, craziest form of fury known to mankind. They burned red, boiled the\nseas, left fires floating in their wake. Not carnivores, so far as the old books\nguessed, but fiercely territorial—and any interloper that disrupted their seas\nwas to be crushed. Interlopers like ships."

        "text": "seas, left fires floating in their wake. Not carnivores, so far as the old books\nguessed, but fiercely territorial—and any interloper that disrupted their seas\nwas to be crushed. Interlopers like ships.\nThis light was different than that rage. A peaceful luminescence, the sea\ndemon no vicious destroyer but a leviathan traversing the seas, leaving\nbarely a ripple to note his passing. The colors shimmered through the\nwaves, grew brighter as the undulation brought the body close.\nUnthinking, Gavin knelt as the creature’s back broke the surface of the\nwater right underneath his boat. Before the boat slid away from the swell,\nhe reached out and touched the sea demon’s skin. He expected a creature\nthat slid through the waves to be slimy, but the skin was surprisingly rough,\nmuscular, warm.\nFor one precious moment, Gavin was not. There was no Gavin Guile, no\nDazen Guile, no High Luxlord Prism, no scraping sniveling dignitaries\ndevoid of dignity, no lies, no satraps to be bullied, no Spectrum councilors\nto manipulate, no lovers, no bastards, no power except the power before his\neyes. He felt small, staring into incomprehensible vastness.\nCooled by the gentle morning breeze, warmed by the twin suns, one in\nthe sky, one beneath the waves, Gavin was serene. It was the closest thing\nto a holy moment he had ever experienced.\nAnd then he realized the sea demon was swimming toward his fleet.\nChapter 2\nThe green hell was calling him to madness. The dead man was back in the\nreflective wall, luminous, grinning at Dazen, features squeezed skeleton-\nthin by the curving walls of the spherical green cell.\nThe key was to not draft. After sixteen years of drafting only blue, of\naltering mind and damaging body with that loathsome cerulean serenity,\nnow having escaped the blue cell, Dazen wanted nothing more than to\ngorge on some other color. It was like he’d eaten breakfast gruel morning,\nnoon, and night for six thousand days, and now someone was offering him a\nrasher of bacon.\nHe hadn’t even liked bacon, back when he’d been free. Now it sounded\nlovely. He wondered if that was the fever, turning his thoughts to sludge and\nemotion.\nFunny how he thought that: ‘Back when he’d been free.’ Not ‘Back\nwhen he’d been Prism.’\nHe wasn’t sure if it was because he was still telling himself that he was\nthe Prism whether he was in royal robes or rancid rags, or if it simply didn’t\nmatter anymore.\nDazen tried to look away, but everything was green. To have his eyes\nopen was to be dipping his feet in green. No, he was up to his neck in water\nand trying to get dry. There was no hope of dryness. He had to know that\nand accept it. The only question wasn’t if he was going to get his hair wet, it\nwas if he was going to drown.\nGreen was all wildness, freedom. That logical part of Dazen that had\nbasked in blue’s orderliness knew that sucking up pure wildness while\nlocked up in this luxin cage would lead to madness. Within days he’d claw\nout his own throat. Pure wildness, here, would be death. He would finally"

        "text": "locked up in this luxin cage would lead to madness. Within days he’d claw\nout his own throat. Pure wildness, here, would be death. He would finally\naccomplish his brother’s objective for him.\nHe needed to be patient. He needed to think, and thinking was hard right\nnow. He examined his body slowly, carefully. His hands and knees were\nlacerated from his crawl through the hellstone tunnel. The bumps and\nbruises from his fall through the trapdoor and into this cell he could ignore.\nThey were painful, but inconsequential. Most worrisome was the inflamed,\ninfected slash across his chest. It nauseated him just looking at it, oozing\npus and promises of death.\nWorst was the fever, corrupting his very blood, making him stupid,\nirrational, sapping his will.\nBut Dazen had escaped the blue prison, and that prison had changed\nhim. His brother had crafted these prisons quickly, and probably put most of\nhis efforts into that first, blue one. Every prison had a flaw.\nThe blue prison had made him the perfect man to find it. Death or\nfreedom.\nIn his reflective green wall, the dead man said, “You taking bets?”\nChapter 3\nGavin sucked in light to start making his rowing apparatus. Unthinking, he\ntried to draft blue. While brittle, blue’s stiff, slick, smooth structure made it\nideal for parts that didn’t undergo sideways stresses. For a futile moment,\nGavin tried to force it, again. He was a Prism made flesh; alone out of all\ndrafters, he could split light within himself. The blue was there—he knew it\nwas there, and maybe knowing it was there, even though he couldn’t see,\nmight be enough.\nFor Orholam’s sake, if you could find your chamber pot in the middle of\nthe night and, despite that you couldn’t see it, the damned thing was still\nthere, why couldn’t this be the same?\nNothing. No rush of harmonious logic, no cool rationality, no stained\nblue skin, no drafting whatsoever. For the first time since he was a boy, he\nfelt helpless. Like a natural man. Like a peasant.\nGavin screamed at his helplessness. It was too late for the oars anyway.\nThat son of a bitch was swimming too fast.\nHe drafted the scoops and the reeds. Blue worked better to make the jets\nfor a skimmer, but naturally flexible green could serve if he made it thick\nenough. The rough green luxin was heavier and created more drag against\nthe water, so he was slower, but he didn’t have the time or attention to make\nit from yellow. Precious seconds passed while he prepared his skimmer.\nThen the scoops were in hand and he began throwing luxin down into\nthe jets, blasting air and water out the back of his little craft and propelling\nhimself forward. He leaned far forward, shoulders knotting with the effort;\nthen, as he picked up speed, the effort eased. Soon his craft was hissing\nacross the waves.\nThe fleet arose in the distance, the sails of the tallest ships first. But at\nGavin’s speed, it wasn’t long before he could see all of them. There were\nhundreds of ships now: from sailing dinghies to galleasses to the square-"

        "text": "Gavin’s speed, it wasn’t long before he could see all of them. There were\nhundreds of ships now: from sailing dinghies to galleasses to the square-\nrigged three-masted ship of the line with forty-eight guns that Gavin had\ntaken from the Ruthgari governor to be his flagship. They’d left Garriston\nwith over a hundred ships, but hundreds more that had gotten out earlier\nhad joined them within days for protection from the pirates who lay thick in\nthese waters. Last, he saw the great luxin barges, barely seaworthy. He\nhimself had created those four great open boats to hold as many refugees as\npossible. If he hadn’t, thousands of people would have died.\nAnd now they would die regardless, if Gavin didn’t turn the sea demon.\nAs he sped closer, he caught sight of the sea demon again, a hump\ncresting six feet out of the water. Its skin was still placidly luminous, and by\nsome good fortune it wasn’t actually cutting straight toward the fleet. Its\npath would take it perhaps a thousand paces in front of the lead ship.\nOf course, the ships themselves were plowing slow furrows forward,\nclosing that gap, but the sea demon was moving so quickly, Gavin dared to\nhope that it wouldn’t matter. He had no idea how keen the sea demon’s\nsenses were, but if it kept going in the same direction, they might well make\nit.\nGavin couldn’t take his hands away from the skimmer’s jets without\nlosing precious speed, and he didn’t know how he would deliver a signal\nthat said, “Don’t Do Anything Stupid!” to the whole fleet at once even if he\ndid. He followed directly behind the sea demon, closer now.\nHe’d been wrong; the sea demon was going to cut perhaps five hundred\npaces from the lead ship. A bad estimate, or was the creature turning toward\nthe fleet?\nGavin could see lookouts in the crow’s nests waving their hands\nviolently to those on the decks below them. Doubtless shouting, though\nGavin was too far away to hear them. He sped closer, saw men running on\nthe decks.\nThe emergency was on the fleet far faster than any of them could have\nexpected. In the normal order of things, enemies might appear on the\nhorizon and give chase. Storms could blow out of nowhere in half an hour\n—but this had happened in minutes, and some ships were only seeing the\ntwin wonders now—a boat traveling faster across the waves than anyone\nhad ever seen in their lives, and the huge dark shadow in front of it that\ncould only be a sea demon.\nBe smart, Orholam damn you all, be smart or be too terrified to do\nanything at all. Please!\nCannons took time to load and couldn’t be left armed because the\npowder could go bad. Some idiot might shoot a musket at the passing form,\nbut that should be too small a disturbance for the monster to notice.\nThe sea demon bulled through the waters four hundred paces in front of\nthe fleet and kept going straight.\nGavin could hear the shouts from the ships now. The man in the crow’s\nnest of Gavin’s flagship was holding his hands to his head in disbelief, but\nno one did anything stupid.\nOrholam, just one more minute. Just—\nA signal mortar cracked the morning, and Gavin’s hopes bellyflopped in"

He swore that all the shouting on every ship in the fleet stopped at\nonce. And then began again a moment later, as the experienced sailors\nscreamed in disbelief at the terrified idiot captain who’d probably just killed\nthem all.\nGavin had eyes only for the sea demon. Its wake went straight, hissing\nbubbles and great undulations, another hundred paces. Another hundred.\nMaybe it hadn’t heard.\nThen his skimmer jetted right past the entire beast as the sea demon\ndoubled back on itself faster than Gavin would have believed possible.\nAs it completed its turn, its tail broke the surface of the water. It moved\ntoo fast for Gavin to make out details. Only that it was burning red-hot, the\ncolor of iron angry from the forge, and when that span—surely thirty paces\nlong—hit the water, the concussion made the signal mortar’s report sound\ntinny and small.\nGiant swells rolled out from the spot its tail had hit. From his dead stop,\nGavin was barely able to turn his skimmer before the waves reached him.\nHe dipped deep into the first wave and hurriedly threw green luxin forward,\nmaking the front of his craft wider and longer. He was shot upward by the\nnext swell and flung into the air.\nThe skimmer’s prow hit the next giant swell at too great of an angle and\nwent straight into it. Gavin was ripped off the skimmer and plunged into the\nwaves.\nThe Cerulean Sea was a warm wet mouth. It took Gavin in whole,\nchomped his breath out of him, rolled him over with its tongue, disorienting\nhim, made a play at swallowing him, and when he fought, finally let him\ngo.\nGavin surfaced and quickly found the fleet. He didn’t have time to draft\nan entire new skimmer, so he drafted smaller scoops around his arms,\nsucked in as much light as he could hold, threw his arms down to his sides,\nand pointed his head toward the sea demon. He threw luxin down and it\nthrew him forward.\nThe pressure of the waves was incredible. It obliterated sight, blotted out\nsound, but Gavin didn’t slow. With a body made so hard by years of\nworking a skimmer that he could cross the sea in a day, and a will made\nimplacable by years of being Prism and forcing the world to conform to his\nwishes, he pushed.\nHe felt himself slide into the sea demon’s slipstream: the pressure\nsuddenly eased and his speed doubled. Using his legs to aim, Gavin turned\nhimself deeper into the water, then jetted toward the surface.\nHe shot into the air. Not a moment too soon.\nHe shouldn’t have been able to see much of anything, gasping in air and\nlight, water streaming off his entire body. But the tableau froze, and he saw\neverything. The sea demon’s head was halfway out of the water, its\ncruciform mouth drawn shut so its knobby, spiky hammerhead could smash\nthe flagship to kindling. Its body was at least twenty paces across, and only\nfifty paces now from the ship.\nMen were standing on the port rail, matchlocks in hand. Black smoke"

        "text": "the flagship to kindling. Its body was at least twenty paces across, and only\nfifty paces now from the ship.\nMen were standing on the port rail, matchlocks in hand. Black smoke\nbillowed thick from a few. Others flared as the matches ignited powder in\nthe pans in the instant before they fired. Commander Ironfist and Karris\nboth stood, braced, fearless, glowing luxin forming missiles in their hands.\nIn the gun decks, Gavin saw men tamping powder into the cannons for\nshots they would never get off in time.\nThe other ships in the fleet were crowding around like kids around a\nfistfight, men perched on gunwales, mouths agape, all too few even loading\ntheir muskets.\nDozens of men were turning from looking at the monster approaching to\nsee what fresh horror this could be shooting into the air—and gaping,\nbewildered. A man in the crow’s nest was pointing at him, shouting.\nAnd Gavin hung in midair, disaster and mutilation only seconds away\nfrom his compatriots—and threw all he had at the sea demon.\nA coruscating, twisting wall of multicolored light blew out of Gavin,\nstreaking toward the creature.\nGavin didn’t see what it did when it struck the sea demon, or even if he\nhit it at all.\nThere was an old Parian saying that Gavin had heard but never paid\nattention to: “When you hurl a mountain, the mountain hurls you back.”\nTime resumed, unpleasantly quickly. Gavin felt like he’d been walloped\nwith a club bigger than his own body. He was launched backward, stars\nexploding in front of his eyes, clawing catlike, twisting, trying to turn—and\nsplashing in the water with another jarring slap, twenty paces back.\nLight is life. Years of war had taught Gavin never to leave yourself\nunarmed; vulnerability is a prelude to death. He found the surface and\nbegan drafting instantly. In the years he’d spent failing thousands of times\nwhile perfecting his skimmer, he’d also perfected methods of getting out of\nthe water and creating a boat—not an easy task. Drafters were always\nterrified of falling in the water and not being able to get out again.\nSo within seconds Gavin was standing on the deck of a new skimmer,\nalready drafting the scoops as he tried to assess what had happened.\nThe flagship was still floating, one railing knocked off, huge scrapes\nacross the wood of the port side. So the sea demon must have turned, must\nhave barely glanced off the boat. It had slapped its tail down again as it\nturned, though, because a few of the small sailing dinghies nearby had been\nswamped, and men were jumping into the water, other ships already\nheading toward them to pluck them from the sea’s jaws.\nAnd where the hell was the sea demon?\nMen were screaming on the decks—not shouts of adulation, but alarm.\nThey were pointing—\nOh shit.\nGavin began throwing luxin down the reeds as fast as possible. But the\nskimmer always started slow.\nThe giant steaming red-hot hammerhead surfaced not twenty paces\naway, coming fast. Gavin was accelerating and he caught the shockwave\ncaused by such a massive, blunt shape pushing through the seas. The front\nof the head was a wall, a knobby, spiky wall."

The front\nof the head was a wall, a knobby, spiky wall.\nBut with the swell of the shockwave helping him, Gavin began to pull\naway.\nAnd then the cruciform mouth opened, splitting that entire front\nhammerhead wide in four directions. As the sea demon began sucking water\nin rather than pushing it in front of it, the shockwave disappeared abruptly.\nAnd Gavin’s skimmer lurched back into the mouth.\nFully into the mouth. The open mouth was easily two or three times as\nwide as Gavin was tall. Sea demons swallowed the seas entire. The body\nconvulsed in rhythm, a circle that squeezed tighter and then opened wider,\njetting water past gills and out the back almost the same way Gavin’s\nskimmer did.\nGavin’s arms were shaking, shoulders burning from the muscular effort\nof pushing his entire body, his entire boat across the seas. Harder. Dammit,\nharder!\nThe sea demon arched upward just as Gavin’s skimmer shot out of its\nmouth. Its tetraform jaws snapped shut, and it launched itself into the air.\nHe shut his eyes and screamed, pushing as hard as he could.\nHe shot a look over his shoulder and saw the impossible: the sea demon\nhad breached. Completely. Its massive body crashed back down into the\nwater like all seven towers of the Chromeria falling into the sea at once.\nBut Gavin was faster, up to full speed. Filling with the fierce freedom of\nflight and the luminous lightness of life, he laughed. Laughed.\nThe sea demon pursued him, furious, still burning red, moving even\nfaster than before. But with the skimmer at full speed, Gavin was out of\ndanger. He circled out to sea as the distant shapes of men cheered on the\ndecks of every ship of the fleet, and the creature followed him.\nGavin led it for hours out to sea; then, circling wide in case it headed\nblindly in the last direction it had seen him go, he left it far behind.\nAs the sun set, exhausted and wrung out, he returned to his fleet. They’d\nlost two sailing dinghies, but not a single life. His people—for if they\nhadn’t been his before, he owned them heart and soul now—greeted him\nlike a god.\nGavin accepted their adulation with a wan smile, but the freedom had\nfaded. He wished he, too, could rejoice. He wished he could get drunk and\ndance and bed the finest-looking girl he could find. He wished he could find\nKarris somewhere in the fleet and fight or fuck or one and then the other. He\nwished he could tell the tale and hear it retold from a hundred lips and laugh\nat the death that had come so close to them all. Instead, as his people\ncelebrated, he went belowdecks. Alone. Waved Corvan away. Shook his\nhead at his wide-eyed son.\nAnd finally, in his darkened cabin, alone, he wept. Not for what had\nbeen, but for what he knew he must become.\nChapter 4\nKarris hadn’t joined the revelers celebrating surviving their brush with the\nsea demon.

        "text": "been, but for what he knew he must become.\nChapter 4\nKarris hadn’t joined the revelers celebrating surviving their brush with the\nsea demon. She woke before dawn and made her ablutions, and brushed out\nher hair to give herself time to think. It didn’t help.\nThe secret was rubbing Karris like a burr under the cinch strap. She\nbound hair black as her mood back in a ponytail as usual. She’d spent the\nlast five days putting pieces together: Gavin “falling ill” after the last battle\nof the war against his brother Dazen; Gavin breaking their betrothal; Gavin\nbeing astonished at learning about his bastard son Kip; Gavin being\ndifferent.\nThen she’d wasted time wondering how she’d been so dense. She—and\neveryone else—had attributed the changes to the trauma of war, the trauma\nof killing his own brother. His prismatic eyes had been proof, proof that\nGavin was Gavin. Gavin was brilliant and quite the liar, but he shouldn’t\nhave been able to fool her. She knew him too well. More to the point, she\nknew Dazen too well.\nThat was finished. She made her way to the forecastle as she had every\nmorning and began stretching. She went crazy if she didn’t do some\ncalisthenics every day. Her superior, Commander Ironfist, had thoughtfully\nbrought her two sets of blacks to wear, and both tunic and pants were cotton\ninfused with luxin—snug in spots, flexible everywhere, made for movement\nforemost and secondly to show off the Blackguards’ hardened physiques.\nBut though grunting and sweating were part and parcel of her life, that\ndidn’t mean she wanted to share it with every cretin on deck.\n“May I?” Ironfist asked, coming onto the deck. The commander of the\nBlackguard was a huge man. A good leader. Smart, tough, and intimidating\nas hell. When Karris nodded, he removed his headscarf and folded it neatly.\nIt was a Parian religious custom, the men covering their heads in respect to\nOrholam. But there were exceptions, and like many Parians, Ironfist\nbelieved the injunction only applied once the sun had risen fully above the\nhorizon.\nIronfist had once plaited his wiry black hair, but after the Battle of\nGarriston and the death of so many of his Blackguards, he’d shaved his\nhead completely bald in mourning. Another Parian custom. The headscarf\nthat had once covered his glory would now cover his grief.\nOrholam. All the dead Blackguards, many of them killed at the same\ntime by one exploding shell, a lucky shot that cared nothing for their elite\nskills in drafting and fighting. Her colleagues. Her friends. It was a yawning\npit, devouring everything but her tears.\nComing to stand parallel to Karris, Ironfist brought his hands together,\nthen separated them to a low-high guard. It was the beginning of the Marsh\nka. A suitable beginning, when muscles weren’t warm, and the ka didn’t\nrange far, so their moves could fit within the small confines of the\nforecastle. Sweep low, turn, back kick, roundhouse, land on the other foot,\nbalance—not as easy a task as usual on the bobbing deck."

Sweep low, turn, back kick, roundhouse, land on the other foot,\nbalance—not as easy a task as usual on the bobbing deck.\nIronfist led, and Karris was glad to let him do so. The sailors assigned to\nthe third watch stole glances at them, but Karris and Ironfist weren’t much\nvisible in the predawn gray, and the gazes were unobtrusive. The motions\nwere second nature. Karris focused on her body, the aches of sleeping on a\nwooden deck quickly worked out, the older aches more stubborn—the\ntraining injury that always made her hip ache, the stiffness in her left ankle\nfrom when she’d sprained it fighting a green wight with Gavin.\nNot Gavin. Dazen. Orholam curse him.\nIronfist moved to Korick’s ka, ramping up the intensity quickly, again, a\ngood choice for this tight of a space. And soon Karris was focusing on\ngetting just a little more length on her spinning roundhouse kick, getting\nfull extension and height on the back kick. She wasn’t nearly as tall as\nIronfist, but he could flick his long limbs out into kicks and spear hands\nwith unbelievable speed. She had to work hard to keep up with the pace he\nset.\nThe sun rose and they stopped only when it had almost cleared the\nhorizon. Apparently Ironfist had wanted some hard work, too. As she\nbreathed and gasped, leaning over with her hands propped on her thighs, he\nmopped his brow, made the sign of the seven to the new-risen sun, breathed\na short prayer, and put his ghotra on his shaven head.\n“You want something,” he said.\nHe picked up another cloth and threw it to her. Of course he’d brought\ntwo. He was conscientious like that. It also told her that he’d not joined her\nmorning calisthenics by accident. He’d come to talk.\nClassic Ironfist. Comes to talk, and says five words in the course of an\nhour.\nStill, he was right. So Karris said, “The Lord Prism is going to leave the\nfleet. He’ll either try to do so without your knowledge or he’ll at least try to\nget you to agree not to send any Blackguards with him. I want you to send\nme.”\n“He told you this?”\n“He didn’t have to tell me. He’s a coward; he always runs away.” Karris\nthought she’d worked out the rage in her calisthenics, but there it was, hot\nand crisp, ready to fling her skyward in an instant.\n“Coward?” Ironfist leaned against the railing. He looked at it. “Hmm.”\nNot a pace from where they stood, the railing was broken. Had been broken\nby a rampaging sea demon.\nA rampaging sea demon that Gavin had faced down.\nShe grunted. “That last part wasn’t supposed to come out.”\nIronfist wasn’t amused. “Come here. Eyes.”\nHe took her face in his big hands and stared at her eyes in the rising\nsunlight, measuring, intense. He said, “Karris, you’re the quickest drafter I\nhave, but you’re also the quickest to draft. Uncontrollable rage? Saying\nthings aloud you didn’t intend? Those are the hallmarks of a red or green"

Gavin.\nIronfist was still holding Karris’s face in both hands, staring into her\neyes. Standing on the deck in the soft warm light of dawn, they both\nrealized at the same time what it probably looked like.\nCommander Ironfist dropped his hands, cleared his throat. Karris\nthought it was the first time she’d ever seen him embarrassed. “Lord\nPrism,” Ironfist said. “Orholam’s eye grace you.”\n“And a good morning to you, Commander. Karris. Commander, I’d like\nto meet with you in an hour. Please summon Kip as well; I’ll require him\nafter our conversation. I believe he’s on the first barge.” Gavin’s white\ntunic, accented with gold embroidery, was actually clean—on a ship, in the\nmiddle of fleeing from a battle, someone had laundered his clothes. He\nmattered that much to people. Things just magically worked out for Gavin\nwithout his even trying. It was infuriating. At least his face looked drawn.\nGavin never slept well.\nIronfist looked like he wanted to say more, but he simply nodded and\nwalked away.\nWhich left Karris alone with Gavin for the first time since she’d thrown\na fit after learning he’d sired a bastard during their betrothal. She had\njumped out of their boat then. It was the first time they’d even been face-to-\nface since she’d slapped his smiling face—in the middle of the Battle of\nGarriston, in full view of his entire army.\nMaybe she had been drafting too much red and green. Anger and\nimpulsivity shouldn’t be a Blackguard’s most prominent traits. Or a lady’s.\n“Lord Prism,” she said, determined to be civil.\nHe looked at her silently, that restless intelligence in his eyes weighing,\nalways weighing. He looked at her almost mournfully, eyes touching her\nhair, her eyes, pausing at her lips, traveling quickly down her curves and\nback up to her eyes again, maybe flicking just for a moment to the sides of\nher eyes, where the wrinkles were starting.\nHe spoke softly: “Karris, you look better when you’re a sweaty mess\nthan most women look in their Sun Day best.” Gavin was handsome,\ncharming, and willful in all senses of the word, but something people often\nforgot was that he was smart, too.\nHe didn’t want to talk. He was stalling. Getting her confused and\ndefensive about something that had nothing to do with anything. Bastard!\nShe was sweaty, sticky, stinky, how could he compliment her now?\nHow dare he be nice after she’d slapped him in the face?\nHow dare his stupid little gambit work despite that she knew what he\nwas doing?\n“Go to hell,” she said, and walked away.\nNicely done, Karris. Professional, ladylike, civil. Bastard!\nChapter 5\nHow could a woman make you want to throw her ass into the sea and kiss"

Karris walked away and Gavin couldn’t\nhelp but admire her figure.\nDamn woman.\nHe saw that some of the sailors on deck were appreciating her figure,\ntoo. He cleared his throat to get their attention and lifted an eyebrow at\nthem; they quickly found work to do.\n“Is this perfectly necessary, Lord Prism?” a voice asked, coming up\nbehind Gavin. It was his new general, the man who’d worked with him\nsixteen years ago when he’d been Dazen’s most effective general, Corvan\nDanavis. They’d had to do some clever work to make everyone believe\nGavin’s “enemy” would now take orders from him.\n“By this, you mean this?” Gavin pointed at the rope ladder up to the\ncrow’s nest.\n“Yes.” General Danavis was the kind of man who prayed before a battle,\njust in case, and then went about his business as if he had absolutely no fear\nof death. Gavin didn’t think he experienced fear in the way other men did—\nbut he absolutely hated heights.\n“Yes,” Gavin said. He climbed up the rope ladder first. As he pulled\nhimself into the observation box, he was struck once again by a thought he\nhad regularly: his whole life was based on magic. He climbed this height\nfearlessly because he knew that if he fell, he could draft quickly enough to\ncatch himself. Though he might appear fearless, he wasn’t. There was\nsimply hardly ever any danger for him—totally unlike most people. People\nwould see him do incredible things, and think him incredible. And they\nwould be totally misunderstanding.\nThe sudden stab of fear was so sharp that he thought for a moment\nsomeone actually had hit him in the gut. He took a deep breath.\nCorvan came up, eyes locked on the crow’s nest, hands in a death grip\non each rung. Gavin hated to do this to his friend, but there were some\nconversations that one simply couldn’t risk having overheard.\nGavin helped him into the box. He let the general catch his breath. At\nleast the safety rails up here were nice and high and stout. Below, the sailors\nwere going about their work. The morning wind was rising, and the first\nwatch was out, checking lines and knots, the captain on the poop with a\nsextant, making sure of their position.\n“I’ve lost blue,” Gavin said. Get it out. Clean it up afterward.\nHe could tell from the expression on his face that Corvan Danavis had\nno idea what he was talking about. He stroked the red mustache he was\ngrowing back. He’d been known for dangling beads from that mustache,\nback during the Prisms’ War. “Blue what?”\n“I can’t see blue anymore, Corvan. It’s a sunny morning, I’m staring at\nthe sky and the Cerulean Sea—and I can’t see blue. I’m dying, and I need\nyour help deciding what I should do.”\nCorvan was one of the smartest men Gavin knew, but he looked lost.\n“Lord Prism, such a thing isn’t—wait, tell me one piece at a time. Did this\nhappen during your fight with the sea demon?”"

        "text": "“Lord Prism, such a thing isn’t—wait, tell me one piece at a time. Did this\nhappen during your fight with the sea demon?”\n“No.” Gavin looked over the waves. The rocking of the ship was\nsoothing, perfectly complemented by the harmonious blues of sky and sea.\nHe could remember the color so clearly he could swear he almost saw it. He\nwas a superchromat, one who could differentiate colors much more finely\nthan other men. He knew blue from its lightest to its darkest tones, from its\nviolet hues to its greenest ones, blue of every saturation, blue of every\nmixture.\n“After the battle,” Gavin said. “When we sailed away with all the\nrefugees. I woke the next day and I didn’t even notice for a while. It’s like\nlooking at a friend’s face and realizing you don’t know her name, Corvan.\nBlue’s there; it’s close. It’s like the color is on the tip of my eyes. If I don’t\nconcentrate, I don’t even notice it, except that the world seems washed out,\nflat. But if I concentrate as hard as I can, I can see gray where the blue\nshould be. Exactly the right tone and saturation and brightness, but… gray.”\nCorvan was silent for a long minute, red-haloed eyes squinting. “The\ntiming isn’t right,” he said. “Prisms are supposed to last some multiple of\nseven years. You should have five years left.”\n“I don’t think what’s happening to me is normal. I was never ordained\nthe Prism. Maybe this is what happens when a natural polychrome doesn’t\ngo through the Spectrum’s ceremony.”\n“I don’t know that that’s quite—”\n“Have you ever heard of any Prism going blind, Corvan? Ever?” The\nlast Prism before Gavin—the real Gavin—had been Alexander Spreading\nOak. He’d been a weak Prism, hid in his apartments mostly, had likely been\na poppy addict. The matriarch Eirene Malargos had been before him. She’d\nlasted fourteen years. Gavin had only the barest recollection of her from the\nSun Day rituals when he was a young boy.\n“Gavin, most Prisms don’t last sixteen years. Maybe the Spectrum’s\nceremony would have made you die earlier. If you’d died after seven years\nor fourteen, you’d never have experienced this. We can’t know.”\nThat was one problem with being a fraud. You can’t elicit information\nabout something that’s terribly secret that you should already know. The\nreal Gavin had been initiated as Prism-elect when he was thirteen years old.\nHe had sworn never to speak of it, not even to once-best-friend and brother\nDazen.\nIt was one oath that, so far as Gavin could tell, each member of the\nSpectrum had honored. Because in the sixteen years he’d been\nimpersonating his brother, no one had said a word about it. Unless, of\ncourse, they had made sidelong references to it—which he never picked up,\nand thus didn’t respond to, and thus let them know that he valued the\nsecrecy of the ceremony highly and they should, too.\nIn other words, he was caught in a trap of his own devising. Again.\n“Corvan, I don’t know what’s happening. I may wake up tomorrow and"

I may wake up tomorrow and\nnot be able to draft green, and the next day and not be able to draft yellow.\nOr maybe I’ve just lost blue and that’s all, but I have lost blue. Best-case\nscenario, if I manage to stay away from the Chromeria and am absent\nduring every blue ritual, I’ve got one year left—until next Sun Day. There’s\nno way I could maintain a fraud through the ceremonies, or skip them. If I\ncan’t draft blue by then, I’m dead.”\nGavin could see Corvan realizing all the consequences. His friend\nexpelled a breath. “Huh. Just when everything was going so well.” He\nchuckled. “We’ve got fifty thousand refugees that no one is going to want;\nwe’re running low on food; the Color Prince has just had a major victory\nand will now doubtless gather thousands more heretics to his banners; and\nnow we’re losing our greatest asset.”\n“I’m not dead yet,” Gavin said. He grinned.\nCorvan grinned ruefully back, but he looked sick. “Don’t worry, Lord\nPrism, I’m the last man who would count you out.” Gavin knew it was true,\ntoo. Corvan had accepted disgrace and exile to make Dazen’s defeat look\ncredible. He’d spent the last sixteen years in a backwater village, poor,\nunknown, quietly keeping an eye on the real Gavin’s bastard, Kip.\nAnother problem.\nCorvan looked down, blanched at the height, and gripped the rail tightly\nagain. “What are you going to do?”\n“The more time I spend with drafters, the more likely it is that someone\nwill notice something’s wrong. And if I’m at the Chromeria too long, the\nWhite will ask me to balance. If blue goes under red, I might not even be\nable to tell, much less balance it out. They’ll remove me.”\n“So…”\n“So I’m going to go to Azûlay to see the Nuqaba,” Gavin said.\n“Well, that’s one way of keeping Ironfist from accompanying you, but\nwhy do you want to see her?”\n“Because in addition to their capital having the largest library in the\nworld—where I can study without the entire Spectrum knowing what I’ve\nlooked at within an hour—the Parians also keep oral histories, including\nmany that are secret and some that are doubtless heretical.”\n“What are you looking for?”\n“If I’ve lost control of blue, Corvan, that means blue is out of control.”\nCorvan looked momentarily confused, then aghast. “You can’t be\nserious. I’ve never read a serious scholar who thought the bane were\nanything other than bogeymen the Chromeria invented to justify the actions\nof some of the early zealots and the luxors.”\nThe bane. Corvan used the old Ptarsu term correctly. The word could be\nsingular or plural. It had probably meant temple or holy place, but\nLucidonius’s Parians had believed they were abominations. They’d\nacquired the word itself as they’d acquired the world.\n“And if they’re wrong?”\nCorvan was quiet for a long time. Then he said, “So you’re going to"

Not a good one, mind you.”\n“I can be awfully charming,” Gavin said.\nCorvan smiled, but turned away. “You know,” he said, “what you did\nyesterday with the sea demon was… astounding. What you did in Garriston\nwas astounding, and not just the building of Brightwater Wall. Gavin, these\npeople will follow you to the ends of the earth. They will spread word of\nwhat you’ve done to anyone they meet. If it came down to a fight between\nyou and the Spectrum…”\n“The Spectrum already has more malleable candidates lined up to be the\nnext Prism, Corvan. If I defy them now, I’ll be in as bad of a spot as Dazen\nwas seventeen years ago. I won’t put the world through that again. The\npeople can love me, but if all their leaders unite against me, I’ll win nothing\nexcept for death for my friends and allies. I’ve done that once.”\n“So, what? You’re just going to leave us? What are you going to do\nabout Kip? He’s a tough kid, but he’s damaged and I think you’re the only\nthing he’s holding on to. If he finds out you’re not who you say you are, he\ncould shatter. There’s no telling what he’d turn into. Don’t do that to your\nsoul, Gavin. Don’t do that to the world. The last thing the Seven Satrapies\nneed is another young polychrome Guile, mad with rage and grief. And\nwhat are we supposed to do? Where are we supposed to put all these\npeople?”\n“Corvan, Corvan, Corvan. I’ve got a plan.” Sort of.\n“Somehow, my friend, I was afraid of that.” The crow’s nest swayed\nhard as the ship caught a rogue wave, and Corvan looked down at the deck\nfar below, swallowing. “I don’t suppose it includes an easy way for me to\nget down?”\nChapter 6\nIronfist grimaced at the missive in his hand. Usually, that expression, from\nhim, toward Gavin, would be a quick twitch, quickly smoothed away. This\ntime, his face twisted as if he were eating steak smoked in poisonwood.\n“You’re having me deliver orders. To the White,” Ironfist said.\nGavin had summoned the big bodyguard to his stateroom after trying\nseveral rooms to see which suited his purposes best. “Regarding my son.\nYes.” As Prism, Gavin didn’t have any authority over the White, but she had\nto be careful not to offend him. Both of them had to choose their battles\nwith each other. He thought this was one she wouldn’t choose.\n“You want Kip made a Blackguard.” Ironfist kept his voice flat. He was\nthe Blackguard’s commander. Technically, he alone was supposed to decide\nwho was invited to try to join. “Lord Prism, I’m struggling to find where to"

Technically, he alone was supposed to decide\nwho was invited to try to join. “Lord Prism, I’m struggling to find where to\nstart explaining how wrong and destructive that would be.”\nIt was a sunny day out, but the gleaming dark woods of the stateroom\nsoaked up light, made Gavin have to concentrate to see the commander’s\nexpressions. “I hope you know, Commander, that I have supreme respect\nfor you.”\nSlight eyebrow twitch. Disbelief. It actually was true, but Gavin\nsupposed he hadn’t given Ironfist many reasons to believe that.\nGavin continued, “But we find ourselves in a situation that requires\nquick action. Refugees. Aggrieved satraps. A city lost. Rebellion. Ring a\nbell?”\nIronfist’s face turned to stone.\nGavin needed to handle this better. Tell the man you respect him, and\nthen treat him like he’s an idiot? “Commander,” he said, “how many\nBlackguards did you lose at Garriston?”\n“Fifty-two dead. Twelve wounded. Fourteen so close to breaking the\nhalo that they’ll have to be replaced.”\nGavin paused long enough to be respectful of the loss. He’d already\nknown the number, of course. Knew the faces and the names of the dead.\nThe Blackguard was the Prism’s personal guard, and yet not under his\ncontrol. He was treading on that line. “And pardon me for speaking so\nbluntly, but that number must be replenished.”\n“Three years at least, and the quality of the Blackguard as a whole won’t\nrecover for ten or more. I’ll have to promote people who are inadequately\ntrained. They’ll not be able to train those beneath them as well. You\nunderstand what your actions have done to us? Killed a generation and\nretarded two. I’ll leave the Blackguard a shadow of what it was when I got\nit.” Ironfist kept his voice level, but the fury beneath it was unmistakable.\nUncharacteristic for him.\nGavin said nothing, jaw clenched, eyes dead. This was the hell of\nleading: to see a man as an individual with hopes, families, loves, favorite\nfoods, more alert in the morning or at night, fond of hot peppers and\ndancing girls and singing off key. Then the next hour to see him as a\nnumber and be willing to sacrifice him. Those thirty-eight dead men and\nfourteen women had saved tens of thousands of people, had almost saved\nthe city. Gavin had put them in a place where he knew they might die, and\nthey had. He’d do it again. He held Ironfist’s gaze.\nIronfist looked away. “Lord Prism,” he added. There was no remorse in\nhis voice, but Gavin didn’t require unquestioning obedience. Just\nobedience.\nGavin glanced up at the open space above the rafters between his\nstateroom and the next. “The Blackguard requires recruits. The autumn\nclass probably hasn’t even started yet, and Kip is ideal. You’ve seen him\ndraft.”\n“It’s too physically demanding. Twenty weeks of hellish training and\nfights every month that purge the deadwood. From forty-nine to the seven\nbest. He’d never make it even if he hadn’t burned his hand. If he slims\ndown, maybe in a year or—”"

If he slims\ndown, maybe in a year or—”\n“He’ll make it,” Gavin said. It wasn’t an expression of confidence.\nSilence as Ironfist grappled with the implication. Then disbelief. “You\nwant me to induct him undeservedly?”\n“Do I need to answer that?”\n“You’ll publicly make him a favorite? You’ll destroy that boy.”\n“Everyone will think he’s favored regardless.” Gavin shrugged and\nmade sure he was speaking forcefully. “He’ll serve the purpose for which\nhe was made, or he’ll break in pursuit of it, just like the rest of us.”\nCommander Ironfist didn’t reply. He was a man who understood the\npower of silence.\n“Come with me, Commander.” They walked together out to a balcony.\nThe door between the rooms was thin, and there were open spaces beside\nthe rafters, perhaps so the captain could yell orders to his secretaries who in\nnormal times had their offices in the cuddy. The exchange hadn’t gone\nexactly how he wanted, but it would serve. Kip should have overheard\neverything.\nNow Gavin had some words for Ironfist, out of Kip’s hearing. “Kip is\nmy son, Commander. I acknowledged him as such when I could have\ninstead let him die without anyone knowing better. I’m not going to destroy\nKip. He’s fat, and he’s awkward, and he’s a powerful polychrome. He’s\ngoing to grow up fast when he gets to the Chromeria. He can become a\nlaughingstock or he can become a great man. He’s getting a late start. The\nsatraps’ sons and daughters will devour him. I want you to soak up every\nhour of his time, remake him physically, make him tough mentally, make\nhim learn the measure of himself. When he’s earned the respect of the\nBlackguards, when he doesn’t care what the vipers think of him, I’ll ask\nhim to quit the Blackguard and jump in the vipers’ den.”\n“You’re grooming him to be the next Prism,” Ironfist said.\n“Why, Commander, Orholam alone chooses his Prisms,” Gavin said.\nIt was a joke, but Ironfist didn’t laugh. “Indeed, Lord Prism.”\nGavin kept forgetting that Ironfist was a religious man.\n“I’m not going to go easy on him,” Ironfist said. “If he’s to join my\nBlackguard, he has to earn it.”\n“Sounds perfect,” Gavin said.\n“He’s a polychrome.” Polychromes were strongly discouraged from such\ndangerous service.\n“He wouldn’t be the first exception,” Gavin said. He would be the first\nin a long, long time.\nUnhappy silence. “And somehow I have to convince the White to allow\nthis.”\n“I trust you.” Gavin grinned.\nIronfist’s glare could have soured honey. Gavin laughed, but he noted it\nagain. Ironfist respected him, but Gavin’s charm did nothing to this man.\n“You’re leaving us,” Ironfist said slowly. “After you got half my people\nkilled, you’re planning to leave, and leave us behind, aren’t you?”\nDamn."

I\nwon’t do anything at all for you if you don’t let me do my job. If you make\nmy work meaningless, why should I help yours? Is this what you call\nsupreme respect?”\nAh. Note to self: charm is less effective on people who have good\nreason to kick your ass. Gavin raised his hands. “What do you want?”\n“Not want. Demand. You take a Blackguard with you. My choice. I\ndon’t know what your mission is, but where one can go, two can. Note that\nI would much rather you travel with an entire squad, but I’m a reasonable\nman.”\nIt actually was far more reasonable than Gavin would have expected.\nMaybe Ironfist wasn’t as good at politics as Gavin had thought. Of course,\nhe was probably too busy figuring out how to kill things efficiently to get as\nmuch practice in politics as Gavin got. Ironfist probably meant to come with\nGavin himself—which would definitely not work, but after Ironfist thought\nabout all the work he had to do rebuilding and training the Blackguard, he\nwould realize that. Too late.\n“Done,” Gavin said quickly, before the man could reconsider.\n“Then it’s a deal,” Ironfist said. He extended a hand, and Gavin took it.\nIt was an old Parian way of sealing deals, not much used anymore. But\nIronfist looked Gavin in the eye as he clasped his hand. “I’ve already had\nsomeone request the assignment,” he said.\nImpossible. I didn’t even tell him I was leaving until—\n“Karris,” Ironfist said. And then he smiled, toothily.\nBastard.\nChapter 7\nKip sat in the secretaries’ office, fiddling nervously with the bandage on his\nleft hand as Ironfist and Gavin talked on the balcony off the ship’s stern. He\nhad been seated with his back to the wall between the office and the Prism’s\nstateroom, but having overheard too much, he quietly moved to one of the\nsecretaries’ chairs, farther back from the wall, so it wouldn’t look like he’d\nbeen eavesdropping.\nA Blackguard. Him. It was like winning a contest he hadn’t even known\nhe was competing in. He hadn’t really thought about his future yet; he\nfigured the Chromeria would take the next few years of his life and he’d go\nfrom there. But the toughest people he knew in the world were\nBlackguards: Karris and Ironfist.\nThe stateroom door opened and Ironfist stepped out. He gave Kip a\nsharp look. A disapproving look. And all at once Kip realized he was being\nimposed on Ironfist—the man didn’t want Kip the fatty debasing his\nBlackguards. His heart dropped so fast it left a smoking crater in the deck.\n“The Prism will see you now,” Ironfist said. And he left.\nKip stood on weak knees.

You did some\npretty amazing things the other day. Come. I need to see your eyes.”\nFeeling suddenly awkward, Kip followed Gavin out onto the stern\nbalcony. In the bright morning light, Gavin looked at Kip’s irises.\n“A definite green ring. Congratulations. No one will ever mistake you\nfor a non-drafter again.”\n“That’s… great.”\nGavin smiled indulgently. “I know it’s a lot to get used to, and I suppose\nsomeone’s already told you this, but you used a lot of magic in the battle,\nKip. A lot. Going green golem isn’t something we teach anymore because a\nperson can generally only do it two or three times in their life. It burns\nthrough your power—and your life—at an incredible rate. The power’s\nintoxicating, but beware of it. You’ve seen some of the greatest drafters in\nthe world work, and you can’t assume that you can do everything they can\ndo. But look at me, lecturing. Sorry.”\n“No, it’s fine. It’s…” It’s the kind of thing a father does. Kip didn’t say it\nout loud. He swallowed the sudden lump in his throat.\nGavin looked over the waves at his fleet following them. He was\nsomber, pensive. Finally, he spoke. “Kip, I don’t get to be fair to you. I\ncan’t spend the time with you that you deserve, that I owe you. I can’t tell\nyou all the secrets that I wish I could. I can’t introduce you to your new life\nthe way I wish. You’ve chosen to be known as my son, and I respect that.\nThat’s how you’ll be known. As my son, I have work for you to do, and I\nneed to tell you what that work is now, because I’m leaving today. I’ll come\nto the Chromeria every once in a while, but not often. Not for the next\nyear.”\nThere were too many thoughts at once. Everything Kip knew had been\nturned on its head too many times. In the last few months he’d gone from\nbeing a child with a haze-addled single mother to losing his village, his\nmother, his life. He’d been flung into the Chromeria, and into the company\nof the best drafters and fighters in the world.\nAnd on the very day his father had accepted him, recognized him as a\nson instead of a bastard, he’d found a note from his mother claiming Gavin\nGuile had raped her. She’d begged Kip to kill Gavin. She’d probably been\nhigh when she wrote it, of course. So it had been the last thing she’d\nwritten. It didn’t magically make it different from all the other lies she’d\ntold Kip over the years.\nShe said she loved me.

And you may, of course,\nfail or choose not to do this, but—”\nKip swallowed. Why was his father dancing so carefully about asking\nhim to join the Blackguard? “You’re scaring me more by hedging than you\nwould if you just told me,” Kip said.\n“First, you have to impress your grandfather without me there. He will\nsummon you. He will not be pleasant. We’ll count it a victory if you avoid\nwetting yourself.” He grinned that Guile grin, then sobered. “Do your best.\nIf you can impress him, you’ll have done more than I ever could. But\nwhatever you do, don’t make an enemy of him.”\n“And that’s going to be impossible?”\n“No—well, maybe—but I was starting with the easy assignment. I want\nyou to destroy Luxlord Klytos Blue.”\nKip blinked. That wasn’t “Join the Blackguard” either. “That thing about\nbeing more scared by your hedging than the assignment? I take it back.”\n“By destroy, I mean do whatever you have to do to make him resign his\nseat on the Spectrum. I need that seat, Kip.”\n“For what?”\n“I can’t tell you. What you should ask is, what do I mean when I say,\n‘Do whatever you have to’?”\n“Right, then, that,” Kip said. He was hoping this was all some kind of\njoke, but the feeling in his stomach told him that it wasn’t.\n“If you can’t get Klytos to resign of his own will, or through blackmail,\nkill him.”\nA chill radiated from Kip’s spine to his shoulders. He swallowed.\n“Your choice. I’m trusting you with that. This is war, Kip. You saw what\nhappens when the wrong man is in power. The governor of Garriston could\nhave prepared his city. He knew what was coming. Preparing the city would\nhave made him deeply unpopular and it would have cost him a fortune. So\ninstead, he chose to let them all die. One man caused all that carnage,\nsimply by his inaction. If we hadn’t been there, it would have been much,\nmuch worse. This is like that. That’s all I can tell you.”\nIt was impossible, but Kip felt a calm. The impossibility didn’t matter\nright now. He could grapple with that when his father was gone. “Does he\ndeserve it?” he asked.\nGavin took a deep breath. “I want to say yes to make it easier on you,\nbut ‘deserving’ is a slippery concept.

        "text": "deserve it?” he asked.\nGavin took a deep breath. “I want to say yes to make it easier on you,\nbut ‘deserving’ is a slippery concept. Does a coward who deserts his\ncomrades deserve to be shot? No, but it has to be done because the stakes\nare so high. Klytos Blue is a coward who believes lies. If a man believes\nlies and repeats them, is he a liar? Maybe not, but he has to be stopped. I\ndon’t believe Klytos is an evil man, Kip. I don’t believe he deserves to die\nout of hand or I’d kill him myself. But the stakes are high, and they’re\nrising. Do what you must. Get in the Blackguard first. I’ve secured a tryout\nfor you. Get in, and the position will help you accomplish the rest.”\nSure. Simple as that. Of course, for Gavin Guile, it probably was as\nsimple as that. Things were so easy for a man of his powers, he probably\nthought they were easy for other people. “What are we trying to do?” Kip\nasked. “Ultimately, I mean.”\n“War is a spreading fire. And every old grudge is dry wood, begging for\nflame. When I fought my brother, men joined me who hated me, but they\nhated their neighbors more, and those neighbors then sided with him. We\nkilled two hundred thousand people in less than four months, Kip. I had a\nchance to stop this new war at one city, a few thousand dead. I failed. There\nare satrapies that wouldn’t mind seeing Atash burn, that wouldn’t mind that\nfire spreading to Blood Forest, that don’t want their sons to die defending\nRuthgar, that don’t want their daughters to have to be Freed after defending\nParia, that don’t want to raise their taxes for Ilytian heathens, that don’t\nwant to send their crops to those filthy Aborneans.”\nKip understood. “Which leaves no one.”\n“We’re trying to stop the war before it engulfs everyone.”\n“How do you stop a war?” Kip asked.\n“You win. So you do your part, and I’ll do mine.”\n“How long do I have?” Kip asked. A small part of him rebelled. It\nwasn’t fair to ask a boy to do this. It wasn’t what you’d ask of a son. But\nKip was only a son by his father’s grace. He was an unwanted bastard, and\nif Gavin held the boy he’d never known at arm’s length, how could Kip\nblame him?\n“Depends on how long the Color Prince licks his wounds in Garriston.\nIt’s probably too much to hope he’ll stay the winter, so he’ll most likely\nhead west. I imagine Idoss will hold him off for a few months. Losing Idoss\nshould be enough to move the Spectrum. If not… six months, Kip. Eight if\nwe’re lucky. If we don’t save the city of Ru, he’ll get their saltpeter caves\nand iron mines and we’ll be plunged into a war worse than the False\nPrism’s War, and unlikely to be as brief.”\nKip was in so far over his head he couldn’t even see the surface. “Why\nme?” he asked."

        "text": "Prism’s War, and unlikely to be as brief.”\nKip was in so far over his head he couldn’t even see the surface. “Why\nme?” he asked.\n“Because audacity is a young man’s sword. Daring is a gun. And, to be\nblunt, if you fail in non-spectacular fashion, you’ll merely look like a petty\nchild. That would damage your reputation but not mine. And it won’t get\neither of us killed. You’re a good weapon because to look at you, you look\nlike a child, an affable boy who wouldn’t hurt a fly.”\nAffable. Code for “fat and nice.” Next I’ll be “jolly.” “I’m so unlikely\nthat I’m perfect?” Kip said.\n“Exactly.”\n“I thought that once, right before I ran away from Garriston.” Kip had\nthought no one would think a child would come to spy on the Color Prince\nand rescue Liv. That had turned out well.\n“But you’re stronger now.”\n“That was two weeks ago!”\nGavin laughed.\n“Doesn’t that tell you something?” Kip insisted.\nGavin smiled. “It should tell you something, too.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\nGavin got serious. “That I believe in you.”\nKip wasn’t sure what to do with that, not when Gavin delivered it\nstraight. He couldn’t laugh it off, couldn’t make a joke out of it. It was too\nobviously true, and it warmed him. Kip grimaced. “You’re really good at\nthis, aren’t you?”\nGavin rubbed Kip’s head. “Almost as good as I think I am.” He grinned.\n“You know, Kip, when this is all over…” He let the words fall away, and\nhis good humor went with them.\n“It’s never going to be over, is it?” Kip asked.\nThe Prism took a deep breath. “Not the way I’d like.”\n“Are we going to lose?” Kip asked.\nGavin was quiet for a while. He shrugged and smirked. “Odds are.” He\nwrapped an arm around Kip’s wide shoulders, squeezed, released him. “But\nodds are for defying.”\nChapter 8\nKarris had all the gear packed and ready. Gavin, she assumed, would draft\nanother skimmer rather than take one of the ships. He always was an\nimpatient man. She checked her gear again to calm her nerves. She hated\nthinking she’d forgotten something. Hated not knowing what to prepare for\nbut trying to pack light.\nOf course, Gavin would come out and say, “Let’s go!” and try to leave\nimmediately. As if, having invented a way to cross the entire Cerulean Sea\nin a day and save a month of sailing, he didn’t have an extra hour or two for\npacking.\nWhy had she volunteered for this again?\nBecause you don’t have anything better to do than saving the world and\nrevealing the cancer at its heart.\nThere was that.\nGavin came onto the deck, and Karris was struck once again by how\nevery eye turned to him.

Now that he’d saved all their\nlives again, she was surprised that they didn’t spontaneously burst out into\napplause.\nThe sailors burst out into applause.\nSon of a bitch.\nTwo Blackguards fell in beside him as he came out the door. Someone\nmust have shouted the word that the Prism was making an appearance,\nbecause in moments, people were piling out onto the deck. The captain, a\nstalwart rotund Ruthgari, made no attempt to stop them or get his sailors\nback to work. They nearly trampled each other on their way out of the\ncabins below, and sailors, soldiers, traders, nobles, and refugee peasants\nalike came out to get a look at their Prism.\nHe’d been on board with them for the last week, and he’d been in\nGarriston with them before that. It wasn’t like he’d changed. But somehow\nwhere he’d been an important man before, now he was theirs. Their savior.\nPitting himself against a sea demon and winning had made Gavin larger\nthan life.\nIf Karris hadn’t seen with her own eyes how close Gavin had come to\ngetting eaten, she might have had the cynicism to think he had arranged the\nwhole thing.\nThe people were packed on the deck—every ship had been filled to\nbursting in order to get the refugees out of Garriston before the Color Prince\ntook over—and all of them were talking to each other, sharing inanities like,\n“Do you see him? Is he saying anything?”\nGavin made his way over to Karris, Blackguards in tow. They, like she,\nscanned the crowd for threats. Gavin said, “Milady, would you do me the\nhonor of accompanying me on a small expedition?”\nWhat do you do when someone asks you kindly to do what you’ve\nalready wheedled and schemed for? “I would be… delighted,” Karris said.\n“Excellent.” Gavin smiled without any hint of irony. He did have a nice\nsmile. The worm.\nHe raised his hands. “My people!” he said. He had a commander’s\nvoice, an orator’s voice with the trick of somehow speaking so loudly and\nclearly that everyone could understand him without his seeming to shout.\n“My people! I leave you today, but only for a time. I go to make a place for\nyou. I go ahead of you. And now I ask you to be fearless and grow strong.\nThere are days ahead that will test us all. There is work that only you can\ndo, though I will help as I can. I’m leaving General Danavis in charge. He\nhas my full trust. He will lead well.”\nThe words walked a narrow line, and he surely knew it.

Gavin had been promachos\nduring the war with his brother, and had been relieved of the title in less\nthan six months. To be a promachos was to be emperor in truth.\nIt was one of the very things the Blackguard had been created to protect\nagainst.\nAt the same time, what else was Gavin going to tell all these people?\nThat he was leaving and they were going to have to fend for themselves?\nThey had nothing. They’d left everything in Garriston.\nHe kept talking, and Karris kept scanning the crowd. Ironfist had taught\nthem the telltales for spotting an assassin, of course. Someone who was\nsweating profusely, shifting awkwardly, anyone who was keeping their\nhands concealed in such a way that they might be hiding something. For\nKarris, it was more of a feeling. An assassin would feel out of place.\nSomeone who wasn’t listening, because they didn’t care what was said.\nSomeone who only cared about his own mission.\nKarris realized two things at the same time. First, that was exactly what\nshe was doing. Second, there were at least fifty Blackguards on deck. Not to\nmention a couple of hundred fanatical common folk who would tear apart\nanyone who even dared offend their Prism. If there were a perfect moment\nto not attempt an assassination, this would be it.\nGavin drafted a set of steps from the deck down to the water and drafted\na yellow-hulled scull onto the water, complete with rowing apparatus for\ntwo.\nThe Blackguards on duty were Ahhanen and Djur. Neither man looked\npleased, but they saluted Karris, transferring protection to her. Life, light,\npurpose.\nGavin descended the steps and took his place. He didn’t offer Karris a\nhand onto the scull, which she appreciated. Now, in this, they weren’t some\nlord and a lady. She was his protector, thank you very much.\nAs she took her place on the oars, she said, “No blue this time, huh?”\nThe last time they’d sculled together, she’d accused him of using blue luxin\nfor the hull because blue was practically invisible against the waves and it\nhad unnerved her.\nHe grunted.\nShe shouldn’t have said it. He’d doubtless drafted the scull from yellow\nto be kind to her. She’d complained about what he’d done last time, so this\ntime he was doing it differently. And she’d thrown it in his face. Nice,\nKarris.\nThey pushed off and sculled together in silence, heading west. When\nthey were half a league out, Gavin signaled that they should stop.\n“I showed them all the skimmer yesterday, but there was a lot going on,”\nhe said. A lot going on. She supposed that was one way to describe the\npanic fifty thousand helpless people felt when they realize they’re under\nattack by a sea demon and then watching their Prism lure it away from them\nsingle-handedly, using magic the likes of which no one had ever seen. “I\ndidn’t want to give all the drafters a tutorial today in how to make one for\nthemselves.

Just because a secret’s going to get out eventually doesn’t mean\nyou need to shout it from the rooftops.” He stopped, seeming to realize that\nshe might not be the person to say that to.\n“So where are we going?” Karris asked. She didn’t want to talk about\nthat now either.\n“I told my people I’d go prepare a place for them.”\n“You tell people things all the time.”\nGavin opened his mouth, hesitated. Licked his lips. Didn’t say whatever\nhe was going to say. “I deserved that. Point is, I’ve got fifty thousand\nrefugees. If we put them in one of the little Tyrean coastal towns, they’ll\noverwhelm the locals, and still be just a short march down the road for the\nColor Prince. They’ll be defenseless, and they’ll starve to death even if he\ndoesn’t come after them. Point is, mostly for unfair reasons, no one will\nwant to help a bunch of Tyreans.”\n“So you’ve come up with an elaborate solution.”\n“Not elaborate. Elegant. Fine, I suppose you could call it elaborate, too.”\nHe began drafting the scoops and straws for the skimmer. “I’m going to put\nthem on Seers Island.”\nHe was officially mad. Karris said, “That entire island is ringed with\nreefs. No one can get ships in there.”\n“I can.”\n“And how do the Seers feel about this?” she demanded.\n“Surprised, I’d guess. I haven’t told them yet.”\n“Oh, wonderful.”\n“Who knows?” Gavin said. “They are Seers. Maybe they’ve foretold my\ncoming.” His grin withered in the heat of her disapproval. He handed over\none of the reeds and they began skimming.\nLast time they’d skimmed together, they had held hands, Karris\nsqueezing out the rhythm so that they would be in time with each other.\nThis time he didn’t even extend his hand toward her. Good, it saved her the\ntrouble of rejecting it.\nRegardless, they found their rhythm and began cruising across the\nsurface of the sea. Within half an hour, the mountains of Seers Island came\ninto view. But they were farther away than they appeared, and it took hours\nbefore Gavin and Karris approached the island. Even then, Gavin didn’t\nhead straight in. He turned south of the island, keeping between it and\nTyrea, whose Karsos Mountains were just visible, purple in the distance.\nFinally, Gavin turned them north, toward a huge bay. It was a shallow\ncrescent, big enough for Gavin’s entire fleet to fit into, but too wide in\nKarris’s half-educated opinion to offer protection from the winter storms\nthat would rip between the island and the mainland in a few months.\nThere were no known settlements. This island was taboo, forbidden,\nholy. Lucidonius had given it to the Seers hundreds of years ago. And, of\ncourse, it was surrounded by reefs that would destroy any ship with a\ngreater displacement than a canoe or a skimmer, and even those could only\nmake it in at high tide.\nAs they came in closer, skimming a mere hand’s breadth over the coral,"

        "text": "greater displacement than a canoe or a skimmer, and even those could only\nmake it in at high tide.\nAs they came in closer, skimming a mere hand’s breadth over the coral,\nKarris saw an enormous pier jutting from the undeveloped shore. A pier that\ngleamed like gold—a pier of solid yellow luxin. She was about to comment\nto Gavin about it—Had he created this? Was this where he’d been going in\nthe last few days?—when she saw something else.\nThere were a couple of hundred armed men and women standing on the\nbeach in an unruly mob.\n“Gavin, those people look angry.”\nAmused, Gavin lifted his eyebrows momentarily. “Not as angry as\nthey’re going to be.” And then, heedless, he beached the skimmer directly\nin front of the mob.\nChapter 9\n“Commander, could I talk with you for a moment?” Kip asked.\nAfter Gavin and Karris left, Commander Ironfist and the Blackguards\nhad taken over the fastest galleass in the fleet and, taking Kip, had headed\nfor the Chromeria.\nEveryone had been busy all the time for the first few days, with the\nBlackguards following the sailors’ lead and trying to learn their craft.\nCommander Ironfist didn’t want his Guards to sit idle, and given the chance\nto master some new skill, they dove right in. The sailors grumbled at first,\nbut were eventually won over by how quickly the Blackguards learned.\nFor those who weren’t on duty, Ironfist supervised shifts of sparring and\ncalisthenics on the galleass’s small castle. Kip was allowed to watch, but\nmostly he tried to keep out of the way. It had taken him days to figure out\nwhen the commander would have a few empty minutes for Kip to bother\nhim.\nThe commander looked at Kip. Nodded. Walked back into the cabin the\ncaptain was sharing with him for his work.\nKip had mustered his courage, but now he found it leaking away as they\ncame into the small room and sat at a little table. “Sir, I… During the battle\nat Garriston, I—Well, some of it doesn’t seem real, like I’m remembering\nthings that couldn’t really have happened, do you know what I—But that’s\nnot what I…” Kip was being stupid, inarticulate. He flexed with his\nbandaged hand. It hurt. “I killed the king—satrap—whatever. When I did it,\nMaster Danavis—I mean, General Danavis—shouted at me, saying I’d\nfouled everything. I didn’t mean to disobey, it just didn’t—I don’t know,\nmaybe I did mean to disobey.” The words wouldn’t come out right. He felt\nlike he was veering all over the place. He’d killed people, and part of him\nhad liked it. Like he was smashing in the faces of those who wouldn’t take\nhim seriously. Except that he had literally smashed faces in, and when he\nthought about it, he felt wretched. But that was too hard to say. “I still don’t\nknow what I messed up, and what it cost. Can you tell me?”\nCommander Ironfist drew a deep breath. Seemed to reconsider. “Hand,”\nhe said."

Seemed to reconsider. “Hand,”\nhe said.\nKip presented his right hand, not sure what the imposing commander\nwanted.\nCommander Ironfist looked at him flatly.\n“Oh!” Kip presented his left hand. The commander unwrapped the\nbandage. He said, “I was fourteen years old when I killed my first man. My\nmother was the deya of Aghbalu—a regional governor—and she was\nangling to depose Paria’s satrapah and become satrapah herself, though I\ndidn’t know that then. I was walking past her chambers one day, and I heard\nher cry out. I had first drafted perhaps two weeks before. I went in, and I\nsaw the assassin. Small man, features of the despised Gatu tribe, teeth\nstained from chewing khat, and poison on the wavy blade of his kris. I\nremember thinking that only if I drafted could I stop him in time. But the\ndrafting didn’t just happen as it had two weeks before. He stabbed my\nmother, and while I stood there, not believing what I’d seen, he jumped out\nthe window he’d climbed in and tried to escape over the roofs. I chased\nhim, and I beat him with my fists, and I threw him off the roof.”\nKip swallowed. Ironfist had chased an assassin, unarmed, across\nrooftops, and killed a man armed with a poisoned blade—when he was\nfourteen?\nIronfist paused, examining Kip’s burned hand. He gestured for the\nointment the chirurgeons had given Kip and rubbed it on the raw skin. Kip\nhissed and clenched every muscle in his body to keep from crying out.\n“You need to stretch your fingers,” Ironfist said. “All day, every day. If\nyou don’t, your fingers will tighten up into claws in no time. The scars will\nfreeze your palm and fingers, and you’ll have to split your skin open just to\nmove. Take a little pain now or a lot later.”\nThis was a little pain?\nCommander Ironfist went back to his story as he wrapped Kip’s hand in\nfresh bandages. “The point isn’t that I’m a hard man, Kip. The point is I\nmade mistakes. My mother was trained in dawat, our tribe’s martial art. Not\nhighly proficient, but trained well for a civilian. If I hadn’t come in the\nroom and she hadn’t been worried for me, she could have fended him off\nuntil her guards came. And once I chased him down, I shouldn’t have killed\nhim. We could have found out who sent him.”\n“But you were just a boy,” Kip said. Having his hand wrapped back up\nand immobile was like crawling back into a warm bed on a cold morning.\n“And so are you,” Commander Ironfist said. Kip started to protest, but\nCommander Ironfist wasn’t finished. “Even if you weren’t, I’ve seen grown\nmen and women make worse mistakes in battle. If we naturally made good\ndecisions in battle, there’d be no need to train for it.”\n“Did I get people killed? I killed a king, and I still can’t figure out if it"

Get control of\nyourself.\n“I don’t know,” Commander Ironfist said. “But the Color Prince exposed\nKing Garadul on purpose. He wanted him killed. Maybe he’d planned it\nwell in advance. Certainly us capturing Garadul rather than killing him\nwould have tripped him up. General Danavis is very, very good at what he\ndoes. He understood in a moment. Most people wouldn’t have. Especially\nnot fifteen-year-old boys who’ve never been in a battle before.”\n“But I ignored him. I wanted to kill the king so much I wouldn’t listen to\nanyone. Anything.” Kip had crushed the king’s head. He could remember\nthe feeling of the man’s skull cracking, brains squishing, blood splurting.\n“You were deep in the grip of your color, Kip. So you blundered. Maybe\nyou precipitated a wider war. Maybe. Maybe the general was wrong. Maybe\nKing Garadul would have been far worse than this prince. We don’t know.\nCan’t know. It happened. Do better next time. That’s what I do.”\nThat’s why you train.\n“Did you ever find out who sent him?” Kip asked.\n“The assassin? My sister thought she did. Let’s head to the galley. It’s\ntime for supper, though not as much as either of us would like.”\n“But did she get her vengeance on the killer?” Kip asked.\n“You might say that.”\n“What’d she do to him?”\n“She married him.”\nChapter 10\n~Gunner~\nTap.

        "text": "after you’ve been made a bung boy for every man on deck with a grudge\nand a hunger.\nI kick, stabbing one foot hardened to leather and bone by a life barefoot\nright at the tiger shark’s nose. I see a flash of the milky membrane over its\neyes as I’m thrown, almost lifted out of the water by the force of its strike.\nThe shark shivers, stunned. Sensitive nose, my father told me. Looks\nlike he told me right.\nGunner ain’t no easy meat.\n“Ceres! You think I did this? I didn’t! It was the Prism! Gavin Guile!\nThat damn boy blew up the ship, not me. Go get him, you dumb broad!”\nCeres hates it when you dirty her face with exploded ship, and I’ve done\nthat more than a time or three.\nThe shark recovers, darts away. For one second, I think I’m safe, that\nCeres is going to be reasonable. There’s other meat out there. Then the\nshark turns, starts swimming back.\nThis is grudge. This is Ceres herself. And she’s used to crushing those\nwho defy her by sheer brute force.\n“Ceres! Don’t do this!”\nI got a pistol still. Lost my musket when it blew up in my hands during\nthe fight with the Prism and his Blackguards—which is infuriating,\nimpossible, I’ve never double-charged a musket in my life. But that’s\nsomething to worry about later. The pistol might even still work, despite my\nplunge into the water. I’ve been trying to make a pistol that’s proof against\nCeres’s spit for years. Nothing’s worked against a full plunge, though, and\nshooting into the water is a fool’s game anyway. Ceres’s sea skin shields her\nkin. So I pull my knife instead, its blade three hands long.\n“Damn you, Ceres. I said I was sorry!” Sea demons are Ceres’s sons. I\nkilled one, years back. She hain’t forgiven me yet. Won’t, until I sacrifice\nsomething surreptitiously special.\nThe tiger shark comes straight at me. No subtlety, and I got her timing\nnow.\nShe strikes, and my heels collide with her soft nose one more time. This\ntime, I absorb some of the blow in my knees, still giving the beast a good\nshock, but not letting myself be thrown so far. I stab for the eye, miss, and\nbury the knife in its gills. Pull it out with a crimson gush following the\nblade like fire from a cannon’s throat.\nA mortal blow, but not a fast death. Damn. Meant it to be quick.\nThe wound stains the water in the high sun, and the tiger shark veers\naway. I swim like a furious goddess is on my heels. I get to the dinghy just\nas some younger tiger sharks arrive. They’re shorter than Ceres’s hellhound,\ntheir stripes more pronounced.\nIt’s a miracle the dinghy survived—a miracle only slightly tainted by the\nfact that there’s no goddam oars. I stand up, wide-legged, see that there are\nother men swimming for the dinghy. The first is a Parian with something\nshy of six teeth. His name is Conner, and for good reason."

        "text": "other men swimming for the dinghy. The first is a Parian with something\nshy of six teeth. His name is Conner, and for good reason.\nThat damned shovel head has got his grubby paws on two oars. He don’t\nlook pleased to see that I’m in the dinghy already.\n“You look wet,” I says. I got no oars, but I’m not swimming with sharks.\nAnd sharks don’t eat oars.\n“First mate,” Conner says. “You’re captain. And we need us a crew.\nTake it or leave it. The winds and waves aren’t like to blow you to shore\nfrom here.”\nHe’s quick. Always hated that about Conner. Dangerous one, he is. Still,\nhow good of a con man can he be? He let hisself get daubbed Conner.\n“Hand me the oars then, First Mate, so I can help you up,” I says.\n“Go to hell.”\n“That was an order,” Gunner says.\n“Go to hell,” Conner says, louder, heedless of the tigers.\nI give in. I never give in.\nConner insists on holding the oars as I pull him in the dinghy—which is\ngood. It keeps his hands busy while I stick my knife through his back,\npinning him to the gunwale.\nEven as the men watching from the water curse, surprised at the sudden\nbetrayal, I pry the oars from Conner’s fingers. He’s dead already, hands\nconvulsed, locked tight. I have to use the butt of my pistol to smash his grip\nopen and drop the oars into the dinghy.\nI stand easily despite the dinghy bobbing like a cork in the waves. I hold\nmy pistol, waving it carelessly as I address the swimming, desperate men\nwho’ve just seen me murder Conner.\n“I am Gunner!” I shout, more to Ceres than to the men in the water. “I\nhave done what satraps and Prisms only dream. I am cannoneer of the\nlegendary Aved Barayah! I am sea demon slayer! Shark killer! Pirate!\nRogue! And now, I am captain. Captain Gunner is on the look for a crew,” I\nsay, finally turning to the men swimming, scared, surrounded by sharks. I\nrip my knife free of the gunwale and Conner’s body drops into the hungry\nsea. “Must be willing to take orders!”\nChapter 11\n“I hope you got your rest, little Guile,” a short, thick Blackguard woman\nnamed Samite said. She was stationed with him near the back of their\ncolumn of Blackguards. The galleass had just arrived at Big Jasper this\nmorning, and the Blackguards were the first off. “It’s going to be a long day\nfor you.”\nRest? Kip had been trying to figure out how to conceal his big secret, his\ninheritance, the last and only gift his mother had ever given him. He had a\nlarge, ornate jeweled white dagger that no one knew about, and he had a\nlarge, ornate polished dagger box. He could put the dagger in the dagger\nbox, of course, but some paranoid corner of his brain was certain that the\nfirst thing a person would ask when they saw the box was if he would open\nit.\nHow could he say no?"

        "text": "box, of course, but some paranoid corner of his brain was certain that the\nfirst thing a person would ask when they saw the box was if he would open\nit.\nHow could he say no?\nSo late into the night, he’d sat in his little bunk in the darkness, trying\nnot to wake the Blackguards sleeping in the other bunks. He’d found twine\nand he tied the dagger to his back, a process that took a good ten minutes\nwith his bandaged hand. Its point hung down to his butt, under his clothes,\nheld in place by his belt.\nIt wasn’t a great solution, but it was the best he could come up with.\nAfter his night, a long day was just what he needed now. Still, he mustered\na rueful smile for Samite. She was nice, despite her crooked, oft-broken\nnose and prominently missing front tooth. She was short and solid as a\nseawall.\nThey were some of the last to join the column, and once formed up, the\nBlackguards set off at a slow jog.\nKip thought that he wouldn’t be quite as awestruck the second time he\nsaw the Chromeria. He was wrong. He was still awed even by Big Jasper\nIsland, which was entirely covered by a city. The city was all multicolored\ndomes on top of whitewashed square buildings. Every intersection was\nadorned with a tower at the top of which hung a mirror, polished and geared\nso that the mirror could direct sunlight or even moonlight into any part of\nthe city. The Thousand Stars, they called them. The streets were laid out in\nstraight lines with mathematical precision so as to cut off as few beams of\nlight as possible.\nSeeing him studying the structures, Samite said, “There is no darkness\non Big Jasper, they like to say.” She grinned her gap-toothed grin. “Not\nliterally true, but more true here than anywhere else in the world.”\nKip nodded, saving his air for the jogging. In simply looking over at her\nfor an instant, he almost collided with a black-robed luxiat.\nThe streets were packed with thousands of people—not for market day\nor any particular holy day, Kip realized. This was normal for Big Jasper.\nAnd the people themselves came from every arc of the Seven Satrapies.\nRed-haired pale savages from deep within the Blood Forest to woolen-\ndoublet-wearing midnight Ilytians, light-skinned Ruthgari in their wide\nstraw hats to shield them from the sun, Abornean men and women virtually\nindistinguishable from each other in their layers of silks and earrings.\nBut regardless of their lineage, the people on the streets had one thing in\ncommon: their awe for the Blackguards with whom Kip was jogging.\nPeople got out of the way for them, and the Blackguards took it as their due.\nAt first, Kip tried not to look too conspicuously out of place among all\nthe hard-muscled physiques around him, but soon he was just trying to keep\nup.\n“Don’t worry,” Samite said. Infuriatingly, despite her own body being\nnearly as wide as it was tall, she wasn’t even breathing hard. “If you can’t\nkeep up, we have orders to carry you.”\nCarry me?

The mortification of the mental image was enough to keep\nKip going. Plus, if they carried him, they’d discover the dagger.\nFinally they crossed the Lily’s Stem, the transparent blue-and-yellow-\nluxin-covered bridge between Little Jasper Island and Big Jasper Island.\nIronfist gave some sort of signal that Kip didn’t see as the Blackguards\ncame into the great yard between the six outer towers of the Chromeria, and\nthe troop disappeared in half a dozen different directions. Kip leaned over\nwith his hands on his knees, trying to catch his wind. He flinched, bit back a\ncurse, and took his weight off his left hand.\n“Concealed weapons are most useful if you can draw them on short\nnotice,” Samite said.\nKip stood up abruptly. Of course. Leaning forward had pressed the\noutline of the dagger against his clothes, and because of their work, of all\npeople, Blackguards would be the best at noticing concealed weapons.\nExcellent, Kip. Outstanding. You couldn’t even hide the dagger for one\nhour.\nStill, she said nothing further.\nKip looked after the departing Blackguards. Ironfist was gone, too. “Uh,\nwhat am I supposed to do?” he asked Samite.\n“I’ll take you to your new quarters, and then to your lectures.”\nKip’s stomach dropped. A class full of people who all knew each other\nand would stare at him when he came in. He’d be dropped into the middle\nof some subject he knew nothing about, and he’d look stupid. He\nswallowed.\nI’ve seen a sea demon, faced color wights, been in battle, and killed…\nand I’m nervous about being the new boy. Kip grimaced, but it still didn’t\nmake him feel any better.\nHe followed Samite up into the central tower, up one of the\ncounterweighted lifts. “You get the layout before?” she asked.\n“The commander took me straight to the Threshing. Not really.”\n“We don’t have time today, sadly. I like watching the fresh meat gawk.”\nShe grinned, but it was friendly. “In short, each tower houses its own color\nof drafters and most of the training facilities for them, though everyone\nshares some barracks, some offices, some storerooms, some libraries. At the\nbase of each tower there are more specialized functions: under the blue\ntower are the smelters and glass furnaces, under the green are gardens and\nmenageries, under the red is the mirth hall and conservatories, under the\nyellow is the infirmary and discipline areas, under sub-red are the kitchens\nand the stockyards, under the Prism’s Tower is the great hall. Got it?”\nHe hoped she was joking. He smiled uncertainly as they stepped out into\nan empty level, not far up. She walked him down the hall and opened an\noak door to a barracks. “Find an empty bed,” she said.\nThere was no one inside, empty pallets stretching from wall to wall. At\nthe foot of each one was a chest for personal items.\n“Please tell me there isn’t some kind of pecking order for who gets what\nbed,” Kip said."

Farthest from the door.”\nKip began walking to the last bed when he realized something. He\nstopped. “I don’t really have any stuff.” He only had a cloak, the ornate\nknife box, and the knife.\nSamite cleared her throat.\n“What?”\n“You’re not going to class armed.”\nOh hell.\n“We’ll also be taking you to the tailors to get you Chromeria garb.”\nWhat was he supposed to do? Leave a priceless dagger in a barracks?\nSamite only knew that he had a knife. They’d just left a war zone, so that\nwas no surprise. But if he showed it to her, she’d surely report it. He had to\nmake it uninteresting even to her.\n“I’m going to, um, have to take off my shirt to get my knife off. Can, uh,\nyou turn your back?” Kip asked.\nShe turned her back, without even making any cracks or grinning.\nKip moved quickly to his pallet and stripped off his shirt and untied the\ndagger. He pulled the shirt back on and folded his cloak clumsily. He\nopened the chest. Inside was a thin, folded blanket. Kip set the cloak and\nthe dagger box into his chest, and put the chest at the foot of the bed.\n“Done yet?” Samite asked.\n“Um, no! Just a minute.”\nKip looked over the beds. There were maybe sixty pallets in the room.\nThe unoccupied beds—those nearest Kip—were unmade and had the chest\nunderneath them. The occupied beds were made and had the chest at the\nfoot.\nThere were no hiding places, just as there was no privacy.\nKip tucked the dagger under the mattress. He made the bed quickly,\ntrying to smooth out the wrinkles so the lump wasn’t obvious. Then he\nstarted walking back toward Samite.\n“So you know,” Samite said, “best way to get something stolen is to hide\nit under your mattress. It’s where the bullies and thieves always look first.”\nI’m terrible at this! I should have told my father about the dagger. Even\nif he took it away from me, that would have been better than having some\nsixteen-year-old butt fungus steal it. Damn it, mother, couldn’t you have\ngiven me a locket?\nKip went back to his pallet, grabbed the dagger, and looked around. He\nwalked down five rows to one of the unoccupied pallets, opened the chest\nunder that bed, and tucked the knife under the blanket. Better than nothing.\nHe slid the chest back under the bed, grimacing.\n“Fantastic,” he said. “What’s next?”\nNext was the tailors’, where Kip had to strip down for the fitting. The\ntailors were women. One of them was attractive, and as she knelt in front of\nhim standing in his underwear, he could see straight down her cleavage.

And just when\nKip was finally leaving, thanking Orholam that his body hadn’t done\nanything to mortify him, the other woman cleared her throat and handed\nhim an extra pair of clean underwear. “You can wash them once in a while,”\nshe said conspiratorially. “And your armpits, too.”\nHe almost died.\nThey made him go sponge bathe—he angrily waved off the slave who\ntried to help him—and change into his new white tunic and new white\npants, and new underwear, and a tower slave took his clothes to the\nbarracks. Then they went and registered with some official who made Kip\nsign his name on a bunch of forms, and then Samite took him to the dining\nhall where he was allowed a very small and very fast lunch, and then she\nshowed him where the toilets were on each level of the towers.\nAnd then she took him to his first class. “I can come inside or I can wait\noutside. Your choice,” she said.\n“Outside. Please, outside.” He was already embarrassed enough that he\nhad a bodyguard. He looked into the lecture hall, trying to hide his nerves,\nwhile other students streamed past him. He was hungry. What wouldn’t he\ngive for a pie right now. He asked, “Anything I should, uh, know?”\n“You’re expected not to know anything.”\nAh, then I might even exceed expectations.\nChapter 12\n“Every time you draft, you’re hastening your death,” Magister Kadah said.\nShe wasn’t yet middle-aged, but she already seemed wizened, mousy, with\nhunched shoulders, hair that hadn’t seen a brush or a pick in weeks, green\nspectacles on a gold chain around her neck, and a thin switch of green luxin\nin her hand. “Your death doesn’t matter, but depriving your satrap of an\nexpensive tool does. Your death doesn’t matter, but depriving your\ncommunity of what it needs to survive does. We who draft are slaves.\nSlaves to Orholam, to light, to the Prism, the satraps, and our cities.”\nCheery sort. Kip tried to keep his expression neutral as he sat in on his\nfirst class at the Chromeria.\n“Lies first, lessons later,” a boy said behind Kip.\n“What?” Kip asked. He looked over his shoulder. The boy was, oddly,\nwearing clear spectacles with thick black mahogany frames in front of\nthicker black brows. The lenses made one eye look bigger than the other.\nBut more intriguing than his Ruthgari looks—curly light brown hair, small\nnose, tan skin, brown eyes—were the mechanical spectacles themselves.\nTwo colored lenses, one yellow, one blue, rested on hinges, ready to be\nclicked down over the clear lenses at a moment’s notice.\nThe boy grinned, seeing Kip’s stare. “My own design,” he said.\n“It’s genius. I’ve never—”\nSomething struck Kip’s desk with a sound like a musket shot. Kip\nalmost jumped out of his skin. He looked at the green luxin switch in the\nmagister’s hand. She’d slammed it across his desk, missing his fingertips by\na thumb’s width."

She’d slammed it across his desk, missing his fingertips by\na thumb’s width.\n“Master Guile,” she said.\nShe let the words sit in the air, announcing to anyone in the class who\nhadn’t known who he was that he was indeed a Guile, and she knew it.\nNext she proves she doesn’t care.\n“Do you think you’re better than the rest of the class, Master Guile?”\nThe temptation was strong, but Kip had his orders. He was to do well in\nhis classes. Getting kicked out of them would not help him achieve that.\n“No, Magister,” he said. He thought he even made it sound sincere.\nShe wasn’t an imposing figure, neither tall nor wide, but she loomed\nover Kip’s seat. He leaned as far away as his seat allowed. “Do we\nunderstand each other, young man?” she asked.\nIt was an odd way to put it, since she hadn’t made any explicit threat,\nbut she didn’t have to. “Yes, Magister,” Kip said.\n“Discipulae, I’m sure you’ve noticed your new classmate.” The way she\nsaid it made it unclear whether or not she was referring to Kip being fat.\nThere were a few nervous titters. “His name is Kit Guile and—”\n“Kip,” Kip interjected. “Not a woody tub for toys, a tubby wooden boy.”\nHe knew it was a mistake as soon as the words were halfway out of his\nmouth.\n“Ah. Thank you. I’d forgotten that gutter Tyrean has its own definitions\nfor words. Put out your hand, Kip.”\nHe extended his hand, not quite guessing why he needed to do so until\nshe cracked the green switch across his knuckles.\nIt yanked his breath away.\n“Don’t ever interrupt a magister, Kip. Even if you are a Guile.”\nHe looked down at his knuckles, fully expecting them to be bloody.\nThey weren’t. She knew exactly how hard she could hit with that thing. At\nleast she’d hit the knuckles of his right hand. His raw left hand would have\nbeen far worse.\nMagister Kadah turned and walked back toward the front of the room,\nmuttering, “Kip. Ridiculous name. But then what can one expect an\nilliterate slattern to name her bastard?”\nIt was a trap. Kip knew it was a trap. It yawned open right in front of his\nfeet. She hates you and she has a plan, Kip. Just keep your mouth shut, Kip.\nHe raised his hand. It was the best compromise his brain could negotiate\nwith his mouth.\nShe didn’t call on him. He kept his left hand up. Wrapped in white\nbandages, it was impossible to miss. It might have looked like a flag of\nsurrender, if it weren’t so patently a rebellion.\n“As you all should remember from yesterday’s lecture, drafting is the\nprocess of turning light into a physical substance, luxin.” She saw that Kip’s\nhand was still up, and her mouth tightened momentarily, but she ignored\nhim. “Each color of light can be transformed into a different color of luxin,"

Comes from having a\nmother who was always smoking haze.”\nHer eyebrows shot up.\n“I have this condition,” Kip said. Stop it, Kip. Stop. “See, I’m not just\nfat, I’m also slow—you know, mentally—so when I get fixated on one\nthing, I’m not able to go on to the next subject until all my questions are\nanswered. Maybe I’m not advanced enough for this class. Maybe I should\nbe moved elsewhere.”\n“I do see,” she said. He knew she wasn’t going to let him go to another\nclass. He didn’t even know if there was another class. “Well, Master Guile,\nthis is a novice class, and we pride ourselves on not leaving behind even the\nslowest cattle in the herd, and obviously, you really want to say something,\ndon’t you?”\n“Yes, Magister.” He hated her. He barely knew her, and he wanted to\nbeat her ugly face in.\nShe smiled. It was a deeply unpleasant smile. Small woman, so pleased\nto be the mistress of her domain, so proud to bully a class full of children.\n“Then I’ll make you a deal, Kip: you say whatever you want, but if I find it\nimpertinent, I’ll smack your knuckles again. You see, class, this will be a\nnice object lesson. An analogue for drafting—there’s always a price, and\nyou have to decide if you are willing to pay it. So, Kip?”\n“You called my mother illiterate, and that’s about as true as me calling\nyou a decent human being.” Kip’s heart was welling up, blocking his throat.\n“My mother sold her soul to haze. She lied and cheated and stole, I think\nshe even whored herself a few times, but she wasn’t illiterate. So if you’re\ngoing to slander my mother to make me look pathetic, there’s plenty of true\nthings you can say. But that is not one of them.” You bitch.\nThe class goggled at Kip. He didn’t know if he’d just defanged a\nhundred rumors, or spawned them. Maybe both, but he’d kept a level tone,\nand he hadn’t called his magister a liar or worse. It was sort of a victory.\nSort of.\n“Are you quite finished?” the magister asked.\nAnd now the price of the victory. “Yes,” Kip said.\nHe put his hand on the desk for her to smack—his left hand, wrapped in\nbandages.\nStupid, Kip.

Kip was the only\nTyrean, though he looked more mutt than anything: hair kinky like a Parian,\nbut without the lean, fluid build; eyes blue like an Atashian, but skin darker\nthan their olive complexions, nose not prominent. He even had a few\nfreckles visible through his skin like he was part Blood Forester.\n“They’ll hate you for me,” his father had told him. Then that lopsided,\nwinsome Guile grin had struck. “But don’t worry, eventually they’ll hate\nyou for you, too.”\nIt was his first day, so Kip was guessing he was being hated for Gavin\nGuile this time.\nSamite was gone when he got out into the hall. Kip supposed the\nBlackguards worked on shifts. She’d probably thought he could get through\none lecture without getting in trouble.\nOops.\nGo ahead, he thought as he sat on the floor in the Chromeria’s hall, feel\nsorry for yourself. You’ve been acknowledged as a bastard of the most\npowerful man in the world. He saved your life many times, and he gave you\nthe choice. You could have entered the Chromeria anonymously. You chose\nthis.\nKip had thought he’d have at least one friend here, though. Liv had been\nhere—until Garriston. She’d been nice to him, though she saw him as a\nlittle brother. But now she was gone, fighting for the Color Prince, choosing\nto believe comforting lies. Kip hated her for that, despised her for seeking\nthe easy way out—but most of all he missed her.\nHe sat close to the door, trying to overhear Magister Kadah’s lecture,\ntrying to think about magic so he didn’t think about anything else. The\nmagister was saying something about the properties of green luxin? He\nthought about trying to draft some right here in the hall. It would be a bad\nidea, though. Green made you wild, made you disregard authority. Now\nwould be a bad time for that. He smiled, though, thinking about it.\n“Are you Kip?” a voice intruded, breaking Kip out of his fantasy. The\nspeaker was a tiny, clean-shaven, very dark Parian man in a starched\nheadscarf and a slave’s robe of fine cotton.\n“Uh, yes.” Kip stood and the ball of dread that dropped into his stomach\ntold him who’d sent the slave.\nThe man eyed him for long moments, clearly judging him, but not"

Andross Guile’s head slave and right\nhand was named Grinwoody, Gavin had told Kip. Grinwoody said,\n“Luxlord Guile requires your presence.”\nLuxlord Guile, as in Andross Guile, one of the richest men in the world,\nwith estates throughout Ruthgar, Blood Forest, and Paria. On the ruling\ncouncil known as the Spectrum, he was the Red. Father of two Prisms,\nGavin and the rebel who’d almost destroyed the world, Dazen. Andross\nGuile was, Kip thought, the only man in the world Gavin Guile feared.\nGrandfather.\nAnd Kip was a bastard, a blot on the family honor. Felia Guile, Kip’s\ngrandmother and the only person who could massage Andross Guile’s\ntyranny, was now dead.\nBut before Kip ran face first into that wall, he had another problem. He\ncouldn’t leave the hall without giving Magister Kadah fresh reasons to hate\nhim, and he couldn’t show Andross Guile disrespect by making him wait.\n“Uh, will you tell my magister that I’ve been summoned?” Kip asked.\nGrinwoody looked at him, expressionless.\nKip felt foolish. Like he couldn’t take one step, poke his head in the\ndoor himself, and say, “I’ve been summoned.” He opened his mouth to\nexplain himself, remembered Gavin’s orders: Remember who you are.\nHe was going to apologize, or say please, but he stopped himself.\nAfter another moment of weighing Kip, Grinwoody acquiesced. He\nrapped on the door and stepped into the classroom. “Luxlord Guile requires\nKip’s presence.”\nHe didn’t give Magister Kadah a chance to respond, though Kip would\nhave given his left eye to see the expression on her face. Grinwoody was a\nslave, but a slave authorized to do his duty by one of the most powerful\nmen in the world. Nothing the magister said mattered. Grinwoody was a\nman who remembered who he was.\nThe real question was, who was Kip? Grinwoody had referred to him\nonly by his first name. It hadn’t been, ‘Luxlord Guile requires his\ngrandson.’\nWhat had Gavin said? ‘We’ll count it a victory if you avoid wetting\nyourself’?\nKip cleared his throat. “Uh, you mind if we stop by the privies on the\nway?”\nChapter 13\nGavin smiled as he stepped off the skimmer onto Seers Island. Karris had\nher ataghan drawn, and was pointing her pistol at the nearest man.\nThe people stood in an unruly mob, but they were armed with swords\nand muskets, makeshift spears. There were few commonalities between\nthem: they had come from all seven satrapies, light-skinned and dark, dirty\nand clean, dressed in silk and wool. Several had an extra eye drawn on their\nforehead with coal. Though even among those, some had exquisitely drawn,\nothers rough, lopsided."

        "text": "and clean, dressed in silk and wool. Several had an extra eye drawn on their\nforehead with coal. Though even among those, some had exquisitely drawn,\nothers rough, lopsided.\nWhat these men and women had in common was only this: each one had\nthe religious devotion to cross reefs in a small outrigger canoe to get here,\nand every one of them was a drafter.\nA woman stepped through the crowd. She was little, barely taller than\nGavin’s waist, arms and legs short, her trunk the size a woman of average\nheight would have. She had a flaring eye tattooed exquisitely on her\nforehead.\n“You will not draft here,” she said.\n“I’ll decide that,” Gavin said.\nInstead of looking irritated, she smiled. “It is as foretold.”\nSeers. Excellent. “Someone foretold that I’d say that?” Gavin asked.\n“No, that you’d be an asshole.”\nGavin laughed. “I think I’m going to like this place.”\n“You’ll come with us,” she said.\n“Sure,” Gavin said.\n“It wasn’t a request.”\n“Yes it was,” Gavin said. “When you don’t have power to compel\nobedience, by definition you’re making a request. What’s your name?”\n“Caelia. When I tire, you’ll carry me,” she said, unimpressed.\n“Happy to.”\nThe sound of a cocking hammer interrupted them. Karris pointed her\npistol straight at Caelia’s third-eye tattoo. There was a rattle as the other\nmen pointed their muskets at Karris, cocked them.\n“Try anything,” Karris said, “and I’ll hollow out your skull.”\n“The White Blackguard. We were told you’d be forceful.”\nKarris uncocked her pistol and tucked it away, sheathed her sword.\n“I’ve changed my mind,” Gavin said. “Who are you taking me to see,\nand how far away is she?” The “she” was a guess. He knew little about the\nSeers’ religious belief, indeed, he thought there was no unified belief here,\nbut when faced with biological facts, cultures had to make their own\ninterpretations. Female drafters tended to draft more successfully because\nmore of them could see colors more accurately, and they tended to live\nlonger than male drafters. Those cultures that had decided this meant\nOrholam favored women didn’t like it being assumed that they would be led\nby a man.\n“The Third Eye resides at the base of Mount Inura.”\nGavin pointed to the tallest mountain. It was green, not so tall that it had\na tree line, but still quite a walk. “What is that, a five-hour walk from here?”\n“Six.”\n“Don’t suppose you have horses?” Gavin asked.\n“We have some few horses, but one walks when one goes to see the\nThird Eye. It is a pilgrimage. It gives one time to reflect and prepare the\nsoul for the meeting.”\n“Uh-huh. Well, when the Third Eye comes to see me, she can ride. I\nwant her to be in the right frame of mind.”\nCaelia appeared to be chewing on the insides of her cheeks. “So it was\nforetold.”\n“She foretold I wouldn’t come?” Gavin asked.\n“No, still the asshole part.” Her men chuckled."

I’ve work to do. I’ll be here, doing\nit.”\nCaelia looked around at the two hundred armed men who surrounded\nGavin and Karris. “I could insist, you know. These men are not just armed,\nthey are drafters, too.”\n“I’m the Prism,” Gavin said, like she just wasn’t getting it. “Do you\nthink two hundred men can keep me from doing what I Will?”\nCaelia hesitated. “I think you seek out conflict needlessly.”\n“Hear, hear,” Karris said under her breath.\nSometimes Gavin thought the world was full of morons. Power could be\na knife, but often it had to be a bludgeon. A man like Commander Ironfist\ncould speak gently, because simply by standing he overawed other men\nwith his physical presence. Gavin had to draw lines and enforce them,\nbecause he didn’t trust others to do it for him. He had to do it because if\nothers were allowed to start basing their decisions on the assumption that he\nwas weak, it would take blunt force to get them to change their minds.\nDeterrence is cheaper than correction.\nBut what he’d said about Will wasn’t thrown in heedlessly. Drafters\nalways imposed their will on the world. The most powerful drafters always\nincluded more than their share of madmen, bastards, divas, and assholes.\nAnd because everything depended on them, they were tolerated. Gavin\nmost of all.\nBut the more power you have, the harder it is to recognize what’s\nbeyond your power.\nAnd there was a pleasure in seeing others do what you want. Gavin felt\nit now as Caelia gave orders, rounding up her men and leaving. He could\ntell himself that it was important to establish the power dynamic because of\nwhat he had to do, and to prepare the Seers for the bitter pill that they were\ngoing to have to swallow. That was true, but he had to watch himself, too.\nBefore they were even gone, Gavin headed back down the beach. He’d\nleft the skimmer sealed.\n“We have one week,” he told Karris. “This bay is too wide, so we’ll\nneed to build seawalls off that point and from there to there. I’m going to\nhave to clear out the reefs. I’m thinking of clearing them in a zigzag pattern\nso that if an invading navy comes here, they’ll be destroyed, but we’ll have\nmarked the safe way so that the locals can direct traffic. Buoys that can be\nmoved? I also haven’t decided how wide the safe path should be. If it’s too\nnarrow, you keep supplies from getting into the city and it simply becomes\ntoo expensive for many people to live here, but too open and the reefs no\nlonger serve as a deterrent. So your thoughts are more than welcome. Other\nthan that, I’ll need your help prioritizing what things I need to build to give\nmy people a running start. Do we clear the jungle—and if so, how? Do we\nneed to build a wall against the native animals, against the native people?"

Do we\nneed to build a wall against the native animals, against the native people?\nShould we try to build any houses, or would that be too much work?”\nKarris was just looking at him. “You know, every time I think I know\nyou… You’re really doing this, aren’t you? You’re founding a city. Not just\na village. You’re planning for it to be a major center.”\n“Not during my life.” Gavin smiled.\n“You know, if you keep changing everything you touch, nothing’s going\nto be the same five years from now.”\nFive years. It was supposed to be the remainder of his term as Prism.\nBut he was already dying, and pretty soon Karris would notice. “No,” he\nsaid, “I hope it’s not.”\nFive years, and five great purposes left. Except now he only had one\nyear.\nChapter 14\nThe only thing this place needs to make it creepier is cobwebs blowing in\nthe wind. Kip stared into the pitch black of Lord Andross Guile’s room with\nsomething less than glee.\n“You’re letting in light,” Grinwoody said. “Are you trying to kill my\nlord?”\n“No, no, I’m—” I’m always apologizing. “I’m coming in.” He stepped\nforward, through several layers of heavy tapestries that blocked light from\nthe room.\nThe air inside the room was stale, still, hot. It reeked of old man. And it\nwas impossibly dark. Kip began sweating instantly.\n“Come here,” a raspy voice said. It was low, gravelly, like Lord Guile\nhadn’t spoken all day.\nKip moved forward with little steps, sure he’d trip and disgrace himself.\nIt was like a dragon’s den.\nSomething touched his face. He flinched. Not a cobweb, a feathery light\ntouch. Kip stopped. He had somehow expected Andross Guile to be an\ninvalid, seated in a wheeled chair perhaps, like a dark mirror of the White.\nBut this man was standing.\nThe hand was firm, though with few calluses. It traced Kip’s chubby\nface, felt the texture of his hair, the curve of his nose, pressed his lips, went\nagainst the grain of Kip’s incipient beard. Kip winced, terribly aware of the\npimples he had where his beard was coming in.\n“So you’re the bastard,” Andross Guile said.\n“Yes, my lord.”\nOut of nowhere, something nearly tore Kip’s head off. He crashed into\nthe wall so hard he would have broken something if it hadn’t been covered\nin layers of tapestries, too. He fell to the carpeted floor, his cheek burning,\nears ringing.\n“That was for existing. Never shame this family again.”\nKip stood unsteadily, too surprised to even be angry. He didn’t know\nwhat he had been expecting, but a blow out of the darkness hadn’t been it.\n“My apologies for being born, my lord.”\n“You have no idea.”\nThere was silence. The darkness was oppressive. Whatever you do,\nGavin had said, don’t make him an enemy. Could it get any hotter in here?\n“Get out,” Andross Guile said finally. “Get out now.”"

Could it get any hotter in here?\n“Get out,” Andross Guile said finally. “Get out now.”\nKip left, having the distinct feeling that he’d failed.\nChapter 15\nThe Color Prince was rubbing his temples. Liv Danavis couldn’t take her\neyes off of him. No one could. The man was practically carved of pure\nluxin. Blue plates covered his forearms, made spiky gauntlets for his fists.\nWoven blue luxin made up much of his skin, with yellow flowing in rivers\nbeneath the surface, constantly replenishing the rest. Flexible green luxin\nmade up his joints. Only his face was human, and barely at that. His skin\nwas knotted with burn scars, and his eyes—halos so broken as to be absent\n—were a swirl of every color, not just his irises, but the whites as well.\nRight now, those sclera swirled blue, then yellow as he sat on the great\nchair in the audience chamber of the Travertine Palace, deciding how to\nsplit up the city he’d just conquered—and found nearly empty.\n“I want the twelve lords of the air to oversee redistribution of the city.\nLord Shayam will preside. First, the plunder. Those who fled Garriston took\nalmost nothing with them—it’s all here. Some of it will travel with the\narmy, but the rest shouldn’t be left to rot. Sell what can be sold, and\ndistribute the rest in the most equitable way possible among the remaining\nGarristonians. The twelve lords are to decide who among the new settlers\nwill be given leases to which properties. The richer areas and homes will\nrequire a fee up front; the poorer will be allowed six months before they\nbegin paying.\n“Lady Selene,” he said, turning to a blue/green bichrome who hadn’t yet\nbroken the halo. She was Tyrean, with wavy dark hair and a dusky\ncomplexion, striking but odd, eyes too far apart, small mouth. She curtsied.\n“You’re in charge of all the greens until we leave the city. Six weeks. In that\ntime, I expect you to dredge the key irrigation canals and repair the locks on\nthe river. I want this city to flower next spring. The first rains of autumn\nmay come any day. Consult with Lord Shayam. New plants will need to be\nbrought in, perhaps soil as well. Do what you can with the labor provided in\nthe time we have.”\nLady Selene curtsied deeply and left immediately.\nAnd on it went, all morning. Liv sat among five advisers to the Color\nPrince’s left. Other than those advisers, no one else was allowed into the\ngreat hall. The prince wanted few people to see the entirety of his plans.\nWhy Liv was one of the privileged few, she had no idea. She was the\ndaughter of General Corvan Danavis, and the Color Prince had made no\nsecret of the fact that he hoped he could recruit Gavin’s old enemy to his\nside, but Liv thought it was more than that. She’d switched sides before the\nBattle of Garriston, even fighting for the army trying to reclaim the city—\nbut she’d done it in return for the Color Prince saving her friends. She\ndidn’t deserve this kind of trust.\nBut she did find the whole thing fascinating. Often, the prince would call"

Often, the prince would call\nforth a courtier to give him more information on some point. He cared\nnothing for previous laws, and little for how things had been done\ntraditionally, but he showed a keen interest in commerce and trade and\ntaxation and agriculture: all the things needed to provide for his people and\nhis army.\nSummoning his military commanders, he elevated one of his most\ntalented young commanders to general, and then tasked him with securing\nTyrea’s roads and rivers. He wanted trade to be able to flow unfettered up\nand down the whole of the Umber River, and bandits to be stamped out\nmercilessly.\nIn some ways, Liv knew, it was merely trading many bandits for one.\nThe prince’s men would doubtless collect taxes just as the bandits charged\npassage fees. But if they did it fairly, and didn’t murder the farmers and\ntraders for their goods, the country would still be better off, whatever you\ncalled it.\nHe set more greens and yellows to clear the river itself, under their own\ncommand. If the prince was a bad man, he was a bad man taking a long\nview, because even though Liv didn’t understand everything that he was\nordering, it was clear to her that he was sacrificing a huge number of his\ndrafters and fighting men for the benefit of Tyrea. In the long run, her\ncynical superviolet nature told her, that would benefit him. An army on the\nmarch doesn’t make its own food, and can’t always count on plunder to pay\nits men, so having a strong economic base would magnify his power later.\n“Lord Arias,” the Color Prince said, “I want you to select a hundred of\nyour priests, young enough to be zealous, old enough to have absorbed the\nbasics, and send them out to every satrapy to spread the good news of the\ncoming freedom. Concentrate on the cities. Send natives where possible.\nLet them know what kind of opposition they’ll face. Expect martyrs in\nDazen’s cause, and begin preparing another wave of zealots. I want regular\nreports, and send handlers with them. We’ll contract the Order of the\nBroken Eye where persecution is too great, yes?”\nLord Arias bowed. He was Atashian, with his people’s typical bright\nblue eyes, olive skin, and a plaited, beaded beard. “My prince, how would\nyou like us to proceed on Big Jasper and in the Chromeria itself?”\n“The Chromeria you leave alone. Others will handle that. Big Jasper\nshould be handled with utmost care. I want our people there to be more eyes\nand ears than mouths, you understand? Your best people only on Big Jasper.\nI want them to grumble in the taverns and the markets, or join those who\nare already grumbling, barely whispering that our cause might have some\nmerit. Identify those with grievances whom we might recruit, but take\ngreatest care. They’re not fools there. Expect the Chromeria to try to plant\nspies.”\n“Will you authorize the Order there?” Lord Arias asked.\n“The Order’s best people are already there or on their way there,” the"

If our operations are exposed too early, the whole enterprise is\ndoomed. The fate of the revolution lies in your hands.”\nLord Arias stroked his beard, making the yellow beads click. “I believe I\nshould base my own operations from Big Jasper, then.”\n“Agreed.”\n“And I’ll need financing.”\n“Which, quite predictably, is where we run into problems. I can give you\nten thousand danars. I know it’s a fraction of what you’ll need, but I have\npeople who need to be fed. Be creative.”\n“Fifteen thousand?” Lord Arias countered. “Simply buying a house on\nBig Jasper…”\n“Make do. I’ll send more in three months if I can.”\nMost of the rest of the day was more mundane: orders for how the army\nwas to camp and where, money requests for food and new clothing and new\nshoes and new horses and new oxen, and money owed to smiths and miners\nand foreign lords and bankers who wanted their loans repaid. Others came\nasking to be authorized to press the locals and the camp followers into\nservice clearing roads, putting out fires, and rebuilding bridges.\nAlone out of the advisers, Liv was never asked to consult on anything.\nThe bursar was consulted most often. She wore gigantic corrective lenses\nand carried a small abacus that she was constantly worrying. Or at least Liv\nthought she was merely nervously fidgeting with the abacus. After a while,\nas the woman gave a report about a dozen different ways the prince could\nstructure his debts so as to maximize his own take, Liv realized the little\nwoman was doing figures ceaselessly.\nFinally, the prince asked one of the advisers to tell him what other\nbusiness was waiting, and deemed that it could all keep until tomorrow. He\ndismissed the rest of his advisers and beckoned Liv to join him.\nTogether they walked upstairs and out onto the great balcony from his\nroom.\n“So, Aliviana Danavis, what did you see today?”\n“My lord?” She shrugged. “I saw that governing is a lot more\ncomplicated than I ever would have imagined.”\n“I did more for Garriston today—and more for Tyrea—than the\nChromeria has done in sixteen years. Not that everyone will thank me for it.\nForced labor to clean up the city won’t be popular, but it’s better than letting\nthe goods rot or be taken away by looters and gangs.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nHe took out a thin zigarro of tobacco rolled inside a ratweed skin from a\npocket in his cloak. He touched it to a finger full of sub-red to light it and\ninhaled deeply.\nShe looked at him curiously.\n“My transition from flesh to luxin wasn’t perfect,” he said. “I’ve done\nbetter than anyone in centuries, but I still made mistakes. Painful mistakes.\nOf course, starting from a charred husk didn’t make things any easier.”\n“What happened to you?” Liv asked.\n“Some other time perhaps. I want you to think about the future,"

I want you to think about the future,\nAliviana. I want you to dream.” He looked out over the bay. It was clotted\nwith garbage, the docks littered. He sighed. “This is the city we’ve taken.\nThe jewel of the desert that the Chromeria did its best to destroy.”\n“My father was trying to protect it,” Liv said.\n“Your father’s a great man, and I have no doubt that’s exactly what he\nthought he was doing. But your father believed the Chromeria’s lies.”\n“I think he was blackmailed,” Liv said, feeling hollow. The Prism she’d\nso admired had used Liv to blackmail her father into helping him. She didn’t\neven know how, but it was the only thing she could imagine had brought\nher father to fight for his sworn enemy.\n“I hope that’s true.”\n“What?” Liv asked.\n“Because if so, it isn’t too late for him, and I’d love to have your father\nstand at our side. He’s a dangerous man. A good man. Brilliant. We’ll find\nout. But I’m afraid, Liv, that he’s been listening to their lies for so long that\nhis whole system of understanding has been corrupted. He might see a few\nweeds on the surface and reject those, but if the soil itself is fouled, how can\nhe see the truth? This is why the young are our hope.”\nThe sun was going down, and a fresh breeze had kicked up off the\nCerulean Sea. The Color Prince took a deep drag on his zigarro and seemed\nto relish the redder light.\n“Liv, I want you to think of a world without the Chromeria. A world\nwhere a woman can worship whichever god she sees fit. Where being a\ndrafter isn’t a death sentence with a ten-year wait. A world in which an\naccident of birth doesn’t put fools on thrones, but where a man’s abilities\nand drive are all that determines his success. No lords but those whose\nnature establishes them. No slaves—at all. Slavery is the curse of the\nChromeria. In our new world, a woman won’t be despised because she\ncame from Tyrea—no, nor will it be a badge of honor. I’m not fighting to\nmake Tyrea supreme. In our new world, it simply won’t matter. Your hair,\nyour eyes, whatever it is that sets you apart will merely make you\ninteresting. We will be a light to the world. We will open the Everdark\nGates that Lucidonius closed and cut passes through the Sharazan\nMountains. We will welcome all.\n“In every village and every town, magic will be taught, and we’ll find\nthat many, many more people have talents that can be used to better their\nlives and the lives of those around them. It won’t be in the corrupt hands of\ngovernors and satraps. As we learn, I think we’ll find that everyone,\neveryone, has been kissed by light. Someday everyone will draft.

They’re Parian, and the deya doesn’t like\ntheir family. They’re Ilytian, and they’re mired in superstition about magic\nbeing evil. Think of the fields that lie fallow. Think of children starving for\nthe bread that they don’t have because they don’t have green drafters to\nfertilize the crops. The Chromeria has their blood on its hands—and none of\nthem even realize it! It’s a quiet death, a slow poison. The Chromeria has\ndrained the life from the satrapies one drop of blood at a time. That’s our\nfight, Aliviana. For a different future. And it won’t be easy. Too many\npeople gain too much from the current corruption for them to give it up\neasily. And they’ll send the people to die for them. And it breaks my heart.\nThey’ll sacrifice the very people we want to set free. But we’ll stop them.\nWe’ll make sure they can’t do it again, that generations yet unborn receive a\nbetter world than the one we have.”\nShe hesitated. “Everything you’re saying sounds good, but the proof’s in\nthe eating, isn’t it?” Liv said.\nHe smiled broadly. “Yes! This is what I want from you, Liv. Draft. Right\nnow. Superviolet. And think. And tell me what you’re thinking. You won’t\nbe punished. Regardless.”\nShe did, soaking up that alien, invisible light and letting it course\nthrough her, feeling it peel her away from her emotions to a\nhyperrationality, an almost disembodied intelligence. “You’re a practical\nman,” she said, her voice flat. Intonation seemed an unnecessary frill when\nyou were in the grip of superviolet. “Perhaps a romantic, too. An odd\ncombination. But you’ve been accomplishing tasks all day, and I wonder if\nI’m not merely the last on the list. I can’t tell if this is the prelude to a\nseduction or if you simply like the admiration of women.” Part of her was\nappalled at what she’d said—the presumption! But instead of yielding to\nher blushes, she huddled deeper in the superviolet’s dispassion.\nArchly, the prince said, “Rare is the man who won’t swoon over women\nswooning over him.”\n“So I’m trivially correct on the latter.” He enjoyed her attention, her\ngrowing awe, but he had barely touched her, even when he had excuses to\ndo so. He didn’t lean toward her as they spoke. He was engaged\nintellectually but not bodily. “But this is no seduction.”\nHe didn’t look entirely pleased. “Alas, the fire that took so much else\nhas denied me the simpler pleasures of the flesh. Not that I despise such.\nBut no cavorting like a green for me.” Between the immobilization caused\nby the burn scars on his face and the immobilization of the luxins he was\nweaving into his skin, it was difficult to read any but the most overt\nexpressions on his face, but she reminded herself that this didn’t mean he\ndidn’t feel readily or deeply.

His eyes swirled freely with colors, but Liv\nthought they, too, were only good indicators of his emotions when he felt\nsomething strongly. It made him something of a cipher.\nSuperviolet loved ciphers. Cracking ciphers.\n“Do you know who I was?” the Color Prince asked.\n“No.”\n“And I’m not going to tell you. Do you know why?”\n“Because you don’t want me to know?” she hazarded.\n“No. Because superviolets love digging up secrets. And if I don’t set you\nto work digging up something that doesn’t matter to me, you might be smart\nenough to dig up something I don’t want known.”\n“Diabolical,” she said appreciatively.\nLuxin shot out of him, slamming into her chest. She staggered, lost her\ngrip on superviolet, and found something tight around her neck.\nKicking, Liv realized she’d been lifted off her feet. No, not just off her\nfeet. She was suspended, off the edge of the balcony, held by a fist of luxin\naround her entire head. She grabbed at the fist, trying to pull herself up,\ntrying to breathe, trying to loosen its grip—panicking, not even realizing\nthat loosening its grip was the last thing she ought to want. If she fell from\nthis height, she’d die. Her head felt hot, all the veins bulging, her eyes\nfeeling like they’d explode.\nThe Color Prince’s eyes were stark red, glowing like coals. He blinked.\nYellow flooded to the fore, and she felt herself swung back onto the\nbalcony, released.\nShe fell, coughing.\n“I… The Chromeria has demonized what we do,” the prince rasped.\n“Literally. They have made us into actual devils, and I won’t tolerate those\nwho call good evil and evil good. I… reacted badly.”\nLiv was shaking, and embarrassed of it. She thought she was going to\ncry, and was furious with herself for it. She was a Danavis. She was brave\nand strong and she would not break down like a little girl. She was a\nwoman, seventeen years old. Old enough to have children of her own. She\nwould not break down.\nShe stood and curtsied, wobbling only a little. “My apologies, my lord. I\ndidn’t mean to offend.”\nHe looked out over the bay, putting his hands on the rail. He’d lost his\nzigarro. He lit another. “You needn’t be embarrassed of the trembling. It’s\nthe body’s reaction. I’ve seen the most fearless veterans do the same. Your\nembarrassment of it makes it look like weakness. Ignore it. It passes.”\nPainting a placid expression on her face as if it were the stark lines of\nkohl, Liv drafted superviolet. It helped. She folded her arms, as if against\nthe evening chill but really to bury their shaking. “So, my lord?”\nHe cocked his head. “So?”\n“So you have a plan for me.”\n“Of course I do.”\n“And you’re not going to tell me what it is.”\n“Such a smart girl. I’m going to assign you a tutor to answer almost\nevery one of your questions.”"

Now go. I have grimmer tasks to\naccomplish before the light dies.”\nChapter 16\nIronfist was standing outside Andross Guile’s chambers when Kip came out.\nAs ever, he was huge and intimidating, but Kip was getting to know the\ncommander of the Blackguard, and the look on Ironfist’s face was more\ncurious than anything else.\n“I’ve seen satraps come out of that room looking worse,” Ironfist said.\n“Really?” Kip asked. He felt destroyed.\n“No. I was trying to cheer you up.” Ironfist started down the hall, and\nKip fell in step beside him. “Kip, I’m inviting you to train for the\nBlackguard.”\nOh, right. Because my father demanded it. Not on my own merits.\nKip thought he’d only thought those words, but by the time he said\n“merits,” he realized he’d stepped in a big pile of his tongue once again.\nIronfist stopped cold. Turned to Kip, glowering, threatening. “You were\neavesdropping?” Ironfist asked.\nKip swallowed. Nodded. I didn’t mean to!\nBut this time the words didn’t weasel their way past his lips. Excuses\ndried up in the blast furnace of Ironfist’s disapproval.\n“Then you know I have to induct you at the end. It’s up to you how\nmuch of an embarrassment you want to make that for both of us.”\nIt was like someone had put a great chain around Kip’s chest, dropped\nhim in the sea, and told him to swim home. Ironfist headed off once again,\nand didn’t pause or slow as they left the Prism’s Tower and crossed the\ngreat yard between the seven great towers of the Chromeria to a broad\nstaircase that disappeared into the ground.\nAs they descended, Kip got a notion of just how massive the Chromeria\nwas. It wasn’t merely the huge towers, the spindles that connected them in\nmidair, and the great yard covered with thousands of people going about all\nthe business of the Seven Satrapies. All of it extended below the ground as\nwell, into a huge chamber. The ceiling was fully twenty paces above the\nfloor. Each of the seven towers had its roots down here, and yet more\nentrances. Buildings and storehouses, barracks, inns, and even a few homes\ncrowded the chamber, reaching in many places from floor to ceiling. Some\nwere constructed of stone, others of luxin. Vibrant colors rioted everywhere,\nand though the whole area was underground, it was neither dark nor musty.\nCrystals scintillated in every color like torches, taking sunlight from above\nand splashing it liberally through the chamber. Great fans set in the ceiling\nat either side sucked in and blew out air, sending a constant slight breeze\nover the whole area. There was a great hall in the center, and exercise yards\noff to one side."

There was a great hall in the center, and exercise yards\noff to one side.\n“Beginning of each new class, there’s a lottery. Some numbers are\nrandom, but legacies and those who finished just below the cut of the\nprevious training class get to challenge in last. Big advantage. You fight for\nyour spot, but you only have to fight three times. So if you choose spot ten,\nyou might have to fight ten, eleven, and twelve. It’s only a starting point,\nthough; it’s easy to move up in the coming weeks, and easier to move\ndown. I can do this much for your father: you get to choose last. Don’t\nchoose too high or you’ll pay for it in blood, but don’t go too low. We cut\nthe bottom seven each month.”\nIronfist moved purposefully, unfazed by the subterranean splendor. Kip\nfollowed, tense. He was squeezing his burned hand. He consciously\nstraightened it, grimaced against the pain. Soon he found himself standing\nwith Ironfist in front of forty-nine young men and women. They were all\ndressed in loose tan shirts and pants. Everyone wore at least one armband\nwith the color he drafted on his right or left arm. Though Kip knew that\nwomen outnumbered men in the Chromeria substantially, this class of\npotential Blackguards had only ten women.\nEveryone was older than Kip, but still young. Kip would guess most\nwere sixteen to eighteen years old. They each had a symbol affixed to their\nleft breast in an old Parian script that Kip could mostly guess at. Numbers,\nhe thought. It looked like they were lined up according to that number,\nseven lines of seven.\nAmong all the new things to look at, the thing that stuck out to Kip was\nthe look in his new classmates’ eyes. They barely even noticed him; they\nwere too busy watching Ironfist like he was a god. The class’s teacher\nhardly looked less impressed than the rest of them. He was a muscle-bound,\nshort man, shaved bald and wearing a sleeveless black uniform that showed\noff massive biceps.\nIronfist gestured and the class melted, re-forming into a large circle in\nmoments. It wasn’t flawless, as a few jostled to move from one place to\nanother, but it was pretty impressive for what Kip knew had to be a fairly\nnew class.\n“Kip.” Ironfist gestured that Kip was to step into the circle.\nOh no.\nKip stepped in.\n“This is Kip Guile. He’s joining the class. As you know, that means one\nof you scrubs will be leaving. The Blackguard is elite. We’ve no room for\ndeadwood. So, Kip, choose. Fights are five minutes or until one combatant\ncries mercy or is knocked out. As at all testings, inflicting permanent\ndamage on your opponent will result in your expulsion from this class.”\nKip knew he was going to lose. He barely understood the rules. The only\nfighting he’d done in his life had mostly been confined to flailing against\nRamir, back in their village. And losing, always losing. His greatest skill\nwas taking punishment."

His greatest skill\nwas taking punishment.\n“Do you have any questions, or are you ready to choose your place?”\nIronfist asked.\n“So if you lose, do you swap places with the person who beat you, or do\nyou just move down one spot?”\n“It’s not an arithmetic problem, Kip.”\nBut that was precisely what it was.\nIronfist grimaced. “You move down one,” he said.\nKip put on a misty look and gazed into the distance. “I see pain in my\nfuture.” He jauntily pointed his forefingers like pistols at the tall, slim\nyoung Parian who bore a number one on his chest. No one laughed. Maybe\nthey’d laugh when Kip got his ass beat.\nThe young man stepped into the circle looking concerned—for Kip.\n“Match rules, Commander?” he asked.\n“No spectacles,” Ironfist said.\nKip and Number One handed over their spectacles. The young man was\na green/blue bichrome.\nIronfist cleared his throat. “I mean that both ways, Cruxer.”\nCruxer? His name was Cruxer?\n“Of course, sir,” Cruxer said. “Sir, his bandaged hand? Can I block it?”\n“Don’t target it. But if it gets hurt, it gets hurt.”\nThe taller youth nodded quickly and moved opposite of Kip. Kip saw\nflashes of incredulity on the other students’ faces as they looked at him. He\nsupposed he didn’t cut much of a figure. No one believed he could win.\nHell, he didn’t believe he could win. Lose with dignity, Kip. Lose in a way\nthat will make them respect you for being plucky.\nPlucky? I’m a moron.\nCruxer looked up and made the triangle: thumb to right eye, middle\nfinger to left eye, forefinger to forehead. Then he touched the three to his\nmouth, heart, and hands. The three and the four, perfect seven. A religious\nyoung man. Hopefully he’d remember the virtue of mercy.\nCruxer turned and saluted Kip, fists touching over his heart and bowing\nslightly. Kip returned the salute.\n“Begin,” Ironfist said.\nThe tall youth moved—fast. He was on top of Kip before Kip could\nreact. He shot into Kip and locked a leg behind Kip’s, blocking Kip’s punch\nand throwing his hips into Kip’s. Kip went down hard, grabbing to try to\npull Cruxer with him.\nThe slender boy let himself fall. His long limbs wrapped around Kip.\nKip threw an elbow, but Cruxer was so close, he barely got any force into it.\nThen, somehow, the young man had control of Kip’s arm and rolled him\nover. Cruxer’s legs scissored around Kip’s head. Tightened and—darkness.\nKip had no idea how long he was out. He blinked rapidly. Not long, he\nthought. Everyone was still standing around.\n“That’s one loss,” Ironfist said. “You’ve got ten seconds until your next\nbout.”"

A number of classmates were slapping Cruxer\non the back, congratulating him on his effortless victory. Kip couldn’t\nsummon any ill feeling for the boy. He’d destroyed Kip without malice and\nwithout causing any unnecessary pain.\nThe second boy was stocky, blue-eyed like Kip, maybe only half Parian,\nbecause his skin wasn’t much darker than Kip’s. He bowed to Kip. Kip\nreturned the bow, wondering what fresh pain was coming his way.\nKip and Number Two circled each other warily, but the boy kept looking\nup and away from Kip. At first, Kip didn’t know why. Then he saw the\nboy’s eyes. There were little wisps of blue appearing and disappearing in\nthe whites of his eyes. Down, into his body. Gathering in his fists. If the boy\nhadn’t been lighter-skinned, Kip wouldn’t have been able to see it. It was\none of the disadvantages the lighter-skinned had. It was why, nominally, the\nBlackguard were black.\nBut because they weren’t wearing spectacles, the boy could only draft\ntiny sips of blue light at a time. He had to take his eyes off of Kip, look at\none of the blue crystals overhead, take what he could, and look back to Kip.\nWithout blue spectacles, it made for a slow process.\nAnd Kip circling slowly was giving the boy all the time he needed.\n“Ah hell,” Kip said. He charged.\nKip threw a punch. It was blocked. The second punch hit the boy’s\nshoulder—but Kip had thrown the punch with his left hand. He felt cuts rip\nopen. It was like he’d dipped his palm in fire.\nA fist caught him in the stomach, and another grazed his arm as he\nhunched forward. Kip staggered back, his motion taking most of the force\nout of a punch that caught his nose.\nIt still made his eyes water, though. He blinked and lurched, surprised\nthe boy had let him go rather than press his advantage.\nThen Kip realized the reason why the boy would do such a thing.\nA blue staff was forming in the boy’s hands, slowly stretching out like\nmolten glass.\nKip darted in and grabbed at the unfinished staff. He caught it, and as his\nfingertips sank into the crystallizing structure, he felt suddenly as connected\nto it as if he’d drafted it himself.\nHe could feel the other boy through the open luxin, his will, so focused a\nmoment before, now scattered and confused by Kip’s invasion. Kip tore the\nstaff away from the boy and sealed it.\nThe blue luxin staff was bent from where the boys had grappled for it,\nbut it was still as tall as either of them and as big around as Kip could\ncomfortably hold in his hand. Ignoring the pain as he grabbed it with his\nbandaged left hand, Kip swung the bottom of the staff for the boy’s knees.\nIt connected with a crack, and the still-stunned boy dropped. He hadn’t\neven tried to move. Just stood there like a dumb ox. He crumpled, and Kip"

He crumpled, and Kip\nstepped over him, putting one end of the staff on the boy’s throat.\n“Match!” Ironfist called out.\nKip stepped away. Drafting blue made it much easier to obey orders than\ndrafting green did.\nThe boy on the ground moaned, dazed, only slowly coming back to\nhimself.\n“Commander, sir,” Cruxer asked, “what was that?”\nIronfist was scowling. “Something we don’t teach until a year from now.\nKip, who showed you that?”\nKip turned his hands up, helpless.\n“Willjacking or will-breaking. Trainer Fisk?”\nThe muscle-bound teacher stepped forward. “Technically, it’s called\nforced translucification. Luxin has no memory. There is no your luxin or my\nluxin. Once a drafter makes physical contact with open luxin of a color that\nshe can draft, she can use it. What just happened here was two drafters\nfought will to will, and Kip broke Grazner’s will.”\nThe boy Kip had just defeated said, “But, but, I didn’t know what he\nwas doing!”\nThe trainer said, “He didn’t know what he was doing either. Did you,\nKip?”\n“Uh, no, sir.”\n“You’re just lucky you weren’t left a blithering idiot, Graz,” Trainer Fisk\nsaid.\nA boy in the crowd whispered, “Blithering, no. Idiot? Weeelll…”\nSeveral people snickered. A few had the decency to try to cover it with\ncoughs.\n“So Adrasteia, you want to challenge Kip?” Ironfist asked.\n“Ah hells,” the boy murmured. He was the one who’d made the crack\nabout Grazner.\n“Sir, I thought if I won I was done,” Kip said.\n“Whatever would make you believe such a thing? The winning is just\nthe beginning.”\nKip swallowed.\nAdrasteia didn’t look terribly pleased to be fighting Kip either. Alone of\nall the fighters, he wasn’t wearing an armband showing what color he\ndrafted.\nHe had straight, shoulder-length dark hair, bound back with a gold scarf.\nSkin just dark enough for the Blackguard, with Atashian features and\nstriking blue eyes. Short and slender, but wearing a baggy shirt and baggy\npants, he looked maybe thirteen years old. Odd haircut, but then Kip wasn’t\nexactly a man of the world. Maybe long hair was in fashion now. Strange\nname, too, and rather full lips.\n“Oh! You’re a girl!” Kip said. It just slipped out.\nThe class hooted. Ironfist rubbed his forehead.\nNot trying for an insult, but succeeding. Oops.\n“No mercy, chubs,” Adrasteia said. Now he could tell she was his age.\nFifteen, maybe sixteen, petite, no curves. Fairly pretty, but no knockout.\nHe hoped she wasn’t a knockout, anyway.\n“Form up,” Trainer Fisk said. “Same rules as before—and no"

She turned toward\nKip, gave a very perfunctory bow.\nKip bowed back. “Sorry, I didn’t—”\n“Save it, Lard Guile,” she said.\nSeveral students laughed aloud.\n“Oh, I get it, you’re jealous ’cause I have bigger boobs than you,” Kip\nsaid. He covered the stab of self-loathing with a condescending grin.\n“I can see you naked,” she said. “And I’m not jealous of that.” She\nsniffed with distaste at his body.\nHuh?\nBut Kip didn’t have time to think about what she could possibly mean,\nbecause she attacked him.\nHe wasn’t in a ready stance, and he wasn’t ready, period. Especially not\nfor her foot to go from the floor to the side of his head in the blink of an\neye.\nThe flexibility! The grace!\nThe astonishing feeling of blood flying from his face!\nKip was looking at the world sideways. He was lying down, without\nhaving been aware of the whole falling part. As ever when hurt, he did a\nquick inventory: just how bad was it? Not that bad. He’d bit the hell out of\nhis cheek and tongue, but he’d gone down mostly from the surprise.\nGetting your head torn off by a little girl will do that to you.\nShe came into his view, still in a fighting stance, close to his head. Flat\non his back, he asked, “That all you got?”\nIt enraged her, and she stepped toward him.\nHe rolled toward her, fast, hoping to catch her feet and trip her.\nShe jumped, trying to leap over him, but he slowed, grabbed one foot\nwhile she was in midair. He got lucky and snagged the inside foot.\nAdrasteia clawed, catlike, twisting, but she couldn’t recover. She landed\nflat on her hip and cried out.\nKip scrambled, trying to pin her—something, anything to use his weight\nto win somehow.\nHe was halfway on top of her when her small fist caught him straight in\nthe throat. He coughed, collapsed.\nIn a moment, he was lying facedown and she was on top of him with her\narm around his neck.\nAn adult was shouting, but Kip could only hear the roar of blood in his\nears.\nThen Adrasteia disappeared, feet kicking in midair as Ironfist lifted her\nbodily off him, literally hauling her off by her collar.\nIronfist dropped the furious girl in front of him. “I said, Enough!” he\nbellowed. Adrasteia was shocked to stillness. Then she wilted. Everyone in\nthe class shrank back, wide-eyed and suddenly quiet. “Kip!” Ironfist roared.\nKip swallowed a few times. “Yes, sir?” he asked, pulling himself to his\nfeet for what felt like the hundredth time of the day.\n“All the scrubs have a partner. You just found yours.”"

You should see what the full Blackguards get.”\n“Good?” Kip asked.\n“Fantastic,” she said. She picked at her food. “I’m serious.”\n“You really love food, huh?” Kip asked.\n“I meant about the spying, sheep-for-brains.”\n“I know.” Sheep for brains? After the time he’d just spent with sailors\nand soldiers, it was insufferably cute to hear someone swear with\neuphemisms.\n“Oh.” She flushed. Looked down at her food.\n“Why does anyone want to spy on me?” Kip asked.\n“You’re a Guile.” She shrugged as if that explained everything. Kip\nsupposed it did.\n“Who are you spying for?” Kip asked.\n“My sponsor, of course.”\n“Well, I sort of figured.” Kip had had no idea. “But who’s your\nsponsor?”\n“That’s kind of a personal question, isn’t it?” she said.\n“You’re spying on me, but I don’t get to ask slightly personal\nquestions?” Kip asked, incredulous.\nShe laughed. “It’s not really a personal question, Kip. I was just testing\nyou.”\nOh, and I failed.\n“So does that mean you’re going to tell me?” he asked, bullish.\n“Tell you what?” Playing dumb.\n“You are really impossible, aren’t you?” Kip asked.\nShe grinned. “Lady Lucretia Verangheti of the Smussato Veranghetis is\nmy sponsor.”\n“You’re from Ilyta? You don’t look Ilytian. Plus, I thought the Ilytians\ndon’t like drafting. Heretics and all.”\nHer eyebrows shot up. “You just say the first thing that pops into your\nhead, don’t you?”\n“I’m getting better,” Kip said. What had he done?\n“This is the better?”\nMaybe I’ll just shut my fat face for the rest of my life. Kip slowly cut off\nanother piece of sausage. His fingers were healing, so gripping wasn’t very\npainful. Stretching, however, was murder. Of course, using his hands to\nfight with hadn’t made anything better. “Tell you what,” he said. “How\nabout you tell me about you—and that way I can spend a few seconds not\ngetting myself into trouble?”\n“What’s there to tell?” Adrasteia said. She hadn’t eaten a bite of her\ndinner yet. “Father’s a merchant sailor. Does the spice/silk circuit when he\ncan. Gone more often than not. Mother’s a brewer in Odess. She wanted me\nto take over the stills. Instead, here I am.”\n“Isn’t Odess in Abornea?” Kip asked. His mother hadn’t taught him"

Kip tried not to let his surprise show.\nShe tapped the top of her ear. It was snipped vertically and cauterized.\n“You not see this?” she said.\n“Oh!” he said. She was a slave—and he was stupid.\nBut she didn’t mock him. She said, “They like to say that among the\nChromeria’s pupils, there is no slave and no free. They like to say all sorts\nof things, of course, but if you can make it into the Blackguard, it’s actually\ntrue.” She didn’t say it bitterly, though. She shrugged. Who you were\nmattered here, and there was no getting around it.\n“So that’s why you’re trying to get into the Blackguard?”\n“You’re joking, right?” she asked.\nKip’s look must have been enough. She sighed.\n“Do you know why almost everyone in our training group is older than\nyou, Kip?”\n“Do you see this blank look on my face? Assume it applies for\neverything,” Kip said.\nShe grinned for a moment. “Getting a spot in the Blackguard is the most\ncoveted appointment most of us can dream of. In our training group alone,\nthere are four legacies: children of Blackguards. Cruxer, Rig, Aram, and\nTana. I can guarantee you that all of them have been training in martial arts\nsince they could walk. If you’re a slave and you test in, you’re freed—\nthough you do have to swear your service to the Blackguard. If you’re the\nowner of that slave, the Chromeria pays you a fortune for the transfer of\nyour property. The Veranghetis have placed dozens of Blackguards over the\nyears. It’s one of their more lucrative businesses. I came in a little sideways.\nThe family that owned me had a daughter who was my age. They wanted\nher to be able to defend herself. I was trained with her, so she’d have a\nsparring partner. When they realized I might be able to draft, they sold me\nto Lady Verangheti. She had me train for the last year, all day, every day,\nwith a variety of top masters, so that I might make it in.”\nA whole life, spent as property, spent training for this? “So you’re telling\nme I shouldn’t feel bad for getting beat up by a girl.”\n“Watch it, chunky.”\nHe grinned a moment late, not realizing right away that she was teasing.\nHer face fell. “I’m sorry, that wasn’t—I didn’t realize you were sensit—\nI shouldn’t have… I’m sorry.”\nThere was a sticky silence.\n“I heard you almost passed the Threshing,” she said.\n“Almost.” Kip Almost. Another reminder of failure. But she’d clearly\nmeant well. “Actually,” he said, “I’ve got one special talent.”\n“What’s that?”"

Highly\nvaluable.”\n“All right,” she said, leaning close.\nHe looked left and right, as if nervous. “Plate cleaning,” he whispered.\nPure puzzlement. He could see her thinking, Did I hear him right? He\ngestured to his empty plate.\nShe laughed. “That one is going right to my sponsor!”\nShe was cute. Damn she was cute. Her smile punched right through\nKip’s chest and stirred that same stupid, awful, ridiculous place that Liv\nhad. Kip sighed. “I know you’re just being nice to me because you’ve been\nordered to, but I like you.”\nSomething died in her eyes. She looked away. He saw a wave of\nsuppressed emotion crest in her lips, which went through about four\nexpressions in a second. She blinked rapidly. Stood up and left without a\nword.\nSo, Kip, sweetie, how was your first day?\nI made my teacher hate me; I got slapped by an old man and beat up by\na little girl; I told my class that you were a whore; I destroyed someone’s\ndream of joining the Blackguard; and I made a nice girl cry.

He stopped immediately. Breathed. Had to concentrate so tears didn’t\nleak out.\nKip got up and walked out of the hall. His Blackguard followed him.\nThe man was tall and skinny, his irises haloed in red behind square-lensed\nred spectacles, pistol tucked behind his back, ataghan on one hip, katar on\nthe other. He wasn’t one of the Blackguards who’d been to Tyrea.\nIt wasn’t even dark when Kip got to the barracks. He didn’t care. He\ncrashed into his bed, not even pulling the blanket over himself. He was\nfinished.\nBut the day wasn’t finished with him.\nSomething jabbed him. “What are you doing in my bed?” a voice\ndemanded.\nReally?\nKip didn’t even open his eyes. “I’m farting in it to warm it up for you.”\n“Get out.” This time whoever it was punched Kip in the shoulder. It\ndidn’t hurt much. Kip was looking through slit eyes and saw the movement\ntoward himself and had braced for it. “I want to sleep in this bed tonight.”\n“It’s a bit small, but I guess we can cuddle,” Kip said, sitting up.\nThe bully was big but doughy-looking. One of those boys who gets his\nheight and weight early, and doesn’t really notice when everyone else\ncatches up with him.\n“Out of my bed, fatty,” the bully said.\nKip rubbed his eyes. The other boys in the barracks were watching,\npretending to be readying their bunks, stripping off their tunics. “Problem\nwith being a bully,” Kip said. “You never know how tough the new boy is.\nBet it scares you a little, doesn’t it?”"

And then…”\nOr I can sidestep all that nonsense.\nKip punched the bully in the nose as hard as he could—and actually\nconnected. A most satisfying pop. The bully went down hard, stunned.\nBlood gave him the mustache and beard that age hadn’t yet.\n“What’s your name?” Kip asked the boy at his feet.\n“Erio,” the boy said, plugging his nose, still stunned. He got up on all\nfours, or all threes actually, since one hand was occupied.\n“Elio?”\nElio started to stand. “I am going to kill you, you little—” Fighting\nmanners dictated that Kip let him stand before they fought.\nKip slugged the boy in the face, knocking him sprawling. He jumped on\ntop of Elio, squashing the breath out of him and trapping his arm in a\nwristlock. He sat on the boy.\nAbruptly, Kip was cold, in control.\nElio said, “I’m going to kick your ass, you little puke. I’m going to\nmake you regret the day you were born.” Apparently he’d recovered from\nhis shock, then. “Let go of my arm!”\nElio jerked and jumped, trying to throw Kip off, but Kip merely ground\nforward until the boy cried out and stopped fighting. He knew wristlocks\nwell, though it had always been from the other side. Back home, Ramir\nused to grind Kip’s face in the ground, make him cry, furious, humiliated.\nMade him kiss the dirt and say nasty things for his amusement before he’d\nlet him get up.\nThe bully didn’t stop: “I’m going to kill you, you fat little bastard. You\ncan’t hold me forever, and once I get out, you’re going to have to watch\nyour back. I’ll be there. I’ll be waiting for you, and you won’t get off with a\nsucker punch next time.”\nKip realized suddenly that he was riding a tiger. There was no winning\nhere. He was in a position of power, so he’d look the bad guy if he used it to\nhis advantage. The normal course of things now was that he would give\nElio an ultimatum, like Take it back! or something similarly stupid. Elio\nwould refuse, and Kip would be stuck. If Kip let him get up, Elio would\ncome back tomorrow—and he probably would beat the snot out of Kip. If\nKip tortured Elio by grinding his arm, it wouldn’t do permanent damage,\nbut many of the boys wouldn’t know that, and even if Elio submitted, Kip\nwould look like a cruel bastard to everyone in the barracks. Or worse,"

Or worse,\nsomeone would interfere before Elio submitted, and Kip would look cruel\nand weak.\nStalling, Kip said, “Elio, I might not look it, but I’m tougher than you,\nI’m meaner than you, I’m smarter than you, and I will always go further\nthan you dare.”\n“Save it, shit-eater,” Elio said, sensing weakness in Kip’s hesitation.\n“Oww! Start begging now, you little bitch.”\nKip was suddenly so tired of it all. What had Ironfist said: ‘The winning\nis just the beginning’?\n“Elio, I was going to give you one more chance to take it back. But\nyou’re not going to take anything back. You’re too damn stupid, and I’m\ntoo tired to keep playing this game. But I want you to remember something\nafter you go to the infirmary: this is me being merciful.”\nStill holding Elio’s wrist in the wristlock, Kip brought his left forearm\ndown sharply with his weight behind it.\nElio’s arm broke with a crunch. Everyone gasped. A bit of bloody bone\nspeared through the skin. Elio screamed. It was a high-pitched sound. Not\nwhat you would have guessed the boy would sound like at all.\nKip got off. As forty boys watched, wide-eyed, Elio crawled away,\nbleeding, weeping. He stood and lurched out of the barracks, cradling his\nbroken arm. None of the boys helped him. No one in authority ever came.\nAs Elio careened out of the door, Kip saw that his Blackguard—the\nslim, tall young man—was standing in the dark corner, leaning against the\nwall. He’d watched everything, no doubt ready to move if Kip’s life were in\ndanger. Other than that, he wouldn’t interfere. He just watched, eyes\nglittering, face blank.\nWith feigned nonchalance, Kip lay back down in his bed and pretended\nto go back to sleep instantly. Just leave me alone. He turned his back toward\nthe boys who were whispering to each other, amazed, repeating the story\nthat didn’t need repeating. They’d all seen it.\nKip’s sleep was a lie. Eventually the boys snuffed their candles. In the\ndarkness, Kip relived the battle at Garriston.\nThe man he’d thrown into the campfire, skin tearing off his face like\nchicken sticking to a pan. The eyes of men, faces contorted with fury, trying\nto kill Kip, hefting weapons as Kip fell through the gap in the wall. Fell,\nfell. Feet kicking at him from a hundred sides.\nThe taste of gunpowder in the air.\nThe joy of sweeping a blade into a man, his flesh parting, the blade\nwinning free of his flesh, liberating blood and soul.\nSurrounded by soldiers, matchlocks coming up. Kip shooting their own\nmusket balls in their faces.\nAn eyeball, blue as the sea, sitting on a paving stone, the head it had\nbeen blown out of nowhere to be found. Staring at Kip, staring. Accusing.\nKiller.\nWhat have you done?"

They’d thought\nRamir was going to be pressed into King Garadul’s army. Kip had killed\nsoldiers—boys—no older than Ramir at Garriston. Boys who’d probably\nbeen pressed into service. Innocents doing guilty work.\nHe’d thought he wanted to kill Ramir, sometimes, back when he was a\nboy. Back when he didn’t know what it meant. Back when he didn’t know\nhow easy it was.\nWhat kind of monster have I become?\nChapter 18\nGavin put the fist-sized charge into the tube and began spooling out a\nnarrow finger of green luxin, pushing it under the waves. In the last two\ndays, he’d gotten pretty good at this, but he still couldn’t rely on the\ncharges, which were made of intermixed layers of yellow and red luxin\nwrapped around a bubble of air. The trick was making that innermost layer\nimproperly—in exactly the proper way. The luxin bubble decayed, exposing\nthe unstable yellow luxin to air. That unstable luxin flashed into light,\nigniting the red luxin. The successive layers did the same and made an\nexplosion big enough to clear the reefs.\nBut handling explosives that you’d deliberately made unstable was tense\nwork. And sometimes the charges blew as soon as they touched the reef;\nother times they didn’t blow up for several minutes, or at all.\nKarris was steadying the boat, sometimes poling, sometimes rowing.\nThis time, the explosion came before Gavin had pulled away the\nplacement tube. The tube shot out of his hands, and the sea jumped beneath\ntheir boat. Gavin had been braced for the wave, but the tube shooting up\ninto the air pulled him off balance. He stumbled backward. Ordinarily,\nfalling in the water would have been fine, but at the moment it was full of\nrazor-sharp chunks of coral boiling up to the surface from the explosion.\nKarris snagged Gavin’s belt as his foot plunged into the water. She\nheaved. He swung abruptly back toward the boat and swept her feet out\nfrom under her as he crashed onto the deck.\nGavin rolled hard to keep from capsizing their little craft, and ended up\non top of Karris. He laughed. “Nice catch!”\nThe look in her eyes was so intense that he thought his heart was going\nto stop.\n“Get. Off,” she hissed. Her body was rigid. He must have misinterpreted\nthat split-second look. For a sliver of an instant he could have sworn—\n“Sorry,” he said. He pushed himself up. “Good catch,” he said again.\nDid she cling to him just for a moment there? Did her body rise with him,\nkeeping the contact for just one moment more? He looked at her.\nThe sun was baking the bay and had been for the last two days. Gavin\nhad stripped off his shirt to cool down immediately, and after modestly\nsweating through the first day, Karris had followed his lead on the second,\nwearing only her tight Blackguard’s chemise.

He tried not to—\nfailed—looked at her breasts.\nBriefly, but she noticed.\nGavin could hear his imprisoned brother’s voice, sudden, sharp: ‘So\nyou’d take this, too, huh, brother? Make love with her, as if you were me?\nYou want to hear her scream my name when she’s in the throes of passion?’\nIf she were any other woman, he would force the moment to its crisis:\nhe would kiss her right now and let her decide. She wanted to say no? Fine,\nto hell with her. He’d move on. Or, more likely, she’d say yes, and he’d bed\nher and leave her with a smile on her face—but leave her. At least he’d do\nsomething.\nKarris was the only woman who paralyzed him.\nHe remembered lying beside her in her room in her father’s house, so\nlong ago. He remembered kissing that breast, caressing her body, talking as\nthe dawn approached. They’d made love half a dozen times through the\nnight, urgency and passion winning through the awkwardness of\ninexperience. He had to be gone before her maid came to wake her in the\nmorning.\nThey’d both known their romance was doomed, even then, even as the\nchildren they’d been. “I’ll come for you,” Dazen had promised.\nHe’d come back as he’d sworn, and she’d been gone—taken away by\nher father, though he hadn’t known it then; he’d thought she had betrayed\nhim—and her brothers had ambushed him. And he’d started the fire that\nkilled them all: brothers, servants, slaves, children, treasures, hope.\n“I’ve done you many wrongs,” Gavin said now. He stood. “And I regret\nevery one of them. I’m sorry.”\nHe extended a hand to Karris, to help her stand. He thought she was\ngoing to refuse for a moment, but then she took his hand, popped to her\nfeet, and didn’t release his hand. She stood close, but her proximity was a\nchallenge. “Do you want to specify what you’re asking my pardon for?”\nAt Garriston, she’d said, ‘I know your big secret, you asshole.’ And\nslapped him.\nWhich hadn’t actually clarified that much. He’d kept a lot of secrets over\nthe years, and whatever she thought she knew could be leagues away from\nthe worst truth. His central secret had necessitated all sorts of other ones\nover the years.\nAnd by secrets, I mean lies.\nSo how cold are you, Gavin? How committed to your goal? You’ve\nkilled for it before. Can you do it again?\nThey were hundreds of leagues away from the nearest Chromeria spy. If\nGavin told Karris the whole truth and she swore to expose him or ruin him,\nhe could kill her.\nSimple. Easy.\nIn a fair fight, she’d have a fair chance against him. Her Blackguard\ntraining had made her quite a weapon. But there was no fair fight against a\nPrism.\n“I’m just sorry,” Gavin said. He looked away.\nShe didn’t let go of his hand. She clamped down on it until he met her"

She clamped down on it until he met her\nfiery gaze. “It’s not an apology if you won’t take responsibility. If you can’t\neven name what you’re apologizing for, you’ve given me nothing. You will\nnot buy absolution on the cheap, not after what you’ve done. Not from me.”\nGavin tried to take his hand back. She refused to let go.\n“Let go, or swim,” Gavin said coldly.\nShe let go.\nDamn woman. She made him so furious. More furious because she was\nright. Damn her!\nBut he couldn’t kill her, and he knew it. He’d let the world burn down\nfirst.\nShe picked up the luxin tube he’d been using to place charges and\nhanded it to him. “Five more charges should finish the channel,” she said.\n“But we’ll have to hurry to get it done before low tide. Then we can work\non the seawall footings.”\nThey worked until there was no longer enough light in the sky for Gavin\nto draft. Karris steadied the boat, and made the forms, and made sure that\nthey were keeping within the lines they’d planned.\nThe seawall would actually be three seawalls, with two wide gaps: one\nfor ships coming into the bay, and one for ships leaving. The channels\nthrough the coral that led to the openings zigzagged, the turns marked by\nbuoys. If they came under threat of attack, the locals could remove the\nbuoys. It was going to be rough work, Gavin thought. He’d learned some\nthings from building Brightwater Wall, but there he’d also had thousands of\nworkers and dozens of drafters to help him.\nLovely that I made such a defensible refuge for the Color Prince.\nWell, second time’s the charm. He would leave this for the people of\nTyrea—now his people—and he would do a few other things to give them a\nhead start on establishing a city. Then he would leave.\nThey had a small campfire, and Karris cooked some fish she’d snared\nwhile Gavin slept. She woke him and they ate together.\n“Sorry,” he said, “I should have helped with dinner.”\nShe looked at him like he was being stupid. “You’re making the Ninth\nWonder of the World this week; I can make dinner.”\n“It’s not really fair, is it?” Gavin said. “I couldn’t do this without you,\nbut it’ll be the Thing Gavin Built, just like Brightwater Wall was.”\nShe shook her head. “You’re a mystery to me, Lord Prism.”\nHe didn’t remember falling asleep, but when he woke in the middle of\nthe night, there was a blanket over him. He saw Karris in the low light of\nthe fire, watching the darkness. He felt an immense gratitude toward her.\nShe’d worked hard all day long, too, and now she was staying up all night.\nHer back was to him and to the fire, maintaining her night vision, of\ncourse. Gavin and most sub-reds could control their eyes well enough to\nattain full night vision quickly, but Karris didn’t like to lose even a few\nseconds of night vision.\nGavin sat up and was right on the edge of calling out to tell her he would"

She was crying. Gavin hadn’t seen Karris cry in years.\nHe knew she wouldn’t be pleased to find out he’d noticed, but he stood\nand put his hands on her shoulders. She tensed.\n“I’ll take this watch,” he said gently.\n“Don’t, Gavin,” she said. Her voice was raw, right at the edge.\nDon’t what? Don’t touch her? Don’t say anything? Don’t leave?\n“Today was Tavos’s birthday,” she said, struggling to get the words out\nclearly. “I almost didn’t even remember.” Tavos, her brother. He’d died in\nthe fire. He’d been a terrible person, violent, unstable, one of the boys\nwhose jeering had made Dazen believe that if he didn’t fight back that\nnight, he would be killed. But Karris hadn’t seen that, had maybe never\nseen that side of her brother. Even if she had, he’d still been her brother. “I\njust miss them all so much. Koios…” She sounded like she wanted to say\nmore, but couldn’t.\nKoios had been her favorite brother. He was the only one Gavin\nregretted killing. The only halfway decent person among them.\nAnd then she did weep. She turned to him, and he held her. He said\nnothing, still not certain he wasn’t dreaming the whole thing, knowing only\nthat if he said anything, he would say the wrong thing.\nBewildered as he might be, sometimes a man’s highest calling is simply\nto stand, and hug.\nChapter 19\nIn his dream, Kip was a green wight, chasing down screaming children and\nmurdering them with blade and fire. He woke alternately furious, weepy,\nand bloodthirsty, the rage from those phantasms sometimes still clinging to\nhim.\nWhen he got up to go urinate in the middle of the night, a Blackguard\naccompanied him. It was a man Kip had never met, and he said nothing.\nMerely walked with Kip, and held him back for a moment while he checked\nthat there were no assassins in the toilet. Ridiculous.\nIt was a relief to get out of bed in the morning, though Kip didn’t feel\nrested in the slightest. Several older, second-year students came and herded\nthe new students toward the dining hall.\nKip was ravenous, but he got no more food than anyone else in the\nserving line. He reached the end of the line in dread. Tables were laid out in\nlong rows, and students clumped together with friends.\nWhich I don’t have.\nIn fact, Kip had quite the opposite. He caught sight of Elio, whose arm\nwas wrapped in thick bandages and hung in a sling. The boy was talking\nwith his friends when he saw Kip. He shut up instantly and blanched.\nI should go over there. I should go and sit with them, disarm them with\nsmall talk, pretend nothing happened, but assert my right to sit with the\ntoughest boys in the class."

He looked around at the lines of students, tables, food,\nservants, and slaves. No Blackguards anywhere. For some reason, it took\nwhat little, tottering confidence he had and knocked it over with a breath.\nThey’d seen what he’d done. They’d decided he wasn’t worth protecting.\nThen Kip saw some kids he recognized: the boy with the strange\nspectacles who’d sat behind him in class yesterday and some others from\nthe Blackguard training class. They were the outcasts—Kip could tell\nimmediately. They were the awkward, the intelligent, the ugly, with those\nBlackguard hopefuls who were destined to fail out early and were merely\ntrying to get in from some vain hope of their own or their masters’. There\nwas, of course, space at their table, and space around them, as if they were\ncontagious. Kip went over.\n“Can you read?” the boy asked as Kip came close. His flip-down\nspectacles currently had the blue lens down over one eye, and the yellow\ndown over the other.\nKip hesitated. Did they not want him? “Um, yes?”\n“You need to get to lecture if you can’t. If you can, you need to check\nthe work schedule. Hold on, you had that—Oh, never mind, of course you\ncan read. You told Magister Kadah to go stuff herself.”\n“Really?” a homely girl asked.\nKip ignored her and tucked into his food.\n“Why are you sitting with us?”\n“You looked nicer than them,” Kip said, gesturing with a toss of his\nhead toward the tough boys. “You want me to leave?”\nThey all looked at each other. Shrugged. “No,” the boy with spectacles\nsaid.\n“So, what are your names?” Kip asked.\nThe bespectacled boy pointed to himself, “I’m Ben-hadad,” then to the\nhomely girl, “Tiziri,” then to a gangly, gap-toothed boy, “that’s Aras, and\n—”\nThey were interrupted by a girl’s voice. “Hey, did you all hear about\nElio getting his halos tapped by the new—” She cut off as she saw Kip.\n“And… that would be Adrasteia. Classic, Teia.”\n“We’ve met,” Kip said dryly.\nTeia opened her mouth, then sat down silently, defeated.\n“I didn’t hear,” Aras said. “What, new who? What happened?”\n“Aras,” Teia said through gritted teeth.\n“What? Was there a fight?” Aras asked.\n“I don’t know if I’d call it a fight,” Kip said.\n“You? You were in a fight? With Elio?” Aras said.\n“You broke his arm in three places!” Adrasteia—Teia?—said.\n“I did?” Kip asked.\n“Wait, you broke Elio’s arm?” Ben-hadad asked. “I hate that kid.”"

She had a birthmark\nover the left half of her face. She wore her kinky hair flopped over that way\nto try to hide it, but it was a futile attempt.\nKip looked at his bandaged hand. He was supposed to get a fresh\npoultice smeared on it every day. He’d forgotten this morning. He didn’t\neven know if he could find the infirmary from here. “No, uh, this.

He fixed his gaze on Kip, one eye looking slightly larger than\nthe other. Kip had heard of the lenses that corrected bad vision before, but\nhe’d never seen them. It was unnerving. “So,” Ben-hadad said to Kip,\n“spill.”\n“About Elio? He came over and hit me a few times, and I punched him\nin the nose.”\nThey waited.\nKip spooned in more gruel.\n“Worst. Storyteller. Ever,” Teia said.\n“You punched him in the nose so hard his arm broke in three places?”\nBen-hadad prompted.\n“Look,” Kip said, “it wasn’t a big thing. I was really scared and I knew\nhe was going to hit me, so I—you know? I hit him first.

People just don’t recognize it yet,\nTeia, we’ve talked—”\nTeia shot back, “If no one recognizes it, no one’s going to recruit me for\nit either. Maybe in five years more people will think like you do, but for\nnow I’ve got no other options. It’s all I’m good for. Don’t you understand? I\ntried to find another sponsor.

The apple of his throat was distractingly large, making him look like a\nlarge, kind vulture.\n“Are we supposed to do anything with our bowls?” Kip asked.\n“Huh?” Aras had been looking over at some girls. Pretty, in the same\nplain uniforms as everyone else, but with jewelry at their wrists and throats.\nRich girls. Out of reach, but not out of the reach of dreams, from Aras’s\ndistant look. “Bowls?

First shift starts soon.” Aras went back to\nstaring at the girls.\nLeaving the table felt like abandoning safety to go back and play in the\nfields of the wolves. But there was no putting it off. Kip stood and headed\ntoward the wall of lists. He passed by some older discipulae just coming to\neat. A boy and a girl walked by, their arms down at their sides, eyes intent\nwith concentration, their food held on blue trays that they each were\ndrafting. Each raised their hands slowly as they walked, trying to adjust the\nopen luxin without spilling their food and drink. Then they sealed their\ntrays, almost simultaneously.\n“Oh no, oh no, oh no,” the boy was repeating. He’d sealed the luxin\nbadly, and even as he reached the table, his tray disintegrated, dropping his\nbowl and glass, both of which shattered.\n“One for the girls!” his opponent said, setting down her perfect tray\neasily.\nThe boy swore under his breath as some other boys, clearly his friends,\ngroaned. A magister piped up, “You’re cleaning that yourself, Gerrad. No\nslaves.”\nTeia intercepted Kip before he got to the lists. “We’ve got mirror duty,\nblue tower.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“You weren’t here for bearings week when they show us how things\nwork. You don’t know anything,” Teia said. “So I switched chores with\nsomeone. I’ll be on your crew all week.”\n“Really?” Kip said. It was a ray of normal piercing his black clouds of\nutter cluelessness.\nHe was about to thank her when she said, “No. Don’t.”\n“I was going to—”\n“I’m not doing it for you. Partners often have to share each other’s\npunishments. The punishments usually mean you miss class. So if you\nbotch things, it hurts my chances to make it into the Blackguard.”\nGreat, something else to feel guilty about.\nTeia walked him to one of the lifts, where they joined about fifty other\nstudents waiting. Teia’s hair wasn’t tied back today and now Kip felt foolish\nfor mistaking her for a boy in the first place. Moron.\nHe wondered what Liv was doing now. He wondered if she was even\nstill alive. Stupid worry. She was probably murdering people by now. Kip\nhad stood there, on the eve of the Battle of Garriston.

High-minded talk used to cloak cowardice.\nMagic was hard. It made you a master of the world for a decade or two,\nand then it mastered you. Drafters went crazy. When vastly powerful people\ngo crazy, they endanger everyone. Killing them wasn’t nice, but it was\nnecessary.\nThe Color Prince said, “We won’t murder our parents who have served\nfor years!” He meant, “I don’t want to die when it’s my turn. I want all the\nprivileges we’re afforded because of our gifts, but I don’t want to pay the\nprice.” Kip could see that, and Kip was a moron. Why hadn’t Liv?\nAfter a few minutes, Kip and Teia were able to get on the lift with\ntwenty other students.\n“We’re lucky,” Teia said. “The mirrors are boring, but when you have to\nspend all morning on the counterweights and then you go to Blackguard\ntryouts and you can barely lift your arms? That’s awful.”\n“Thanks, tell me about it,” another student said. Kip thought he\nrecognized the boy from the Blackguard class. His name was Ferkudi,\nmaybe? “I’ve got the counterweights all week!”\n“We’ll trade you,” Teia said.\n“You will?!”\n“No,” Teia said. The students laughed.\nThe lift stopped about halfway up the tower, and almost all the students\nspilled out to cross the walkways. Kip and Teia went with them. The six\nouter towers of the Chromeria were connected to the central tower by a\nseries of spindly walkways hanging high up in the air. Kip had crossed one\nof these bridges before. He knew that they were safe.\nAfter all, the Chromeria wouldn’t put drafters at risk, right?\nKip swallowed and followed. The blue tower was finished with blue\nluxin cut into facets so that the whole surface gleamed in the sun like a\nmillion sapphires. It would have been breathtaking, if Kip had any breath.\n“Don’t like heights, huh?” Teia asked after they got across.\n“Not my favorite,” Kip admitted.\n“This might not be that much fun, then.”\nKip forced a weak smile.\n“You have a bad experience or something?” Teia asked. “With heights?”\n“Fat assassin lady tried to throw me off the yellow tower,” Kip said.\nShe looked at him, dubious. “Look, if you don’t like heights, that’s fine.\nYou don’t have to make fun. I was just making conversation.”\nKip opened his mouth. No, he wasn’t going to win this one.\nHad they ever figured out who wanted him dead?\nIf so, no one had ever told him. Which reminded him of his Blackguard\nescort—there still wasn’t one. It gave Kip the feeling—again—of being\ntangentially involved in Big Things. Someone tried to kill him; no one\nexplained why. He got a Blackguard escort; the Blackguard escort got taken\naway, and no one figured to clue Kip in.\nGo play in the corner and don’t bother the adults, Kip."

He got a Blackguard escort; the Blackguard escort got taken\naway, and no one figured to clue Kip in.\nGo play in the corner and don’t bother the adults, Kip.\nTeia led half a dozen students to the blue tower’s lift and they took that\nup to the top. There was a big, sturdy door and a nice hallway.\n“Other half of the top floor is for satrapahs and nobles and religious\nfestivals,” Teia said. “On Sun Day, this whole floor rotates so that their half\nfaces the sun, rather than ours.”\nBeyond the sturdy door was a room full of gears and pulleys and ropes\nand sand clocks and bells, with enormous windows. It was so bright that\nKip was momentarily blinded. Teia handed him a pair of large round\nspectacles with darkened lenses. Once he put them on, he was able to see\nagain.\nWeary students who’d pulled the dawn shift got up from their chairs and\nhanded off thick coats to the next shift. Some of them muttered instructions\nabout the states of certain gears or ropes. A few traded jokes. Kip was lost.\nEventually, they got sorted. Kip and Teia took their coats and both took\na chair. There were six stations, two students per station, two chairs, four\nsand clocks, four bells, one giant mirror per station that was bigger across\nthan Kip was tall, and three smaller mirrors.\n“The whole Chromeria rotates over the course of the day so that it’s\nalways facing the sun more or less directly,” Teia said. “So mostly we only\nhave to move the mirrors up and down as the sun rises. First rule, never\ntouch the mirrors with your hands. If there’s a problem, we summon the\nlens grinders. They’re the best in the world, and they get furious if they find\nhandprints on their mirrors.”\nBut as impressive as the mirrors and pulleys were, they weren’t what\nseized Kip’s attention. There were half a dozen massive holes in the floor:\none huge central hole, with six mirrors above it, and then numerous smaller\nones.\n“Lightwells,” Teia said. “So that drafters in the tower below us will\nalways have enough light available, no matter if they’re on the dark side of\nthe tower, or if it’s early or late in the day. Take a peek over the side.”\nSo every team used their big mirror to send light to another big mirror\nover the central hole, where other mirrors shot the light downward.\nKip poked his head over the side. The walls of the hole were perfectly\nsheer, covered in silver polished to a mirror sheen, and it plunged on\nforever. In the glare of the gathered sunlight, he couldn’t even see the\nbottom.\nAs he was watching, about four floors down, a section of the wall\nopened and a mirror three feet across popped out into the light stream. Kip\nsaw that farther down, other mirrors were similarly gathering light, offset\nfrom each other by careful degrees so that mirrors above wouldn’t block\nlight to the mirrors below.\nKip stepped back, swallowing. It was mind-blowing, genius—and there\nwas no railing to keep the mirror-tenders from falling straight down.\nA tiny bell rang, startling him. Teia turned over the sand timer connected"

Teia turned over the sand timer connected\nto the bell and grabbed a rope over one of the smaller side mirrors. She\npulled a ratcheting lever, which moved the mirror by some tiny degree.\nThe smaller mirrors fed light to smaller holes. “Special laboratories, or\npolychromes’ or Colors’ chambers,” Teia answered Kip’s unspoken\nquestion. “There’s only so many private lightwells in each tower, so you\nhave to be pretty important to get your own. But our work is pretty\nmindless. Once you get used to it, anyway. We don’t calibrate anything.\nMirror slaves do that, setting things every dawn, and then we just move the\nropes so much every time a bell goes off. Teams of two so we stay awake,\nand in case we have to open the windows, and for the zenith switchover.”\n“Sure. Zenith switchover,” Kip said, having no idea what she was\ntalking about.\nThe work seemed complicated at first, but pretty soon Teia was letting\nKip pull the levers and turn the sand timers.\n“Anyone ever fall down the holes?” Kip asked.\n“A boy fell down one of the smaller lightwells last year. It was four\nfloors down to the Blue’s mirror. Broke his back. Lived for six months. A\nfew years ago, it’s said some boys fought up here, and one pushed the other\none into the great well. Died instantly. The killer swore it was on accident.\nThey didn’t believe him.”\n“What’d they do?” Kip asked.\n“Orholam’s Glare.”\nKip’s face apparently said it for him: I have no idea what you’re talking\nabout. Again.\n“There’s a pillar at the base of the bridge on Big Jasper. You know the\nThousand Stars?”\nThe mirror towers all over the city. “Sure.”\n“Right, all those mirrors, plus all the mirrors on Chromeria towers, are\nall focused on that one point. They put the condemned at the focal point at\nnoon. Drafter’s got a choice then. You can cook to death like an ant under a\nglass, or you can draft. If you draft, it’s like pushing too much water\nthrough a straw. You burst.”\n“That sounds… unspeakably awful,” Kip said.\n“It’s not supposed to be fun. Come on, it’s time for lecture. You think\nyou can get through it today without causing an incident?”\nKip’s brow wrinkled, not ready to let it go. “But I thought that they\nslaved the Thousand Stars onto the Prism every Sun Day.”\n“Yes?”\n“Well, how does he not die?” Kip asked.\n“He’s the Prism. He can do anything.”\nChapter 21\nI can’t do this.\nSeven years, seven great purposes.\nIt was a fantasy, a fairy story, a fool’s errand.

He shook it off, ignored the stabbing pain and tightness in his\nchest. Dawn was close. Karris would wake any minute, and she would\nmove away. They would get up; they would work. Sooner or later, the\npeople of this island would either come to stop him or to talk. If they came\nto kill him, they would come at night. With dawn coming, he thought it\nunlikely they would attack now. Gavin would live another day.\nThe first of his purposes was easy enough, though he’d persistently\nfailed: tell the whole truth to Karris. When the city had fallen to the Color\nPrince, he’d almost abandoned the second: saving the people of Garriston\nwho had suffered so much because of him. Now that salvation was within\nsight. Other purposes, he had achieved: learning to travel faster than any\nman alive; undermining certain Colors on the Spectrum, the ruling council\nof the Chromeria. Others were still in process. All except telling Karris the\ntruth ultimately built toward one goal, one grand design that he barely even\ndared to think about, lest somehow thinking it would make it even more\nimpossible than it already was. As if, in thinking it, he would spill the secret\nand it would escape beyond his grasp forever.\nHe owed his dead little brother Sevastian better. He owed his mother\nbetter. He owed Gavin better.\nHe wasn’t sure, even as he thought it, if by “Gavin” he meant himself, or\nhis brother.\nKarris snuggled close to him, but the very movement seemed to raise\nher consciousness above the waterline, and she started. He breathed evenly,\nfeigning sleep. She pulled back, scooted away gently so as not to wake him.\nShe might hate him—deservedly so—but she was still kind. It was one of\nthe things he loved about her.\nHe’d held her while she mourned her brother last night. Held her until\nshe slept, and then got up and kept watch. He’d envied her tears even as it\nwarmed him and made him ache for her. He’d envied her for clean grief for\na dead brother rather than his horror and guilt over a living one. No wonder\nhe’d dreamed about Dazen when it had been his turn to sleep. Regardless,\nlast night changed nothing between them. He expected a brusque thank-you\ntoday, if anything. Then things would be back to normal.\nExcept normal couldn’t hold. Karris wasn’t stupid: pretty soon she’d\nnotice that he couldn’t draft blue. And her questions had already been\nunsettling.\nThe truth was, all his purposes were focused in one direction, except for\nthe one about telling Karris the truth, which ran directly opposite. Karris\nwas the greatest threat to his plans. And she was immune to flattery or\npressure. She had nothing but her own sense of justice. If she thought\nruining him was the right thing to do, she’d do it regardless of the cost.\nThe smart thing to do was to treat her like any other obstacle, and take\nher out.\nIt didn’t mean killing her. He could take her to one of the outer islands,\nwhere even merchants came only once a year, and simply leave her there."

But stealing a\nyear of the life of a woman who had, quite likely, only five years left to live\nwas no small offense.\nHe sat up. This was going nowhere.\nKarris was just coming back from making water in the woods.\n“Any itch weed?” Gavin asked.\nShe blushed, remembering that misadventure. “I’m a touch more careful\nabout that these days.”\n“Once bit twice shy, eh?” Gavin asked, standing and stretching. He had\nto go make water himself.\n“In some things.” She had an odd look in her eyes.\nHe stepped into the woods and started to urinate. It had been awkward,\nfifteen years ago, to have someone standing two paces away while he\nrelieved himself. Having Blackguards protect him made him have to get\nover that fast. Especially when they traveled in wilderness, a Blackguard\nwasn’t going to let him out of her sight.\n“Gavin? Thank you,” Karris said.\nGavin pissed. He knew better than to talk, better than to laugh in\namusement at being right. He cleared his throat. “So, you figure this Third\nEye is going to come today?” he asked.\n“Safe bet,” Karris said, voice suddenly tense. He heard her pistol\ncocking.\nChapter 22\n“You may not know it now, but this class will be the most important topic\nsome of you will ever study,” Magister Hena said. She was both impossibly\ntall and impossibly skinny, with bad posture, bad teeth, and thick colorless\ncorrective lenses that made her eyes look different sizes. “For most of you\nboys, it will be the only time you get to taste the greatness of making real\nstructures with luxin, so it will behoove you to pay attention, so you know\nwhat the women for whom you work are doing. If you’re good at it, you\nmay be allowed to do the arithmetic, of course, so a large part of this class\nwill have to do with the decidedly mundane task of teaching the abacus and\nthe skills of drawing. Engineering is knowing. Building is an art. Everyone\ncan do the former, the latter is reserved for the best women.”\nOne of the boys, scowling, raised his hand. She called on him.\n“Magister Hena, why can’t we build?”\n“Because only superchromats are allowed to build with luxin. You boys,\nyour eyes are inferior. In some applications, you can cover your flawed\ndrafting with enough will and by spraying enough luxin at the problem. But\nnot in a structure people have to trust. Only women, and only superchromat\nwomen, are allowed to build. It’s not worth death to risk trusting a man.”\n“But why, Magister Hena? Why can’t we draft as well?” the boy asked.\nHe sounded whiny. Even to Kip, who thought it was unfair, too.\n“I don’t care,” Magister Hena said. “Ask a luxiat or one of your\ntheology teachers. For today, I’ll isolate the superchromats. Yes, I know you"

Only at one place on those sticks is the luxin drafted absolutely\nperfectly. Make a mark beneath that spot with your chalk. I’ll come around\nand check your work, and the superchromats will move to the front of the\nroom.”\nKip looked at the sticks of luxin and picked up the chalk. He was\ndamned if he did and damned if he didn’t, he knew. He was a superchromat\nand a boy. A freak. Being in the in group wasn’t going to help him at all,\nbecause none of the other boys would be in it with him. They’d hate him for\nbeing with the girls, and the girls wouldn’t treat him like he belonged either.\nHe’d be different, no matter what.\nAnd because Magister Hena had seen the earlier test results, if Kip\nfailed, she’d ask him if he’d failed on purpose. She didn’t look like the type\nto think that “It’s too embarrassing to be a superchromat boy” would be an\nacceptable answer.\nKip made his marks. It was easy. Around the room, boys and girls both\nwere squinting, looking at the sticks from different angles, holding them up\nto the light. Kip suddenly felt sorry for the girls who didn’t make it. It was\none thing for boys to fail. No one expected them to pass. But half of girls\npassed. That was a big enough number that failing was embarrassing. To\nfail was to be like the boys. It was to be a second-class drafter. He could see\nthem agonizing.\n“It’s not a test you can pass by trying harder,” Magister Hena said. “You\neither see the differences or you don’t. It’s a failure, but it’s not a personal\none. There’s nothing you can do to pass it. Either you were born blessed, or\nyou weren’t. Chalk down.”\nEither you were born blessed, or you weren’t? Thanks. That makes it so\nmuch better.\nMagister Hena walked around the room. She ticked through the\nstudents. “Up front, up front, stay here, stay here. Stay, stay, stay.” She\nwalked behind Kip’s place, “Stay—er…”\nShe looked at his slate, then at the slates of his neighbors. Kip guessed\nthat there were only so many tests, and she was seeing if he could have\ncheated off of a real superchromat to get the correct answers.\nApparently, she hadn’t heard about him. Great.\n“The boy next to you, take his test,” Magister Hena ordered.\nKip grimaced to himself as the class looked at him. He picked up his\nchalk and quickly marked the spots on the boy’s slate—of course, the boy’s\nmarks had been all wrong.\n“Hmm, a superchromat boy. It’s been years,” Magister Hena said. “Very\nwell.

Girls… and boy… you’ve been\nmoved up front because you’re favored by Orholam. You can appreciate the\nbeauties of Orholam’s creation in ways the rest of this class and most of the\nworld is blind to. However, that means more will be expected of you. That\nis why I’ve had you come to the front, not because I care what accident of\nbirth gave you better eyes than the rest. You do have better eyes than the\nrest, so you have a responsibility to Orholam and to me to use those eyes\nwell. Understood?”\n“Yes, Magister,” the girls said weakly.\nShe raised her eyebrows and peered at them over her goggly lenses.\nThey repeated it, louder. Kip joined them, lest he be even more different.\n“Good. Now, the abacus. Any of you here from Tyrea?”\n“No? Oh, the boy, of course,” she said as Kip raised his hand. She went\non, “Tyrea was, despite all evidence to the contrary, once the seat of a great\nempire, long before Lucidonius came. Perhaps it was crumbling by the time\nhe did come, or perhaps he hastened its demise. That is for another class.\nThe Tyrean Empire gave us a few gifts and a few curses. The only one I\ncare about for this class’s purposes is the base twelve number system. Tyrea\nis the reason our day is broken into twelve-hour halves, and sixty-minute\nhours. Some of you Aborneans and Tyreans may have been taught to use the\nbase twelve system in counting and in arithmetic. If so, this class will be\nmuch, much harder for you. That number system is unholy, and you will not\nuse it henceforth. Unholy? you ask. Yes, blasphemous. How can a number\nsystem be unholy? Well, how can a number system be based on twelves?\nWhat is our number system based on, anyone?”\n“Ten,” a girl in the front row said.\n“Correct. Why does ten make sense?”\nNo one answered. “Fingers,” Kip said, being a wiseass.\n“You think you’re joking, but even fools can be right.”\nKip scowled.\n“It’s true. Fingers and toes. So if fingers and toes are the easiest way for\nprimitives and morons to count”—she glanced at Kip—“especially before\nparchment or vellum or paper, how does a society count based on twelves?”\nKip scowled harder.\nA girl at the back raised her hand. Magister Hena called on her. “The\nTyrean gods had six fingers and toes.”\n“Exactly. That’s why you’ll hear stories of children who have six fingers\nand toes being venerated in certain superstitious corners of the world.\nYou’ve heard of such things, right, boy?”\n“It’s Kip, and no, I’ve never heard of any such thing.”\n“Well, then perhaps your parents were particularly enlightened for\nTyrea.

Or ignorant even of the ignorance, I suppose.”\nKip opened his mouth, then shut it. Don’t, Kip. It doesn’t matter. He\nsuddenly felt hungry.\nThe next hour was spent learning how to use an abacus. The four beads\non the bottom row were called the earthly beads, and the one bead on the\ntop row was the heavenly bead. And first they simply counted, up and\ndown, adding by ones, subtracting by ones. Then adding by twos and\nsubtracting by twos, then fives.\nSome of the students clearly were bored, having learned this long ago.\nOthers, like Kip, struggled to keep up with even basic arithmetic. But the\nchildren who did the worst were the few who had learned to use the abacus\non the base twelve system. They seemed frozen; everything they’d learned\nwas wrong.\nThe next lecture was better. It was Properties of Luxin, taught by a\nferret-faced Ilytian magister who leaned on his cane in between making\npoints. Kip was surprised to find that half of the auditors were non-drafters.\nAnd the non-drafters were all smart and driven. These were the future\narchitects and builders of the Seven Satrapies. Like the drafters, these boys\nand girls had their tuitions paid for by the satraps. Some were connected—\nsecond and third sons of nobles who had to be given some way to support\nthemselves. But even they had passed competency tests in order to be\naccepted.\nKip could tell right away that these children wouldn’t need any training\non the abacus.\nThe tutorials were pretty basic today, though. Sheets of blue luxin one\nfoot by one foot and one thumb thick were placed on supports, then weights\nadded to the center until they shattered. The same was done with green, and\nsuperchromat-drafted yellow.\nMagister Atagamo then had those students who were able to do so draft\ntheir own sheets of blue luxin. He tested each of those. They all failed at\nmuch lower weights—especially the boys’. “Later, I will have you\nmemorize the theoretical weakest blue luxin that will still hold a solid so\nthat you know the full range. For now, be aware that we are establishing\nmaximum strengths. The luxins we have to work with are superchromat-\ndrafted. Your own luxin will be weaker than this. Boys, yours will usually\nbe substantially so.”\nThen Magister Atagamo’s assistants put a cubit tub on a scale, showed\nhow it measured one foot per side, zeroed the scale, and filled it with water.\nKip noticed that all of the other students were writing everything down.\nThe weight of the water within that small tub was a seven, the basic unit\nof measuring weight. Of course, that was too big of a weight to be useful\nfor a lot of things, so it was broken into sevs: one-seventh fractions of a\nseven. Kip weighed twenty-nine sevs, or four sevens and one sev, usually\nexpressed as four sevens one.\nBut the magisters weren’t finished. They poured out the water and had\nthree superviolet drafters fill the tub with superviolet luxin. That was when"

That was when\nKip knew he was in real trouble—they were measuring everything! When\nthey unsealed the superviolet and it dissolved into feather-fine, nearly\ninvisible dust, they swept that out into a tiny cup and measured it.\nEverything that could be quantified was.\nFor a while, with the rest of the students, Kip simply wrote down the\nnumbers without knowing why. Then they asked them to add the weights of\nall the colors together. The students who were already proficient with their\nabacuses did so quickly. Kip barely got through adding the first two before\nthose students were finished.\nMagister Atagamo said, “Now, subtract the weight of the cube of green\nluxin from that total, and add the weight of a small woman, let’s say eleven\nsevs.”\nFour girls—non-drafters all—had the total practically as soon as the\nmagister was finished talking. Kip was aghast.\n“Excellent,” the magister said. “Now, a practical example. You’re a blue\ndrafter, manning the counterweights for the lift in one of the towers. One of\nthe counterweights breaks in half. It is made of iron, and weighs thirty sevs\nsix. How much blue luxin will you have to draft to replace the\ncounterweight? If your counterweight is more than three sevens heavier\nthan the original when combined with the weight of the delegation, the\npulley will break, killing everyone. When you have your answer, come\nshow it to me. For the sake of our example, we’ll pretend that the\ndelegation is coming from your home satrapy, and if you don’t have the lift\nready by the time they arrive, you will shame them and lose your\nsponsorship. So you have thirty minutes to get your solution. If you get the\nanswer quickly, you can leave, take the rest of the morning off. If you can’t,\nthere will be a mark against you for today. Go.”\nThe other students set to work immediately, and Kip saw that the easy\nanswer was impossible. He couldn’t just add full-size blocks of blue luxin\ntogether, because that would make the counterweight too heavy. The\narithmetic here was to find the exact fractional volume of blue luxin he\nwould need to make a new counterweight.\nThe best girls and boys were already working their abacus beads back\nand forth. Kip wasn’t good enough with the abacus. He’d never make it in\ntime. He didn’t know how to figure fractions. He could work the entire time\nand still not—Oh.\nGot nothing to lose, do you, tubby?\nKip scribbled something on his paper, stood up, and walked to the\nmagister’s desk.\nThe magister looked at him tolerantly, like he was a student who hadn’t\nunderstood the question and was about to ask for clarification. Kip held up\nthe paper.\nHe’d drawn a quick sleeve of blue luxin to go around the original\ncounterweight to hold the broken halves together.\n“You’re Guile’s by-blow, aren’t you?”\n“Yes, Magister.”\n“I can tell. Those boys cheated magnificently, too.”"

The rest of the class stopped working on hearing\n“cheated.” “You taught them, sir?”\nMagister Atagamo’s mouth twisted. He ignored the question. “You’ll\nhave to learn to use the abacus eventually, you know.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nThe old man snorted. “Goodbye, little Guile.”\n“So I pass?”\n“Highest marks of the day. And don’t ever do it again.”\nChapter 23\n“Give us privacy,” the White said.\nIronfist stood in the White’s chambers, atop the Prism’s Tower at the\ncenter of the Chromeria. The wheels of her chair were tall enough that she\ncould push on them directly to move around her room, which she insisted\non doing, despite the delicacy of her wrists.\n“My blanket, please,” she said.\nHe brought over her blanket—something she’d woven decades ago with\nher own hands. Like many who make their livelihood with their minds, she\nhad an outsized pride in the few things her hands had crafted. It was\nperhaps the only thing for which Ironfist could consider her a silly old lady.\nHe tucked the blanket around her legs and was surprised to feel how thin\nthose limbs had become.\n“You see?” she said. “You can tell, can’t you, Commander?”\nSilly old lady indeed. She’d set him up. Sharper than he was, still. It was\na good reminder, both ways. Weak physically, but not mentally. Not in the\nleast.\n“Tell what, my lady?”\n“Psh,” she said. A little eye roll. “It is a hard place, for those who are not\nprepared.” I’m dying, she was saying, prepare yourself so that when I do\nyou won’t fall prey to your enemies.\nIt was both terrifying to imagine a world without Orea Pullawr as the\nWhite, and warming to learn that she considered him a friend.\n“Tell me again, Commander, about your coming to Garriston, and the\npreparations for battle there.”\nSo he did, again. He tried to tell it differently, knowing that she was\nsifting his words, looking for something. He told her about the movement\nof troops, about how many men and drafters each side had, about the\ndisposition of the Ruthgari garrison that had been there. She’d been\ninterested in that, the first time. But now those were mere numbers to her.\nShe already had memorized them, and analyzed what they meant about the\nRuthgari commitment to Tyrea, and who had been bribed. Now she was\nlooking for something else.\nHe spoke for two hours. He told her about General Danavis coming\nalone—unmustached—to the Travertine Palace, and how Ironfist had been\nexpelled from the meeting. He spoke of Gavin moving the wagon that had\nblocked the gates, making the men help in doing what he could have done\nby himself, thereby somehow cementing them to his own cause.\nShe smiled at that, a small, knowing smile. Perhaps the smile of one\nleader approving of another’s nice play.\nHe wasn’t sure what she was looking for, though, and pretty certain that"

Perhaps the smile of one\nleader approving of another’s nice play.\nHe wasn’t sure what she was looking for, though, and pretty certain that\nhe wasn’t supposed to know.\n“You don’t gamble, do you, Commander?” she asked.\n“No, my lady.” How did she know that? He supposed it wasn’t the kind\nof thing that would be hard to find out, but that she had, that she cared about\nit, and that she recalled it was what made the White both alien and a little\nfrightening.\n“Always thought that was strange. You seem like the kind who would.”\n“I used to,” Ironfist admitted. “I had a bad experience.” He kept his face\neven. Equanimity was all a man could aspire to. Knowing what you had\ncontrol over, and what you didn’t. The Nuqaba had no place in his thoughts.\n“My husband used to play Nine Kings. He maintained that he was a\nmediocre player, though he rarely walked away from a table with much less\nthan he brought to it. He had a reputation as an amiable player who served\nfine liquor and excellent tobacco, though, so he played with all sorts of men\nfrom all over the Seven Satrapies. We were married three years—and I was\nonly beginning to really fall in love with him—before he got me to come to\none of his parties. It wasn’t the night he would have chosen for me to see.\n“A young lord came. Varigari family. From a line of fishermen before\nthey were raised in the Blood Wars. He came in, new and cocksure, and\nover the course of the night he went through a small fortune. The lords my\nhusband played with that night were wealthy, and decent men, not wolves.\nThey could see what was happening. They told the young Varigari to quit.\nHe refused. He won often enough that he kept hope, and I could see the\nresignation on their faces: he loses a small fortune, and perhaps it teaches\nhim a lesson, so be it. Dawn came, and he had nothing, and there was this\nmoment where he bet a small castle in order to stay in. I saw this look on\nhis face. It’s etched into my memory. Do you know what he was feeling?”\nIronfist could feel it right now, the memory was so hot and sharp.\n“Terror, but elation, too. There’s something potent in knowing that you have\npushed your life to one of its pivots. It is insanity.”\n“I glanced at my husband, unable to believe what I was seeing.\nEveryone else was looking at the young Varigari. My husband was looking\nat everyone else. And I realized a few things all at once.” She coughed into\nher handkerchief, then glanced at it. “Keep worrying I’m going to cough\nblood one of these times. Not yet, thank Orholam.”\nShe smiled to defuse his worries, and continued, “First, about the young\nman: the small fortune he’d lost was not a small fortune to him, and the\nsmall castle he’d bet was probably the last thing his family owned. To him\nthis wasn’t a lesson; this was ruin. Second, my husband was no mediocre\nplayer. He had the winning hand, and he had the wealth to risk playing it."

He had the winning hand, and he had the wealth to risk playing it.\nHe was an expert, but an expert who took pains to rarely win, because he’d\nfound something that was more valuable to him than winning small fortunes\nand becoming known as a great player of Nine Kings. What he was really\ndoing every time he played was taking the measure of those he played with.\nFinding not just their tells, but how they reacted to the whims of fate and\nfortune. Was this satrap greedy? Did this Color get so focused on one\nopponent that she ignored a true threat? Was this one smarter than anyone\nknew?”\nScary to think of the White paired up with a man as smart as she was.\nShe said no more.\n“And?” Ironfist asked.\n“And?” she asked.\n“There was a lesson in there somewhere,” Ironfist said.\n“Was there?” she said, but her eyes danced. “I’m so old.”\n“I know you too well to think your mind is just wandering.”\nShe smiled. “When the big bets are on the table, Commander, it’s good\nto know which character in that little drama you are.”\nProblem with being surrounded by brilliant people: they expect your\nmind to be as nimble as theirs. Ironfist had no idea what she was talking\nabout. He’d get there eventually, he always did, but he’d have to mull it\nover for a while. “If I may, my lady?”\n“Please.”\n“Did Lord Rathcore ever play against Luxlord Andross Guile?”\nShe chuckled. “I guess it depends what you mean. Nine Kings? Never.\nHe knew better. You don’t play against those to whom you can only lose.\nI’ve seen Andross play. He uses his stacks of gold like a bludgeon. There is\nno gracefully losing a little bit of gold to Andross. It’s win big or lose\nbigger against him. For my husband to play Andross was to lose a fortune\nor to lose the whole purpose of his games by exposing how skilled he was.”\n“And if I wasn’t asking about Nine Kings?” Ironfist asked. He had been,\nbut she obviously meant to tell him more.\nShe smiled, and he was glad that he served her. To be the commander of\nthe Blackguard was to stand ready to give your life for those you protected,\nregardless of your feelings. But for this woman, even frail and with few\ndays left, Ironfist would gladly trade his life. She said, “All I’ll say is this:\nAndross Guile isn’t the White, and it galls him deeply.”\nBut the White was chosen by lot. Orholam himself moved his will\nthrough that.\nBut if Andross Guile had thought being the White was a victory within\nhis grasp, maybe that was because it actually had been. Surely to corrupt the\nelection of a White was the work of a heretic—worse, an atheist. Ironfist\ncouldn’t comprehend it.\nThe further implication—that Lord Rathcore had stymied Andross Guile\nby instead getting his wife Orea selected—was almost worse. If the White’s\nelection had been tainted by the machinations of men, was it thereby void?\nHow could Orholam tolerate such a thing?"

Perhaps she\nhadn’t been involved, or hadn’t known, or hadn’t figured it out until many\nyears later. And then what would you do? Abdicate because there was some\nblight on your election that no one else had ever noticed and that even you\nhadn’t known about? Perhaps that would bring greater disrepute on the\nChromeria than simply to let it lie.\nBut it shook Ironfist’s faith. What had Gavin said on the ship? Some jest\nabout being chosen by Orholam—a jest that only made sense as a jest if you\ndidn’t believe Orholam really did choose.\nLord Rathcore had blocked Luxlord Guile from becoming the White, but\ncouldn’t block him from having his son made the Prism.\nIt almost took Ironfist’s breath away to think of it in such nakedly\npolitical terms. He was no naïf. He served these people. He knew that even\nthe greatest had their foibles. He knew they all had vast ambition. But\nsurely, surely some few things must be held holy.\nHe remembered again holding his mother’s bleeding body, screaming\nhis prayers to Orholam, praying until he thought heart and soul would burst.\nPraying that Orholam would see him, just for one moment of his life. Hear\nhim, just once. And his mother died.\n“Who won? That night. What happened?” he asked.\nShe was quiet for a moment. “My husband let the young man win. No\nmatter.” The White waved a frail hand, as if to shoo the example away.\n“Commander,” she said quietly, “I’ve upset you. I’m sorry. Let this be my\nabsolution: as important as it is for you to know what character you are in\nthis little drama, perhaps right now it is more important for you to know\nwhich character I am. I am the gambler, Commander, just waiting for\nOrholam’s eye to rise over the horizon and reveal the truth. I am the\ngambler, and I’ve bet the family castle, and I’m waiting for the cards to\nturn.”\n“There’s war coming, isn’t there?” Ironfist asked.\nShe sighed. “Yes, blind though the Spectrum is to it. But I wasn’t talking\nabout the war.”\nHe walked to the door, stopped. “What happened to that young man?”\n“He gambled again later with someone else and lost everything, as\ngamblers do.”\nChapter 24\n“Skill, Will, Source, and Movement. These are the necessaries for the\ncreation of luxin,” Magister Kadah was saying. She had a gift. A great gift.\nShe could make even magic seem boring.\nKip sat in the back of the lecture hall today, stomach growling, but\nabsolutely determined not to open his big yapper. Adrasteia sat in the seat\nnext to his, paying attention, and Ben-hadad was next to her, one yellow\nlens of his glasses continually swinging down in front of his eye, no matter\nhow he tried to keep it up.\nTogether, they took up one of the little wooden tables.

Sitting together,\nalmost like friends.\nIt wasn’t real, not yet. They didn’t know Kip. They let him sit with\nthem. It was different. But it was closer than Kip had felt to friendship in a\nlong time.\nHe looked over at Teia. She saw him looking and glanced over at him, a\nquestion in her eyes.\nAnd at exactly that moment, Magister Kadah looked up and caught\nthem. Rotten luck. “Kip, do you have something to share with the class?”\nshe asked.\nDon’t do it, Kip. No smart remarks.\nProblem was, he had no idea what the magister had been talking about,\nand his mind had drifted. “I was thinking about the instability of\nimperfectly crafted luxin,” Kip said. Magister Kadah had been talking about\nSkill, Kip thought, so it seemed like it might be close to a real question.\n“Hmm,” Magister Kadah said, as if disappointed she hadn’t caught Kip\nnapping. “Very well.” She ran long fingers along the edge of her stick,\nflipped it over. On the back side, there was a color spectrum. She\nconsidered it for a moment, rejected it, walked over to the wall.\nShe opened a panel on the wall. It was dazzlingly bright. The lightwell,\nKip realized. There was a slide with a mirror mounted on it, and she pushed\nthat into the light stream. A pure beam of white radiance shot across the\nroom onto a bare white wall behind the students.\n“This is light as it is. It is the keystone, the base on which all else is\nborn. And this is how we imagine light is—” She held up a screen over the\nlight stream. Brilliant colors were cast upon the wall, cerulean blue\nimmediately next to jade green abutting on vibrant yellow next to an orange\nto make fruit jealous next to a clear red.\n“These are the colors we draft—minus sub-red and superviolet, of\ncourse, which most of you can’t see. We’ll talk about them later. This is\nhow the colors are in a rainbow, right, discipulae?”\nThere were some mutters. The colors were in the right order.\n“Right, discipulae?” she repeated, irritated.\n“Yes, Magister,” most of the class answered.\n“Morons,” she said.\n“This is light in our world—” She held a prism in front of the stream,\nand it sheared the light into the whole visible spectrum. Unlike the screen,\nwhich had the most vibrant colors immediately next to each other, the\ncolors of the natural spectrum were broken into a continuum—but the\ncontinuum wasn’t even. Some colors took up more space than others.\n“In some ways, drafting is like anything else. If you sit in a poorly\ncrafted chair, it breaks and you fall. It fails its purpose. Poorly crafted luxin\nis the same. On the color line, there are resonance points. Seven points,\nseven colors, seven satrapies. This is as Orholam has willed.

        "text": "seven colors, seven satrapies. This is as Orholam has willed. At these\nresonance points”—she pointed to the places on the color line that\ncorresponded to the bright colors she had put on the screen earlier—“at\nthese places, luxin takes on a stable form. Becomes itself. Becomes useful.”\nShe pointed to places on the color line, in order. “Why, smarter auditors\nmight ask, why those colors?” Magister Kadah smiled unpleasantly. She did\nthat a lot.\nLikes making people feel stupid, doesn’t she?\nKip had noticed that the distances between the colors weren’t even.\nSome colors were wide bands—blue stretched over a huge area, and red,\ntoo, but yellow and orange were tiny.\n“Why does blue cover so much area? We might point to this”—she\npointed deeper in blue—“in our humanness, and call it violet. Why can’t we\ndraft violet? Anyone?”\nNo one said anything. Not even Kip.\n“It’s simple, and it’s a mystery. Because luxin doesn’t resonate there.\nYou can’t make a stable luxin from violet. It doesn’t work. Seven is the holy\nnumber. Seven points, seven colors, seven satrapies. Instead of demanding\nthat the mystery surrender itself to the hammer blows of our intellects, we\nalign ourselves with the mystery, and when we find perfect alignment with\nthe piece of his creation that Orholam has given us, we draft perfectly. This\nis what we strive for. When you’re not exactly in the center of his will, your\nblue will fall to dust, your red will fade, your yellow will shimmer away to\nnothingness. Those points, that perfection, that alignment with Orholam\nhimself is what we seek, every time we draft. And when we do it perfectly,\nwe become conduits of his will. This is what makes us better than the\ndullards out there, the munds, the norms, the non-drafters who only absorb\nlight rather than reflect it. This is why bichromes—those who can draft two\ncolors—are honored more highly than those who can draft only one.\nBichromes are closer to Orholam, they partake of more of his holy creation.\nEach color has lessons to teach us, lessons about what it is to be human, and\nlessons on what it is to be like Orholam.\n“And this, of course, is what makes the Prism so special. He is the only\nman on earth to commune perfectly with Orholam. He alone sees the world\nas it is. He alone is pure.” She stared directly at Kip, walked toward him.\n“And this is why we oppose any who would taint the Holy Prism’s light, or\nany who would dim his glory and bring shame upon him.”\nIt took Kip’s breath away. She hated him because she revered his father\nand Kip brought shame upon him?\nThe worst part of it was that it made sense. It wasn’t fair. He hadn’t\nchosen to be a bastard, but it did make sense.\n“Remember, Kip,” Magister Kadah said quietly, “you’re not\nuntouchable now.”\nWhat?\nBen-hadad raised his hand, rescuing Kip, and Magister Kadah called on\nhim."

I mean, what about the other resonances?”\nOther resonances?\n“I already said we’ll talk about sub-red and superviolet later.” The brief,\nugly look that passed across her face told him that she had hate enough in\nher for Ben-hadad as well. Here Kip had thought he was special.\n“Your pardon, Magister, but I didn’t mean those. I meant the secret\ncolors,” Ben-hadad said.\nTeia buried her face in her hands.\n“Friend of Kip’s, are you?” Magister Kadah asked.\n“What? No. I mean, not really.” Ben-hadad scowled as if that came out\nharsher than he meant. “I mean, I barely met him.”\n“Uh-huh,” Magister Kadah said. “This is one of the early lectures. It’s to\ncover basic topics. Yes, there are other, weaker resonances. Some believe,\nas I do, that the use of those resonances are examples of man forcing nature\nto do things Orholam never intended. Some even call those who use the\nunnatural colors heretics.”\nKip couldn’t help but glance at Teia. She was pale, but her jaw was set.\nMagister Kadah said, “The seven colors are in Orholam’s will. The\nseven are strong. This we know. If you want to have fifth-year debates, you\ncan wait until fifth year.”\nChapter 25\nKip caught up to Teia on the way to Blackguard practice. “What was that all\nabout?” he asked.\nShe didn’t answer immediately. Didn’t look at him.\nThey came to the lift and had to wait, and Kip thought she wasn’t going\nto answer him, that he’d somehow been rude without knowing it. He would\nhave started up a conversation about something else, but he couldn’t think\nof anything to say.\n“You know how you’re a superchromat?” she said quietly.\n“Freak,” he said. Though other than making him different, as far as he\nknew, it was a pure advantage, with no drawbacks. “And how did you\nknow?” She wasn’t in his engineering class.\n“Everyone knows everything about everyone here, Kip, especially about\nthe new kids, especially when the new kid has a grandfather who’s a\nColor… or a father who’s the Prism.”\nOh.\n“Anyway,” she said, setting her scarf on her head to pull back her hair,\nbut still not making eye contact. “I’m a subchromat. Color-blind. It happens\nas rarely for girls as superchromacy does for boys, so I’m as much of a\nfreak as you, but you’re a freak in a good way.”\n“But, but, how’s that work?”\n“Reds and greens look the same to me.

An older student took care of counterweights. They\ndidn’t let first-year students operate the lift. Too many fatalities, they said.\nNot reassuring.\n“So, while we’re trying to join the Blackguard, what is everyone else\ndoing?” Kip asked.\n“Work,” Teia said. “And after we’re done, there’s practicum until dinner.\nThen another work period every other day of the week. On alternating days,\nthey assign readings. Color theory, mechanics, drawing, religion,\narithmetic, hagiographies, politics, lives of the satraps, that sort of thing. It’s\na lot of work to maintain the Chromeria, and they say it’s good for us to\nknow what all of that work is, so that when we take over one day, we know\nit all.”\n“What other kinds of work are there?”\n“For dims? Mostly cleaning. Every floor, every window, every study\nmirror. If you’re unlucky or being punished, you get latrines or stables or\nkitchens. If the older students are busy, we help in the jobs that take more\nskill or are more physically demanding: lifting the counterweights and the\nwater, manning the great mirrors, carrying magisters’ books back to the\nlibraries. Later still, students who are rich or have good sponsorships are\nable to bring slaves to do their work for them. Or hire servants or poor\nstudents.”\nLike you, Kip realized. But not like me, not anymore. A Guile would\ndefinitely go into the rich category.\n“You should have some sponsors coming around soon, Kip. Just make\nsure you don’t sell out cheap. They’ll act like they’re your friend, but at the\nend of the day, they don’t care about you. They’re just scouts, and they get\npaid out of the difference between what the sponsor is willing to pay and\nwhat the drafter is willing to take.”\nThey emerged from the Prism’s Tower into the sunlight. Kip said, “But\nI’m not going to have to worry about a sponsor, am I? I mean, I thought my\nfather was going to pay for everything.”\nShe stopped dead. “What are you talking about?”\nKip raised an eyebrow, lifted his hands, befuddled. “I already told you\nI’m a Guile. I mean, a bastard, but my father has recognized me.”\nHer mouth dropped open. “You mean you don’t know? I thought that’s\nwhy you came and sat with the rejects today.”\n“What are you talking about?” Kip said. His throat felt suddenly tight.\n“Andross Guile disavowed you. And he’s the Red.

It was the best news he’d heard in weeks.\nChapter 26\nThe Third Eye was, Gavin thought, quite beautiful for an otherworldly\nmystic. Her light brown hair hung in dreadlocks, pulled back on top with a\nspiky sandalwood crown, points lacquered with gold leaf. A very artistic\nsun, perhaps? Light brown to go with her hair; she had to have some\nRuthgari blood in her for that. She wore a knee-length white dress, secured\nwith golden ropes, wrapped around her body ingeniously in order to cross\nover the body’s power centers in old pagan mysticism. Loose ends dangled\nfrom the last knot at her groin, the next crossed over her belly, the next\ncrossed between her breasts, the ends looped over her shoulders. Gold\nmakeup crossed her cheeks to her lips to suggest a knot there, and a few last\nstreaks suggested a knot at her third eye in the middle of her forehead. She\nwore a bracelet on each hand connected to rings on each finger—sort of a\nfingerless glove—gold, suggesting knots there. Her sandals, covered now in\nsand as she walked the beach, would doubtless be the same.\nSeven knots, or nine, depending on how you counted. It was a pagan\nparadox.\nHeresy, maybe, but what it reminded Gavin of most at the moment was\nthat he hadn’t had sex for far too long. The knots might be religious\nsymbolism, but the practical effect was that they pulled the dress tight\naround a fine-looking woman. He glanced at her breasts, briefly, then back\nto her face. Damn woman, not fighting fair.\nHe’d thought that she must have more gold paint on her forehead from\nhow it glinted in the rising sun, but as she came to stand before him with\nher motley bodyguard of ten men, Gavin saw that the Third Eye had the\nmost elaborate, remarkable tattoo he’d ever seen.\nThe third eye tattoo wasn’t merely exquisitely drawn, it glowed. She’d\ninfused yellow luxin into the tattoo: it caused the eye to emit golden light,\nmaking it even more reminiscent of Orholam’s Eye, the sun.\nHer own eyes declared her a yellow drafter, yellow near the halo, a\npretty brown beyond it. She was in her late thirties, trim, but curvaceous.\nGavin glanced at her breasts again. Dammit. He supposed after he\nfinished the harbor here, it would be good to go by the Chromeria. He\nneeded to go there anyway to make sure his orders were being followed and\nthe satrapies were preparing for war, but spending some quality time in bed\nwith his room slave Marissia would help him tolerate a few more weeks\nwith Karris Blue Balls.\nIf the Third Eye weren’t standing right there, Gavin would have drafted\nblue in order to give himself the cool rationality blue always brought.\nWait, no, I wouldn’t have. I can’t draft blue anymore."

Gavin’s throat tightened.\n“Greetings,” Gavin said. “Light be upon you.”\nThe Third Eye was staring at him intently, and Gavin could swear that\nthe tattoo was actually glowing brighter—not an impossible trick, but a\ngood one regardless. “You’re dying,” she said, her voice mellifluous.\n“You’re not supposed to be dying yet.”\nChapter 27\nThe Blackguard training went about how Kip expected: a lot of running\n(not very fast), a lot of jumping (not very high), a lot of punching in time\n(not very timely), a lot of push-ups and sit-ups (not a lot). The vomiting,\nhowever, was a surprise. Not a pleasant one.\nHe stood, bent over, by one of the chalk lines, his whole body hot and\ncold and flushed. He felt like he was going to die.\n“The good news is that this is as bad as it gets,” a familiar voice said.\nKip could barely lift his eyes from Ironfist’s shoes. He was purely\nfocused on breathing. In, out.\n“If you want it to stop, Kip, it can.”\nKip spat, trying to clear the acrid sludge from his mouth. It didn’t work.\nIt seemed to cling to every crack and crevice. “What?”\n“If you hate this. If you think it’s pointless, you can quit. In fact, I’ve\nbeen asked to cut you.”\n“Cut me?” Kip’s brain wasn’t working very well.\n“The Red is demanding that you be cut from the Blackguard. He cast\naspersions on whether you would have been selected if you weren’t… if the\nPrism hadn’t requested it.”\nWhich was, of course, true.\nSo Commander Ironfist was caught between what the Prism had asked\nhim to do and what the Red was demanding now—but Andross Guile was\nhere, and Gavin Guile wasn’t.\n“I guess my meeting with him went even worse than I thought, huh?”\nKip said.\n“You’re a couple years before you can play those games with these\npeople, Kip. Don’t worry why they’re doing what they’re doing. It probably\nhas nothing to do with you anyway. What you need to do is figure out you.\nDo you want to quit, or do you want to stay?”\nKip straightened up. Teia handed him a cup of water. She’d heard\neverything, but her eyes were a cipher. Kip’s arm felt wobbly even as he\nlifted the water to his lips. He swished. Spat it aside.\nHe was the worst person in the class. Of forty-nine people, he did the\nfewest push-ups. He ran the slowest. He finished last. He couldn’t do a\nsingle pull-up. If he stayed, he would probably vomit every day. Every\nweek, he would get his ass kicked more times than he could count. Every\nmonth, he’d get beat up in the testing, probably many times.\nIt wasn’t even a fair contest: his left hand was still injured, raw, tight,\npainful to fully open, agony to put pressure on."

And now his grandfather wanted to destroy him.\n“Am I even going to be able to stay at the Chromeria?” Kip asked. “If\nI’m not a Guile, I don’t have a sponsor, do I?”\nA brief, satisfied smile flickered over Ironfist’s face. “The funds had\nalready been transferred to your account. Your tuition is fully paid. And\nbelieve me, once the money goes in, the abacus jockeys over there don’t let\nit go out.”\nThe funds had already been transferred. Past tense. So Kip’s grandfather\nhad tried to go after them, but had been foiled. And the quick smile meant\nIronfist had done that—and was pleased to have stymied Andross Guile in\nthis one small thing.\n“But the situation is worse than that,” Ironfist said. “From here on out,\nit’s all you. You understand?”\nKip understood. Ironfist was being delicate because Teia was standing\nright there. He wouldn’t help Kip. Couldn’t stack the odds for him. If Kip\ngot in to the Blackguard, he’d have to get in on his own. It was impossible.\nAnd yet freeing. If Kip did this, he’d do it on his own. Not because of\nhis father, but on his own merit.\nSo, it comes to this: an easy life as a student who doesn’t even need a\nsponsor, or a terrifically hard life as the worst of the scrubs, and a slim\nchance to actually make it into the Blackguard on my own and be\nsomething.\n“Fuck ’em,” Kip said. “I’m staying.”\n“Good,” Ironfist said. A fierce pleasure filled his eyes. He took a deep\nbreath that expanded his giant chest and brought his massive shoulders\nproudly back. “Good. Now, five laps. Blackguards guard their tongues,\ntoo.” Suddenly he was back in command, sharp and stern and all\nprofessionalism.\n“F-five?”\nThe commander said, “Don’t make me repeat myself. Adrasteia, you,\ntoo. Partner runs, you run.”\nChapter 28\nThe next day, the girls in Blackguard scrubs class were split off from the\nboys and brought into another training area. As in many of the training\nareas, one wall was covered in weapons, but here the weapons were bows\nof various sorts, from short horse bows to the great yew longbows from\nCrater Lake, to the composite bows of Blood Forest that packed as much\npower as those yew bows into a much smaller frame. Crossbows of a dozen\nsorts completed the armory. There were numerous targets in the area where\nthe girls were walking.

As Adrasteia\nfollowed the other nine girls, she studied the women. Though their body\ntypes ranged from the squat thick Samite to the willowy Cordelia, they all\nhad something that Adrasteia wanted badly: they were confident, at ease in\ntheir bodies, with the world and their place in it. Somehow, that made even\nthe plain look luminous.\nNot sure what else to do, the girls lined up before their teachers.\nPetite, curvy Essel spoke. “There is a legend about warrior women of\nold on Seers Island. They were peerless archers, but—” She picked a bow\noff the wall, drew a practice arrow from a quiver over her shoulder, and\naimed between Adrasteia and Mina.\nAt first all Adrasteia felt was alarm. The target wasn’t very far away\nfrom her, and she had no idea what the Blackguards were trying to teach. It\ncould well be How to Take an Arrow and Keep Fighting.\n“Anyone see a problem?” Essel asked.\nAside from you pointing an arrow at me?\n“Your breast’s in the way,” Mina said. Teia felt a surge of jealousy—\nfirst, that Mina wasn’t fazed by having an arrow nearly pointed in her face,\ntoo, and had been able to answer, and second, that Mina had probably\nthought of it because she had breasts, too. Unlike Teia, whom Kip had\nthought was a boy.\nBut Essel had obviously been chosen to give this talk exactly for her\nlarge bosom. She grinned and took tension off the bowstring. “Ah, you’ve\ntrained with the bow?” she asked Mina.\nMina nodded, suddenly shy. “Yes, my lady. It was, um, fine until one\nday when I was thirteen and I near tore my…” She trailed off, blushing.\n“My father hadn’t thought to teach me to bind my chest. I think it made him\nfeel more awkward than me.”\n“Well, those warrior women of legend were called the Amazoi. Literally,\nthe Breastless, so perhaps you can think of their solution to the problem,”\nEssel said.\nEyebrows shot up, though at least a couple of the girls seemed to already\nknow the story.\n“Of course, they only actually cut off their right breast—or their left if\nthey were left-handed—and perhaps they didn’t make the flat women join\nthem. But the Breastless makes a better name than the Women Who Cut Off\nOne Breast, Sometimes, If Their Breasts Were Big Enough to Interfere with\nArchery.”\nThe girls giggled.\n“The story isn’t true, of course,” Essel said. “It endures, probably,\nbecause men are fascinated with breasts, and men are fascinated with\nwomen who don’t have to take their shit, and because women are fascinated\nwith women who don’t have to take men’s shit. I personally can’t imagine a\nwoman dumb enough to cut off what she could bind with a strip of cloth.”\nAgain, more grins.\n“Regardless, the bow is the symbol of the women of the Blackguard.\nThat much is known to all, but what follows is not to be shared with any"

Men think the bow is our\nsymbol because a bow is used to kill from distance, because women aren’t\nas strong as men. Some say the bow is a coward’s weapon. Some say as\nOrholam made women better at drafting, so men are better at fighting. They\nsay that because men are more muscular, in this, women should defer.”\nEssel stopped, and Teia and all the others waited, expecting her to say\nsomething withering. Instead, Essel shook her head slowly. “They may be\nright. Generally. Thing is, I don’t care. To be a Blackguard is to be the\nexception to the rules. Put me in a room with fifty men off the street, and\nI’m the best fighter there. Put me in a room with fifty soldiers from any\narmy in the world, and I’m the best fighter there. But if Commander Ironfist\nfell in battle, big as he is, most of the men in the Blackguard would still be\nable to carry him off the field. Alone. I couldn’t. Samite here, she could.\nI’ve seen her.”\nSo what’s the lesson? Teia wanted to ask. She could tell from the\nsidelong glances that the other girls were thinking the same thing.\n“The bow is our symbol because the bow represents the sacrifices we\nhave to make to be Blackguards—and the sacrifices we don’t have to make.\nYou could cut off your breast if you wanted to be an archer. Or you can bind\nit. Your choice. Both have their drawbacks. It’s an annoyance that none but\nthe fattest of men have to deal with. Fine. That’s how things are. I see it. I\naccept it. I deal with it. I don’t expect a man to consider the world as if he\nhad breasts—though a good leader might. Mina, if your father could have\nseen past his own embarrassment, he would have been able to give you\nsimple advice that would have spared you pain. He didn’t. That’s fine. We\nall have limitations, and we all see our own needs first.\n“There are things about combat that are harder for women, and there are\nsome few things that are easier. We’ll talk about those, and we’ll train you\nin what sacrifices you need to make and what you don’t. These sacrifices\nare not the fault of men, they are the fault of the bow. What it is to be a\nBlackguard, what it is to be an elite warrior, what it is to be a powerful\nwoman, is all the same: it is to stare unflinching at what is, and then move\nwhat is toward what you will.”\nSamite stepped forward. “Let’s be blunt and practical. The Blackguard\nwill make the minimum possible accommodation for any warrior. You have\nhorrible cramps during your moon blood? You can switch guard shifts\nwithout asking your commander. Men are not allowed to do that. But you\nwill make up the shifts you miss, and your sisters will expect you to be\nmore willing to switch with them when their turn comes.

In the barracks,\nwomen have a separate room—though the door between the rooms usually\nstays open. We have separate baths and toilets. But in the field, if your\ncommander says battlefield rules, you bathe and change and piss where the\nmen do, and anyone who gives you trouble gets punished severely. We’re\nnever allowed to have relations with other Blackguards, man or woman.\nYou want to get married, one of you retires first. You’re caught sleeping\ntogether, both of you are bounced out, ostracized, and fined equal to what\nreplacing you costs the Blackguard. You are to think of the men as your\nbrothers—your little brothers. You take care of them, they take care of you,\nbut they don’t get any say over your life. You spend your money and your\ntime off how you want. You drink as much as you want. You bed who you\nwant. Obviously, not all choices are equally wise, and sometimes the men\nget their roles as brothers confused and think they can tell you what to do in\nyour off time. We will stand together with you and correct them. Mostly,\nthey understand the rules and do their best.\n“Out in the world, things can be different. Where village toughs or\nbullies might try to start a fight with a Blackguard man for status—because\nwin or lose, a bully wins respect from his fellows simply for daring to fight\na Blackguard—that won’t happen to you. Even if a bully beats you, to his\nfellows, he’s only beat a woman. And if he loses, he loses everything. You\nmay, however, get groped or spit on or slighted. We’ll talk about how you\ndeal with that, and you’ll find there are no fiercer defenders than your\nbrothers.\n“There are privileges for the sacrifices we make, sometimes privileges in\ntheir own right, and sometimes privileges that merely negate the privileges\nof others. Essel, you want to share about the governor’s ball?”\nEssel grinned at the memory. “We escorted the White to a ball at the\nAtashian embassy—so the grounds are technically Atashian soil. The\nambassador thought that gave him rights. He liked me. In fact, I liked him. I\nwas on break and he found me. He kissed me—which wasn’t unpleasant,\nbut it was unprofessional. I felt it would reflect badly on the Blackguard if\nwe were found. So I told him so. He thought I was being coy. I told him I\nwasn’t. But he got aggressive. He kissed me again. I told him I wouldn’t\nwarn him a third time. He put his hands on me in a way I found\nobjectionable. So I broke his fingers. Most of them.”\nTeia didn’t know what impressed her the most: that Essel could break\nthe man’s fingers so easily, that she would dare to do so, or that she was so\nnonchalant about it.\nContinuing, Essel said, “When he recovered, he went to the White,\nfurious. Demanded redress. He told some ridiculous story. The White didn’t\neven ask for my side. She asked, ‘Essel, did you act improperly?’ I said no,"

She asked, ‘Essel, did you act improperly?’ I said no,\nand she told him that he was going to be lucky if she didn’t decide to have\nhim expelled from Big Jasper.”\nSamite said, “If anything, the Prism is even harsher with those who\ninterfere with us. We occupy an odd position. In some ways, we’re mere\nslaves who must be ready to die for those above us in an instant, deserving\nor not. In other ways, not even ambassadors, not even the Prism himself can\ninterfere with us.\n“Now,” Samite continued, “after Essel has just spent time warning you\nabout generalities and how they often don’t apply, I’m going to use some.\nBecause some generalities are true often enough that we have to worry\nabout them. So here’s one: men will physically fight for status. Women,\ngenerally, are more clever. The why of it doesn’t matter: learned, innate,\ncultural, who cares? You see the chest-bumping, the name-calling,\nperforming for their fellows, what they’re really doing is getting the juices\nflowing. That interval isn’t always long, but it’s long enough for men to\ntrigger the battle juice. That’s the terror or excitation that leads people to\nfight or run. It can be useful in small doses or debilitating in large ones. Any\nof you have brothers, or boys you’ve fought with?”\nSix of the ten raised their hands.\n“Have you ever had a fight with them—verbal or physical—and then\nthey leave and come back a little later, and they’re completely done fighting\nand you’re just fully getting into it? They look like they’ve been ambushed,\nbecause they’ve come completely off the mountain already, and you’ve just\ngotten to the top?”\n“Think of it like lovemaking,” Essel said. She was a bawdy one.\n“Breathe in a man’s ear and tell him to take his trousers off, and he’s ready\nto go before you draw your next breath. A woman’s body takes longer.”\nSome of the girls giggled nervously.\n“Men can switch on very, very fast. They also switch off from that battle\nreadiness very, very fast. Sure, they’ll be left trembling, sometimes puking\nfrom it, but it’s on and then it’s off. Women don’t do that. We peak slower.\nNow, maybe there are exceptions, maybe. But as fighters, we tend to think\nthat everyone reacts the way we do, because our own experience is all we\nhave. In this case, it’s not true for us. Men will be ready to fight, then\nfinished, within heartbeats. This is good and bad.\n“A man, deeply surprised, will have only his first instinctive response be\nas controlled and crisp as it is when he trains. Then that torrent of emotion\nis on him. We spend thousands of hours training that first instinctive\nresponse, and further, we train to control the torrent of emotion so that it\nraises us to a heightened level of awareness without making us stupid.”\n“So the positive, for us Archers: surprise me, and my first reaction will\nbe the same as my male counterpart’s.

I will be able to\nmake precision movements that a man cannot. But I won’t have the\nheightened strength or sensations until perhaps a minute later—often too\nlate.\n“Where a man needs to train to control that rush, we need to train to\nmake it closer. If we have to climb a mountain more slowly to get to the\nsame height to get all the positives, we need to start climbing sooner. That\nis, when I go into a situation that I know may be hazardous, I need to\nprepare myself. I need to start climbing. The men may joke to break the\ntension. Let them. I don’t join in. Maybe they think I’m humorless because\nI don’t. Fine. That’s a trade I’m willing to make.”\nTeia and the rest of the girls walked away from training that day\nsomewhat dazed, definitely overwhelmed. What Teia realized was that the\nwomen were deeply appealing because they were honest and powerful. And\nthose two things were wed inextricably together. They said, I am the best in\nthe world at what I do, and I cannot do everything. Those two statements,\nheld together, gave them the security to face any challenge. If her own\nstrengths couldn’t surmount an obstacle, her team’s strengths could—and\nshe was unembarrassed about asking for help where she needed it because\nshe knew that what she brought to the team would be equally valuable in\nsome other situation.\nThe Archers were uncompromising and unapologetic and yet in total\nbalance. They respected each other and they respected themselves. Some of\nthe Blackguards, Teia knew, had come from slave stock, others had come\nfrom noble blood. Some were blues, some were yellows or greens or reds.\nSome were bichromes, some were tall, some were skinny, some were as\nmuscular as Commander Ironfist. They were different from each other—but\nthe Blackguards looked at those differences and asked where they were\nuseful, not who they made better than whom. Being a Blackguard was the\ncentral fact of their identity. All else came behind that.\nFor a girl who was a slave and a color-blind drafter of a useless color,\nthat was like the impossible dream, dangled in front of her nose. She’d been\nordered to join the Blackguard by her owner, she’d been trained for it for\nyears at the direction of others and for the profit of others—but now she\nwanted it for herself, for her own reasons. And she wanted it with all her\nheart.\nChapter 29\nKip and Teia finished their laps—for Teia punching a boy who’d dismissed\nher as a ‘little girl,’ this time—and had no time to clean up before heading\nto practicum: drafting practice, Teia called it. She seemed to dread it. Kip\nwas looking forward to it—even if he was a sweaty, stinky mess.\nAs usual, Teia led the way.

The Red will not be\npleased.”\nAnd I care so much about his pleasure. “What does he want with me?”\nKip asked.\n“You’ve been summoned.”\n“What if I don’t want to go?” Kip asked.\nGrinwoody’s eyebrows tented. “You wish me to communicate your\nrefusal to the Red?” His belief that Kip was a buffoon was written all over\nhis face. The man clearly didn’t like him, and now that Kip had been\ndisavowed, he felt no need to hide it.\nIt made Kip want to dig in his heels and tell the man to go to hell.\n“Kip?” Teia said. She waited.\nKip looked over at her.\nTeia said, “Don’t be an idiot.”\nKip frowned. “Let’s go,” he told Grinwoody.\nHe followed the man up to Andross Guile’s room and found himself\ntrying to hold on to his anger, but getting more and more nervous.\nGrinwoody opened the door and gestured to the heavy blackout curtains.\nSo help me, if that old bastard hits me today, I’m hitting him back.\nKip was pretty certain that he would do no such thing, but it made him\nfeel better to think it.

Brain engaging two seconds late.\nSilence. Then: “Sit.”\n“On the ground?” Kip asked.\n“What are you, a monkey?”\n“More monster than monkey.

Besides, Kip didn’t have so much as a flint.\nWas it a drafting test to see if Kip could—\nMoron.

There was an enormous four-poster bed barely visible through the\ndoors in a second chamber, and of course the heavy velvet curtains\neverywhere. Ivory and marble sculptures sat on the mantel, on the\nharpsichord. Kip couldn’t pick a single style from all the art, but it all\nseemed very, very fine.\nThere were a number of chairs, divans, and tables. A clock with spinning\ngears and a swinging pendulum of the kind Kip had only heard of.\nLast, Kip looked at the man in front of him, expecting some horror.\nDespite the darkness, Andross Guile wore enormous dark spectacles. He’d\nbeen a big man, before age robbed him. His shoulders were still broad, but\nskinny. His hair, flat, desaturated violet in the lantern light, must be silvery\ngray, almost white. It was sparse, disheveled—befitting a man who lived\nwithout mirrors. His skin, too, was washed out, loose. Naturally darker than\nGavin’s, but bleached by age. His nose straight, deep wrinkles. There was\nan old scar along his neck up onto his jawline.\nHe had been a handsome man. Clearly a Guile.\n“You play Nine Kings?” Andross Guile asked.\n“My mother never had that kind of money,” Kip said. It was a card\ngame. The cards themselves were often worth their weight in gold.\n“But you know how to play.”\n“I’ve watched others.”\n“The deck lies before you,” Andross Guile said. “Let it not be said I’m\nnot fair: the first game will have no stakes.”\n“It will not be said,” Kip said. He picked up his deck, and was hit with\nanother reminder of how different of a world he’d stepped into. Depending\non the seriousness of the players, there were many different variants of Nine\nKings. There were more than seven hundred cards, from which each player\nconstructed his own deck. In villages like Rekton, soldiers passing through\nmight have a deck built by a small-town artist. The main requirement there\nwas that the cards should have no markings on the back side by which\nplayers could cheat and draw the card of their choice. Nobles would play\nwith cards made by artists and drafters together at one of the six branches of\nthe Card Guild. Those cards were beautifully drawn and lacquered with\nblue luxin, guaranteeing every one was uniform.\nThese weren’t those cards. Each card was electrum—a mixture of gold\nand silver. Parian cuneiform numbers denoted each strength and ability, and\neach was adorned with masterful art and signed. Some were inlaid with tiny\njewels. All were sealed with perfect crystalline yellow luxin. Jeweled\nknucklebones and ivory counters and stained glass sand clocks completed\nthe set.\nKip tried to ignore the treasure in his hands and awkwardly shuffled the\ncards.\n“How’d you cripple yourself?” Andross Guile asked.

The wood was still hot.”\n“ ‘Still hot’?”\n“Oh, I drafted the fire when I fought them.”\nAndross Guile mmed that.\nThey played, and Kip lost spectacularly, barely even recalling the rules.\nHe could hardly decipher the Parian numbers because he’d only just learned\nthem from seeing the Blackguard scrubs stand in order. Andross, on the\nother hand, played blind. His cards had small bumps and ridges on the face\nthat must have been code to tell him what the card was. It wasn’t cheating,\nand it wasn’t any advantage, but it told Kip that the makers of the cards\nwere making them specifically with Andross Guile in mind.\nNo wonder Kip hadn’t done any damage at all to Andross. The man was\nserious about his game.\nThe old man was expressionless, though. “Another.

Play to win.”\nKip took a deep breath and played better the second time, but still got\nmassacred. When his last knucklebone turned over to zero, Andross Guile\nsat back and folded his hands over his little paunch.\n“Today, you sat with a small group of young people who call themselves\nthe Rejects. Among them was a girl named Tiziri. It was observed that you\nmade no particular connection with her.”\nKip remembered her. She was the homely girl at the table. Big smile,\noverweight, birthmark across her face. “What are you going to do?” Kip\nasked.\n“Her parents sold six of their fifteen cattle to pay for her passage to the\nChromeria. She’s going home tomorrow. Because of you.”\n“What? Why? That doesn’t make any sense. That’s not fair!”\n“You lost,” Andross Guile said. “We’ll play again. Next time the stakes\nwill be higher.”\nChapter 30\n“And you,” the Third Eye said, turning to Karris, “The Wife. You’re not\nright either.”\n“Excuse me?” Karris said.\nGavin felt like he’d been kicked in the stomach, so it was nice to see\nKarris equally stunned.\nBut the Third Eye looked genuinely confused. “What are you here for,\nPrism?”\n“I have fifty thousand refugees in need of a home. If I put them\nanywhere else, they’ll either be held hostage to the politics of satrapies, or\nmassacred outright by the Color Prince.”\n“You plan to put them here?”\n“You’re the Seer.”\n“You’ll destroy the community we’ve built here,” she said.\n“You built a community to serve Orholam. Serve him by saving his\npeople.”"

Serve him by saving his\npeople.”\n“You don’t even know what you’re destroying,” she said.\n“Nor is it in me to care overmuch. When the emperor sends a ship to\nParia, he doesn’t concern himself with the comfort of the rats in the hold. If\nyou want to serve Orholam, start putting together food. ‘Faith without deeds\nis dust,’ is it not? Fifty thousand starving people are going to arrive in three\ndays.”\nThe men surrounding Gavin and Karris bristled. He shouldn’t have said\nit, but the sun was up and he needed every minute of daylight to finish the\nharbor before the fleet arrived. They would most likely have run out of food\ntoday. If he didn’t clear the coral and make a safe port, the ships would run\naground, the men and women and children die.\n“Are you a man or a god, Gavin Guile?” the Third Eye asked.\n“I’m busy,” Gavin said. “Join me or get out of the way, because I’m\ngoing to do what I will, and if you oppose me, I’ll do what I must.”\n“I don’t think I like you very much, Gavin Guile.”\n“In another time, I think you would. Now pardon me, but I’ve a harbor\nto build.”\n“Dinner,” the Third Eye said. “After the sun has set, of course. Join me\nfor dinner. You’ve given me much to think about, and I would like to return\nthe favor. Unless dining with a rat is beneath you?” She lifted a\nchallenging, cool eyebrow.\nA very palpable hit. “I would be… delighted,” Gavin said.\nHe walked down the beach, drawing in light. He stripped off his tunic. It\nwasn’t so warm yet that it was necessary, but he wanted the Third Eye and\nher men to see the waves of color flooding through his skin as he walked\naway. Yellow first, making his body glow golden. He threw a spout of\nyellow up into the air, and had it formed into a skimmer by the time it hit\nthe waves.\nKarris stepped onto the skimmer with him. “Not sure why you always\nput yourself in a position where you have to turn your back on armed men,”\nshe said.\n“All the world is armed,” Gavin said. “I’ve got to have my back to half\nof it.”\nShe grunted. “Which means I walk backwards a lot.”\nHe looked over at her. She was smirking.\n“You’re not mad at me?” he said. He thought he could have handled\nthings better.\n“You’re the Prism,” she said, making a gesture as she said “the Prism,”\nas if the words themselves sparkled. “How can I be mad at the Prism?”\nHe laughed. He spent his whole life with women, and he still didn’t\nunderstand them. “No, really,” he said.\nShe joined him on the oars. “I don’t know what your ultimate objective\nis with Tyrea’s refugees.

You really are doing this to save people who right now don’t\nhave anything to give you in return. People who are terribly inconvenient.\nPeople you could ignore. You’re not ignoring them. That’s—that’s a good\nthing. I don’t need to take that away from you.”\nSo there’s something in you that wants to take it away from me, though.\n“Thank you,” Gavin said. He meant it, but his heart ached, too.\nOne year. Maybe it’s a good thing I’ve only got one year left. I don’t\nthink I could take this for another five.\nThey worked, and gradually the pain faded. Gavin drafted the great\nposts that would support the seawalls. There was more blasting to clear the\nsea floor and dig deep enough to give the posts a solid foundation, but it\nwas mostly brute drafting. Layers of yellow for strength and green for\nflexibility. He would have loved to use blue, but he thought this would\nwork.\nBy night, they’d finished all the posts. Tomorrow, the seawalls. The next\nday finishing touches and double-checking that everything was working the\nway he’d intended. Then he could get the hell out of here.\nThey rowed to shore after sunset. Gavin was thinking that after today’s\nlabors, he should probably bathe before meeting for dinner with the Seer.\n“Are you going to bed her?” Karris asked.\nGavin coughed. “What?”\n“Is that a ‘yes,’ or a ‘yes if the opportunity presents itself’?”\nGavin flushed, but had no words.\nKarris turned away first, though. The muscles in her jaw jumped,\nrelaxed. “I’m sorry, Lord Prism. Inappropriate question. I apologize.”\nWell, that takes that off the table.\nI can’t bed you, but I sure as hell better not bed anyone else, huh?\nPerfect.\nThe Third Eye greeted him at the beach, her walk an aristeia of\ncorporeal grace, sensuous, sinuous, suggestive without seeming practiced.\nStanding, she was striking. In motion, she was a woman for whom the\nworld reveled that Orholam had given bodies to his creation, that he had\ngiven light that man might see beauty. She was smiling, lips full and red\nand inviting, eyes bright and large. She was made up exquisitely and\nwearing a white gown so thin that he could see the dark circles of her\nnipples through it.\nJust. Fucking. Perfect.\nChapter 31\nKip went back to the barracks dismayed. He didn’t know what to do. If he\ntold the Rejects that he was responsible for getting Tiziri sent home, they\nmight turn on him, afraid that they would be next. And it was a rational fear,\ntoo.\nWhat else could higher stakes next time mean? Kip had no money. All\nthat could mean was that Andross would send home someone closer to Kip\n—or do something even worse.\nThe barracks was empty, though. Evidently the other students weren’t\nback from practicum yet. Kip walked toward his own pallet at the back,\ndouble-checking that no one else was present.

He dug under the\nblankets.\nHe heaved a deep sigh. The dagger was still there.\nCovering it back up, he closed the box carefully, making sure nothing\nlooked different than it had before. Then he went to bed.\nHe slept, dreamlessly for once. He woke amid excitement the next\nmorning. Students were chattering with each other, making no attempt to be\nquiet for those who were still in bed—though Kip realized as he sat up that\nhe was the only one still in bed.\n“What’s going on?” he asked, voice scratchy from his long sleep.\n“It’s Sponsor Day,” a boy said a few beds down. “No lectures or\npracticum today. We all meet with our sponsors.”\nKip shuffled to the communal bathroom and washed, gargled with salt\nwater, and ran a comb through his hair a few times until it had something\napproximating order.\nHe walked downstairs alone and went to the dining hall. It was still\nserving food—much finer food than normal, he noticed—but there were\nfew students. Those who were present were sitting with adults. One or two\nof the adults might have been older siblings, or parents.\nIt felt like a fist in the middle of his chest. Kip stood with his tray,\nlooking for a place. It didn’t matter where he sat, he was going to be alone.\nMother dead. Grandfather disavowed him. Father gone, as he’d been gone\nKip’s whole life.\nHe sat, alone. Ate, alone. He forced himself not to hurry, some part of\nhim not quite enjoying the pain, but reveling in it nonetheless.\nThese are the hammerfalls that shape a man. And he accepted the blows.\nSo be it.\nHe finished and went to the library. The librarian, a surprisingly\nattractive woman, perhaps a weak yellow from her eyes, said, “I’m afraid\nall our private meeting rooms have been taken by sponsors already, young\nman.”\n“I don’t need a room. I need books. On strategies for Nine Kings.”\n“Ah.” Her face lit up. “I think we can help you.”\nRea Siluz was the fourth undersecretary. Usually worked the late shifts.\nBefore Kip would be allowed to even view the books, he had to sign a\ncontract swearing not to bring fire or to draft red luxin in the library. That\ndone, she seated him at a desk on the shade side of the library, though of\ncourse there was plenty of artificial light from yellow lanterns throughout\nthe space. Then she brought him half a dozen books.\n“You play much?” Rea asked.\n“Only twice. Lost both times, badly.”\nShe laughed quietly. Her dark hair, tightly curled, was massed in a huge,\ncareful halo around her head, setting off a narrow face, full lips. “Most\npeople lose the first twenty times they play.”\nUgh. “That’s not an option for me,” Kip said. “Where should I start?”\n“Read these two first, and then study this one. This one has all the cards\ncopied out, so you can refer to it when you don’t understand. The sooner\nyou memorize them, the better you’ll be.”"

The sooner\nyou memorize them, the better you’ll be.”\nOh, boy. Kip settled in.\nHe read for twelve hours. When he went to the toilet once, as he was\ncoming back, he saw a man hovering over his table, writing down the titles\nof the books piled there. He saw Kip coming and disappeared. Kip thought\nbriefly of chasing him, but realized that he didn’t know what he would do if\nhe caught the man.\nGreat, so they’re spying on what I read. Kip didn’t know who “they”\nwere, but he figured it didn’t matter too much.\nWhen he got up to get a late dinner, he went to Rea’s desk. “Can I come\nback after I eat?”\n“You haven’t eaten yet?” She looked tired from working two shifts.\n“No, but I’m starving now.”\n“I’m sorry, then, but the library is closing in a few minutes.”\nKip looked at the students, who seemed to be giving no indication of\nleaving anytime soon, and gestured helplessly.\n“Those are third- and fourth-years, Kip. Higher years and Blackguard\ntrainees get to study whenever and wherever they want. With so many other\nduties, some of them don’t even get here until midnight. First-years aren’t\ntrusted that much. You can only be here when librarians are.”\nSo Kip studied for a few more minutes. When he finally left to go to\nbed, he was stopped in the hall by Grinwoody. The man grinned wolfishly\nat him.\nKip hadn’t learned enough. There was no way he could win.\nAndross Guile’s chambers were exactly like before, and when Kip sat,\nthere was a superviolet lantern and a deck of cards. Kip looked through his\nown cards. The twelve hours had done him no good at all.\n“What are the stakes?” he asked.\n“Higher, I told you.” Andross Guile said nothing else. He played his first\ncard, setting the scene.\nKip played. He played one of his good cards too early—which he only\nrealized at the end of the game—and got slaughtered. He would have lost\nregardless, but it was the first time he caught a glimpse of something\nbeyond his own helplessness.\n“So what are you going to do to me this time?” he asked.\n“Pathetic. Not a drop of Guile blood in you, whinger. You don’t have to\nlose. You are losing because you choose to lose.”\n“Right, I’m choosing to lose. Because it’s so fun.”\n“Sarcasm is the sanctum of the stupid. Stop it. The stakes this time were\nthe privilege of eating tomorrow. Tomorrow, you fast. Maybe it will focus\nyour mind. Now, another game.”\n“What are the stakes?” Kip asked, stubborn. It told him how little\nAndross Guile thought of him, though, that he thought not eating was a\ngreater loss to Kip than a girl being sent home and losing everything she’d\nworked for.\n“Higher.” Andross Guile began to shuffle his cards.\n“No,” Kip said. “I don’t trust you.

I’m not playing until you tell the stakes.”\nA thin smile curved Andross Guile’s lips. “Practicum,” he said. “You\nlose this time, you lose your practicum.”\n“I lose that every time you make me come up here,” Kip said.\n“Permanently,” Andross Guile said.\nLosing the right to go to practicum meant losing the one place where\nKip could learn to draft in any sort of organized way. “Can you even do\nthat?”\n“There is very little I cannot do.”\nIf Kip couldn’t learn to draft properly, he had no future. “That’s not\nfair,” he said. He knew he’d lose.\n“I have very little interest in fair. Guiles are interested in victory, not\nsportsmanship.”\n“And if I refuse to play?”\n“I’ll have you expelled.”\nYou asshole. “What do I win if I win?” Kip asked.\n“I’ll send that bully Elio home.”\n“I don’t care to send him home.”\n“Maybe you should,” Andross Guile said.\nWhat was that? A warning?\n“I hate you,” Kip said.\n“Breaks my heart,” Andross Guile said. “Draw.”\nKip drew. He recognized his opening hand as spectacular. He’d seen this\nhand in one of the books.\nBut three rounds in, he lost it. Got befuddled, didn’t move before his\ntimer ran out. He didn’t know how to use even a great hand correctly.\nAndross Guile had obviously drawn a terrible hand—but he survived the\ndamage Kip was able to do in the early rounds, and then demolished him.\nKip turned over his last counter as he lost, and said, “So what am I\nsupposed to do while everyone else goes to practicum?”\n“What do I care?” Andross Guile said. “Figure out other ways to be a\nfailure and a disappointment. By the time my son gets back, he’ll be ready\nto relinquish this.” He gestured toward Kip, as if he were a cockroach to be\nswept away.\n“You’re old,” Kip said. “How long before you die?”\nThe Red grinned a feral grin. “So, there’s a little bastard in the little\nbastard. Good. Now get out.”\nChapter 32\nAdrasteia was a slave, not a victim. She had crossed the Lily’s Stem, the\nbridge between the Chromeria and Big Jasper, before the sun had come up.\nToday was Sponsor Day. That meant no lectures, though the Blackguard\nwould still practice. The Blackguard was too important to take days off.\nEvery student was supposed to meet with her sponsor today, and slaves\nwere no different from anyone else in this.\nThe difference was that Adrasteia’s sponsor never met with her. Instead,\nshe gave Teia secret little jobs to do on Sponsor Day. Lady Lucretia\nVerangheti was not an easy mistress.\nThe vendors in the market were setting up their tents and stalls, laying\nout carpets, prodding their burros to try to get loads of produce or fish into\nposition.

There was a constant stream of people, but with the dawn it would\nbecome a flood as house slaves and wives attended to the daily shopping to\nfeed their households. Adrasteia slipped through the mass of people as if\nshe had somewhere to be. She kicked loose one of the laces of her boots\nand stopped by a wall, knelt on one knee, and pulled her skirt up enough to\ntie the lace.\nShe pulled the package out from its space between two bricks, slipped it\ninto her boot, and went on her way. She took a few twisting alleys to make\nsure she hadn’t been followed—not that she’d ever been followed, but it\nwas part of her orders—and finally found a place between two taller\nbuildings. She pulled the package from her boot, then unrolled the letter.\nLady Verangheti rarely wrote words. She didn’t want to leave her own\nhandwriting to tie her to the crimes she made Adrasteia commit, and she\ndidn’t like trusting slaves or scribes with any more than she had to.\nIt didn’t matter. Adrasteia knew what was expected.\nThere was an uncannily accurate drawing of a man—Lady Verangheti\ncould have been quite an artist if she hadn’t thought it beneath her. The next\npage of impossibly thin rice paper had a drawing of a snuff box, inlaid with\na family crest: Herons Rising over a Crescent Moon.\nFrom doing this before, Teia knew she was supposed to steal the snuff\nbox, before tomorrow morning.\nAdrasteia was a slave, not a fool: she knew that half the time, the\nvictims were men or women working for Lucretia Verangheti. She’d been\ncaught before, back home.\nBut she never knew which marks were real and which were decoys. It\nmade sense, she supposed. Training worked best if failure was possible, but\nnot catastrophic. If your trainee failed once and then was useless, you’d lose\nall the time you’d put into training her. If you weren’t willing for your\ntrainee to ever fail, then you wouldn’t stretch her skills, you wouldn’t teach\nher where the line was.\nBut Teia didn’t know which was which. It didn’t matter that much,\nhonestly. She couldn’t treat any of them like they were decoys. The\ndifference being that if she were caught thieving from one of Lucretia’s\nmen, she’d be thrashed, and if she were caught stealing from anyone else,\nshe’d be thrown out of the Blackguard and the Chromeria and put in jail.\nAnd of course, her father was counting on her. Things went well for the\nfather of a slave doing excellent work. The other half of the statement didn’t\neven have to be breathed. A slave knew. Her father was a free man; she\nhadn’t lied to Kip about that part. But that didn’t mean that Lady Verangheti\ndidn’t have power over what happened to him and his debts.\nSo Teia studied the portrait, memorizing the man’s features. Landed\nnoble, most likely, from the clothes. Balding, short-cropped hair, wide nose,\nfat necklaces, wide cloak, sword belt, wide sleeves, leather gloves."

        "text": "noble, most likely, from the clothes. Balding, short-cropped hair, wide nose,\nfat necklaces, wide cloak, sword belt, wide sleeves, leather gloves.\nDressed like that, Teia wouldn’t be surprised if he traveled with a\nbodyguard. She glanced down the alley both ways. Saw no one. She folded\nup the rice paper. The corners had red and yellow luxin under a thin layer of\nwax. She rubbed them together, scraping away the wax, and the paper\nignited and burned up in a flash. Teia blew away the dust and headed back\ntoward the market.\nLike every other intersection in the city, each entrance to the market was\nstraddled by arches that supported one of the city’s Thousand Stars. Though\nthey were primarily intended to extend the power of drafters, in between the\ndrafters’ uses each district could employ the great elevated mirrors for\nwhatever they chose.\nThis market had rented out its stars to whatever merchant paid the most.\nSo some focused beams of sunlight on particular shops. Others had colored\nfilters fixed over them and focused on luxin jugglers who wandered the\nmarket, doing tricks and promoting one shop or another. Adrasteia made her\nway to the base of one of the stars, unlocked the tiny door with a key,\nclosed and locked the door behind her, and crawled up the painfully narrow\nshaft. She had an arrangement with the tower monkeys, the slaves who kept\nthis arch. As long as she didn’t get in their way or do any damage, they let\nher use one of the ventilation windows partway up as a lookout.\nShe opened her bag as she waited. Ordinarily, she hated her flat, lifeless\nhair, but this was why she kept it cut short. With a few clips, she was able to\nfasten a wig to her head with no problem: this time, long, wavy Atashian.\nBound it with a red handkerchief. She fished about twenty bracelets out of\nthe bag. Gaudy, flashy—anything to take attention off her face. She put\nrouge on her cheeks and lips, and folded her other handkerchiefs. She\ntucked her shawl into the bag, loosened some ties on her dress, and pulled it\ndown—when she left the arch, she would put on tall shoes that would\ndisguise her height, and the hemline needed to hang low enough to disguise\nthe shoes. She pulled on a bodice and cinched it loosely around her ribs and\nstuffed the folded handkerchiefs into the bodice to give the appearance that\nher breasts were larger than mosquito bites.\nAlmost everything she hated about her body made her good at this work,\nshe knew. It was doubtless part of why she had been chosen. Not too short,\nnot too tall, skinny—that was easier to disguise with clothes than fat was—\nfacial features pleasant, but not so pretty as to stand out from a line of other\ngirls. As much as Kip had peeved her for saying it aloud, she could—and\nhad—even disguised herself as a boy.\nWhen she was finished today, though, she thought she probably looked\nlike a woman. Lower-class Atashian wife, mid-twenties, tallish, bad taste,\none tooth blackened with a mixture of ash and tallow. Which tasted awful.\nThe disguise wasn’t flawless, but Adrasteia wasn’t trying for perfection."

Which tasted awful.\nThe disguise wasn’t flawless, but Adrasteia wasn’t trying for perfection.\nThe best thing about this disguise was that if she were pursued, she could\ntake it all off in a couple of seconds.\nFinished changing, she waited. Finding one nobleman among the human\nstockyards of Big Jasper would have been impossible on her own, much\nless stealing a particular item within that same day. But Adrasteia wasn’t\nrequired to find her target. He would come to her, and he would come\nmarked.\nShe waited for an hour, dilating her eyes every minute. Her vision, as\nshe’d told Kip, was alternately average, incredible, and terrible, with no\nlogic behind which was which that she could divine. Superviolet didn’t\nregister at all, her perception of violet, purple, and blue was merely average,\ngreen possibly average, yellow average, and then red indistinguishable from\ngreen. But then, below the spectrum that was visible to mundanes and many\ndrafters, her sight sharpened. She couldn’t draft sub-red, but she could see it\nbetter than most sub-red drafters. Teia barely had to consciously dilate her\neyes to see it; as long as she was relaxed it was as easy to her as going from\nfocusing on something near to something far.\nBut when she did dilate her eyes, she saw something altogether\ndifferent. Below sub-red, below sub-red as far as sub-red was below the\nvisible spectrum, farther, was her color—if color it was. The books called it\nparyl. Paryl was pure and beautiful and mostly useless. It was so fine it\ncouldn’t hold anything. So fine the few books she’d ever found that tried to\nmake some translation of paryl called it spidersilk.\nExcept, of course, spiders could hang from their webs. Teia knew better\nthan to try that with her color.\nShe was starting to get nervous about the mirror slaves’ shift changing.\nThey didn’t mind her being in their tower, but they couldn’t get out while\nshe was inside. And the moment when she left the tower in her disguise was\nthe most vulnerable time of her day. She’d dilated her eyes all the way to\nparyl when something flickered at the corner of her vision.\nA wisp of paryl smoke swirled and disappeared over the crowd, a\nhundred paces away.\nNo one noticed it, of course. No one could notice it. Teia hadn’t even\nmet anyone who could see paryl, much less draft it.\nIt had to be her target. That was how her targets came marked: wisps of\nparyl in their hair or on top of their hat, burning like flameless fires. It made\na perfect beacon, invisible to anyone but Teia. But she’d never seen her\ncounterpart; the man or woman who marked Teia’s targets for her had\nalways kept well out of sight.\nTeia watched, looked everywhere. There! A beacon, passing below the\nfoot of her tower. She couldn’t quite get the angle to see her target, but this\nwas going to be easier than usual.\nShe slid down the ladder with her bag slung over her back.

At the\nbottom, she pulled out the tall shoes, put them on, put her bag over one\nshoulder, and made sure that the straps hadn’t displaced her “breasts.” She\nbreathed deeply. Confident but not aggressive, Teia. No, not even confident.\nJust busy. Enough sway to make it look like I have hips, but not so much\nthat I look like a prostitute. Checking her wig one last time, she exhaled,\nopened the door, stepped out, and closed it unhurriedly behind her.\nThe foot of the arch here was right next to the side of a building, so she\nwas able to step into a narrow side street quickly. She scanned the crowd\nonce she got away from the arch, and relaxed her eyes briefly. It was as\nimportant for her to look for people who had noticed her stepping out of the\narch as it was for her to find her target.\nShe found the beacon in seconds. But it wasn’t on her target. It was in a\nwoman’s hair, and it was knotted, tight. Not loose and fiery.\nTeia knew it was a bad decision, but she followed the woman\nimmediately.\nIf what Teia had seen was this woman being marked, the other paryl\ndrafter might be here.\nBut rather than pure excitement, Teia felt that she’d stepped into\nsomething dangerous. Whoever had marked this woman didn’t know that\nanyone else could see her. It was like stumbling across a secret message and\nopening it. Whoever had sent the message wouldn’t be pleased to have their\ncorrespondence read—even if the words meant nothing to Teia.\nThere were powerful undercurrents in this city, and a slave could get\nsucked down into the weakest of them. It was a rare morning on Big Jasper\nthat the Cerulean Sea didn’t carry away at least one body.\nTeia kept her eyes open, but didn’t draft. Any drafting would alert the\nother paryl to her presence. The woman was perhaps fifty paces ahead of\nher, and not in any particular hurry, browsing the stalls, moving deeper into\nthe market. Her very lack of haste made it almost impossible to find the\nother drafter. If she were heading somewhere, the number of possible\nfollowers would be limited to the people who were heading in the same\ndirection and at roughly the same speed.

She sort of surprised herself. She wouldn’t\nbe so rude in real life, but wearing a disguise was strangely freeing.\n“Very well,” the merchant said, giving her a false smile. He turned away\nand cursed her under his breath, none too quietly.\nShe had more important things to worry about, but it made her blush\nnonetheless. What an—\nShe almost missed it. A quick pulse emanating from near the fountain.\nShe looked for the source, but couldn’t narrow it down between three men\nstanding there, all of them looking toward the pretty woman.\nTeia knew that pulse. She’d used it herself. It was, in fact, the only\nreason she had a chance at getting in the Blackguard. The special thing\nabout paryl that no other color could do was that it went right through\nclothing. With paryl, you could see exactly where anything metal was on a\nperson’s body. If they wore mail concealed beneath a tunic, or had a\nconcealed dagger strapped to their thigh, it wasn’t concealed to Teia. That,\nand marking things with beacons no one else could see, seemed to be the\nonly practical uses of the color that Teia had found. One book had\ndiscounted it from being a true color at all for that very reason, calling paryl\n“singularly ephemeral, and singularly useless.”\nIt was easy to get tunnel vision when hunting, and Teia’s fighting\nmasters back in Odess had beaten her for it a number of times. So she tried\nto breathe deeply and be aware of her surroundings. That intense focus\ncould give you away or cause you to make mistakes.\nAnd just in time, too.\nGlancing up and down the main street of the market, through the swirl\nof humanity—traders from every satrapy, slaves, luxiats, beggars, and\nnobles—Teia saw the last thing she wanted to see. Her own target—her\ntarget for Lucretia Verangheti—was walking straight toward her. Worse, the\ndirection he was going would take him straight in front of the other paryl\ndrafter. Her target had the familiar paryl beacon woven into his hair. If he\nwalked down the street with that intact, the other paryl drafter couldn’t miss\nhim. And that might set him hunting Teia.\nTeia was moving before she was sure what she was going to do. If she\nhad one flaw, it wasn’t passivity.\nShe shot out a pulse of superfine light herself, making it as brief as\npossible. A couple of the best things about paryl were that it could be\ndrafted faster than any other color and it was everywhere, even on the\ncloudiest day, so there was rarely any problem finding a source. It was\npresent weakly even at night, so long as you were outside.

She crossed the street. At the last\nmoment, to make it convincing that her running into the target was\naccidental, she glanced back.\nMistake. She saw one of the men by the fountain—slight, plain, a fringe\nof red hair around a bald spot, tradesman’s clothes—bring his hands\ntogether in front of him. A needle of paryl luxin leapt from his hands and\nstuck into the side of the neck of the woman he was watching, twenty paces\naway. It was an amazing shot through the press of massed bodies and\npassing carts. It hung in the air, anchored on one side to his hands and on\nthe other to her neck. He was bent forward in concentration.\nA passing pedestrian walked through the spidersilk thread and snapped\nit, but the man was unperturbed. He released the paryl and walked away\nwithout a second glance.\nTeia caught a glimpse of the woman, frowning and rubbing her neck for\na moment, then going back to looking at a melon in the cart before her.\nThen someone collided with Teia. She would have gone sprawling, but a\nstrong hand snatched her arm.\n“Watch yourself there, sweetcheeks,” her target said. He cupped her butt\nand gave it a squeeze as he helped her regain her balance.\n“Oh—I—” Teia didn’t have to feign her confusion. It took a little more\neffort to regain her balance with her tall shoes, and a little more effort than\nthat to regain her mental balance.\n“I’ll be at the Red Six Inn later, if you’re looking for some\nentertainment, gorgeous,” the man said. His hand was still on her butt.\nShe swatted his hand away. “No, thank you, my lord. Excuse me.”\nHe laughed and didn’t try again. “Think about it,” he said. “I’ll show\nyou a better night than your husband ever could.”\nShe ducked her head shyly and walked away, feeling violated. She\nswore she could still feel his hand on her. She wanted to punch him in his\ngrinning face for groping her.\nInstead, she contented herself with dropping the snuff box into her bag.\nHe’d caught her off guard, but Teia had recovered quickly.\nShe turned as he walked on and, drafting, snatched the beacon off his\nhead.

She staggered and suddenly fell.\nA couple of people grinned and chuckled. But the woman didn’t get up.\nShe started having a seizure. Apoplexy. A stroke.\nThe smiles disappeared, and people began running toward her.\n“Someone, help! Chirurgeons!” a bystander shouted.\nDread shot through Teia. Orholam have mercy, what had she just seen?\nChapter 33\nThe great hall of the Chromeria was converted every week into a place of\nworship. Every student, drafter or not, was required to attend. Kip shuffled\ninto his place in the pew between Ben-hadad and Teia. Ben-hadad was\nflicking down the colored lenses of his odd spectacles, staring from the\nwhite marble of the arches to the many-colored stained glass panels of the\nclerestory.\nKip was too absorbed in what was happening on the floor to even begin\nto parse the scenes depicted above them in the stained glass. “So what do\nwe do?” he asked.\n“Mmm?” Ben-hadad asked.\n“We listen,” Teia said. Her tone was short, withdrawn, unusual for her.\n“It’s the second week of the cycle, so I think the Blue himself will be\nspeaking.”\n“Oh no,” Ben-hadad said. “He’s the worst. I heard from one of the glims\nthat last year Gavin Guile preached on the Blue day and that he was\namazing. But what’s-his-name is awful.”\n“Klytos Blue,” Kip said. He felt a weight of dread. His target.\n“He tries to be scholarly because he thinks that’s how blues are\nsupposed to be, but I’ve heard the real scholars mocking him.”\nKip didn’t care, though he hoped he could dislike the man he had sworn\nto destroy. It would be his first chance to see Klytos Blue in person. He\nfound that his heart was pounding.\nThe great hall slowly filled, with a big rush of people coming in at the\nlast minute before noon. Even as the people were still entering, a low choral\nchant rose from a pit hidden near the front. “What’s that?” Kip whispered.\n“The sub-reds’ men’s choir,” Ben-hadad said, still staring up at the light\npouring in through the clerestory.\n“Shh,” Teia said, intent on the music. Cranky.\n“Why don’t the blues do their own music?” Kip asked Ben-hadad.\n“Don’t know. It’s just a special thing they do.” Ben-hadad grinned\nsuddenly and pulled his eyes down from the ceiling. “Sub-reds are always\npassionate, of course, but the men are almost always sterile. Both of which\nmake them quite popular with the ladies.”\n“Musically talented doesn’t hurt either,” Teia said wistfully.\n“What?” Kip asked Ben-hadad. “Why?”\nBen-hadad’s eyebrows shot up."

I was—?” Oh, she knew that. She was\ngrinning as he blushed.\nSeventy?\nShe relented and, speaking low, said, “No one knows why they’re\nsterile. It’s just part of their burden and their sacrifice to Orholam.”\n“Shh!” a girl in the row in front of them said, turning around, irritated.\nThe choir began a new song, and this time many of the congregation\njoined in. Kip had no idea what they were saying. He could only guess that\nit was archaic Parian. It was beautiful, though, and he was glad that he\ndidn’t understand it. He could soak in pure music.\nTwo great skylights lit up suddenly with more than the noonday sun. Kip\nguessed that two of the great mirrors on top of the other towers had been\nturned toward the great hall, which of course had an entire tower above it,\nso it couldn’t let in light from straight above. So the mirrors stood in to let\nOrholam’s light shine upon his people.\nThere was more singing, and then a procession of blue-robed men and\nwomen, some swinging censers full of smoking incense. Kip watched as\nKlytos Blue, dressed in a blue silk robe with a high starched collar and\nwearing a strange blue hat, walked within several paces of him. The man\nlooked uncomfortable, barely enduring this.\nKip didn’t like him.\nOrholam, Seventy Ways? Kip could only really imagine two.\nWho could you ask about that sort of thing? They’d laugh at him like he\nwas a bumpkin.\nThere was kneeling and prayers and readings and responses from five\nthousand throats. Kip moved his mouth and pretended to know what was\ngoing on. His mother had never had time for luxiats. She’d feared\nOrholam’s judgment, mostly saying that if you kept your head down, you\nmight escape the wrath you deserved.\nThen Klytos Blue came to the lectern and began speaking so softly that\neven the people in the front row probably couldn’t have heard a word. He\nwas so awkwardly shy that Kip felt a stab of cruel compassion for the man.\nOne of the luxiats approached him quietly and whispered to him.\nKlytos raised his voice to a mumble: “… under eye of… this forty-ninth\nday…”\nKip saw the luxiat eyeing another luxiat, communicating with glances.\nThe other luxiat got up and murmured to Klytos Blue, who spoke sharply\nback to the man, flushed, and then turned back to his papers.\n“As I was saying,” Klytos shrilled, finally speaking loudly enough that\neven those in the back could hear him. He sneered, “It is part of the\nChromeria’s work to bring the most recent work of scholars to blinkered\ncorners of our world. Not long ago, it was considered heresy to speak of our"

Not long ago, it was considered heresy to speak of our\nworld as if it were anything but a rolled-out parchment. People believed that\nthe world had actual corners—luxiats most of all. Thanks to the blues and to\nthe blue virtues, we now know this to be superstition and not in conflict\nwith the scriptures which were speaking only metaphorically of the\nsatrapies being the center. The center of Orholam’s will is a metaphorical\nstatement, not a spatial one.”\nKip had no idea what he was talking about, but a couple of the luxiats\ndidn’t look particularly pleased with this turn. Kip guessed that if Klytos\nlowered his voice another time, none of them was going to remind him to\nraise it again.\n“In the last few years, there has been some exciting work done by your\ncompeers in the Tower of Reason regarding the Great Schism and the\nevents that flowed out of the Deimachia, the War of the Gods which most\nscholars now agree is better translated the War on the Gods. The ‘dei’ of\ncourse is the ablative, and in most of our translations, there’s simply not\nenough contextual evidence to support overturning the generally accepted\n‘war of.’ However, in Tristaem’s On the Fundaments of Reason, he points\nout that with only a few changes in how we understand old Parian grammar,\nour entire hermeneutics is shifted. These shifts are under way now.”\nKip’s eyes began to glaze over. There were simply too many words he\ndidn’t understand. Even if he did think grammar was interesting, he\ncouldn’t have followed if he’d wanted to. He lost the stream and began\nlooking around the room instead. One old luxiat in her rumpled black robe\nlooked like she was chewing on a lemon. Several of the older students\nactually looked fascinated, and Kip despaired. Am I going to turn into that?\nHe’d thought that the Chromeria was a place of learning, yes, but a place\nof practical learning. He began studying the stained glass mosaics that lined\nthe entire clerestory. There was Lucidonius himself, white-robed and soft-\nlooking, surrounded by his Parian warriors, but his skin a couple of shades\nlighter than theirs. That was interesting. Kip had always heard he was a\nParian outsider.\nOh, maybe he was an outsider even to the Parians.\nKip suddenly imagined furious arguments over exactly what color\nLucidonius’s skin color had been when the stained glass had gone in. He\nknew the Parians claimed him, especially over their rivals in riches and\npower, their neighbors the pale-skinned Ruthgari. The darker Lucidonius\nwas, the more of a poke in the eye it would be to the Ruthgari.\nAnd now, despite that the stained glass had gone in hundreds of years\nafter Lucidonius died, people would look at the windows and assume that\nbecause they were old, they must be accurate.\nFascinating. Kip wished he knew.\nOh, hell. That’s exactly what old windy up there is doing, isn’t it?\nTurning the world on the parsing of a word, like Kip was imagining the\nworld turned on a bit of pigment in a window."

That’s exactly what old windy up there is doing, isn’t it?\nTurning the world on the parsing of a word, like Kip was imagining the\nworld turned on a bit of pigment in a window.\nThe Blue had lowered his voice again, and Kip had to lean forward to\nhear him now. But he’d said a word that had caught Kip’s attention:\nLightbringer. “… which is why the Lightbringer is best understood as a\nmetaphor for each one of us. Each of us is to bring light into the dark\ncorners of the world. Not through missionary zeal. If the religions of those\nbeyond the Everdark Gates are serving the barbarians out there well, who\nare we to change who they are? Are they not also the children of Orholam?\nWe are to bring light into the dark corners of our own lives, by being kind\nand generous, by speaking well of others, by loving extravagantly. The\nLightbringer is not coming. Hear O Children of Am, the Lightbringer is not\none. We are Lightbringers all.”\nThe luxiats’ eyes all seemed ready to pop out of their heads as they ran\nscreaming from the room to bathe themselves in milk.\nKip almost burst out laughing at the image.\nHoly shit, Kip. Gotta get more sleep.\nThe High Luxiat took the dais. He didn’t even look at Klytos Blue.\n“Choir,” he said, “I wonder if you could close us with ‘Father of Lights,\nForgive Us.’ ” It wasn’t, apparently, the song that had been planned.\nOh, nice.\nBut the men sang it, and they sang beautifully.\nEveryone shuffled out after the song and Kip asked Ben-hadad, “So\nwhat was all that?”\n“A lie from the pit of hell,” Ben-hadad said. Two girls in the row in front\nof them turned and glanced at him, but he was heedless. “There have\nalways been fights about the Lightbringer. Who he is, or will be, or if he\nalready came. The Chromeria says he already came, that Lucidonius was\nthe Lightbringer. His name means ‘light giver,’ after all.”\n“But you don’t buy that?” Kip asked.\n“I don’t know all the arguments, but my parents don’t believe it.”\nKip looked at him. It was one of the dumber things he’d ever heard, and\nby the sudden glum look on Ben-hadad’s face, he could tell the boy knew it,\ntoo.\n“I don’t want to live after history is settled,” Ben-hadad said.\nWhich was also dumb: I don’t like how the world is, so it isn’t that way?\nAt least this time Kip was able to keep himself from saying it.\n“The Lightbringer is going to be a genius of magic,” Teia suddenly said.\nShe’d been unusually quiet until now. “A warrior who sweeps all before\nhim. He will be great from his youth. He’s going to do things no one ever\nthought was possible, and bring us back to the true path. Lucidonius wasn’t\neven a good drafter. He figured out how to make colored lenses, but that\nhardly makes him a genius, does it? The Lightbringer will protect us. He\nwill slay gods and kings.”"

And the last gods.”\n“Lucidonius’s people did that,” Ben-hadad said. “Not Lucidonius\nhimself.”\n“It’s the same thing,” the boy said. “When you say, ‘The Color Prince\nseized Garriston,’ you don’t mean he picked it up. You don’t even mean that\nhe took it by himself. You mean it was done at his will. It’s—”\n“Children!” a black-robed luxiat said, disgusted.

Out!”\nChapter 34\n“That dress doesn’t do justice to your beauty,” a young man said to Liv as\nshe emerged from a warehouse some of the displaced women and their\nchildren had taken over in Garriston. “Nor do those quarters do justice to\nyour gifts.” He smiled the smile of a man who knows he’s gorgeous. “I’m\nZymun. I’m your tutor.”\nAnd he would have been gorgeous, had not his entire look been spoiled\nby the bandage over his nose, and two black eyes. Zymun looked maybe\nsixteen or seventeen, Liv’s age, but maybe older, or maybe he simply\ncarried himself like he was older. He had a mop of curly black hair, an\naquiline nose made even bigger by the bandage over it, a wide mouth, and\nperfect bright white teeth. Atashian skin, heavy brows, light blue eyes with\na ring of many colors beneath the halo. He wore a new white shirt—who\nhad new shirts, just after a huge battle?—and over his sleeves, his forearms\nwere covered with multicolored vambraces with five thick bands of color\nagainst a white background. He wore a sparkling clean cloak that echoed\nthe pattern, from a black fuzzy band for sub-red to red, orange, yellow, and\ngreen. A five-color polychrome. Five!\nThere were only perhaps twenty five-color polys in the Chromeria.\nMaybe a few more still in training. If this boy was cocky, it was for good\nreason.\nInsufferable.\n“You lose a fight?” Liv asked. How rude!\n“Failed an assassination attempt, actually. Took a punch in the face. And\ngot beaten for my failure when I got back. After swimming through shark-\ninfested waters.” He smiled.\n“You’re joking.”\n“Terrible sense of humor, if I were. It’s not very funny, is it?”\n“You’re serious?”\n“Second time’s the charm, I guess. Come, we need to get you out of\nthose rag—those clothes and into something more becoming.”\nHe was her tutor, put over her by Lord Omnichrome himself, so Liv\nsupposed that meant she had to obey him.

The warehouse wasn’t far from the Travertine Palace,\nbecause it felt safer to be close to the soldiers. Being a woman alone during\nwartime meant never being off your guard.\nBut as Liv followed Zymun, she saw that his garb was better than armor.\n“Is everyone so afraid of drafters here?” she asked.\n“Afraid? They respect us, which is only right, don’t you think?”\n“I suppose so.”\n“You suppose so? Ah. So this is why you needed a tutor.”\nWell that was patronizing, and Liv didn’t appreciate it one bit.\n“The Chromeria makes slaves, Liv. It depends on making those it trains\nbeing so indebted to them that you become at best an indentured servant—\nwith the term of your indenture being the rest of your life. A slave, in other\nwords. The Free reject that. We recognize instead the natural order as it is.\nDid you choose to be born a great beauty? Of course not. But you are. You\ncan do with that what you will. Similarly, you were born a drafter. We can\nwish that all were born with our gifts, and the Color Prince is investigating\nhow this might be done. But the fact remains, we are special. We have a gift\nthat other men and women don’t. We didn’t do anything to earn that gift—\nwe can’t choose to be drafters. But we are. We don’t ask those who have\ngifts to chain themselves, as we don’t ask those who are skilled in running\nto get fat so they don’t make us feel bad for being slow. We are what we\nare, as wild and free as nature made us. When you walk the streets as a\ndrafter, men know that if they accost you, you can kill them. They can fear\nthat or simply respect it like they’d respect a woman carrying a pistol. With\nthe advantage, of course, being that a pistol only has one shot.”\nThey passed workers clearing rubble-strewn streets and finally arrived at\na little store undamaged in the fighting. An old woman greeted her. “So\ngood to have business! Thank you, thank you, oh, and so beautiful you are!\nA marvel I’ll make you. I have an order for three dresses, yes?” she asked\nZymun.\n“If that’s what Lord Omnichrome ordered,” Zymun said.\n“Very well then, strip down,” she told Liv.\nLiv looked at her, then over at Zymun, who showed no inclination to\nleave. “Do you mind?” she asked him.\nHe looked her up and down, grinning mischievously. “Very much, but as\nyou wish. Can’t fault me for trying.”\nHe stepped outside and left her in the capable hands of the seamstress.\nThe woman took her measurements quickly, compared it to her height, had\nher turn around a few times, and then allowed her to dress. She made three\nquick sketches and showed them to Liv. “Everything is to be the finest\npossible for you, my lady. This first will be wool, but it’s a goat’s wool from\nthe Abornean mountains.

Amazing? “… expensive.” Liv hated\nherself for saying it, but she’d been poor for so long, she couldn’t help it.\n“Ha! That’s not the start of it. I’m doing the trim of your silk dress with\ntrue murex purple. The finest silk, too, of course. Who’s going to waste true\npurple to dye bad silk? Ten thousand murex shells harvested just for you.”\nLiv felt a little sick to her stomach. Silk? True purple? “I meant… I’m\nreally sorry. What I meant is, I don’t have any money. Maybe plain wool?\nJust one dress?” Truth was, she didn’t even have the money to pay for that,\nbut her pride couldn’t take admitting utter poverty.\n“Oh, you pretty little thing, you don’t have to pay! The Lord\nOmnichrome is taking care of everything. One warm dress, one for\neveryday wear—that one will be upland Atashian cotton—and one to\ndazzle. Looks like you could use some new shifts and undergarments, too?”\n“Please! I don’t generally… well, war, you know.”\n“Of course, of course. And we’ll get you a clean dress to wear in the\nmeantime.”\nThat offer turned into a clean dress and a hot bath, ostensibly because\nthe old woman didn’t want her getting the dress dirty, but Liv thought the\nseamstress was happy to have someone to spoil, someone to talk to.\nAs she scrubbed herself with a sponge and let the hot water unknot her\nmuscles, Liv fought the rush of tears just below the surface. She blew out a\nbreath, feeling like she could cry and she would feel better afterward, but\nshe didn’t want to look all splotchy and swollen. She was sure the old\nwoman wouldn’t care—she had the air of someone who’d understand—but\nZymun would come back to pick her up later, and he’d ask. And how can\nyou explain why you were crying when the answer would either take an\nhour or one word? Neither would make him understand. She’d just look like\na weak girl.\nLiv blew out another breath.\n“That’s a lot of sighing,” the old woman said. Liv hadn’t noticed her\ncome in.\n“Have you ever realized that everything you ever believed was a lie?”\n“Everything? The sky is green now?”\n“I didn’t mean—”\n“Teasing, child.” The old woman paused, then heaved a little sigh of her\nown. “I believed my husband was faithful to me. When that fell, it seemed\nlike all the world did with it.”\nLiv hesitated.\n“No, child. Don’t tell me. I’m a stranger. Take my kindness, but don’t\ntrust so much, so easily. You’re a beautiful young woman in a perilous\nplace. Put on some armor. Just remember what’s armor and what’s you, so\nwhen it’s time to take it off, you can.”\nThe old woman walked out, and Liv knew that she’d done her a\nkindness greater than she could have by listening to her churning thoughts.\nLiv had joined the enemy.

She could excuse herself and say that she’d\nhoped her action might inspire the Color Prince to save Kip and Karris, and\nit had, but in truth she’d lost faith in everything the Chromeria had taught\nher. If the fruit is poison, why respect the tree?\nBut if the Chromeria itself was corrupt, how deep did that corruption\ngo? If they’d taught one lie, how many others had they espoused? It made\nher feel sick to her stomach, like she was looking into the abyss. If the\nChromeria was corrupt, and the Chromeria was supposed to be a central\nfont of Orholam’s will, what did that say about Orholam himself?\nHow could he let such corruption be? Either he didn’t care, or he didn’t\nhave the power to do anything about it, or he didn’t exist. Liv felt a chill\ndespite the hot water. It was a thought that couldn’t be called back.\nBut there was no answer. Doesn’t care, can’t fix, or doesn’t exist. No\nmatter what, things were not as Liv had believed. It was like having a nice\nwarm cloak of comforting suppositions ripped off her shoulders.\nSo be it. This was what it was to be an adult, to be a strong woman. Her\nfather had raised her to believe certain things, but her father wasn’t\nomniscient. He could be wrong. And if he was, Liv wasn’t going to be a\nmoral coward. She would face the world as it was.\nShe’d once heard an old philosopher quoted in one of her classes: ‘The\ntruth is so dear to me that if Orholam stood on one side and truth on the\nother, I would turn my back on my creator himself.’\nSo be it. Fealty to One, that was the Danavis motto. Liv’s fealty would\nbe to the truth.\nSimply considering that was scary, terrifying as she thought about the\ndecisions she made all the time based on what was right—which was based\non what was holy—which was based on what the Chromeria taught was\nholy—which was based on what the Chromeria believed about Orholam.\nTaking out that linchpin?\nBut at the same time, it was tremendously freeing. She would be strong.\nThis was hard, but she would do it. She wouldn’t shrink from hard truths or\nembrace comforting delusions. She would be a warrior for truth.\nShe finished bathing, the impulse to tears forgotten, steel in her spine.\nAnd then she ate what the old woman brought her, though it was only a thin\nbroth dotted with a few potatoes.\n“It isn’t up to my normal standards, but well, war, you know,” the old\nwoman said, a twinkle in her eye.\nLiv laughed.\n“After I finish your dresses, I’ll be able to serve you something much\nbetter, I promise.”\nWhen she was finished, Liv felt a thousand times better. She thanked the\nold woman and stepped outside.\nZymun was sitting on a crude bench, tossing little blue disks out of one\nhand into the air and shooting them with green from the other.\n“You were waiting for me the whole time?” Liv asked.\nHe tossed a blue disk up and blasted it into oblivion, harder than\nnecessary.\n“Oh. I forgot about you,” she said. Oops, that didn’t come out quite like\nshe meant it."

Oops, that didn’t come out quite like\nshe meant it.\n“You get away with that shit because you’re beautiful?” Zymun asked.\n“If so, quit it.”\n“You keep saying that. I don’t know if you’re trying to make a\nbackhanded compliment or a stupid forehanded insult.” She wasn’t\nbeautiful. She knew that. On her best day, she could manage a bit of cute.\nAnyone who said different was trying to get something from her.\nZymun looked like he was going to tear into her, but then his mouth\ntwitched. “ ‘Forehanded insult’?” he asked. “That your own invention?”\nBut he grinned.\n“I was hoping you wouldn’t notice.” She scowled, feeling stupid. “I\nthought you weren’t a blue,” she said quickly. He had five colors on his\ncloak and vambraces, but not blue and not superviolet.\n“Not yet,” he said. He drafted another blue disk. Liv could tell the color\nwas off, and in barely more than a second it frayed apart and dissolved.\n“Hoping I grow into it. It’s so close it’s infuriating. Blue has so many uses.\nPlus, as nice as it already is to be a five, I can’t help but dream of being a\nfull-spectrum polychrome.”\nHe was reaching to be a seven-color drafter with exactly the same kind\nof statements Liv had used a few months ago when she was longing to have\nher second color recognized. It was never enough, was it? There’s always\nsomeone better than you.\nStill, if seven colors might be within reach for Zymun, that meant the\nboy was on another plane altogether.\n“Sorry about forgetting,” Liv said, looking at her feet. “I didn’t think I\nwas important enough for you to wait around for me.”\nHe smiled, and broken nose, black eyes, and all, he was terribly\nhandsome. “Come on,” he said. “I’ve got something to show you.”\nChapter 35\nIt was strangely freeing to be so busy that he had no time for friends—or his\nlack thereof. Over the next weeks, Kip spent his mornings in class and\nworking, spent hours more on the Blackguards’ field, and then headed to the\nlibrary. He got to know the staff, and they him. As often as not, a stack of\nbooks was waiting for him—the ones he requested every day, plus whatever\nones Rea Siluz thought he might find helpful.\nHe would find an isolated desk, and not leave for eight or ten hours,\ndepending on when the last librarian left. Every day he scowled at the older\nstudents, and stayed late with them a few times—until he was discovered\nand banned from the library for a week. Students also weren’t allowed to\nreshelve their own books. Apparently so many had done so incorrectly for\nso long that it became a nightmare for the librarians. Now, after being read,\nbooks were to be deposited at one of the two desks for the purpose on each\nlevel of the library.

Kip also quickly learned that despite taking up three full\nlevels of the Prism’s Tower, this library was only a small sliver of the total\nnumber of books the Chromeria owned. Many more were kept below\nground. Dims were not allowed in the secondary libraries, period.\nAll of which combined to make Kip’s other searches nearly impossible\nto even begin. He had sworn to avenge his mother—and crushing King\nGaradul’s head somehow hadn’t made that ache go away. Then he’d sworn\nto find out if his mother was lying about Gavin Guile. He couldn’t imagine\nthe man had actually raped her, but liar and addict and horror though she\nwas, she still deserved that of her son.\nOf greater concern, though, was that he’d sworn to make Klytos Blue\nstep down.\nHe really had to stop swearing.\nThe problem with both goals was that he barely knew where to start. He\ncouldn’t exactly ask, “Pardon, can you tell me where the damning evidence\nabout the currently serving Colors and Prisms is kept?” And with his books\nbeing checked up on, any wider reading he did want to do had to be done\ncarefully. Kip had found several books of genealogy to learn about Klytos\nBlue, and then waited until he saw one of the young women who assisted\nthe libraries reshelving books and slid his books into her stacks.\nAt this rate, he’d never find anything. There was only one shortcut to get\nto the libraries that might have the information he needed: make it into the\nBlackguard.\nSo what had begun as something he attempted to please his father whose\nultimate purpose he didn’t understand now became the only possibility. Kip\ntrained and studied and read books in the library and didn’t sleep much,\nnightmares interrupting his rest every night, until he would crash and sleep\nfor a day or two straight.\nThere was no punishment for missing class. The Chromeria let the\nsponsors handle that. It made Sponsor Day deeply unpleasant for those\nstudents who loafed. But Kip didn’t have a sponsor. He went to class,\nthough, even when he hated it. To miss would be to disappoint his father, to\nbe a failure.\nAnd then fight day came, the culmination of the month’s training.\nThough Kip was clearly the worst in class, by entering at number four\nhe’d made it terribly unlikely that he could fail out this month. But the\nentire system was designed to force the cream of the class to rise. On testing\nday, each student was given a fight token. The testing started at the bottom,\nwith the lowest-ranked students given a chance. Number forty-nine would\ngo first. He could only challenge someone within three places, and if he\nwon, he would be awarded that person’s fight token, which he could\nimmediately use again to keep climbing.\nBefore they started, a boy asked the trainer, “Trainer Fisk, sir? Why do\nwe have to fight with the spotlights instead of giving us spectacles?”\nThe trainer said, “You ask now? Why not ask when you started?”\n“I, uh—everything was new,” the boy said. Kip could tell the truth. The\nboy had been too intimidated to ask then.\n“Anyone have a guess?” the trainer asked.\n“Spectacles could break in training, and they’re worth a fortune,” Teia\nsaid."

Far as I know, it’s true. Back in the days of Prism\nKarris Shadowblinder, just after Lucidonius himself had introduced colored\nlenses to the world, there was a young man who joined the Ilytian Heresy,\nthough the same could have happened to anyone. Blue drafter named\nGilliam. He had his blue lenses, and he never took them off. It was a time of\nwars to make ours look paltry, so none blamed him. The lenses were a\nsymbol of power, and of status, of course. The technology to create colored\nlenses was known to only a few, so having the lenses showed that you were\nwealthy as well. He was in many battles over the years, mostly on the\nwrong side, but that’s neither here nor there. A number of years later, he\ntried to assassinate Prism Shadowblinder. He cut through her guards\nhandily, and then he faced the Prism herself. She berated him for using the\nspectacles her own husband had given him to fight her. She berated him for\nusing them too much.\n“But of course he thought she was stalling, and he tried to kill her again.\nShe snatched the spectacles from his face. It was an overcast day; there was\nno blue for him to draft, and in moments he was hamstrung. She asked him\nthen if he understood. He didn’t. She picked up a simple iron spear and told\nhim to stop her. Of course it was impossible. He looked everywhere for\nblue. There was none. And then, as she came closer, he felt the reds and\ngreens and yellows sliding into his eyes. He was a full-spectrum\npolychrome, and he’d never known.\n“But having never used the colors, he couldn’t control them, couldn’t\nbind them to his will in the time he had. And she slew him as he screamed.\nHe who has ears, let him hear.”\nKip looked around. Some of the scrubs were nodding, like this all made\nperfect sense. Others looked like he felt.\n“He who looks through only one lens lives in darkness,” Teia murmured.\nHe could tell she hadn’t just made that up. It had a weight of antiquity to it.\n“Enough questions, we’ve got work here. Places!” Trainer Fisk said.\nAnd that was it. No explanation. Fantastic.\nForty-nine, a slight, awkward boy with crooked teeth, challenged forty-\nsix as everyone expected he would. Forty-six was a beefy girl, nearly twice\nhis size, but slow. If she lost, she would lose her fight token and her chance\nto challenge those above her, so it was do or die for both of them.\n“What’s your strategy?” Teia asked Kip.\nForty-nine and forty-six approached the great wheels, each spinning one.\nDepending on where the whizzing counters landed, they would have\ndifferent rules for their fight.

It was another aspect of the Blackguard ethos:\nyou never knew under what circumstances you might have to fight, or with\nwhat weapons. You could get lucky or unlucky, and you had to deal with it.\nThe boy’s roll landed at yellow and green. The girl’s at staves.\n“What do you mean?” Kip asked, entranced by what was happening in\nfront of them.\nShutters were drawn and the battleground was bathed in yellow and\ngreen light. The boy and girl walked to Trainer Fisk, who stood by a small\npodium, and they both pushed their fingers onto two points of black rock\nand then were given staves. They saluted each other and began fighting.\nThey were awkward, so bad that even Kip might have had a chance against\nthem.\nThe girl attacked, her first shot rattling hard against the boy’s block, and\nher very next swing going through and catching him on the side of the head.\nHe fell heavily, not unconscious, but jellied.\nThe boy got up to his knees, then fell over again.\nThe girl was declared the winner, and forty-nine burst into tears. There\nwas no way he could stay in the Blackguard. He was done.\n“Don’t feel sorry for him,” Teia said. “Failing out may keep him from\ngetting killed, either next month or down the line. The Blackguard can only\nbe the best.”\n“Someone is going to go home today for me,” Kip said.\nShe looked at him, quizzical. “So, you don’t have a strategy?”\nHe stared back. She wasn’t getting it. “Teia, I’m terrible. I’ll fight the\nbest I can, but I’ll lose. It’s that simple.” He wasn’t going to disappoint\nGavin any more than necessary.\nForty-eight went next—and instead of challenging forty-five, instead he\nchallenged the girl at forty-six.\n“Why’d he—”\n“She’s already fought once, so she might be tired,” Adrasteia said.\nAnd so it was. Forty-eight and forty-six fought a purely mundane fight\n—the colors he’d spun were colors that neither of them could draft. Forty-\nsix won, and challenged forty-three. She won again, and challenged forty,\nbut lost.\nAs he watched and pieced together why people were sometimes\nchoosing to fight three places up and sometimes only the person directly\nabove, Kip asked Teia questions. Pretty quickly he figured out that there\nwas as much strategy here as at Nine Kings.\nOh hell no.\nPeople would sometimes not fight their friends, because they didn’t want\nto make them lose places or challenge tokens. Other times people would\nfight those whom they thought were tired, or if there was a particular low-\nranked fighter whom people thought was better than his spot, sometimes\npeople would fight below him so that they could then leapfrog him.\nIn the bottom seven were people who’d already lost and were definitely\ngoing to fail out—those were assumed be less likely to fight hard, so others\nwere more likely to challenge them.\nWith this setup, as Teia explained it to Kip, if someone was ranked\nlower than their ability deserved, they had a chance to climb all the way to"

Practically, of course, it almost never\nhappened. Fighting was exhausting, and having to fight again immediately\nif you won meant it was rare that anyone jumped up the rankings very far.\nAt the same time, it put tremendous pressure on those at the top not to\nlose even once. If they did, and the person they’d lost to also lost, they\ncould lose numerous places by losing a single fight.\nWhoever had designed the tests wanted to get Blackguards who\nperformed well under tremendous pressure.\n“By getting into the hierarchy higher than people think you deserve,\nKip, you’ve pretty much guaranteed that you’re going to get challenged a\nlot,” Teia said.\nOf course. If there was a safe fight in your block of three, you take that\none. Kip would always be that safe fight.\n“What do I care?” Kip asked. “It’s just beatings.”\n“You know,” Teia said, “I can’t decide if you’re brave or stupid.”\nHuh?\n“If I fight you again, I’m going to win,” she said.\n“You never know,” Kip said. “I might get lucky.”\nShe left. He barely noticed; he was watching the fights. Because he\ndidn’t get any time in drafting practice, this was Kip’s first glimpse of what\nhe assumed was normal drafting.\nBut most of the Blackguard trainees were monochromes, and the odds of\ndrawing their color on the wheel weren’t good, so most of the fights were\npurely hand-to-hand or weapon-to-weapon. Or sometimes the wheel would\ngive them their color, but weakly, so instead of trying to draft a color\nslowly, they’d go for a straight fight. Not many of the children were able to\nfight effectively while also slowly drawing in enough light to be able to use\nit after two or three minutes of fighting. Most of the fights didn’t last that\nlong.\nThe fighters got a lot better quickly, though.\nThe last fighters in danger began their fight. A muscular boy got unlucky\nand fought a blue-drafting girl in blue light. She used bars of blue luxin to\nchoke him out before he could cross the distance to her.\nWhen he got up, furious, instead of going toward her, he marched over\nto Kip and shook his finger in his face. “You! You’re worse than me! You\nshould be going home, you lardass. Not me.”\n“You’re right,” Kip said quietly.\n“You’re damn right I’m right! Why are you even here? Because your\nmother’s some whore who spread her legs for Gavin Guile? You’re a\nbastard. I’m the son of the dey of Aghbalu! This is bullshit!”\nKip knew what he should do. He should punch the boy. Destroy him\nsomehow with a ferocity that let everyone know, once again, that Kip was\nnot to be crossed. He’d already done it with the bully Elio. Apparently once\nwasn’t enough. One story, people could disbelieve.\nBut Kip didn’t want to be the boy who was the crazy, erratic bastard."

He looked inside himself for that fury he knew was\nthere for the boy insulting his mother, but today it was just an ache. He had\nno violence in him now.\n“Is this what I am to be?” Kip asked. Some part of him wanted to weep.\n“What?” the boy snarled. “I wasn’t done with you.”\n“You’re nothing,” Kip said sadly. “And I’m less. I’m the violent\nmadman.”\nThe other Blackguard trainees were gathered, of course, eager to see\nwhat would happen. The trainer, Kip thought, was notably slow to come\nbreak it up. Perhaps pecking orders were best established early in the\nBlackguard.\nKip stood up. He needed a spark of fury, but he had nothing. It was too\nhard to think of coldly sucker-punching another boy. Especially one who\nwas rightly angry at him.\n“Wait, wait, wait,” Kip said. “What’s your name?” I won’t fail my\nfather.\n“Tizrik, and you’d better remember it, you—” The boy’s eyes were\nsuspicious.\n“Tizrik Tamar, of Aghbalu? Tizrik!” Kip spread his arms out to hug the\nboy like he was long-lost family. “Tizrik! My uncle said—”\n“No, it’s not Tamar—I’m—”\nKip embraced the boy, who tried to push his hands away, irritated. But\nthen Kip seized both of the boy’s sleeves and yanked fiercely, throwing his\nforehead into the taller boy’s face. With his own hands off to the sides,\ntrying to stop Kip from hugging him, Tizrik didn’t have a chance.\nFace met forehead. Stuff crunched. Blood showered over Kip’s head.\nThe boy collapsed, mostly onto Kip. Kip pushed him off. The boy fell to\nthe ground, his nose streaming blood even as he lay whimpering. His nose\nwas crooked, clearly broken, his lips mashed. He more mouthed out than\nspit out blood, and a tooth came with the torrent.\nKip felt like he was watching himself from afar as he stepped over the\nboy and put a foot on his neck, holding him prone.\nMurmurs and gasps raced through the crowd. Trainer Fisk pushed\nthrough them. He looked at the bleeding young man, then at Kip.\n“Chirurgeons! You, too, Kip.”\nKip was stunned that he didn’t appear to be in trouble, and apparently\nthe others were, too. “But… but I haven’t fought yet today.”\n“You’ve fought enough,” the trainer said, pulling Kip back away from\nTizrik.\n“He cheated!” Tizrik said, holding his nose.\nTrainer Fisk said, “Blackguards don’t cheat. Blackguards win.”\nTheir questioning looks obviously irritated Trainer Fisk. “This is real\nlife,” the trainer said. “Our coin is violence. Sudden, sharp, breathtaking,\nleaving no hope of revenge.

But by being caught up with them, his space was\npassed. He lost two places as others above him lost challenges, but he\nrealized that by not having to fight this week, his chances of staying in the\nBlackguard had pretty much been doubled. He had a chance.\nBut he was going to have to win some fights.\nChapter 36\nTeia walked into the ring, praying. She was lean, with quick reflexes.\nSlippery. What she wasn’t was strong, not compared to the boys in the\nBlackguard. Luckily, the training favored cutting and slashing weapons.\nThe Blackguard didn’t have any bias against crushing weapons—war\nhammers, bludgeons, maces—indeed, those were often the best against\nheavy armor. But those weapons weren’t safe to train with.\nThey could blunt the edges of a mace, but if one of the monsters like\nLeo—with the shoulders of a draft horse and arms of banded iron—hit you\nwith a mace, it wouldn’t matter if you had pillows wrapped around it.\nBones would break. So they didn’t train with them.\nShe supposed that the muscular boys thought that wasn’t fair. On the\nother hand, at least their colors might come up on the wheel.\nAnd what would I do if my color did come up on the wheel? Stab it\nthrough someone’s neck and kill them?\nThe thought turned her stomach, sent shivers of dread down the back of\nher neck. She saw the look on that woman’s face again, dropping the melon,\nlooking startled, not understanding that she was about to die horribly.\nHow had that happened?\nHer opponent was Graystone Keftar. He was very dark-skinned, cute\ngrin, green drafter. Nice boy. He’d flirted with her a few times. Already\ngoing bald, though. Tragic. He was short and athletic, a son of a rich family\nthat had paid for him to be trained before he came to the Chromeria.\nGraystone winked at her and spun his wheel. She grimaced and spun\nhers. Next time he flirted, she’d give him nothing. You only wink at\nsomeone you’re about to fight if you don’t take them seriously.\nWhat’d the boys think? That she was training to be cute?\nThe wheels came up green or red. From Graystone’s self-satisfied\nexpression, she knew it was green—dammit!—and rapiers.\nShe and Graystone took their weapons.

She could challenge one of the boys above her.

More honestly, she was probably about tenth best\nin the class. If she was to make the top seven, she’d have to be a little lucky\nin what colors came up in the next three testings.\nBut the more she fought now, the more chances the others had to scout\nher abilities. She wanted to finish strong, not be strong until the finish.\nSo she didn’t challenge anyone. It was perhaps a little dirty, but it was\nclever, too.

And though the fight was close,\nwith every weapon Ironfist had won.\nThen there were still legends of his exploits during the False Prism’s\nWar. And now stories were coming out about what he’d done at the Battle\nof Garriston. They were saying that he’d gone through King Garadul’s\nentire army, infiltrated the wall behind him, taken out all the cannon crews\n—by himself!—and then turned the cannons back on the king’s army,\nmanaging to shoot one of the great wagons loaded with black powder and\nkilling scores if not hundreds. Then he’d escaped an entire furious army, but\nnot alone. No, simple escape wasn’t good enough for Ironfist. He’d done all\nof that to serve as his own distraction—and had then rescued Kip and Karris\nWhite Oak, running across the surface of the sea, where frenzied sharks\nwere already feeding, only to return in time to foil an assassination attempt.\nIf there was one man who encompassed all that every one of the gathered\nyoung people wanted to be, it was Ironfist.\n“Well done,” Ironfist said, addressing them. “Well fought, and just as\nimportant, well thought. I saw some real cleverness today, and some\nglimpses of real ability. But I’ve come today to lay a greater challenge\nbefore you than perhaps you can surmount. You’re not going to like it. I\ndon’t like it, but circumstances demand it. We Blackguards judge\ncircumstances with equanimity. We are unmoved. And we overcome.”\nEveryone was suddenly on the edge of their seat.\n“As you may know by now, the Blackguards were involved in action at\nthe fall of Garriston. They performed heroically, as expected. And our\nlosses were grievous. Bullets don’t bypass the brave. The Blackguard has\nalways been an elite force, and our numbers have always been small. We\ncan’t sustain huge losses and still achieve our mission. Therefore, instead of\nyour class only graduating the top seven into our ranks, we’ll be taking the\ntop fourteen.”\nThe first feeling was one of relief. Fourteen spots! Teia could do that!\nThere were a few cheers—but they came from the students who thought\nthey could make the top fourteen and knew they couldn’t have made the top\nseven. The boys who had been certain they were going to make it didn’t\nlook as pleased.\nIronfist pursed his lips. “Yes,” he said. “The Blackguards in previous\nclasses are going to look down on you. I want you to take that on, as a class.\nI want you to make everyone in your top fourteen as good as the earlier\nclasses’ top seven. We have a mission. We need Blackguards to accomplish\nit. I will still expel anyone who can’t handle the mission. I’m expanding\nBlackguards’ remuneration immediately, too. You’ll be elites, and you’ll be\npaid as such. If you have friends who are excellent fighters or have the\npotential to be such, encourage them to join the next class. We’ll be running\nfour classes a year from here on, not two. If I’m right, the next few years\nmay see all of us needing trustworthy comrades. Not all of us will make it.”"

Not all of us will make it.”\nIronfist took off his ghotra. His head was shaved bald in mourning, and\nhis face was mournful but stern. “Your predecessors have died defending\nthe Seven Satrapies, defending the Prism, defending the White. Many\npeople will look at you and see children, but I’m asking you to make an\nadult decision. Are you ready to die, maybe alone, far from home, with no\none even knowing what a hero you were? I can’t even promise that your\nlives or your deaths will accomplish victory. All I can promise you is that as\nlong as I draw breath, as long as I lead you, I won’t let you be wasted.\nThat’s all you get. That, and the brothers and sisters you see around you. If\nyou don’t want that, good for you. Go lead a happier, safer life somewhere\nelse. Don’t show up tomorrow. Because tomorrow everything gets harder.”\nHe tossed his ghotra on the ground and walked out.\nThe students watched him go.\nA few clapped, but others looked toward Cruxer. He put out his hand,\npalm down: no, don’t clap. And that—with a dozen students deferring to\nCruxer, and Cruxer taking that deference and doing the right thing with it—\nwas when Teia realized Cruxer would be the commander of the Blackguard\nsomeday.\n“It’s war,” Cruxer said. “The Color Prince has invaded Atash. By now\nthe city of Idoss has probably fallen. And his heresies are spreading. He\nsays the oaths we swear to the Chromeria aren’t binding. It’s a lie from the\npit of hell. Go talk to your sponsors and figure out where your loyalties lie.\nDon’t come back until you know. If you’re not back in a week, you’re cut.”\nHe hesitated. “If that’s acceptable, sir?”\nTrainer Fisk had held his tongue the whole time, and now the students\nlooked to him. He was, after all, in charge. He nodded.\nCruxer walked through the trainees with all eyes on him. He picked up\nIronfist’s ghotra reverently and folded it carefully, then walked away.\nWith silence heavy upon them, the rest of the trainees left, too.\nChapter 37\nGavin followed the Third Eye to a clearing not far into the jungle. There\nwas a fire to fend off the coolness of the evening and cheery lanterns hung\nfrom the limbs of a jambu tree, the light showing its ripe, pink fruit. Rugs\nwere spread on the ground. A bowl of wine and a larger bowl of figs and\njambu and other fruits sat in the middle of the rug.\nThe Third Eye sat cross-legged on the rug, the movement exposing her\nlegs to the knee. She gestured to the place opposite, and Gavin sat.\n“So how did you come here to Seers Island?” Gavin asked. “How does\none gain an eye?” He gave her a wry grin.\nShe ignored him, turning her face to the heavens, praying, blessing her\nmeal.

        "text": "one gain an eye?” He gave her a wry grin.\nShe ignored him, turning her face to the heavens, praying, blessing her\nmeal. He tried not to stare at her breasts as she took a deep breath. He\nglanced over at Karris, who was standing guard in the jungle. She glanced\nat the Third Eye’s breasts, then back to Gavin, nonplussed. You think that\nwas on accident? she asked him with the barest twitch of one eyebrow.\nGavin closed his eyes so as to appear to be praying, too. Some people\ndidn’t like to think their Prism was irreligious.\nNice spot you’ve put me in here, Orholam.\nHe pretended to finish praying. When he opened his eyes, she was\nleaning forward—which did distracting things with her low neckline. She\nsaid, “I think you’ll want to dismiss your… bodyguard? There are things I\nwish to speak with you about alone.”\nGavin turned to Karris, who had of course heard everything the woman\nhad said.\n“I’m not leaving,” Karris said, “unless those two women with muskets\nyou have stationed in the forest withdraw and I search you for weapons.”\nThe Third Eye looked off into the jungle. She stood, gracefully.\nApparently light-blinded by the lanterns, she didn’t look the right direction.\n“Clara, Cezilia, is that you? I told you my life is not in danger. My virtue,\nperhaps. Please withdraw now.” She turned to Karris. “Be my guest,” she\nsaid.\nBriefly, and not roughly, Karris patted her down. She was a professional.\nPlus, in that dress, there weren’t that many places the woman could be\nhiding a weapon.\nBefore Karris finished, the Third Eye leaned close and spoke to her, too\nlow for Gavin to hear.\nKarris blanched. Started, looked at the Third Eye, looked over at Gavin\nto see if he’d heard.\n“You can’t know that,” she said. She was trying to speak low enough\nthat Gavin didn’t hear, but there was too much emotion for her to keep the\nreins tight. She shot a look over at Gavin as the Third Eye continued.\nThen the Seer finished, and a long moment passed.\n“I’ll be nearby if you need me, Lord Prism,” Karris said stiffly. Then she\nwithdrew.\nThe Third Eye took her place across from Gavin once more. His eyes\nwere tight, disturbed. Very few people had that kind of effect on Karris.\n“Please,” she said. “Drink. Eat. You’re my guest.”\nHe began, and she joined him, not saying a word. There was goat cheese\nwith the fruit. A woman came with a loaf of flatbread and a bowl of beans\nand rice and wild pig in a spicy sauce. Following the Third Eye’s lead,\nGavin tore off chunks of bread and used it to scoop up the mixture. She said\nnothing, though she studied him intently. His attempts at starting\nconversation met silence. If he didn’t know better, he would have assumed\nshe was deaf.\n“What are you doing?” he asked finally.\n“I’m waiting,” she said.\n“Waiting?”\n“It’s coming, sometime tonight. I thought it would be by now, but\nclearly…”\n“So you really do see the future,” Gavin said.\n“No,” she said."

I thought it would be by now, but\nclearly…”\n“So you really do see the future,” Gavin said.\n“No,” she said.\nGavin raised his hands. “And yet here you are, predicting the future.”\nShe raised a finger to object, but Gavin cut her off. “Even if not well.”\nShe smiled. Gleaming white teeth, perfect smile. “Gifts can be curses,\ncan’t they, Lord Prism?”\n“I suppo—”\n“You’re beautiful,” she said, cutting him off. “Always did like a man\nwith muscles, and the sight of yours has been filling my mind all day. Quite\ndistracting.”\n“Um, thank you?”\n“Are you a swimmer?” she asked, glancing at the breadth of his\nshoulders.\n“Only when I make mistakes skimming. Which isn’t often.”\nHer pupils flared. “I see. You know, that masterful, cocky thing you do\nmakes me want to tie you to my bed and ravish you.” Her eyes trailed over\nhim and Gavin knew she was picturing it in her mind.\nGavin swallowed. There’s no subtle way to adjust yourself when you’re\nsitting cross-legged. He glanced guiltily over at Karris.\n“Exactly,” the Third Eye said. “You need her more than she needs you,\nPrism. She makes you human.”\nShe tilted her head down and closed her eyes. The tattoo-and-luxin\nyellow eye on her forehead glowed, then she opened her eyes as it\ncontinued to pulse like a heartbeat. Then it faded.\n“I see outside of time. And if that doesn’t make sense to you, it doesn’t\nto me either. Nor is it perfect, how I see. I’m not Orholam. I still have my\nown desires and prejudices that can color what I see or how I interpret what\nI see—how I put into words those visions that come before my eye. Tell me,\nPrism, do you think mercy is weakness?”\n“No.”\n“Wrong question; your pardon. What I meant was, do you think justice\nis better, or mercy?”\n“It depends.”\n“Who decides?” she asked.\n“I do.”\n“Are pity and mercy the same?” she asked.\n“No.”\n“What’s the difference?”\n“I don’t believe in pity.”\n“Liar.” She grinned.\n“Excuse me?” Gavin said.\n“There are two kinds of people who make excellent liars: monsters with\nno conscience, and those who become excellent liars from practice and\nnecessity because they’re deeply ashamed. I don’t think you’re a monster,\nLord Prism. You’ve played beautifully. Your mask is compelling, gorgeous,\nalluring. It makes me want to get naked and subdue you with pleasure until\nyou’re too exhausted to maintain that façade and I can rip it off and show\nyou what’s underneath. Because I already know, and I judge that man\nbeneath your mask much less harshly than you do.”\nFortune-teller tripe. Albeit tripe with a fine sexual edge to it.\n“Are you sure you’re not trying to seduce me?” Gavin asked lightly.\n“Ah, Prism, you always do like to cut corners, don’t you? It’s a strength,\nI suppose. Remember it. But then, you remember most everything, don’t\nyou?”"

But then, you remember most everything, don’t\nyou?”\nHe was confused.\nShe smiled. “What I’m sure of is that bedding you would be a disaster\nfor you and for Karris and for the Seven Satrapies. I’m also pretty sure it\nwould be really, really good for me. Both in the moment and in the long\nrun. Which is why I’m doing everything I can to be completely over the top\nand disgust you with my wanton ways. If I make you uninterested, then that\ndisaster won’t be an option anymore.”\nHe laughed—and could tell she wasn’t joking. She was acting as sex-\nstarved as he felt, and something about her relentlessly frank style\nconvinced him that she would be the best he’d ever had. He said, “The\n‘wanton ways’ gambit is having an effect, but perhaps not the one you’d\nplanned.” Orholam’s royal blue balls, Karris wasn’t ten paces away. Gavin\nwas going to die.\nThe Third Eye stared up at the sky and scowled. “I really thought it\nwould start by now, hmm. What do you think is the worst decision you ever\nmade in your life, Lord Prism?”\nThat was easy. Not killing his brother. “I had pity once.”\n“You’re wrong. You didn’t spare Gavin out of pity. And you wouldn’t do\nany differently than you did if you could do it again.”\nShe said it so matter-of-factly that he almost missed it. And then it\nyanked him up short, like a dog catching scent of a rabbit and charging\nheedless—right until he got to the end of his chain. She’d said sparing\nGavin. She knew both that he wasn’t that Gavin and that he had spared his\nbrother. The air got dense, hard to breathe. Gavin’s chest tightened.\n“What, did you think I was a charlatan? Adjust to the new reality,\nDazen, and move on to the real point.”\nThere was no denial. No point. She hadn’t ventured it as a guess, or a\ntrap, and if he made her repeat it, Karris might hear. Gavin’s heart was\nthundering. He swallowed, took some wine, swallowed again.\n“My worst choice was not telling her.” Gavin was in a fog, a fugue. He\ndidn’t want to say Karris’s name. They were far enough away that their\nvoices should be a murmur to her, but hearing one’s own name tended to\npique the ears.\n“No, not that either. If you’d told her the truth when she was younger,\nshe’d have exposed you. What you did wasn’t kind, or perhaps fair, but it\nwas wise, and I’d advise you not to apologize for what you did when the\ntime comes. Karris is better at adjusting to hard realities than she is at\nforgiving. It’s a character flaw.”\nIt was true. Deeply true. Telling Karris, “I was doing my duty” would\nprobably work better than, “I’m so sorry.” She understood duty, cared about\nit. And yet something in Gavin bristled, wanted to defend Karris.\n“So, what was it then?” Gavin asked."

And yet something in Gavin bristled, wanted to defend Karris.\n“So, what was it then?” Gavin asked.\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t see everything. I just know what it\nwasn’t. I know that you’ve been asking the wrong questions, so you’ve had\nno hope of getting the right answers. So my part is done, sadly with no cries\nof passion or clawing of your back. Aside from two things. First, your\npeople may stay. They will, I’m fairly certain, destroy our way of life. But\nperhaps it will one day turn into something better. I have little hope of that,\nbut I’m too close to see this clearly, and I know that pushing fifty thousand\nstarving people into the sea is not what Orholam would ask of me,\nregardless of what they will do to us once they are no longer starving.”\n“And second?” Gavin asked. It was a huge victory. She was giving him\neverything he wanted, but you don’t laud victories, you consolidate them\nand press forward.\n“And second, you’ve lost control of blue, and your… counterpart has\nbroken out of his blue prison. I’d advise you to do something about it,\nbecause without a Prism, strange things start happening. First, they’re\ninnocuous, weird little things. But they get worse.” She seemed to retreat\ninto herself.\nGavin felt naked. Not in a good way. The news about his brother—if it\nwas true—was cataclysmic. Not just a terrible shock, and not just terrible\nnews, but too coincidental. Gavin had woven alarums into the drafting, of\ncourse, but they were alarums to notify someone in his own room in the\ntower: Marissia when he was gone. There was no way he should have been\naware, no matter how dimly or on how visceral a level, that Dazen had\nbroken out.\nHe had sunk a huge amount of his will into that prison, in ways long\nforbidden, so maybe he’d felt that breaking of his will dimly over the\nleagues. But huge talent though he was, the Chromeria was halfway across\nthe sea.\nPerhaps his losing blue had weakened the prison or broken it. There\nneed be no coincidence. The one could have caused the other—but he\ndidn’t know which way that causation flowed. Gavin felt like he was\nburrowing into the roots of a mountain, and the deeper he went, the faster\nhe moved forward, the sooner the entire thing was going to come down on\ntop of him.\nBut he didn’t know any way out.\nOrholam, his brother was out of the blue? Did Marissia even remember\nhow to switch over the chutes? Maybe Dazen would starve to death. No…\nno, he’d shown her, years and years ago, how to do it, against just this\neventuality. She had an excellent memory. She’d do it right.\nNonetheless, he had to get back. And going back meant heading right\ninto the middle of everything that threatened him most.\n“Aha!” The Third Eye sniffed. “Here it is.”\nScrunching his forehead, Gavin glanced over at her.

She was leaning\nback, looking up again, this time not in prayer, though it again outlined her\ncold-stiffened nipples clearly against the fabric of her dress. He sniffed to\nsee what she was talking about.\nSmelled nothing. Sniffed again, and caught something very faint.\nSomething prickled on his skin, the lightest of touches. He looked over\nat the Third Eye.\nShe was grinning like a little girl. He didn’t understand. Then something\ntouched his arm. He brought it close, but it melted before he could get a\nlook at it. Snow?\nIt was cool tonight, but it wasn’t cold enough for snow. Not even close.\nHe could smell it now—the familiar mineral, chalky odor. Blue luxin.\nMore hit his upturned face, his arms. It was snowing.\n“Blue delights in order,” the Third Eye said. “I know you can’t see it,\nbut every flake is blue. Utterly beautiful, Lord Prism. I’ve never seen so\nstunning a harbinger of doom.”\nGavin’s heart dropped. Other than in the mountains of Paria and Tyrea,\nmost of the Seven Satrapies went years without seeing snow. Gavin caught\na flake on his sleeve, squinted at it. It looked like a snowflake. The blue\nluxin, free of his control, was running amok—but for blue, running amok\nmeant randomly imposing order. Like organizing the crystals of a\nsnowflake. It was a tenuous order; the unnatural snow was melting almost\nimmediately.\n“If it starts with this, what will it do next?” Gavin asked.\n“Something worse,” the Seer said. “And it’s already doing it. We’re\nsimply so far away that this is all that’s reaching us.”\n“The bane,” Gavin whispered.\nShe nodded.\n“Can you tell me where it is?”\n“It’s moving, and I see outside of time.”\n“So?”\n“If something stays in one place, it doesn’t matter when I see it. But if\nsomething moves, finding it inside a particular time is problematic.”\n“Which isn’t the same as impossible,” Gavin said, his heart leaping. If\nhe could save himself the trip to Paria to see the Nuqaba, he could avoid all\nsorts of problems.\nShe scowled. “No, it’s not.”\nAny time the Prism showed up in a major city, there were a thousand\nthings that could only be done by him—not least endless rituals. The best he\nwas ever able to get away with was doing one ritual for each color. And one\nof those would now expose him. He might be able to bluff his way past it, if\nhe were there for only a week or two to find out what he needed, but the\nless he had to rely on his luck, the better. And if she could just tell him what\nhe needed to know…\nShe looked over at him, and it obviously didn’t take a Seer for her to\nknow what he was going to ask her next. She sighed. “I don’t see\neverything all the time all at once, Lord Prism. And I need light. I’ll look"

I don’t promise that knowing won’t cost you\nsomething.”\n“Aha, so now comes the bargaining. You’re going to save me at least\ntwo weeks and lots of awkward conversations with a powerful woman I\nonce outmaneuvered. What’s it going to cost me?” He was trying to set the\nfloor low. The Third Eye would be saving him a whole lot more than that.\nAnd, being who she was, she could probably find that out, if she really\ncared to take the time to look. But as she’d said, she was human, and there\nwas a lot of history and future for her to dig through.\nBut she shook her head. “I didn’t mean that kind of cost. My help will\nbe a gift. You don’t need to earn it. But though truth is a gift, it’s not always\none people thank you for.”\n“Ah. That kind of cost,” Gavin said, suddenly grim.\n“Does the man who ‘killed his brother’ expect the truth to be easy?”\nKilled my brother. If only. But of course, she knew that. She knew what\nit was costing him to maintain that deception and why he’d done it and\nwhat the truth would cost the world if it came out. She must also know the\nprice of truth through her own gift in a thousand ways that Gavin would\nnever know.\nThe Third Eye looked over at him, compassion in her eyes, and\nsuddenly Gavin saw that she was a woman of tremendous depth. A leader in\nher own right. A woman who understood what Gavin was doing, why, and\nwhat he faced. He found her tremendously appealing. If his damn stubborn\nheart hadn’t already been claimed, he could have fallen for her. She knew it,\ntoo. She hadn’t been lying earlier: she really had been trying to make the\nattraction purely sexual—so that there wasn’t the danger of something\ndeeper.\nAs crystalline flurries spun around them, flecks of order spun in chaos,\nGavin peered into the night as if he could unravel its mysteries. “So, you\nand me, disaster, huh?”\nShe smiled, full red lips, perfect teeth. Nodded, met his gaze. A\nremorseful twitch touched the corner of her mouth. “Utter.” She gazed at\nhim appreciatively, but as if saying farewell to the prospect of bedding him.\n“But I do have one prophecy for you already, Lord Prism, in the style you\nso love: Get there before noon. Three hours east, two and a half hours\nnorth.”\nSounded simple enough. He did like that. And then he realized that she\nhadn’t told him north and east from where. He said, “That’s only going to\nbe helpful in retrospect, isn’t it?”\nShe grinned cryptically.\n“You enjoy this, don’t you?” he asked.\n“Immensely.”\n“I haven’t really had much use for prophecy,” Gavin said.\n“I know,” she said. “It was one of the first things I saw about you.

I think I always thought it was—oh, no, there was\nsomething. When I was a boy and my brother stopped playing with me, I’d\nfind these prophecies in old books, and I’d dream that I could decipher\nthem. There was this one: how’d it go?”\nHe was asking himself, but the Third Eye said quietly,\n“Of red cunning, the youngest son,\nWill cleave father and father and father and son.”\n“How’d you…?” he asked.\n“I see that line burning in bitter fire over your head, Lord Prism. What\ndid you take it to mean?”\n“The youngest son of red cunning—the youngest son of the red Guile—\nthe youngest son of the Guile who becomes the Red. So Andross Guile’s\nyoungest son. It was a prophecy about my little brother Sevastian.”\n“And then he died. Murdered.”\n“By a blue wight. He was everything that is good about my family with\nnone of the bad. If he were alive, everything would be different.” He shook\nit off. “Your prophecies aren’t like that. I mean, maddeningly vague. I\nmean, except for this last one.” He grinned. “Why is that?”\nShe touched her third eye thoughtfully. “We’re human, Gavin. My gift\ndidn’t come with a list of rules. I’m muddling through. I’m making it up as\nI go. But I feel the same temptations I’m sure all my predecessors have felt:\nto be important, to help those I love and harm those I hate, to be held as\nalmost a god, to guide and be loved—or to say hell with it, I’m not\nresponsible for this damned thing, and just spew everything I see. I hold my\ntongue when I’m not sure. I think others have spoken more, but more\ncryptically, hoping that they wouldn’t be held responsible if things went\nwrong. And then, of course, there have been frauds: Seers who were not\nSeers at all.”\n“Can you tell me if that prophecy was a fraud?”\n“I have no idea where to even start looking.”\n“You said you saw it in bitter fire over my head,” Gavin said. “How\nabout there?”\n“I saw the words for a moment, yes. That doesn’t mean they’re true.”\n“You’re honest to a fault, aren’t you?” Gavin said.\n“I hope not,” she said. She smirked, a devious, playful twist on her full\nlips.\nGavin wanted to tear her clothes off.\nHe looked away and cleared his throat. “My lady, good night, and ahem,\nnow that we’ve decided not to make a most delightful mistake together, I\nhope together we make our next meeting less… strained.” He stood and\nbrushed nonexistent crumbs off his lap pointedly.

Her instant reaction had been an artifact of her old beliefs.\nShe’d always heard that the old gods were figments of the primitive\nimaginations of the peoples who lived around the Cerulean Sea before\nLucidonius came. But if the Chromeria lied about other things, then that\ncould be a lie as well. She cleared her throat. “I mean, go on.”\n“I think the peoples of the Seven Satrapies knew it, too. From nowhere,\nit seems, little statues of the gods have resurfaced. Hidden in attics, in\ncellars, in secret family shrines in the woods. Keep your eyes open as you\nwalk the camp, you’ll see little signs. Soon, there will be priesthoods\nreestablished, worship will become public. You look skeptical.”\n“I’m sorry, but, the old gods? Like Atirat and Anat and Dagnu?”\nAgain, a flash of irritation, and Liv felt stupid. But he spoke with\nkindness. “You know how you feel when you draft superviolet?”\n“Of course. Alien, separated from emotion, and honestly a little proud of\nhow clearly I see things.”\n“That isn’t you,” Zymun said.\n“I’m not a terribly conceited person, I’ll agree,” Liv said. But you don’t\nknow me, so how would you know?\n“I don’t mean that isn’t the ‘real you.’ I mean, that isn’t you.”\n“Pardon?”\n“Those aren’t your feelings. Those aren’t your perceptions. Indeed,\nthose aren’t your abilities. Ferrilux is invisible. He is behind many of man’s\ngreatest achievements, but he doesn’t think much of most men. He is distant\nand disdainful, and he has chosen to share his powers with you.”"

He is distant\nand disdainful, and he has chosen to share his powers with you.”\nThe idea seemed repugnant to Liv. “There’s an invisible man helping me\ndraft? This is what the Color Prince believes? My drafting’s mine.”\nZymun’s voice was cold, affect flat. “So you chose your colors?\nSuperviolet, for an outsider, for the Tyrean girl who could never be part of\nthe Chromeria, but who secretly despised the girls who would never let her\njoin their petty circles. Yellow, for a clear thinker who couldn’t decide\nwhether or not to engage with all she saw around her. Hmm, sounds very,\nwhat’s the word? Serendipitous.”\n“You’re talking like a tenpenny soothsayer. If I’d been a sub-red, you’d\nsay, oh, sub-red, for the girl so furious at being made an outsider. Or blue,\noh, you envied the girls who did belong. Garbage.” Liv folded her hands,\ntook a breath, and squeezed her fingers against each other. “I mean… your\npardon, my lord, but I’m not convinced. I know the Chromeria taught lies,\nbut that doesn’t mean I’m going to accept the first counterargument that\ncomes along.”\nZymun didn’t seem to take it personally. “You’re cute when you’re mad.\nAnd when you do that with your arms, it shows off your bosom nicely.”\nLiv looked down and dropped her clenched hands like she’d been\nburned. “Excuse me?!” She stopped walking and he stopped, too, facing\nher. She almost slapped his silly face. “That is the most inappropriate thing\nanyone has ever said to me. And I expect your apology right this instant!”\n“Inappropriate? Why? Who says? You’re beautiful. I told you so. Who\ngets to decide that I can’t tell you what I think? I’d tell you, but you’re\nsmart enough to already know. You’ve joined the Free, Aliviana. We decide\nfor ourselves, and there’s power in that. The Chromeria wants you to be\nmodest. Why? If Orholam existed, why would he care how tight your dress\nis or who comes to your bed? Should have bigger problems to tackle, you’d\nthink, wouldn’t you?”\n“Well…” But Liv didn’t have anything to follow that monosyllable.\n“The Chromeria teaches you to hate the very things about yourself that\nmake you strong. You’re beautiful. Use that. Use it however you wish.\nDon’t you see? You choose. Now, you could choose to become a prostitute\n—no, don’t take offense, dammit, it’s a hypothetical! You could do very\nwell, no doubt, and it wouldn’t be wrong because Orholam says it’s wrong:\nit’s not wrong at all. It’s just stupid. It’s a poor use of all your gifts, and it\nlimits your other choices, at least until the world changes. So it’s a bad\nchoice, but not a wrong one. That’s how we draft, too.

What we have here—the\nFree—what we offer, is a free-for-all. But it’s not chaos. Free choices,\nfreely made, but still with consequences. You choose to join the army, you\nhave to obey orders until your time of service is ended. This is a harder\nworld than what you left, Liv. Freedom is hard. If you don’t want me to\ncompliment you because someone told you that you shouldn’t be proud of\nyour beautiful curves, your full lips, your radiant skin, the graceful lines of\nyour neck, your bright eyes, that’s ridiculous. To hell with them. If you\ndon’t want to bed me because you don’t like me, that’s altogether different.”\nHe was terribly smart, wasn’t he? And supremely willful. Powerful.\nShe pushed down a sudden surge of admiration, and a deep and silly\npleasure at his outrageous flattery. She’d never been called beautiful at the\nChromeria. Tyreans couldn’t be beautiful, couldn’t be fashionable, not after\nthe False Prism’s War. “You’re used to getting your way, aren’t you?” she\nasked.\n“Hazard of being handsome and brilliant.”\nShe sniffed. “So is getting punched in the nose.”\nHe raised his hands and stepped back. “I didn’t say I was brave, too.” He\noffered her his arm, and she took it, not able to stop a grin from sneaking\nthrough her defenses. “Mm. Oh, just thought of something. Who was the\nColor Prince? Before he got burned?”\n“Koios White Oak. Why?”\n“Just curious.” Karris’s brother?\n“No secret. What you were is less important to us than what you are, and\nwhat you will become. Now, you get to work on drafting. You have a lot to\nunlearn, and more to learn.”\n“I’m still not going to bed with you,” she said.\n“We’ll work on that,” he said with a wink and a big grin.\nAnd with that, Liv’s education began.\nChapter 39\nWhen Kip shuffled out of the library at midnight, Ironfist was waiting for\nhim at the lift. The huge commander said nothing, but gestured to him.\nKip was instantly alert. Hungry, but alert. He was surprised to see that\nAdrasteia was with the commander. They stepped into the lift together, and\nCommander Ironfist pushed a key into a lock, and took them to a lower\nlevel in the Chromeria than Kip had ever been to. He looked at Teia. She\nlooked back, shrugged.\nThe commander poked his head into a dark hallway. He walked through\nthe darkness. Kip opened his eyes wide, wider, to the sub-red spectrum.\nIronfist radiated enough heat, his whole body gray, armpits and groin\nlighter, and his bare, uncovered head the brightest of all. He went down the\nhall.\n“Kip,” Teia said. Her voice was tight. He couldn’t quite read her\nexpression: sub-red light was inexact and Kip wasn’t practiced with it, but"

Surely not scared of the dark. Not Teia.\nBut of course she was. Almost all drafters were afraid of the dark—even\nlots of sub-reds were. Light was Orholam’s gift; darkness was akin to evil;\nblindness was powerlessness. Her hands were out, and Kip took one. He led\nher down the hall. Ironfist didn’t slow.\nThen Kip realized he was holding hands with Teia, and abruptly felt\nawkward. He sort of spasmed. She couldn’t miss it.\n“Uhm,” he said. “Uh.” He put her hand on his arm instead.\nOh, like a lord leading his lady to a dinner party. Much better. Moron!\nKip cleared his throat, but then thought that anything he said would be\nequally stupid. He scowled and shot a look at her.\nShe was smirking.\nThough of course it was dark so she didn’t know he could see her\nsmirking, he still wanted to die.\nShe said, “I’m… I’m better now.” Her tongue darted out to moisten her\nlips, an odd, hot point in the cool, dark hall. “I… have some trouble\nrelaxing my eyes sometimes.”\nOh, that was right. She could see sub-red. Her color was down farther on\nthe spectrum that way. She would have gotten it on her own. She took her\narm back, awkwardly.\nKip squared his shoulders, put his head down, and followed Ironfist\ndown the halls. It was only a couple of turns before Ironfist took them into a\nroom. He manipulated some mechanism Kip probably wouldn’t have\nunderstood even if he’d been able to see it in visible light, and the ceiling\nbegan glowing, a warm radiant soft white.\nIt was a training room, but not like any Kip had ever seen.\nIronfist began rummaging in a corner while Kip and Teia looked around.\nThere were beams for practicing balance, bars for doing pull-ups, punching\ndummies coated with luxin that would light up in various zones to train\nquickness, punching bags of sawdust and leather, wooden blocking trees, a\npile of cushioned body armor for sparring, terry cloths, targets, and padded\nweapons of every sort.\n“This is the Prism’s training room. He allows us to share it,” Ironfist\nsaid. He had long strips of cloth in each hand. “Give me your hands, Kip.\nStraight as you can, and firm.”\nKip gave him his hands, and Ironfist began wrapping a strip of cloth\naround his wrist.\n“It’s time for you two to learn something,” Ironfist said.\n“What’s that, sir?” Adrasteia asked.\n“There are three scrubs I absolutely can’t let fail.”\n“Who?” she asked.\n“Kip, because his father asked me not to.”\nTeia looked over at him, obviously not happy with the injustice of that.\nKip blushed, then scowled.\nIronfist continued: “Cruxer, because he’s got the potential to be the best\nBlackguard in a generation.”"

He’s the best of us by far,” Teia said.\n“Only through bad luck. But it could happen. Could, but I won’t let it.\nAnd the third is you, Teia.”\n“Me?” she asked. She sounded genuinely shocked.\n“Your color,” Commander Ironfist said. “You can see through cloth,\nwhich means you can see concealed weapons. In a normal year, I could take\nyou even if you had no legs. Your peers would be angry, but in the fullness\nof time they’d realize you’re worth any five of them, even if you couldn’t\nfight at all. I can’t do that, not this year. If I pass you on and you’re terrible,\nit’ll be another blow to the Blackguards’ confidence. It’s important that we\nknow we’re elite. If I’m seen adding obvious mediocrities to our ranks, it\nhurts everyone. Thus, a bastard and an outer-spectrum girl have to look as\ngood as everyone else. Teia, you’ve been hiding how good you are, but\nwithout drafting, you’ll have to get lucky to make it at your current skill\nlevel, and Kip’s a year behind the top students. So you both get extra\npractice, and less sleep.”\nHe finished wrapping Kip’s hands, scowling and being careful with the\nleft, then helped Kip pull gloves on.\nUnder Ironfist’s watchful eye, Kip started punching one of the sawdust\nbags. They’d trained punching forms in their lines during practice, but full\ncontact was different.\n“Not so hard, not yet,” Ironfist said.\nKip got back to hitting the bag, quick but not hard. It hurt his left hand.\nBut mostly keeping his left in a fist wasn’t hard. It was straightening it that\nsent tears down his face. Ironfist set Teia to doing push-ups, with claps in\nbetween. Teia was tiny, so she didn’t have that much body to throw into the\nair, but even then she quickly tired. Ironfist had her continue doing it from\nher knees.\nAfter they got going, Ironfist wrapped his own hands and stepped up to\nthe bag next to Kip’s and started working out himself.\nKip’s hands hurt, but after ten minutes or so, they simply felt warm. He\nwondered if they were bleeding under the wrappings. Ironfist simply let him\nknow that he could start hitting harder. He thought about Liv. He thought\nabout his mother. He thought about the Prism.\nAnd somehow, though his thoughts took him nowhere and he discovered\nnothing new, he felt better after beating the hell out of an inanimate object.\nBut Ironfist kept going, and going. Kip followed. After an hour, Kip was the\nwalking dead. Ironfist threw him a towel and said, “Kip, go to the lift. We’ll\nbe along in a minute.”\nKip left. The temptation to eavesdrop was strong, but the idea of facing\nIronfist’s wrath was daunting. Plus, it just seemed disrespectful. He walked\ntoward the lift, wiping sweat away with the towel."

The glims, or\nsecond-year, and above students had lounges that were reputed to serve\nfood for longer hours—or for the gleams and beams, the third- and fourth-\nyear students, all day and night. But first-year students weren’t allowed.\nYou had to earn everything here, from library access to food.\nKip coughed, and in his sub-red vision the spray shot out in a cloud of\nlittle white and red dots.\nHe raised his hand, and he was in Garriston, covered in green luxin, the\nsmell of gunpowder and blood and luxin and sweat and fear heavy in his\nnostrils. He held up his hand and shot out bullets at the soldiers massed\naround him. A man’s cheek was blown off, head jerking around and then\ntwisting back toward Kip, flinging teeth and blood droplets, the man\nstaggering into him.\nKip put his hand on the man’s forehead, as if blessing him. And shot a\nbullet into his brain, gore blasting back into his open palm.\nHe was pure will, and those who opposed him were nothing but chaff on\na breeze blown about a titan’s knees.\nAnd then he was back, blinking, shivering.\nIt was like all this was so thin, so fragile. A lie. Kip was worrying about\npassing some test? About what fifteen-year-old children thought about him?\nDeath was huge, towering, indomitable, victorious everywhere. One tiny\nlead ball away. A sliver of luxin, and all this was exposed as frippery and\nfolly.\nHe barely had time to dab away the tears from his eyes—he wasn’t\ncrying, why were there tears?—before Ironfist and Teia came down the hall.\nIronfist glanced at Kip but said nothing. They got on the lift. Kip wanted\nto ask him something, but he couldn’t even put it into words. How did\nIronfist do it? How did he kill people, and come back, still himself? How\ndid he straddle the worlds? Ironfist was a rock, unperturbed, solid, an island\nin a sea of madness.\nCommander Ironfist ran his hand over his shaven, bare head. His voice\ncame out low, gravelly. “While my mother bled out her life from that\nassassin’s blade, I held her, Kip. I prayed. Prayed as I never had before, or\nsince. Orholam didn’t hear me. I believed I wasn’t worthy of his gaze, that\nhe sees only the good and great.” His face twisted for a half second in some\nemotion, quickly suppressed. Grief? Desolation? But his voice was level.\n“Kip, the world doesn’t explain itself. You go on.”\n“How?” Kip’s voice sounded small and hollow in his own ears.\n“You just do.”\nKip looked at the commander. That was it?

His body ached; his mind was numb,\ncrying out for sleep, but every time he closed his eyes he saw blood, brains,\nthe bullet blessing.\nDawn was a relief of the only kind he now knew: a move from one kind\nof fight to another. He got up to fill another day. If he was busy enough, he\nwouldn’t have time to think.\nChapter 40\n“She’s a beautiful woman,” Karris said.\nGavin said nothing. They were hiking back through the jungle to their\nown camp. This was the first thing Karris had said since exclaiming over\nthe blue snow—which Gavin had claimed to know nothing about.\n“She likes you,” Karris said.\nGavin said nothing.\n“You can spend the night with her, you know,” Karris said.\nNow she was starting to infuriate him.\n“You’ve been edgy,” Karris said. “Maybe it’ll help calm you down if\nyou go get it out of your system.”\nGavin stopped. “You’re saying this to me. Really. You?”\nKarris gave a tiny shrug. “What I asked earlier… it wasn’t fair. I’ve got\nno claim on you. You and I don’t have anything that should keep you\nfrom… cavorting as you please. You’re the Prism, there ought to be some\nbenefits, right?”\n“Please don’t say stupid things to me, Karris.” Cavorting?\n“I was just—”\n“I’ve made my decision.” And it’s you.\n“And I’m telling you—”\n“Shut the fuck up.”\nUsually, that would have made her explode. This time, she said nothing.\nThey walked in silence. Made camp in silence. Slept in silence.\nSomehow, he did sleep, but he dreamed of colored hells and his\nbrothers. The dread inside him kept that sleep from leaving him rested. By\nthe time Karris woke him for his watch, hours before dawn, the snow was\ngone. While Karris slept, Gavin sat up.

Who\nwould you have been, Sevastian? Could I have killed Gavin and then\nhanded over the reins to you and the world now know peace? What sort of\nworld would this be, if that damned wight hadn’t murdered you?\nA blue wight, too. What did that mean? The very color Gavin had lost\ncontrol of now was the color that had murdered Sevastian. It was the very\ncolor that Dazen had broken out of. Coincidence?\nYes, Gavin, that’s what a coincidence is.\nThe sun rose, but there was only darkness in Gavin’s heart.\nChapter 41\nDazen Guile stared at the dead man in the wall of the green prison. He and\nthe dead man were picking scabs from their knees. They’d been in the green\nhell for days, a week? Surely not two weeks yet. They’d been quietly falling\nunconscious for unknown periods, quietly licking water off the wall, quietly\nstarving. Maybe two weeks, from the scabs.\nAt some point before falling unconscious, he’d drafted tiny slivers of\ngreen. Whatever else it was, luxin was clean. Dazen had pushed luxin out—\nnot out of his palms or under his fingernails, but out of his cuts. First he’d\ndone the cuts on his hands and knees, then finally the inflamed, infected cut\non his chest. The pain had been horrific. Yellow pus had preceded the luxin.\nWhen he woke, he’d licked the wall for moisture for an hour, then did it\nagain, and passed out again. After a third time, only plasma and blood\nleaked from the wound.\nEventually, the fever had passed, leaving him passionless, empty, but\nfinally aware again. Somewhat himself. A weaker self.\nLike the blue prison, this green one was shaped like a squashed ball, a\nnarrow chute above, a trickle of water down one wall, and a narrow drain\nbelow for the water and his waste.\nHis jailer—his brother—apparently hadn’t yet figured out that Dazen\nhad broken out of the blue prison. There must surely be some advantage to\nthat fact, but Dazen couldn’t figure out what it was. All he knew was that\nsince he’d come to this prison, there had been no bread. He hated that thick,\nlumpy, coarse, dense bread—but now he would have begged, would have\nlicked broken glass for it.\nPerhaps his brother did know. Perhaps this was punishment.\nNonetheless, Gavin hadn’t had the guts to starve him to death before,\nand he’d had sixteen years to do that, so Dazen didn’t think Gavin would\nstarve him now. At least not on purpose.\nHe felt weak, and that weakness was temptation. He hadn’t drafted\ngreen since the fever passed, and green was strength, wildness.\nGreen had doubtless saved him, but it was death now.

Every time he drafted a tiny\nsip, he would want to draft more. And green was irrationality, wildness.\nWildness in a cage meant insanity, suicide.\nI’m close enough to that as is.\nHe started building the towers of suppositions again. That was the\nbeauty of years spent drafting blue. It ordered your thoughts, smothered\npassion.\nBlue still hated the illogic of how he thought of his brother as Gavin and\nhimself as Dazen, but he’d held firm to that decision. Gavin was a loser.\nGavin had lost the war, Gavin had let himself be imprisoned. Dazen had\nstolen Gavin’s identity, so let him have it. “Gavin” was the dead man in the\nwall now, he the prisoner, he was Dazen now. He was a new man, and as\nDazen, he would escape and he would win back all that should be his.\nIt was a touch of black madness, he knew. But perhaps a bit of madness\nis the only way to stay sane alone in a dungeon for sixteen years.\nRecenter, Dazen. Dazed. Dozed. Dozen. Doozie. Double. Doubt.\nCertainty. T’s. Bifurcations. Intersections. Directions. Direct. Deceased.\nDead. Dozing. Dazed. Dazen.\nHe expelled a long, slow breath.

He held out his right hand. Either Gavin\nknows I’m in the next prison, or he doesn’t.\nNo, back up.\nEither Gavin had put into place a system that would tell him when I\nmoved from one prison to another, or he hadn’t.\nIf he’d gone to the trouble of making more than one prison, he’d have\nput a system into place to know when I went from one to the other.\nEither his alarm worked, or it didn’t work.\nI’m betting it worked. Nothing Gavin has done has failed so far.\nSo if the alarm worked, it showed that I’ve come here.\nIf it showed I’ve come here, either Gavin hasn’t seen the notice or he\nhas.\nBut I’ve already established that he doesn’t have the guts to starve me.\nSo maybe he hasn’t seen that I’m here.\nWhich leaves another question: what does Gavin do when he travels?\nEither he never travels, or he’s set up a system to get me fed when he does.\nThere’s no way he’d let himself be chained as much as I am, so he’s set up a\nsystem.\nEither he leaves someone else in charge of feeding me, or he has an\nautomated system. Automated systems can easily break, and Gavin\nwouldn’t want to kill me accidentally. But people can’t be trusted.\nTough choice.\nMeh, Gavin believed in people. It was always one of his weaknesses.

It\nwas why Gavin had been able to foil his plan to escape with Karris.\nThat “Gavin” stuck in his blue brain irritated him. Made it hard to think\nabout the time before the prison. Regardless, his brother’s trust was why his\nbrother’s elopement with Karris had failed. Either the new Gavin had\nlearned not to trust people from that failure or he hadn’t. Hmm. Gavin had\nbeen successful in taking Gavin’s place as Prism, which he couldn’t\npossibly do on his own. So Gavin hadn’t learned not to trust. So Gavin did\ntrust someone.\nSo there was someone up there, who had either seen or not seen the\nwarning that Dazen had moved from one prison to another. Either that\nsomeone was punctilious in fulfilling their duties or not. Gavin wouldn’t\nhave trusted someone who wasn’t careful. So that someone was careful.\nEither that someone knew what the warning meant, and what he was\nsupposed to do when he saw it, or he didn’t.\nOr… back up. Either that someone was a woman or a man. Not that it\nmattered, but somehow the thought of some woman running around\npanicking because there was a blinking green luxin light and she didn’t\nknow what to do about it pleased the prisoner immensely. He hoped she\nwas a proud woman. How he missed humbling proud women.\nTangent, Dazen. And a tangent that stirred his lust. He couldn’t afford\nlust, not here, not now. He had once loved to draft green while bedding a\nwoman, loved the wildness, the intensity. But starvation and blue had\nblunted his carnal desires, and green was madness. And madness was death.\nSo…\nGavin wouldn’t have instructed for his brother to be starved to death, so\neventually the woman up there would either do the right thing or the wrong.\nOr many wrong things in a row, looking for the right thing.\nTo do the right thing, she would have to either put bread in a different\nchute or manipulate the original chute so that it aimed toward Dazen’s new\ncell. First, of course, she’d have to dye the bread green.\nBut would she know to dye it green?\nShe would only know to dye it green if Gavin had told her to do so.\nMaybe she was new. Maybe Gavin had kept her in the dark, not wanting to\ngive away any details about the prison below, not wanting to stoke the\nwoman’s curiosity any more than necessary.\nThat was it. That was why it had been a week without food.\nGavin hadn’t left her adequate instructions. She would know that there\nwas food going down to someone. She would get desperate.\nEither Gavin would come back before she did something wrong, or he\nwouldn’t.\nFor the first time in perhaps years, a smile lit Dazen’s features. All he\nhad to do was wait. He would either wait until he died or he would wait\nuntil she made a mistake that led to his freedom.\nWaiting was hell, but it was a hell he was comfortable in. He talked with\nthe dead man to pass the hours. The dead man mocked him, and he mocked\nthe dead man. It wasn’t pleasant, but it was diverting. He could hardly wait\nuntil he broke out and left the dead man down here to die."

Any of his suppositions could be wrong. Gavin might have\ntrusted a woman to watch the prison who had reason to hate Dazen. She\nmight be willfully murdering him, even though she knew exactly what to\ndo. You never knew with women. Or there could be an alarm, but it had\nbroken. How often would his brother check such things, anyway? Maybe\nafter sixteen years he’d gotten careless. Maybe he inspected it every year,\nbut the year had only recently expired, and he hadn’t come yet. Despair set\nin. He had to try something.\nAlmost without willing it, he drafted green. It was warmth on a cold\nnight. It was food to the starving. It was a shot of straight liquor that instead\nof warming his belly went from his eyes to every extremity, washing him\nclean of weakness and paralysis.\nNot too much. Not too much! He cut off the flow before it overwhelmed.\nBut already, looking at the walls made him terribly claustrophobic. His\nfingers twisted into claws and he found himself clawing at the green luxin\nwall.\nStop stop stop! He flung the excess luxin from his fingers. The strength,\nhe knew, was only a veneer of strength. His body was horridly weak. He\nwould pay for anything rash he did. And green was stupidly rash. He\nwanted to charge the far wall and break through it. If he gave in to that\nimpulse, he’d knock himself unconscious, probably die.\nWhat had he even drafted green for? He wasn’t going to punch a hole in\nthe green luxin wall with green luxin. His brother wasn’t that stupid.\nOrholam, his hunger! He shot a tendril of green luxin up the food chute,\nfarther, farther. He pushed around a corner—this chute was shaped\ndifferently than the blue. Of course it was, it had to direct the bread, what,\ntwenty, thirty paces farther away? He tried to hold his patience, but\nOrholam, there was food there. He needed it! There was freedom\nsomewhere up there.\nHe pushed forward, slowly, but not nearly as slowly as the blue would\ncounsel. He didn’t feel the superviolet until it snapped.\nSomething swung sharply shut across the green arm he’d pushed so far,\nsnapped it, snapped his will with it. He lost consciousness.\nThe next day—if day it was—he heard the grinding of gears in the\nchute. He sat up, expectant. Was it his brother, come to gloat, or food to\nsave him?\nHis assumptions had been wrong. Either his brother did want to kill him,\nor the alarm had failed, or… he couldn’t reconstruct the tower now. Not\nwithout fresh blue. He was stupid. He was an animal. He was wasted, thin.\nHe was broken. If it wasn’t bread, he was going to draft green. So it would\nbe suicide. So what? What was so good about living, anyway?\nSomething rattled down the chute.\nHe waited, waited.\nA loaf of bread shot out of the chute, and he caught it. He caught it and\nalmost didn’t believe.

It was blue\nenough.\nChapter 42\nAdrasteia had been summoned. Her mistress herself, Lucretia Verangheti,\nhad ordered her to this dingy home on the far south side of Big Jasper, in\nthe shadow of the walls. Not a pleasant neighborhood.\nA pale, grumbling man opened the door and showed Adrasteia to a nook.\nHe brought tea. Only one cup. Didn’t put it in front of her.\nA woman Adrasteia didn’t recognize came in ten minutes later. She was\nyoung and Ruthgari, with the vanishingly rare true blonde hair and blue\neyes. It would have made her an exotic beauty if she didn’t also have such a\nlong, horsey face. She was dressed in a casual dress, well cut, and she wore\nonly a few jewels. Her hair was long and gorgeous, but bound up in a\npractical bun right now. In all things, she looked like an extremely wealthy\nlady taking her ease in her own home. She sat. Sipped the tea.\n“This isn’t hot, Gaeros,” she said.\nThe man apologized profusely and took it away. He returned almost\nimmediately, put a hot cup in front of her. “We’ll need privacy,” the woman\nsaid.\n“Yes, Mistress.” He left and shut the door after himself.\n“So,” the woman said.\n“So?” Teia asked.\n“I’m your owner, my name is Lady Aglaia Crassos. You may call me\nMistress.”\n“My owner is Lady Lucretia Verangheti.”\n“There is no Lady Verangheti. Or I am Lady Verangheti, depending on\nhow you want to look at it. My family has enemies who would block us\nfrom placing slaves in certain households or positions—say, the\nBlackguard. The fiction of ‘Lady Verangheti’ helps me circumvent such\npettiness.”\n“I’m sorry, Mistress, I don’t mean to be rude, but out of loyalty to my\nmistress…” There had to be some way to say this. “Hrm…”\n“You don’t believe me,” Lady Crassos said. She sounded amused, which\nTeia hoped was good. “It would be an interesting bluff, would it not? Of\ncourse, it would only work on slaves who never meet their mistress—\nmeaning my slaves. Sad.” She pulled out a single piece of vellum and\nhanded it over. It was Teia’s title; she recognized it instantly. Attached to it\non a separate sheet was a writ of transfer, signed by Lucretia Verangheti and\nAglaia Crassos. The handwriting was the same.\nIt took Teia a few moments to understand. If Aglaia wanted to keep her\nownership of Teia secret, she couldn’t own Teia’s title under her real name\nor anyone who bothered to inquire could find out to whom Teia belonged.\nBut she needed to have the writ of transfer already finished in case\nsomething came up that required her to prove ownership quickly—so she"

Why would the woman reveal her ownership\nnow?\n“How good of a liar are you, girl?”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“Simple question. If you’re willful, you will be beaten exquisitely.”\nExquisitely? “I’m pretty good, when I try. Mistress.”\nAglaia Crassos’s face lit up. “Good. Good. Exactly what my sources\nhave told me. Continue to answer honestly and your service for me need not\nbe wholly unpleasant.”\nFear stabbed through Teia. Not wholly?\nAglaia looked around, as if searching for something. She rang her little\nbell, and the serving man instantly came in. “My crop,” she said.\nGaeros knuckled his forehead and disappeared. He was back in\nmoments. He presented her with a riding crop, then turned his back.\nShe cracked the riding crop low against his back. He jerked, but said\nnothing.\nAglaia dismissed him with a wave. “My slaves must anticipate my\nneeds. I believe in disciplining you personally when you don’t. When a lady\nhands off discipline to someone else out of some misplaced sense of\ndaintiness, she can’t know if her discipline is being enforced with too much\nmercy or too much gusto. And slaves—like children or hounds—are best\ndisciplined immediately. I will not always have an enforcer with me, but I\ncarry my strong right arm wherever I go. So when we conclude our\ninterview today, I will beat you. I think it’s important for you to know how\nfirm of a hand your mistress has. It will also let me know how easily you\nbruise, in case I have to beat you someday before you’re to be seen in\npublic.”\nTeia swallowed. The weight of dread made her knees quiver. “Yes,\nMistress.”\n“Kip Guile is your partner in the Blackguard training.”\n“Yes, Mistress. Your pardon, but he was disowned weeks ago. He’s no\nlonger a Guile.”\n“I’m aware of this. But I have reason to believe that Kip may be\nwelcomed back into his family when Gavin Guile returns.”\nTeia ducked her head, made her face show contrition. She was a slave,\nnot a fool.\n“Adrasteia, my brother was the governor of Garriston. He was trying to\nsave that worthless city when Gavin Guile shamed and murdered him and\nmade him look like a traitor. And now my slave is partnered with his\nbastard. A bastard about whom he apparently cares. These are facts.”\nTeia scowled briefly, not sure what her mistress was implying. She\ndidn’t hold the expression. Some owners didn’t like to see unpleasant\nexpressions on their slaves. She also didn’t smile with the vacuous\nimpression that she was an idiot that so many other slaves had mastered.\nAglaia had said she prized intelligence. It might even be true. Best to\nreinforce her mistress’s feeling of superiority without overplaying it."

Best to\nreinforce her mistress’s feeling of superiority without overplaying it.\nAglaia rolled her eyes, like Teia was hopelessly stupid. “I want you to\nkeep my ownership of you secret, understood? If it’s found that I own you,\nbecause of the history between Gavin’s family and mine, you’d likely be\nexpelled from the Blackguard and made worthless to me. I’ll sell you to a\nbrothel at the silver mines in Laurion after I vent my frustrations on you.\nUnderstood?”\nThe silver mines were notorious, the first option for slaves who\ncommitted serious but not capital crimes, and the last resort for slave\nowners exasperated with slaves who rebelled or fled repeatedly. The mines\nwere dangerous, the other slaves more so, and the brothels were worse.\nThey were reserved for the use of the depraved gaolers and their favorite\nslaves: the best of the worst. Teia had a friend, Euterpe, whose owners had\nlost everything during a drought. Finding the local brothels already full with\nslaves and even free women who’d sold themselves into slavery so they\ncould eat, Euterpe’s owners had sworn to her that she would return after\nonly three months. She’d been returned five months later, after her owners\nfinally recovered. She never did. Never smiled. Flinched at the touch of any\nman, even her father, who’d gone mad and hanged himself.\nLaurion was a curse among slaves. A byword. A threat whose mere\nexistence was enough to keep most slaves in line.\nAglaia Crassos didn’t mean it as a threat. Her eyes had as much pity as a\nrattlesnake’s. “You think I wouldn’t do that when you’re worth a fortune if I\nlet the Blackguard buy you?”\nTeia licked her lips, but couldn’t think of any response that mightn’t\nplunge her further into hell.\n“My brother’s death means I’ll inherit twice as much money now as I\nthought I would a few months ago. Vengeance is sweeter than gold. Do you\nknow the girls in Laurion service up to fifty men every day? Fifty! I didn’t\nbelieve it myself, but I’ve known several people who’ve sworn it’s true.\nThey give the girls a measure of olive oil every day. Can you guess why?”\nTeia blinked stupidly, ice in her guts.\n“Because otherwise they get destroyed inside. Death by cock sounds so\nromantic, doesn’t it? But I’m sure it’s not. Fifty each day. And a pretty girl\nlike you… you might do even more. Not many pretty young girls there. Do\nyou understand me?”\nTeia’s knees felt weak. She nodded. She had to get away.\n“So now that we understand each other, tell me, have you seen anything\nworthwhile?”\nTeia gave her report. Kip was fat, had few friends, spent most of his time\nin the library, apparently spending all his time reading about some game.\nHe’d been summoned several times to speak with the Red, and had seemed\ndistraught afterward.

Teia had seen Kip draft green and blue.\nHe didn’t sleep well.\nAll that was fine. It was information Lady Crassos could learn through\nother avenues. But that wasn’t good enough, and Teia knew it.\nFeeling sick to her stomach, Teia also told her mistress that Commander\nIronfist had told her that there were two trainees he couldn’t let fail out of\nthe Blackguard: Cruxer and Kip. She omitted herself.\nThat was obviously news to Aglaia. “That’s good,” she said. “That’s\nvery good. Is there… anything else?”\n“I train with Kip, after midnight, in a special room low in the Prism’s\nTower.” Adrasteia shrugged. “The commander wants him to be good\nenough to make it into the Blackguard by himself.”\nHold back what you can about Kip, too. Don’t tell her about the dagger\nhe has hidden. Keep what you can of your soul.\n“Good enough,” Aglaia said. “Anything else?”\nGive everything else. A slave, not a hero. “I saw someone else using\nparyl when I was out on one of my special jobs.”\nAglaia’s eyebrows shot up, and she made Teia tell her everything about\nit.\n“An assassination,” she said. “Never liked her anyway, but that someone\nwould… hmm. I’ll have to see if she died. Worrying, though, either way.”\nShe didn’t explain who she was talking about. Teia knew better than to ask.\nAglaia seemed to push the thought out of her mind and turned back to\nthe task at hand. She smiled, and it actually seemed genuine. “You’ve\npleased me greatly, girl. I’ll remember this. I know I’m a hard mistress, but\nif you perform well, you’ll be rewarded well. Today, two rewards. First, I’ll\nlet you name one.”\nIt could be a test, a trap. A slave knew there were certain rewards you\ndidn’t ask for. Asking too much made you seem lazy or ungrateful or\ngreedy. But if your mistress were in a good mood, she might change your\nlife on a whim—for the better. “Erase my father’s debt,” Teia said before\nshe thought too much.\n“How much does he owe?” Lady Crassos asked.\n“Seven hundred danars.” It was two years’ wages for a laborer. Her\nfather spent everything now simply paying the interest on it.\n“Seven hundred danars? That is a substantial sum. How did your father\nrun up such a massive sum? He a gambler?”\nTeia ignored the patronizing tone. “He bought my sisters back.” He’d\nbeen crushed when he came back from a trade journey to find that his wife\nhad taken up with another man, had borrowed vast sums to fund a lavish\nlifestyle, and lost everything he’d worked for twenty years to accumulate,\nincluding their house, furniture, jewels, and brewery. His wife had finally\nsold their three daughters to pay her debts. And then only part of the debts.\nAll while he’d been gone.\n“He bought them back. But not you.”"

Her\nmother had only been furious that she had sold Teia too cheaply.\nAfter everything, Kallikrates hadn’t even left his wife. Said she’d gone\nmad.

She held\nout a wrist, bangled with some ugly golden glittering thing.\n“No, my lady.” Guessing too high would be as bad as guessing too low.\n“Guess.” It was an order.\n“Six, seven thousand danars?” Teia said. It couldn’t be worth more than\nfive thousand. Her father would have gotten it for four.\nAglaia’s eyebrow rose for a moment. “Well done, little flower. I got it\nfor five thousand six hundred, and I drove a hard bargain. I thought it would\ncomplement a necklace I have. It doesn’t.” Her expression made it clear that\ntoday was the last time she would ever wear it.\nTeia said nothing. She knew better than to hope.\nAglaia said, “No, no, of course not. Seven hundred danars, for collecting\nsnuff boxes and trinkets and a bit of information? That’s far too rich. I will\nkeep it in mind, though. Something else…?”\n“Training in paryl,” Teia said quickly. If she got in, the Blackguard\nwould probably go to the expense of finding and hiring a private tutor for\nher. Otherwise, she’d have to wait until she was a gleam, or a third-year,\nwhen more specialized Chromeria training started. That was too long.\n“Ah,” Aglaia said. “That might well be more expensive in the long run\nthan erasing your father’s debts. But… it would make you more likely to\nget into the Blackguard, wouldn’t it? An investment.” She thought about it\nfor a moment, while Teia’s heart pounded. “Yes. Done.” She smiled. “And\nan excellent request. Shows a good mind. For a slave. I want you to know,\nI’m quite pleased; if this weren’t our first meeting, I’d skip the beating. But\nI can’t have you thinking I’m soft. Strip down to your shift, girl. I like to\nkeep one layer of cloth on so I don’t leave marks, but there’s no reason to\ngive you more padding than necessary. Beatings can be so tiring in a stuffy\nlittle room.”\nTeia stripped, and Aglaia Crassos carefully beat her horrendously from\nher calves to her shoulders, and then, when Teia thought she was finished,\nshe beat the front of her body from her collarbones to her shins.\nSometimes Teia fantasized about not weeping through a beating, of\nbeing as hard and implacable as Commander Ironfist or Watch Captain\nKarris White Oak, but she wept freely.

Gaeros\ncarried in a platter with a goblet of chilled wine in it.\nThe foul hag took it and drank deeply. “Gaeros, help this one dress,\nand”—she rubbed the beads of perspiration from her upper lip—“summon\nmy room slave, the tall one, Incaros. I find I’ve worked up an appetite.”\n“He awaits you eagerly in the next room, Mistress.”\n“Ah, see! Anticipating my needs!” She turned and put the crop against\nGaeros’s groin. “If you were even a little bit handsome I might reward you\nfor that.” She slapped the crop against his crotch, as if it were playfully, but\nit connected hard.\nA small grunt escaped as the man turned to the side and held himself\nstill for a long moment. His eyes were watery when he opened them. But\nAglaia had already forgotten about him. She turned to Teia and stood over\nher.

He’d discovered a little trick to help his concentration. He was\nstanding at the window, and now he closed the book, keeping a finger\ntucked in to hold his place. He looked left and right. No one was in sight.\nHe turned the book over; its cover was bright blue, drafter’s blue.\nBlue sluiced through him, starting at his eyes, and cleared away every\nobstruction to logic: weariness, emotion, even pain from sitting scrunched.\nKip breathed out and let the blue go. He grabbed another book, on the fauna\nof old Ruthgar when it was called Green Forest. It was actually a pretty\ninteresting book, but he’d grabbed it for its cover as well: drafter’s red. The\nprimary colors—not in the sense artists used the term, but in the drafter’s\nsense, the colors that were closest to their luxin counterparts—were\nendlessly popular. Kip looked at the cover and drafted a bit of red. It blew\nair on the dying sparks of his passion for learning about the cards. He set\nthe book down. Grabbed orange. A thin tendril of that helped him be more\naware of how objects related. He wasn’t doing any of these colors perfectly,\nhe knew. To be counted a drafter of a particular color, you had to be able to\ncraft a stable block of its luxin. Kip couldn’t do that. He could draft only\ngreen and blue. The sub-red had been a fluke, just that once. He’d taken the\ntest. He was a bichrome.\nBut what he could do was pretty darn useful. He opened his book again\nand kept reading.\nOver the last two weeks, he felt like he’d made a lot of progress learning\nNine Kings. Now he had a good sense of the basic strategies—it was, after\nall, only a game. There were whole reams of information he could simply\nignore as well—strategies when playing more than one opponent, game\nvariants played using fewer cards or more, ways to wager money, drafts\nfrom common piles. All unnecessary for him.\nThen, at some point, he had a realization that he’d learned basic strategy,\nbut in studying accounts of great games, he still didn’t understand why\nplayers wouldn’t play their best cards immediately—and with a whoosh like\ndrafting fire, the metagame opened up. Counters that he’d figured were\nunimportant, perhaps vestigial from the ancient versions of the game,\nsuddenly came into play. Strategies to thin the opponent’s deck. Theories as\nto how to balance play styles when addressing decks of certain colors. It\nbecame a game of mathematics, managing piles of numbers and playing\nodds. Playing against a certain deck in a certain situation, your opponent\nwould have a one in twenty-seven chance of having the perfect card to stop\nyou. If he played Counter-Sink now (and he was playing logically), you\ncould infer that he didn’t have it.\nHe walked up to the librarian with the huge black halo of hair, Rea\nSiluz, and handed her back the basic strategy book she’d told him to\nmemorize. “Metagame,” he said."

She had beautiful, full lips. “That was quick.”\n“Quick? That took me weeks!”\n“The next step shouldn’t take you so long.” She handed him a lambskin-\nbound book. “Hang in there with this one. It’s a bit dry.”\nKip took the book. She’d said the last one was interesting. If that had\nbeen interesting and this was dry… But he forgot his complaint as soon as\nhe thumbed open the book. “What’s this?” he asked.\nThe writing in the book was odd, blocky, legible, but unnaturally\ncramped. And unnaturally even. Every letter looked like every other letter,\nwhether it was at the beginning of the word, the middle, or the end.\n“It’s an Ilytian book. Not more than five years old.” She glowed,\ngenuinely excited. “They’ve figured out how to copy books with a machine.\nThink of it! Apparently it’s hideously difficult to make the first copy, but\nafter that, they can make hundreds of copies. Hundreds! In a few days! The\nIlytian scribes are up in arms, afraid their craft will go extinct, but the\ngoldsmiths and clockmakers are flocking to it. They say even tradesmen\nown books in Ilyta now.”\nStrange. There was no personality to it. No human hand had inscribed\nthese lines. It was lifeless, everything the same. No extra space after a\ndifficult sentence to give a reader time to grapple with the implications. No\nspace in the margins for notes or illuminations. No particular care taken on\na memorable line or passage to highlight it for a tired reader. Only naked\nink and the unfeeling stamp of some mechanical roller. Even the smell was\ndifferent.\n“I think I’m going to get bored even faster,” Kip said. “It makes a book\nso… tedious.”\n“It’s going to change the world.”\nNot to something better. “Can I ask something rude?” Kip asked.\n“Generally when you preface a question that way, no, you shouldn’t,”\nRea Siluz said.\nKip tried to figure out a more diplomatic way to ask if she was spying\non him. He looked up, thinking. “Um, then… do lists of the books students\nare reading get passed on?”\n“If librarians wish to keep their jobs, absolutely. Sometimes we neglect\nto write down all the titles, or miss things, however.”\n“Ah. Can you miss that I’ve moved on to this volume?”\n“Want someone to underestimate your skills, huh?” she asked.\n“I don’t know if it’s possible to underestimate my skill at this point,”\nKip said. “I’m hoping my skill takes a leap sometime soon and surprises\neveryone. Including myself.”\n“If you want to take a leap, you have to start playing.”\nKip opened his hands, helpless.\n“I’ll teach you,” she said. “At the end of my shift, I can stay late for an\nhour or two. I’ll bring decks.”\nSo now, a week later, he was waiting for Rea to come play against him\nas she had every day."

I’ll bring decks.”\nSo now, a week later, he was waiting for Rea to come play against him\nas she had every day.\nShe came out and gestured Kip to follow her to one of the side rooms.\n“I’ve figured out your problem,” she said.\n“I’m not smart enough for this game?” Kip asked.\nShe laughed. She had a nice laugh, and Kip was nicely infatuated with\nher. Orholam, was he fickle or what? But the women here had been a\nhandful of heavenly beads nicer to him than the girls back home. He\nwondered if things had been unfairly bad before because he’d had the\nbaggage of his mother back home—or if they were unfairly good now\nbecause he had the father he had. He couldn’t tell—and he never would. He\nwas who he was, and nothing could change it, nothing could tell him how\nthings would have been if his parents had been different, normal.\n“I doubt it’s that, Kip. Every card has a story.”\n“Oh no.”\n“Every card is based on a real person, or a real legend, anyway. But a\nnumber of the cards you’ve described to me are archaic, pulled from use\nyears ago. They’re sometimes known as the black cards, or the heresy\ncards. The odds of the entire game have shifted without those cards. Some\ncards can’t be countered in ways they easily could have when those cards\nwere in play, and so forth. You can’t tell anyone you’ve been playing with\nthose cards, Kip. Playing with heresy is a good way to get a visit from the\nOffice of Doctrine. But I’ll tell you this: you won’t win against someone\nplaying with black cards. The basics are still the same, but all the deep\nstrategy books in the last two hundred years have been written around the\nholes that yanking those cards has created.”\n“There’re no books with those cards in them?”\nShe hesitated. “Not… here.”\n“Not here here, or not in the Chromeria?”\n“The Chromeria prizes knowledge so highly that even horrid texts\ndescribing the rituals the Anatians used when they would pass infants\nthrough the flames haven’t been destroyed. Indeed, when they’ve gotten so\nold that they need to be copied or disintegrate to dust, we still copy them.\nAlbeit with rotating teams of twenty scribes. Each scribe copies a single\nword, and then moves on to the next book and the next, so that the\nknowledge may be preserved without contaminating anyone fully. Not\neverything that goes into the dark libraries is similarly evil—much is simply\npolitical, but only the most trusted people are allowed beyond the cages.”\n“Like who?” Kip asked.\n“The Chief Librarian and her top assistants, of course. The Master of\nScribes and his team. Some luxiats who’ve been given special dispensation\nby the White. Full drafters who have submitted applications for specific\nresearch are sometimes granted single books or are accompanied in there.\nBlackguards, and the Colors. And sometimes the Colors grant permission to\ncertain drafters, but those have to be approved by the Chief Librarian, who\nanswers to the White herself.”\n“Blackguards?”\n“They’re the most likely to have forbidden magic used against them as\nthey protect the Prism or the White. And, unofficially, they’re also the ones"

And, unofficially, they’re also the ones\nwho need to know what longstanding feuds there are, so they can prepare\ndefenses against the right people.”\nIt was a light in darkness. A way Kip could kill about fifteen birds with\none stone: he could learn the game, he could try to dig up dirt on Klytos\nBlue, and he could try to find out if his mother had simply been smoking\ntoo much haze or if there had been something to her accusations about\nGavin. All it required was that he do what he’d already decided he had to\ndo: get into the Blackguard. Easy. Ha.\n“Blackguards being allowed in doesn’t include scrubs, does it?”\nShe chuckled. “No. Nice try.”\nHis immediate problem, though, was the games with his grandfather.\nAnd he knew, even though he’d been ignoring it because she was pretty and\nhelpful, that he probably shouldn’t share anything at all with Rea Siluz.\n“So I’ve been wasting my time,” Kip said.\n“You can win, but you won’t win consistently, even if you play well.\nThe odds you’d judge from are the wrong odds.” She shrugged.\n“And I can’t find the real odds by playing because no one plays with the\nheretical cards Andross Guile has in his decks, and I can’t find out the real\nodds by studying because I’m not allowed into those libraries?”\n“Pretty much.” She looked like she wanted to say more, though.\n“Or?” Kip prompted.\n“There’s someone who might help you, a woman named Borig.”\n“Borig?” It had to be the ugliest name for a woman Kip had ever heard.\n“She’s an artist. A little eccentric. Be respectful. The spies who check in\non you are accustomed to you and me spending the next two hours playing\nin this room. If you leave by the back and take the stairs down a level, you\ncan slip out without them seeing you. It’s important, Kip, for her sake as\nwell as yours, that you not be followed or overheard. The Office of Doctrine\nis more academic now than it once was, but with the recent troubles, there’s\nbeen talk of appointing a few luxors. You don’t want to run afoul of people\nwho are afraid. Not now.”\n“Luxors?”\n“Lights mandated to go into the darkness. Empowered to bring light by\nalmost any means they deem necessary. There were… abuses. This White\nwouldn’t stand for them to be appointed again, but Orea Pullawr is not a\nyoung woman, Kip.”\nIt made Kip feel sick to his stomach. There were layers on layers of\nintrigue here, everywhere lurking under the surface. And any one of them\ncould engulf him. “Where is she?” he asked.\nRea gave him directions, and he left immediately. Down the tower,\nacross the bridge, into Big Jasper. He was walking through a narrow alley\nbefore he realized that sneaking away might be dangerous. Might be a\nsetup. How stupid was he? Someone had tried to kill him once already.

He\ndidn’t know Rea Siluz’s loyalties, and she had both given him the problem\n(the existence of black cards) and the solution (visiting someone who might\nnot exist, in a place far from safety).\nHe should go home right now. He should stop playing with Rea Siluz,\nand he should… What? Wait until he was a Blackguard? Ignore every\nsummons from his grandfather? That wouldn’t work. The old man wouldn’t\nlet Kip show him that kind of disrespect. Kip didn’t know what Andross\nGuile would do, but it would be bad. Very, very bad.\nIf only Gavin would come back. Gavin could protect him. Even though\nKip had heard people say that Gavin was afraid of Andross Guile—that\neveryone was afraid of Andross Guile—it felt like Gavin could arrive and\nsolve all of his problems in an instant. Kip could go back to being a child\nagain.\nA child tasked with destroying the Blue.\nOrholam have mercy. Kip couldn’t count on anyone. He had to make the\nbest of it. He had to go on.\nIt was late afternoon. The stars of this district had their light focused\nelsewhere. Here, the buildings were close, the shadows long. He looked\nover his shoulder.\nSure enough. A large, unkempt man was looming at the mouth of the\nalley. The man drew a knife from his belt. It was roughly the size of a sea\ndemon.\nKip ran.\nIt was only twenty paces to the nearest lightwell. Kip skidded to a stop.\nHe fumbled with his pocket, pulled out his spectacles as the big man\ncharged after him. Put them on his face.\nThe big man pulled up short. Raised his hands. “Didn’t see you there,\ndrafter, sir. Was just running, uh, home. No offense.”\nKip hadn’t even started drafting. In truth, he probably wouldn’t have had\ntime to draft before the big man killed him.\nBut the man didn’t know that. He backed away, as if from a wild animal,\nthen ran.\nJust a thug. Just a thief. Nothing personal. No conspiracy. No\nassassination attempt.\nAnd Kip hadn’t even thought of the fighting skills that Ironfist and\nTrainer Fisk had been beating into his skull. He looked down at his hands.\nHis knuckles were chafed, fists bruised from constant use, and Kip had\nsimply… forgotten it all. Hadn’t even occurred to him that he could fight.\nHe tucked his spectacles back in a pocket, and saw that the door in front\nof him was labeled: Janus Borig, Demiurgos.\nHe knocked and swore he saw dark-clad figures up several stories on\neither side of the alley bob out of nowhere quickly and disappear. He felt\nthe weight of hidden eyes.\nJumpy, Kip. Jumpy.\nAn old woman opened the door. She was almost bald, and she was\nsmoking a long pipe.

She was wrinkly and ugly as afterbirth, but plainly vigorous,\nand there was such warmth in her features, Kip found himself grinning\nalmost immediately.\n“So. You’re the bastard,” she said. “Rea told me you’d come. Come in.”\nChapter 44\nThe first thing Kip noticed about Janus Borig’s home was that it was home\nto the largest mess Kip had seen in his life. The mess had paws in every\nnook, had shed fur in every cranny. Piles of clothes like coughed-up\nhairballs hid the floor, and stacks of books stood like trees for the mess to\nmark its territory. The mess seemed to have little sense of human valuation,\nbecause old gnawed-on chicken bones shared floor space with strands of\npearls and either jewels or colored glass close enough to jewels to fool\nKip’s eyes.\nThe second thing he noticed was the guns. Janus Borig liked guns. There\nwas one attached to the door, swiveling toward the peephole, in case Janus\ndecided to kill a visitor rather than welcome him. But others were scattered\neverywhere, as if the mess had gotten into them and tossed them about.\nPistols, the latest flintlock muskets, matchlocks, blunderbusses—there were\nhandy ways to kill people everywhere.\n“Don’t touch anything,” Janus said.\nWhich was impossible, thanks.\n“Half the things in here will kill you if you nudge them wrong.”\nOh. Lovely.\nShe spun around and put something down on a shelf. It was a tiny pistol.\nShe took a drag on her long pipe, contorted her lips into a quasi-smile, and\nblew smoke out of both sides of her mouth simultaneously. “Promise me\nsomething, bastard of the greatest Prism to ever live.”\nShe turned over her pipe and tapped out the ashes into a small pile of the\nsame. She picked up another pistol, cocked it, and then used the spur of the\nhammer to scrape out the remaining ashes from her pipe. With every scrape,\nthe cocked—and for all Kip knew, loaded—pistol rotated from being\npointed at Kip’s forehead to being pointed at his groin.\nTo his left and right, there were piles; he couldn’t move anywhere\nwithout touching something.\n“Uh, yes?” Kip said.\n“Promise me you won’t kill me or report me to those who might.”\n“I promise,” Kip said.\nShe sucked at her lips, making a squeaking sound, then spat. She put\ndown the pistol and grabbed at a pile of tobacco, stuffed some in her pipe,\neyeing Kip closely. He swore there was a pile of black powder right next to\nthe pile of tobacco. She snatched a fuse cord from one of the matchlocks\nand stuck it onto the flame of a lantern, then used the fuse to light her pipe.\n“Swear it,” she said from behind a curtain of smoke.\n“I swear,” Kip said.\n“Again.”\n“I swear.”\n“And thus are you bound. Come with me,” she said.\nKip picked his way around piles that reached up to his knees. The\nwoman wasn’t right."

The\nwoman wasn’t right.\nHe followed her upstairs. It was, apparently, her workroom. The division\nbetween the rooms was stark. The mess didn’t set one grubby paw beyond\nthe stairs. There was no disorder here, none. Every surface was immaculate,\nall done in white marble with red veins. Jewelers’ lenses and hammers and\nchisels hung beside tiny brushes, special lanterns, palettes, and little jars of\npaint. One desk was slate, with little bits of chalk and an assortment of\nabacuses, large and small. An easel sat opposite, with a blank canvas on it, a\nmagnifying lens in front of it.\nOne wall was dedicated to finished cards. They were hung so densely\nthat you couldn’t touch the wall. And the wall was so big, so packed—from\nfloor to ceiling—that if Kip hadn’t spent the last weeks in the library,\nmemorizing everything he could learn about these cards, he’d have no idea\nthat every single one of them was worth a fortune. These were originals.\nAnd there were too many of them. Kip sucked in a sudden breath.\n“The Black Cards. The heresy decks,” Janus said. She sat on a little\nstool in front of her easel. “You know of them.”\n“I’ve barely heard a whisper,” Kip said. “I—not really.”\n“What colors have you drafted, Kip Guile?”\nKip felt a chill, displacement, sickness. “That’s not my name,” he said\nstiffly.\n“There is no one else you can be, Kip. I’ve seen your eyes. You think\nyou’re smart, but the truth is—”\n“Right, I know, everyone tells me—”\n“—you’re a lot smarter than you think you are.”\nWhich left him dumbstruck. Ironically enough.\n“You’re a Guile to your bones, young man. Even if you’re not a son, a\nbastard can go far in this world. The Guiles are cursed, don’t you know?\nThe family has few children, and has had few for generations. Intense lights\nall snuffed too soon. So goes the story, anyway. Now, what colors have you\ndrafted?”\n“Why do you want to know?”\n“Because I’m starting your card.”\nShe was speaking another language, or nonsense. Kip knuckled his\nforehead.\n“I have a gift,” Janus Borig said. “Curious, curious gift. Unusual. I have\na host of gifts that are common enough, of course, though not common all\ntogether, and one gift as rare as a Prism’s.”\n“I suppose you’re going to tell me,” Kip said. Someone is telling you\nsomething interesting, and you have to let your big yap interfere?\nBut she laughed. “Green, of course. But blue, too. What else? You’re not\nmerely a bichrome, I’m certain of that.”\nWant to play it like that?\n“You can paint,” Kip said. “Very skilled, and you’re a jeweler, too. You\ncan split a stone finely enough to fit it on your cards.”"

You, on the other hand, have all the\nuncommon abilities in the world from which to guess.”\nNine colors left? Eleven colors? What the hell was she talking about?\n“You’re teasing me,” Kip said.\n“Maybe we’ll know each other well enough someday that you’ll be able\nto figure that out,” she said. “Smoke?”\nHuh? “Sub-red,” Kip said, thinking she was guessing what he could\ndraft.\nShe lowered her pipe. Oh, she’d been offering to share her pipe. But she\nsaid quickly, “You’ve drafted sub-red, or fire?”\n“Same thing,” Kip said.\n“Answer the question.”\n“Fire.”\n“Do you know, a scheme can be useful without being true. You can see\nsub-red?”\n“Yes,” Kip said. Suddenly, he wasn’t sure why he’d come. Curiosity?\nMaybe it hadn’t been a good enough reason.\n“Can you see superviolet?” she asked.\nHe nodded, grudgingly. He wasn’t even sure why he was loath to give\nher more information.\n“Do you want to be a Prism, Kip?”\nIt was like she had a trick of asking questions that he didn’t want to ask\nhimself. “Everyone probably thinks about that,” Kip said.\n“You don’t know if you want it or not. Part of you does, but you don’t\nthink you could ever be the man your father is.”\n“That’s crazy talk,” Kip said. He swallowed.\n“No, it’s not. I know crazy talk. I know it well. I am a Maker. We are not\nmere artists; we are the caretakers of history. The cards are history. Each\none tells a truth, a story. The Black Cards tell history that has been\nsuppressed, because it threatens…” She looked up at the ceiling, thinking,\nlooking for the right word. She gave up. “Well, it threatens. Take that as you\nwill.”\nShe smoked, thinking.\n“What I’m about to tell you is heresy. Don’t repeat it, if you value your\nlife. Heresy, but true. Take these words, and bury them, treasure them.\nThere are seven Great Gifts, Kip. Some are common. Others are given only\nto one person a generation, or one person a century. Light is truth, and all\nthe gifts are connected to this foundation. To light, to truth, to reality. Being\na drafter—one who works with light—is a great gift, but a relatively\ncommon one. Being a Prism is another. Being a Seer, who sees the essence\nof things, that is much rarer. My gift is rare as well: I am a Mirror. My gift\nis that I can’t paint a lie. And my gift tells me that your father has two\nsecrets. You, Kip, are not one of them.”\nChapter 45\n“So what’s your real name?” Gavin asked the Third Eye, coming to stand"

She had kept her vigil on the southernmost point of\nSeers Island, and the descending sun bathed the woman in gold. “Or what\nwas it, before? Who are your people?”\nThe Third Eye was dressed in a yellow cotton dress that made her look\nmerely mortal, though she was still a striking, radiant figure. She hadn’t\nsent for Gavin until late afternoon. Her associate, or servant, or friend,\nCaelia, told Gavin that seeing the future took time.\n“Oh no you don’t,” the Third Eye said. “You’re probably one of those\nmen who accuses women of being capricious, too.”\n“Huh?”\n“You ask me last night not to tempt you, to be more formal, and today\nthe first thing you do is ask for greater familiarity. Uh-uh, Lord Prism. In\nyour vanity you can take pleasure in breaking other hearts. Not mine.”\nVanity? That was a little offensive, a little blunt, a little… accurate. He\nmade to speak, then found he had nothing to say.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “The aftermath of Seeing is… I forget myself. It’s\nhard not to be honest. My apologies.” She snapped open a handfan and\nfanned herself. “I’m afraid I’ve overheated, too. My skin doesn’t well\ntolerate so much sun.”\nShe did indeed look like she’d have a good burn.\n“Seeing requires light, you said?” Gavin asked.\nShe nodded but didn’t seem interested in explaining her gift any more\nthan that.\n“Did you find it?” Gavin asked finally.\n“Many times, and down many paths. It’s in the sea.”\n“Pardon?”\n“The bane is floating, somewhere in the Cerulean Sea.”\n“That is…” Useless? Unhelpful? “… a large area,” Gavin said. She’d\nsaid three hours east and two and a half hours north—which would be in the\nsea from here, but somehow he was sure this wouldn’t be that easy.\n“I’m aware of this. It is also fairly hard to find landmarks or time\nmarkers to tell you where to find it in the sea. It’s moving through the\nwater.”\nGavin threw his hands up. “Where’s it going? Where’s it coming from?”\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I think I can tell you it’s heading toward center. A\ncenter? The center… I’m not sure.” She looked apologetic.\n“The center of the sea? Like White Mist Reef? Or the center like\nsinking?”\n“Bane float, most of the times.”\nTimes, plural. “That doesn’t give me anything.”\n“It gives you enough.” If the bane was floating toward White Mist Reef,\nthen taking the calculations backward, it would be somewhere south of the\nIlytian city of Smussato, perhaps floating in a line from the border between\nParia and Tyrea. If he knew where it was going, and he could guess that it\nwould go straight, and he knew where it was going to be at any one time,\nthat should give him a line on which it must be.\n“You mean I’m going to find it?” Sudden hope.\n“Yes.”"

There’s something else I should tell you.”\n“There’s a thousand other things you should tell me!”\n“If you take Karris when you go fight it, you’re much more likely to\nsucceed.”\n“I could have guessed that myself. She’s a useful woman.”\n“And if she goes with you, she’ll almost certainly die.”\n“Had to be a catch, didn’t there?” Gavin said.\n“I’m not trying to give you a catch; I’m trying to give you a chance.”\nHe shrugged that off. “ ‘Almost certainly’ as in ninety-nine times out of\na hundred, or as in two times out of three?”\n“When I see her go with you, I watch her die in dozens of different\nways. It’s not pleasant for me. Especially since I know that if she lives,\nwe’re probably going to be friends someday. Assuming you don’t bed\ncertain… you know what?

Good day.”\nHe bowed and left. He was only a few steps away when he thought he\nheard her murmur something.

It had taken\neight. Though Liv had spent half her waking hours with the Color Prince,\nshe knew there were entire currents passing right beneath her eyes that she\ndidn’t even see. For a superviolet accustomed to seeing that which others\ndidn’t, it was discomfiting.\nOne day, a general was found hanged from the open portcullis of the\nTravertine Palace. Liv only found out after the fact that he had been one\nwho’d advocated staying put, satisfied with regaining Tyrea and settling\ndown in their new country.\nThe Color Prince had opened his court that day, saying, “While there is\noppression anywhere, there is freedom nowhere.”\nLiv heard the statement repeated a dozen times that day, and the next\nday as they marched. He was too busy for her for weeks, spending all his\ntime with his military commanders. Liv was on the outside, literally and\nfiguratively. She rode close to the front, but not with the commanders or\nadvisers. She wasn’t certain of her place, and no one else was either.\nThe women and men who’d been with the prince since he’d left Kelfing\ndidn’t trust her. She was the enemy general’s daughter. Again. How that\ninfuriated her. In switching sides, her father had managed to make her be\ncast out from the opposite side than those who’d treated her like an outcast\nfor her entire youth.\nAfter two weeks on the road, one night the Color Prince summoned her\nto his tent, which was ostentatiously small and plain. A man of the people.\nLiv wondered how such transparent tricks worked. But work they did.\n“So, Aliviana, have you learned your purpose yet?” he asked.\n“You only have perhaps half a dozen superviolets in your whole army. I\nmay be the best of them. I know that you’re looking for more, and you’re\nlooking for a test that will help you identify superviolets. Your methods are\ncrude compared to the Chromeria’s. The general level of your drafters’\nabilities is poor, and you’re hoping that the perspectives I bring might be\nvaluable to you. That last is speculation, but well supported, I think. So I\nthink you want me to train your superviolets.”\nBack in the Chromeria, the magisters had warned their disciples"

So I\nthink you want me to train your superviolets.”\nBack in the Chromeria, the magisters had warned their disciples\nconstantly not to rely too much on their luxin to shape their thoughts or\ntheir feelings. Here, it was encouraged, and Liv wasn’t sure yet which\napproach was better. If you were burning away your life by drafting as the\nChromeria taught, it made sense to train young drafters not to draft when\nthey didn’t have to. But it had never been clear to Liv that the prohibitions\nwere solely utilitarian. They’d been moral warnings, as if luxin were wine\nand those who relied on it were morally weak.\nIf so, she was weak. But the superviolet gave her clarity, and distance\nfrom her feelings of inadequacy, of loneliness. She used it and then yellow\nto pull problems apart, examine them from new angles, and peer right\nthrough them, all the time.\nHe poured himself some brandy, held up a finger, watched it as it turned\na dull hot red, and touched it to his zigarro. “That’s all you have for me?”\n“You were Koios White Oak,” Liv said. Karris White Oak’s supposedly\ndead brother.\n“Past tense?” he said grimly into his brandy.\nShe had no answer.\n“How’d you find out?” he asked.\n“I asked,” she admitted. Not exactly genius deduction.\n“And what does this revelation tell you?” he asked.\n“Not as much as I’d hoped.”\nHe swallowed the rest of his brandy in a gulp. “Come with me.”\nThey walked through the camp in the low light of the shrouded moon\nand a thousand campfires. As soon as he stepped out of the tent, two\ndrafters and two soldiers clad in white fell in beside them.\n“The Whiteguard?” Liv suggested. It smacked of desperation to be taken\nseriously, a mockery of the Prism.\n“Are there no mirrors in nature?” he asked, seeming to read her\nthoughts. “There have been four attempts on my life. One by one of my\nformer generals. Three by parties unknown. Light cannot be chained, but\nthe Chromeria hopes it can be extinguished.”\nThey passed the camp in its thousands. It was more organized than when\nit had marched on Garriston. Practice, Liv supposed. Few people even\nnoticed their leader moving down the path, and those who did didn’t seem\nto know how to salute him. Some bowed. Some prostrated themselves.\nSome gave a more military salute.\n“The blues want me to standardize the response to me,” the prince said\naround his zigarro. “But I only want to impose what order is needful. More\norder is needful while directing an army than I would like, but once we tear\ndown what the Chromeria has built, the needs will change. All will be free\nin the light.”\nThey stopped in front of a gallows on the western edge of the camp.\nFour men were hanged there. In the low light of torches, Liv couldn’t see\ntheir faces, but she did see the unnaturally elongated necks. The prince held\nup a hand and a beam of yellow light shone on the dead men.

The birds\nhad been feeding on them.\nLiv didn’t know much about how bodies rotted, but she knew enough to\nbe able to tell that these men had been dead for more than a day. So they\ncouldn’t be criminals; the army had just arrived here.\n“They’re our zealots. Martyrs now. These were men I sent to spread the\nnews to Atash, to prepare the way for us. They went unarmed. They were\nonly to speak, to convince. Their tongues were torn out and they were\ntortured before they were hanged. The Atashians didn’t even wait for them\nto cross the border. Invading our land to kill the unarmed? This is a\ndeclaration of war and commencement of hostilities. Atash has sown the\nwind. They will reap the whirlwind.”\n“You tell a lot of lies, don’t you?” Liv asked. Then she swallowed. The\nsuperviolet made her understand structures, but not necessarily obey them.\nThe prince’s guards stiffened. Liv saw glares of hatred from them. But\nthe prince looked over at her curiously. “I forget who you are,” he said.\nThen his voice cooled. “But perhaps you do, too.”\nShe swallowed again.\n“I don’t deny that I already intended to liberate Atash, but they have\ndrawn first blood. Against innocents. And let me tell you this, Aliviana\nDanavis. It’s time for you to step beyond the illusions of your childhood. A\nlie told in the service of truth is virtue. Do you know why Ilytian pirates\nhave plagued the Cerulean Sea for centuries?”\n“Because they have safe havens and the Ilytian coast is treacherous for\nthose who don’t know—”\n“No. Because men are bad at judging their own long-term interests.\nSatraps hate the pirates. Traders hate the pirates. Families whose fathers are\npressed into their service hate them. Parents whose sons are enslaved to pull\nan oar hate them. But though the pirates have been bruised a few times—\nand I’ll be the first to acknowledge this is one good thing that the so-called\nPrism has done—they always come back. And why? Because satraps find it\neasier to pay them off than to crush them forever. There are currently four\npirate lords in Ilyta, and each of them has signed contracts with the\nAbornean satrapah swearing not to attack ships flying the Abornean flag.\nDo you know what happens to the money that satrapah sends to those\npirates?”\nLiv grimaced. “It enriches the pirates.”\n“It finances more piracy, and the dreams of every pirate to become a\npirate lord himself. Satraps have looked at the problem and despaired. From\ntime to time, they’ll go after one pirate lord who broke a treaty, and\nsometimes they’re even successful in hanging a boatful of men. But it never\nsticks. No one is willing to put her money or men on the line to help others,\nso then when it’s her ships getting stolen and scuttled, no one is willing to\nhelp her in return. Now, don’t you think the Seven Satrapies would be better"

Now, don’t you think the Seven Satrapies would be better\noff if they worked together for once and simply took care of the problem?\nNot just better off now, but better off for a hundred years?”\n“If you could really stop it. You really think you can accomplish what\nsatraps and Prisms have failed to do?”\n“Absolutely. It’s purely a matter of will, and that I have in infinite\nsupply.”\nHis audacity was breathtaking.\n“That’s small, Liv,” he said. “Slavery. Nature made not slaves, nor\nshould man. You’re Tyrean, and your land hasn’t been tainted as much as\nothers, but slavery’s a curse. I’ll end it. The Chromeria is the same. It comes\nand sweeps up the flower of a nation—its drafters—and takes them away.\nIndoctrinates them. Returns them only to those places it favors, and fools\nthe young drafters into thinking they’re doing it for their own good. Like\nslavery, a curse that corrupts those on both sides. Everyone has said these\ninstitutions are too big to change. I say they’re too big not to change. I lie in\npursuit of that. Say it will be easier than it will be. I admit it. I lie carefully,\nand only to motivate people toward their own good and the good of the\nSeven Satrapies.”\nLiv believed him, but the superviolet part of her compelled her: “Who\ndecides which ends are worth lying for?”\nHe shook his head sadly. “You think I do this lightly? Look at what the\nChromeria has wrought. Your father is a drafter. He’s my enemy right now,\nbut I can recognize him as a great man. A great soul. Would not almost\nanything be better than murdering him? Are your hands any cleaner because\nyou ask someone else to do the murdering for you?”\nShe felt sick thinking about it. Her father was old for a drafter. He’d\ndrafted little for most of her youth, but now, fighting, he would be drafting\nalmost every day. He had a couple years at most. “Can’t… maybe they can\nbe convinced that the Freeing is unnecessary? That wights aren’t evil? That\n—”\n“Convinced? Liv. The Freeing isn’t incidental to the Chromeria’s order.\nIt’s the central pillar. Without the Freeing, there’s no necessity for the\nChromeria. If drafting isn’t oh so very dangerous, you needn’t send your\ndaughter to a far country to learn it. Without that, there’s no indoctrination,\nand no capture of the most valuable commodity in the whole world—\ndrafters. Without control over and a monopoly on the drafters, the whole\nhouse comes down. That’s why this.” He pointed to the dead men.\nA wind gusted and blew foul putrefaction into Liv’s nose. She coughed\nand turned away.\n“You might wonder why I haven’t cut them down, given them a decent\nburial. I will. After all of our people march past this, and see what kind of\nanimals we’re fighting. Because I refuse to cover up the Chromeria’s sins,\nand I refuse to take part in them.” He stared at the bodies for another"

Not… now,” Liv said, looking at the bodies, feigning\nhardness.\n“I favor you because of your mind, Aliviana. You needn’t restrict\nyourself to the lecture at hand.”\nShe wondered at that. How much was true, how much was flattery? But\nit warmed her nonetheless. “The gods,” she said, “are they real?”\nA twist of a smile. “What does Zymun say?”\n“He says they are.”\n“But?”\n“But he’s Zymun, and you’re you.”\nThe Color Prince laughed aloud. “Perfectly put. You ought to be an\norange.”\nShe thought he was teasing her for her ineloquence, but then realized he\nmeant it. What she’d said was the safest thing she could have said: it could\nmean anything or nothing.\n“Yes, they are real. Though I don’t believe their exact nature is like\neither the Chromeria or the new priests think. I like you, Aliviana. You ask\nthe right questions. You think big. But you don’t think big for yourself.\nYou’re too modest. I need my drafters trained, of course. That is a purpose,\nand a worthy one—but it’s not a great purpose.”\n“Does it have to do with Zymun?” she asked.\n“Zymun? Oh, you fear that I’m trying to pair you off with him?”\n“He’s certainly doing his best, my lord.”\n“Yes, I’m not surprised. Zymun never underestimates himself. No, I put\nyou with Zymun because you’re of an age and I thought you’d appreciate\nthat. And it keeps both of you busy. If you prefer another tutor…?”\n“No, my lord. I’ve rather grown… used to him, I should say.” So long as\nshe didn’t insult Zymun’s own intelligence, which he couldn’t bear, he was\nan unending fount of praise for her abilities, for how quickly she mastered\nabstruse concepts and remembered obscure history. He made her feel good\nabout herself. Special. And his ceaseless attempts at seduction made her feel\ngrown-up, womanly, desirable. “Only… he doesn’t speak about his past\nmuch.”\n“The only important thing for you to know about Zymun’s past is that he\ntried to assassinate the Prism,” the Color Prince said.\n“He really did? He said something, but I thought he was—”\n“I gambled. Sent Zymun on a mission that had a low chance for success.\nHe thinks he failed, which is good. It helps me keep him in line. Truth is, he\nonly half failed. History may give him credit for midwifing…” His voice\ntrailed off. He looked up at the sky.\n“A new era?” Liv suggested. “Midwifing a new era?” She followed his\ngaze as the moon emerged, illuminating the nighttime clouds.

The vision—for such a thing couldn’t be real, could it?—\nlasted for perhaps twenty seconds, then the clouds broke under the\nonslaught of the winds, smeared, scattered.\nThe Color Prince broke the silence. “New gods, Aliviana. New gods.”\nChapter 47\n“Secrets?” Kip asked. “What secrets?”\n“I don’t know. Yet,” Janus Borig said. “That’s why I brought you here\ntoday. I wanted to know if you were one of them.” She sucked at her teeth.\n“You’re not.”\n“So is that good news or bad news?” Kip asked.\n“It is very, very bad news.”\n“I still don’t understand,” Kip said.\n“Understatement.”\n“Huh?”\n“Come here.”\nKip came to her side. She showed him her sketches. The first was of a\ncloaked, hooded figure, lit from behind, long hair falling in front of his eyes\nin a dark curtain, eyes dimly gleaming from behind the mass, a beard with\ngleaming beads woven in, a dagger drawn. An assassin? Another showed a\nbald, ebony-skinned man, bleeding from a cut under one eye, wearing an\neye patch, spinning short swords in both hands. Another showed—\n“Wait, that’s Commander Ironfist,” Kip said.\n“Ah, so it is. Thank you,” she said. “What happened to his hair?”\n“He’s in mourning for his lost Blackguards.”\n“Ah yes, of course.”\n“Why are you asking me? Why does he only have one eye?”\n“Does he not only have one now? Hmm. It’s not always literal.” Her\nhead tilted to the side. She scrawled an old Parian word on the paper below\nIronfist.\n“Guardian?” Kip asked.\n“Sentry. Watchman. Guardian. Vigil Keeper. Strong Tower. Quiet.”\n“Quiet?” Kip asked. “How’s that fit?”\n“Not him. You. Be quiet.”\n“Oh, oh, sorry.”\nShe drew a scrawl around his neck. A necklace. But her hand paused\nwhen it got to what was hanging from the chain. She sucked at her pipe,\nbringing the dormant coals back to life. Then she sighed. “Lost it.”\n“I’m still back at what you’re doing with Commander Ironfist,” Kip\nsaid. There was some corner of dread turning over in his soul. She turned\nher eyes on him, and his heart flipped over and convulsed, tried to crawl off\nthe squeaky clean floor to the stairs, its palpitations making it hop like a\nderanged bunny, the worst escape attempt in history.\n“Do you think being Prism is too small for you, boy?”\n“You keep saying these things that make no sense to me,” Kip said.\n“Because I keep trying to draw you as the next Prism, and I can’t. You\nwon’t be the Prism, Kip.”\n“I don’t aspire to that,” Kip said. A chill. Like being collared by history.\n“Do you aspire to more?”\n“There is no more, is there?” Kip asked. What could be bigger than\nbeing the Prism?"

Sure: Fatty. Lard Guile. Bastard. Pokey.”\n“Something else. Maybe I’ve gone about this wrong. Maybe instead of\ntrying to make your card, maybe I should try to decide which card is\nyours.”\n“Look, I just came here to learn how to play better. Can you help me or\nnot?”\n“What do you know about Zee Oakenshield?”\n“Nothing,” Kip said. He’d never even heard the name.\n“Do you know anything about the cards?”\n“I know all sorts of things about the cards. I’ve memorized seven\nhundred and thirty-six of them by name and ability. I’ve committed a dozen\nfamous games to memory. I know twenty of the standard decks and why\nthey work. Does that count for anything?”\n“No.”\n“Oh hell.” If Kip had honestly wasted all the time he’d spent studying,\nhe was going to find the nearest tall building and throw himself off.\n“I jest,” she said. “It means you’re ready to start.”\n“I feel a sudden, intense desire to throw a temper tantrum,” Kip said.\nShe squinted at him. “The cards are true, young Guile. And that’s why\nthis game has been played by generations of fools and madmen and wise\nwomen and satraps. Take a moment and soak that up. The strengths and\nweaknesses on the cards are honest to the figures they depict. Not all-\nencompassing, of course—for a few numbers, a few lines, and a pretty\npicture can only tell so much—but not misleading. But that’s only the\nbeginning of the greater truth, the greater gift that is Mirroring.” She\nwalked over to the wall and grabbed a card. She sat on a stool and spun\naround twice like a little girl. “Come, look, and see. Taste of the light of\nOrholam.”\nSuperstitious drivel, or magical invocation, or efficacious prayer? Kip\nhad no idea. The old woman seemed half mad. Maybe every word she was\ntelling him was a lie or a delusion.\nThe card was, Kip guessed, an original—a young woman, dressed in\nleathers, buttons of turquoise, pale skin, flaming red hair piled atop her\nhead, caged between black ironwood thorns. Green stained the skin of her\nleft arm, which was down at her side, leaves coiling about it. Her right hand\nwas behind her back, as if she might be concealing a dagger. She stood\nstraight-backed, and the smirk on her face was imperious, ready for\nanything.\n“This is your great-great-great-great-grandmother, Zee Oakenshield. In\nmost ways, she is the founder of your house, though the Guile name comes\nfrom elsewhere.”\nShe was attractive, and there was nothing about her to remind Kip of\nhimself—but that smirk was all Gavin Guile. It was like the artist had\ncarried her expression over a century and dropped it on the man.\nInstead of commenting on the startling similarity, and the obvious gift\nthe artist must have had to have captured it so well, Kip said, “She doesn’t"

There were five tiny gems, framing the picture, one at each\ncorner, one above her head.\n“Draft a bit, any color, and then touch all those gems at the same time.”\nShe pointed at a painting with broad bands of the drafting colors on one\nwall.\nKip stared at the blue. Blue was far less frightening than green. Within\nseconds, he felt the wash of cool rationality. Should he obey this woman?\nWell, if he didn’t, he wouldn’t learn anything. The only reason he’d come\nwas to learn. Besides, what was she going to do with a card that she\ncouldn’t do to him with one of her many guns?\nWith the blue in his fingertips, he touched the gems.\nNothing happened.\nWell, that was a little disappointing.\n“Push harder,” Janus Borig barked. “It needn’t bleed, but it must be near\nenough to call to your blood. You’ve got soft hands. It shouldn’t be hard.”\nSoft hands? Kip grimaced, but obeyed, tapping the blue jewel hard, his\nother fingers loosely over their corresponding jewels.\nZee blinks to clear her eyes, peering into the dawn. Filtering through the\nsmoke of two burning cities on either side of the Great River, the rising\nlight is red. It’s disorienting, having his view cast this way and that, without\nhis body moving, without any control.\nThere are enemy soldiers on both sides of the Great River. Kip can\nalmost hear the whisper of thoughts attached to those men—who they are,\nwhat they do—but “enemy” is the only thing that drifts through to him.\nShe’s on the high ground, and her siege-drafters are already at work,\nropes and cranks at the ready, waiting for the dawn to get enough light to do\nthe rest of their work.\nZee turns to a hulking brute of a man with one eye. He looks at her, a\nfrightening visage, but deferring. An officer? A subordinate, certainly. He\nholds a great bow, an arrow the size of a ship’s spar drawing back. Her\nmouth moves, but Kip hears nothing. He can only see.\nThe enemy is four hundred paces away, twenty paces downhill,\ndownwind from Zee, to judge by the flapping of the standards. The Ruthgari\narmy is jogging, keeping ranks. Some of Zee’s horsemen—most still in\ntheir teens—are already charging. She sees officers waving at them angrily,\ncalling them back perhaps?—and then, defeated, the officers follow them.\nHer line is tearing, some of the clansmen on foot following after the\nhorsemen, spoiling the shots for her archers.\nOnce the foot soldiers charge, the archers would have to leave off\nshooting.

A thousand archers follow his lead.\nShe grabs a torch and rides out in front of her men. Kip thinks she’s\nshouting. Perhaps all the men are shouting. She throws the torch in a high\narc, and her men surge forward.\nHer thirty mighty men surround her in seconds.\nSomething is shifting, sinking deeper—\nA flaming barrel of red luxin smashes into the front lines of the\nRuthgari, bursting and cutting a vertical flaming slash, crushing men and\nsetting them alight. I draft green off the grasses that will soon run red. To\nmy left, Young Bull and Griv Gazzin are drafting blue and green\nrespectively, swatting arrows and firebombs out of the air, keeping me safe.\nI draft a lance of green luxin and kick my stallion’s flanks.\n“Enough.”\nThe sound reverberates oddly.\nI don’t seem to notice.

Then the smell of ash and sweat and horses—\ngone. The feel of the saddle between her knees, knuckles tight on the lance.\nIt goes dark.\nKip blinked, and found his hand held in the crone’s.

It was dinner time, and there weren’t many scrubs in the hall.\nMostly it was inductees from the classes ahead of Teia’s, but Cruxer was\nnearby, kicking his shins methodically up against a post. He’d told Teia\nonce that it lightly broke the bones in the shin, and that the body responded\nby building them up ever tougher. He’d showed her his lumpy shins. It was\nimpressive—and kind of gross. She thought it was the greatest thing she’d\never seen. But right now, he’d slowed his training, obviously\neavesdropping.\n“What’s dangerous about it?” Teia asked. Her private tutor, Marta\nMartaens, was more than fifty years old. Ancient for a drafter. Wavy dark\nhair gone platinum, olive skin, top front teeth missing.\n“That you go blind or burn to death.”\nTeia took a sharp breath. Oh, is that all?"

Oh, is that all?\n“To see paryl, you have to dilate your pupils much, much more than\nmost people can. You can do this consciously, yes?” Magister Martaens\nsucked at her thin upper lip.\n“Yes, Mistress.”\n“Do it. I need to see.”\nIt took Teia a moment. It was hard to relax your eyes as far as paryl\ndemanded when you were tense. But then it came.\n“Good,” Magister Martaens said. “Now, back to normal. I assume\nyou’ve never seen your own eyes in a mirror when you’ve done that? No?\nWatch.”\nThe woman stared at Teia, and her eyes dilated unnaturally wide, the iris\na tiny band of brown around a huge pupil.\nTeia made a moue of appreciation.\n“That’s to see sub-red,” the old drafter said. Then her pupils flared again,\nstretching the sclera itself, her entire eye going an eerie black, pushing the\nwhite to nothingness.\nTeia flinched and shrank back.\nThe woman’s eyes went back to normal in a blink. “That’s what your\neyes look like when you’re viewing paryl, Adrasteia. Our eyes themselves\nare different, the lenses far more malleable, blessed by Orholam to see\ndifferently. Can you see superviolet?”\n“No. And I’m color-blind, red-green.” Best to get it out right away.\n“Unfortunate.”\n“Are you?”\n“Color-blind? No, but it’s more common among us. We can see a vast\nspectrum of light, far more than other drafters. But that doesn’t necessarily\noverlap with what others see. My own mistress’s master Shayam Rassad\nwas completely blind in the visible spectrum, but navigated perfectly with\nsub-red and paryl. But, dangers. First, the physical: if you dilate your eyes\nso much in bright light too often, you will go blind. Slowly, usually, but you\nneed to take extreme care with mag torches and bright sunlight. Now,\nenough talk. Let’s see what you can do.”\nSo they began practicing, Magister Martaens asking Teia what she could\nsee, drafting substances of her own, picking out sources distant and near,\nasking Teia to draft it herself. The paryl as Magister Martaens explained it\nwas more like a gel than anything, albeit a gel that was lighter than air. It\nmade good markers because the gel floated and frayed apart, constantly\nemitting paryl light.\n“So you made the markers for my mistress,” Teia said. She was stupid\nnot to have realized it earlier. Of course the woman had! There weren’t\nexactly hundreds of paryl drafters around.\nThe woman’s face went very still.\n“How many of us are there?” Teia asked.\n“Only two right now,” Magister Martaens said. She looked to either side\nas she spoke, glancing nervously over at Cruxer, who was still pretending to\nbe working out, without moving her head. “You and me.”\n“But that can’t be right,” Teia said. “I saw a man craft solid paryl and—”"

Teia froze up.\nMagister Martaens smoothed her features and calmly walked toward the\nexit, beckoning Teia to join her. When they were out into the huge, bright\nunderground cavern beneath the Chromeria, she went around the corner of\nthe building where they couldn’t be seen. When Teia joined her, she saw the\nwoman was livid.\n“I don’t know what you thought you saw,” Magister Martaens said, “but\nyou are never to speak of it again. Do you understand?”\n“I—I’m sorry, but no,” Teia said.\n“You don’t need to understand, you need to be silent. Especially about\nsuch things.”\n“No!” Teia said. “You’re my tutor. Teach me. I need to know everything\nif I’m to get into the Blackguard. You can’t hold back on me.”\n“I can and I will. You’re my discipula; you will obey me.”\n“Then I’ll take my questions to Commander Ironfist.”\nThe woman went gray. “I want you to think very carefully about what\nyou’re considering, young lady.”\n“Going to someone I trust, someone in authority over me, with a simple\nquestion, that’s what,” Teia said, getting angry.\n“Tell me what you think you saw. Quietly.”\nSo Teia did.\nMagister Martaens was shaking her head even before Teia was finished.\n“No. No. I’ve tried to make paryl solid a thousand times a thousand. It\ndoesn’t work that way.”\n“But what if it did?” Teia said.\n“Yes, exactly,” Marta Martaens said.\nTeia lifted her palms, more mystified than angry now. Maybe drafting\nparyl really did make you crazy.\nMagister Martaens looked around, again, though there was no one to\noverhear them. “Think about what you’re suggesting: a color that’s invisible\nto nearly everyone, even every drafter—a color that could kill, without\nleaving a mark, without leaving any evidence, that looked like a natural\ndeath. Please use your tiny brain to think about how people would react to\nsuch magic.”\nTeia licked her lips. They would react exactly as she had, with terror.\n“Anytime someone dies mysteriously, it becomes the fault of a paryl\ndrafter. Anytime some obese noble keels over from a burst heart, people\nwhisper that it’s the work of his enemies—and every noble has enemies,\nand most of them are fat. Think first about what that does to nations, when\nany death could have been an assassination. Then think what that does to\nparyl drafters. When the Office of Doctrine sent out luxors to stamp out\nparyl drafters, they weren’t authorized solely or even mainly because the\nSpectrum thought we were heretics.”\nThe Office had sent luxors after paryl drafters? “So it does work. You’re\nadmitting it,” Teia said, despite her tight throat.\n“I’m admitting nothing. I’ve never seen solid paryl, and I can’t make it.\nI don’t believe it can be done. There were some of us, hundreds of years"

I think they\nprobably killed with poisons, but by claiming that they could kill invisibly\nand without leaving any trace, they got many more contracts. But then,\nwhen people did die, it got out of control. That’s why there aren’t any paryl\ndrafters anymore, you fool girl. Not because it doesn’t work, but because\neveryone fears it might work better than it actually does.

A darkness that can only be driven away with fire. Do you\nunderstand? A darkness that can only be driven away with fire.”\n“Burnings,” Teia said quietly.\nMagister Martaens seemed abruptly calm. “I met her once, you know.\nThe White. She apologized. Said that drafters treat paryl drafters like the\nbenighted treat all drafters. Said she was working to overcome it, but that it\nwould be a labor of several generations. A good woman. Don’t you dare\noverturn all her work with foolish rumors. We may never have such a friend\nin the Chromeria again. This is bigger than you and me. This is for\ngenerations yet to come. Your mistress has already asked me all sorts of\nquestions and I’ve had to lie a thousand ways to convince her you were\ndelusional. When next you meet her, you tell her that just before you came\nto see her, you saw the paryl again. Describe it as a streak, but that there\nwas no one there. That it originated from thin air. Be confused, and if she\nasks, tell her you haven’t asked me about this yet, but you will. That you\nnever said anything to me about the dead woman. I’ve told her that paryl\ndrafters tend to see streaks at times, that it’s a side effect of our drafting.\nYou’re to make her believe that what you saw was a coincidence. Because\nif you don’t, our kind will be purged again.”\n“Yes, Magister.”\n“Then let’s get to work. I want to see how far away you can place a\nbeacon, and how tight a beam you can use to see through clothing,”\nMagister Martaens said.\n“Magister,” Teia said, “how does it work? I mean, how does it\nsupposedly work? I’ll never speak of it again, I promise, but, please.”\nThe older woman sucked on her thin lips. She looked around again. “In\nthe stories, if she had the knowledge and tremendous will, a drafter could\nsharpen paryl not only to a solid, but into a needle so fine a person wouldn’t\nfeel it poke them.

But there’s no reason paryl should hurt\nanyone. I’ve cut myself and touched paryl to my blood; it isn’t poisonous.”\n“But you’re describing exactly what happened!” Teia said. At the\nwoman’s glower, she lowered her voice. “Sorry.”\n“And I’m telling you that you must have read the same story I did and\nforgotten it. Hallucinations are not uncommon among exhausted drafters.\nWe who work with light sometimes have our eyes do strange things.”\nTeia couldn’t believe the woman’s willful blindness. She struggled to\nmaintain a respectful tone. “Magister, does my mistress think it can be\ndone? Does she believe you, or me? Does she want me to do that to\nsomeone?”\nMagister Martaens looked like she’d swallowed vinegary wine. “I know\ntwo things about your mistress. She’s more interested in who she can take\nto her bed than she is in dusty old tomes in forbidden libraries she’d have to\npay a fortune to gain access to. Dangerous knowledge is often hidden under\nponderous grammar and obscurantist vocabulary. She hasn’t the patience to\nsift through mysteries. Everyone’s heard silly stories about dark drafters and\nnight weavers. No one knows anymore that those stories are about us.\nWhich is why it behooves us not to remind them. Which is why I’d like you\nto wear darkened spectacles whenever you draft paryl publicly, or to always\ndraft quickly so that no one sees your eyes.”\n“And the second thing?” Teia asked.\n“There are those who can savor a silent victory. Your mistress is not one\nof them. She’s not looking for quiet ways to kill the Guiles. But when she\nfigures out whether helping the Prism’s bastard or hurting him will hurt the\nGuiles more, you can expect to be used. No matter what it costs you, or her.\nShe’s insane with hatred. So don’t get too close to that boy Kip. You’ll\nprobably have to betray him.”\nChapter 49\nKip followed Grinwoody sullenly. Everything about the room was the same\nas always. Door, curtain, darkness. Andross Guile was already seated at the\ntable.\nAs Grinwoody brought out the superviolet lantern, Kip took a seat\nacross from the old man.\n“Can I use your deck this time?” Kip asked.\n“No,” Andross Guile said. “You play the hand given you. You’re a\nbastard. You get the bad deck.”\n“Oh, I’m a bastard now? So you don’t doubt who my father is?” Kip\nswallowed. He shouldn’t have said it.\nBut Andross Guile said nothing. He picked up his deck and began\nshuffling. “That my son sired you has never been in question, you fool.\nEven your voice sounds like his.

If he’s claimed she was a concubine\nmerely to vex me, I shan’t let it stand. I know for a fact there was no\nmarriage, and I bet you know it, too.”\n“I didn’t exist yet, so actually, no.” Snotty. Dangerous, Kip.\n“You still have that bandage on your hand?” Andross asked.\n“Yes, my lord.”\nHis eyebrows lifted above the dark glasses for a moment: Oh, it’s “my\nlord” now?\nKip didn’t know if he hated himself more for his earlier recklessness, or\nfor his later deference to the old buzzard.\n“Take off the bandage.”\nUntying the knot near his wrist took his fingers and his teeth, but soon\nKip had unwrapped the linen. The burns were healing, but the skin was pink\nwhere it wasn’t white with scars, and his fingers were bent permanently. He\ncould tighten them into a fist, but it hurt to even try to straighten them. The\nchirurgeon and Ironfist both urged him to try, but it was agony.\n“Put your hand out, bastard, I’m blind.”\nKip put his hand on the table. The old man put his hand on top of Kip’s.\n“Please,” Kip said. “It’s very painful.”\nAndross Guile hmmphed. He traced his bony, pale, long, loose-skinned\nfingers over Kip’s hand, heedless of the oily unguent. It stung, but Kip held\nstill.\n“You’ll lose the use of this hand quickly if you don’t stretch your\nfingers,” Andross said.\n“Yes, my lord. I know.”\nAndross Guile turned Kip’s hand over, palm down. “You know. So\nyou’ve chosen to become a cripple? Why?”\nKip clenched his jaw. Swallowed. “Because it hurts.”\n“Because it hurts?” Andross mocked. “You’re ashamed. I can hear it.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“You should be. Keep your hand on the table. Scream when it hurts too\nmuch.”\nWhat?\nAndross pushed down on Kip’s hand, flattening it slowly. Kip felt the\nnew-formed skin at his joints tear open. A squeak escaped his lips, but he\ndidn’t scream.\nI’m a big tub of lard, a shame, an embarrassment, but I am the fucking\nturtle-bear. You can go to hell, Andross Guile. You old, heartless, cruel—\nThe ligaments in Kip’s hand were on fire, his whole palm was touching\nthe tabletop, but his fingers were stubborn claws, arched up.\nAnd then suddenly, the pressure stopped.\nTears were leaking down Kip’s cheeks. He gasped and cradled his hand\nto his chest.\nAndross Guile said, “That which you would have serve you, you must\nbend to your will. Even your own body. Perhaps especially your own body,\nfat one. Did the skin tear?”\nIt was a moment before Kip could trust his voice. “Yes, my lord.”\n“Smear the unguent back into the cuts. You don’t want it getting\ninfected.”\nWith a trembling hand, Kip did."

He did know what to do. He simply\nhadn’t had the will to do it. Andross Guile didn’t even have to say anything.\n“You did well,” the old man said instead.\n“Huh?”\n“You didn’t scream. I expected you to. So this time, no stakes. A practice\ngame. Next time is for your little friend, though, so I hope you’re getting\nbetter.”\nWith no further talking, Andross Guile dealt himself his cards. Six\nfacedown, two up: a Stalker and a Green Warden.\nThat meant he was using his green and shadow deck. One of his best.\nKip wrapped his bandages loosely around his hand and drew his own cards\nfrom the pure white deck Andross had given him to play. Kip had played\nwith it twice before, and he was finally getting comfortable with its strategy.\nHis up cards were the Eye of Heaven—a power enhancer—and the Dome\nof Aracles.\nKip cursed inwardly. No stakes? He’d just drawn this deck’s best\npossible opening hand. His hand cards were good, too. He actually had a\nreasonable shot at winning. There were no choices for his first two rounds,\nand unless he drew something game-changing in the interim, all he had to\ndo was survive until the sixth round, so Kip said, “When you say we play\nfor my little friend, what do you mean?”\nAndross played Cloak of Darkness, making Kip’s gambit much less\nlikely, and said, “That slave girl.” He seemed to be at a loss to remember\nher name. Kip didn’t supply it, for fear that he was being baited. Andross\nsnapped his fingers.\n“Adrasteia,” Grinwoody said quietly from the darkness. Kip looked at\nhim. The man was wearing odd, heavy spectacles Kip hadn’t seen before.\n“Adrasteia,” Andross said as if he had remembered it, as if Grinwoody\nwere an extension of himself. “I’ll buy her, and if you win, I’ll give her to\nyou. You can take her as your room slave. I don’t imagine your village gave\na boy of your dubious charms many opportunities for the pleasures of the\nflesh, did it?”\nKip’s stomach turned. “And if I lose?” he asked, hoping to steer far\naway from those topics.\n“She’ll be my slave. Worry about that as you will.” His mouth twitched\nin a shadow of a smile.\nKip, I’m a slave, Teia had said. You don’t even know what that means.\nHe did now. Kip was a fat bastard from the armpit of the Seven\nSatrapies, but he had choices. Teia didn’t. Other people might look down on\nKip, but they didn’t even see Teia. Or when they did, it might not be in the\nway she’d want to be seen.\n“What’s your plan for me?” Kip asked."

Are you bold or\nstupid, boy?”\n“Both. And you’re avoiding the question.”\nAndross Guile’s lips pursed. He lifted two fingers, waved them forward.\nA fist crashed across Kip’s cheek. Grinwoody. May Orholam scratch out\nhis eyes with sand.\nKip had fallen out of his chair and dropped his cards. He picked them up\nslowly, regaining his composure.\n“It’s amusing once in a while, Kip, but I don’t tolerate much disrespect.\nRemember, or be reminded.”\n“So are you going to tell me or not?” Kip asked. He was treading the\nline, and he knew it, but Andross Guile let this one pass.\n“It depends on how good of a Nine Kings player you are.”\nKip was too smart for once to follow that up with, But what’s the\nendgame, Rossie? Sure, the Guiles nearly rule the world, but Prisms don’t\nlast forever. Your family’s almost gone. What do you want?\nMaybe Andross Guile had been scheming so long that he didn’t know\nhow to not scheme. Maybe there was no winning, and he knew it, but losing\nwas definitely possible, and his pride wouldn’t allow him to lose. So he’d\nfight and fight and tear down a hundred other families and keep clawing\nuntil they finally nailed shut his crypt under the Chromeria.\n“I don’t have that much left that you can take away from me,” Kip said.\n“So how many more times can we play?” After a while, with nothing to\nlose, I’ll only be able to win.\nBut it was impossible to imagine Andross Guile putting him in a\nposition where only good things could happen.\n“Three more times,” Andross said.\nHe had thought of it, the old shark.\nKip said nothing, and lo and behold, silence actually paid off. “Once we\nplay for who owns Adrasteia. And then we play again, for your future.”\n“I don’t think I like you very much,” Kip said.\n“That’s a cryin’ shame, because I mean for you to hate me as much as\nyou hate your mother.”\n“Don’t,” Kip said, suddenly cold.\n“Excuse me?” Andross Guile said.\n“Don’t,” Kip said.\nAgain, the head tilt, weighing Kip. “Your move,” the old man said.\nKip made a mistake on the seventh round, not correctly calculating the\ncascading effect of the cards’ abilities on each other, and watched Andross\nput together a brilliant series. Kip lost on the next turn.\nWith a sigh, Kip collected his cards. It was, as Andross Guile had said, a\npractice round, without even timers. But Kip could have won.

Blood is destiny, bastard. Don’t\nforget it.”\nKip heard the words, but suddenly they lost meaning, blew apart into\nirrelevance. The art on one of the white cards was different than he’d\nremembered. Or maybe because he’d been studying miniature portraits of\nall the cards, he simply hadn’t noticed. Heaven’s Finger. It was a dagger:\nwhite, veined with black, with seven colorless gems gleaming in the blade.\nIt was the dagger Kip’s mother had given him. He was stunned.\nHearing Grinwoody whispering something in Andross’s ear, Kip looked\nup quickly.\n“Hellfang,” Andross Guile said. “You’ve seen it. Not the card. The real\none.”\nIt was a shot right in Kip’s big soft stomach. He started. “I—No, what\nare you talking about?”\n“Hellfang is its other name. Marrow Sucker. The Blinder’s Knife.\nYou’ve seen it. I’m right, aren’t I?”\nKip said nothing, but he realized the last part wasn’t to him. Grinwoody\nsaid, “He jumped when he saw the card, my lord. Definitely recognition.”\nHe made no effort to hide the smugness in his voice.\nHe’d been set up. Andross Guile had been playing him these games all\nthis time simply to lure Kip into a false sense of security, complacency. Kip\nhad played the White deck twice now, and the card had never come up.\nAndross Guile had been content to play him again and again so that Kip\nwould be off guard when it did. All that time so that Kip would give an\nhonest, startled reaction if he had seen the knife before. It had all been a\ntrap.\n“We’ll talk more, when you’re ready,” Andross Guile said. “I know your\nmother stole it.

Playing his wits against Andross Guile was\nlike playing Nine Kings with only two cards against an expert with a full\ndeck. Kip’s cards were Ignorance and Stupidity. Not winners.\n“I’ll see you in a week,” Kip said. “Have Teia’s papers ready. I intend to\nwin.”\nChapter 50\nAs soon as Kip got out of sight, he ran. He took the stairs down to his level\nand ran until he was within sight of his barracks.\nThere was a man standing outside the barracks. “Hello, sir,” he said as\nKip approached.\n“Uh.”\n“I’ve been told to tell you that Lord Andross Guile wishes to reward you\nfor your fine play. You’ve been given your own room. Your things have\nalready been moved. Would you like to follow me?”\nThat old, decrepit, infuriating spider. He was magnificent. He’d just\nplayed a Scry and looked at Kip’s hand. For one moment, Kip couldn’t help\nbut admire how well played it was. How better to go through all of Kip’s\npossessions than by helping him move? And how could Kip object? He was\ngetting a better room, for nothing.\nSo Kip did the smartest thing he’d done all day. He went upstairs—\nwithout making some excuse to first go into the barracks and check to see if\nthe dagger was still in the chest five beds down. If they’d stolen it, it was\nalready gone. If it was still there, he’d only be tipping them off. He’d come\nback later.\nHis new room wasn’t large, but it did have a bed with new sheets and a\nwarm blanket, a desk, a couple of chairs, and a small window to the outside.\nThere was a lock on the door. The servant handed him a key. Nice touch.\nThe people most likely to steal from him doubtless already had a copy.\n“Thank you,” Kip said. “Tell Luxlord Guile I was left speechless by his\ngenerosity. Tell him nice Scry.”\n“Nice… try, sir?”\n“Nice Scry.”\n“Scry. Very well, sir.”\nThe man waited near the door, and Kip realized he was supposed to give\nhim a tip. “I’m terribly sorry,” Kip said, “but I don’t have any money.”\nThe man glanced around the room, as if to say, Awfully nice room and\nsituation you’ve got here for a pauper. As if to say, Liar.\nKip flushed. “Thank you, now goodbye.” He nearly slammed the door\non the man’s face, suddenly angry, deeply embarrassed."

As if to say, Liar.\nKip flushed. “Thank you, now goodbye.” He nearly slammed the door\non the man’s face, suddenly angry, deeply embarrassed.\nBut as the door closed, he realized that Lord Guile had done this, too.\nHe had plenty of slaves who could have brought Kip to his new room.\nSlaves weren’t tipped, and the use of slaves so that your guests didn’t have\nto worry about tipping was a courtesy often shown between the rich. Lord\nGuile was reminding Kip of his poverty, of his tenuous position. Rubbing\nhis nose in it. Reminding him how badly Kip needed Teia.\nKip didn’t know much about the economics of it, but he did know that\nsome drafters never pledged themselves to any satrapy, instead being\nsupported privately. Those lords or merchants then sometimes rented out\nthe services of their drafters to whoever needed them—mercenaries. For\nthose who couldn’t afford the time and money it took to invest in\ndeveloping a drafter, it was a bargain.\nBut… Teia’s talent was worthless, wasn’t it?\nOr priceless, in the right quarters.\nGavin, Father, would you please come back? I’m afraid I’m going to do\nsomething awful here.\nIt was too late to go find Teia. She’d probably be done with her shift by\nnow, but Kip couldn’t stay here. He wasn’t tired anyway. And he had four\nhours before his midnight training time with her and Ironfist.\nHe left the Prism’s Tower and walked into Big Jasper. As he crossed\nthrough a market, he swore that for a few steps everyone’s gait was\nsynchronized, one, two, three steps all simultaneous—then it passed. He\nmust have imagined it. A few people looked at each other, then went back to\ntheir business. In half an hour, he was back in front of Janus Borig’s door.\nHe knocked and waited patiently. He saw shadows shift on the rooftops\nnearby. Guards? The traps slid open, and he saw her peer out.\n“Where can I get a deck of black cards?” Kip asked.\nShe laughed. “Back so soon. You see? I told you you’re smarter than\nyou thought. Come in. Come in.”\nChapter 51\n“You know I don’t like to start fights,” Karris said.\nGavin froze with a bit of rabbit stew on its way to his mouth. Clearly not\nan opening that boded well. He made a noncommittal noise. He and Karris\nwere eating alone tonight in their little tent not far from the beach.\nThe weeks had passed in a blur of meaningful work and renewed\nfriendship and fruitless searching and quietly growing dread. The Tyreans\nhad landed in wonder and tears. The Third Eye’s people had provided an\nenormous feast—and Gavin had put the Tyreans to work immediately.\nWithin days, he had a plan and a routine. As much as possible, he handed\nover power to Corvan Danavis, supporting his decisions, deferring to him\npublicly, and bolstering the man until the Tyreans were almost as likely to\nturn to Corvan to settle disputes and give guidance when Gavin was there as\nwhen he was gone.\nAnd Gavin was gone almost every day, scouring the seas for the blue"

He’d sat with his abacus and his map, checked and\ndouble-checked his calculations and his assumptions—and then checked\nand double-checked the seas. The bane wasn’t there. Wherever the two\nhours east and two and a half hours south started from, it wasn’t from his\nbeach on Seers Island. Nor, running it backward, was it simply two hours\nwest and two and a half hours north of White Mist Reef, though that had\ntaken him some time to figure out, too, because the reef wasn’t simply one\npoint on the map, it was an entire zone in the sea, five times larger than\nSeers Island. So did he measure that distance from the presumed center of\nthe reef, or from some particular point therein, or from every possible point\nin a circle?\nAnd it wasn’t like his skimmer’s speed was a simple constant either.\nSome days he was tired and he’d cover leagues less, though he thought he’d\nbeen traveling at the same rate.\n“It’s about Kip,” Karris said.\nThat seemed safe enough. “Yes?” he ventured.\n“What are you doing to that boy?”\n“Pardon?” He hadn’t even seen Kip in weeks.\n“He’s a boy, Gavin.”\n“I was under the impression he was a ptarmigan.”\n“Don’t give me that,” Karris said, flushing. She shifted on her stool and\nwinced. Training with amateurs meant collecting bruises from where people\nweren’t in control enough of their own bodies to pull blows short\nconsistently.\n“I have no idea what we’re even talking about,” Gavin said.\n“You’ve given him some impossible task, haven’t you?” Karris asked.\nGavin scowled. “How’d you know—”\n“I know you!”\n“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” Gavin said lightly, grinning, trying to\ndefuse.\nBut Karris obviously wasn’t in the mood to make peace. “He’s a boy,\nnot a weapon. You’ve loosed him like an arrow at some target. I don’t know\nwho. I don’t even care. You’re using him to advance some agenda.”\nGavin absorbed that, pursed his lips, set his spoon down into his stew.\n“That’s right. We all serve.”\n“It’s not right. He’s a good kid, and he deserves better. You’ve\nacknowledged him as your son—now be a father.”\n“What? What did you just say?” Gavin demanded.\n“He’s a child! You’re treating him like he’s another soldier. He needs\nyour time, Gavin. He needs you to put him first.”\n“I don’t put him first,” Gavin said frankly.\n“Exactly!”\n“Exactly. And what exactly would you have me abandon so I can go\nhave playtime with Junior? Clothing and housing fifty thousand refugees?\nNot important. Destroying a bane? Not important. Saving all seven\nsatrapies? Not—”\n“That’s not what I meant and you know it! You’ve said Kip is your son.\nAre you going to treat him like he’s your son or not?”\n“Kip is not important!” Gavin shouted."

He roared, “Decency?! I do everything for others!\nEverything!”\n“A lie,” Karris said quietly. “But so very close to true. How is it that\nthose closest to you get the worst of you, Gavin Guile?”\n“Out! Get out!” he roared.\nShe got up and walked out. At the flap of the tent, she turned pitiless\neyes on him and said, “You’re a great man, but only when seen from afar.”\nThen she was gone.\nWhat the hell was that about?\nHe’d thought things were warming up with Karris as they worked\ntogether. They’d always worked well together, always enjoyed each other’s\ncompany, even when they didn’t speak. And now this. This ambush. Where\nhad this come from?\nWomen. Gavin mouthed a few more curses. He could go after her. He\nshould go after her.\nAnd what? Tell her what? Tell her the whole truth?\nThe thought chilled his anger. He swore again and pulled out his charts.\nHe had work to do, damn her.\nHe’d ended up abandoning his shortcut, which had probably put him\ntwo weeks behind what a methodical approach would have yielded, and\nnarrowed the search through guesswork and good intelligence. He’d visited\ncities around the Cerulean Sea, asking if people had seen blue wights, and if\nso, what direction they were traveling. He’d even come across wights twice,\none in a sailing dinghy, the other rowing a blue luxin dory of its own\ndesign. Both had been as unhelpful as possible, of course, trying to kill\nGavin and Karris, but Gavin had found where each had come from, one\nfrom a little town outside Idoss in Atash and the other from Garriston.\nTaking the blues’ penchant to move in efficient straight lines, he’d\ncalculated where their paths should intersect—and found nothing there.\nClearly, one or both of them had either been a bad sailor or had been\nblown off course by the autumnal storms that were all too frequent now.\nBlown off course by a storm from out of nowhere, pity the bastards.\nAmbushed. No wonder they say the sea is a woman.\nGavin had ended up dividing the Cerulean Sea into zones and grids, and\nhe would skim as far as he could, checking every half hour on his sextant\nand compass that he was staying on line. Of course, at the speeds he was\ntraveling, he could have gone off course for a half hour by a few degrees—\neasily done during the hard weather—then corrected himself, and the next\nday traversed that day’s path perfectly and still have cut a wide enough\nberth that he would miss a small island.\nThe only other option was to stop every ten minutes and take the\npainstaking readings.

He was adept in the tools’ use, but stopping that often\nmeant leagues and leagues that he didn’t even get to. He also had to be\naware that the bane was moving. If it moved too fast, it could go straight\nacross his grid and he’d never be the wiser—even if all of his other\ncalculations and guesses were accurate. It was infuriating.\nKarris had suggested he build another condor and fly. It would have\nbeen a great suggestion, if he could still draft blue. It had taken him months\nto design the condor with the original materials, and it had still been a long\nway from perfect. Yellow luxin could be substituted for blue, but it was\nheavier, and infinitely more difficult to draft a stable version. He thought\nthat within a couple of weeks he could figure out a design that would\nsuffice. But made from solid yellow, it would be a permanent design. He\ncouldn’t make a new one every day, and he couldn’t easily unravel it if he\nlost it to some enemy. So that meant finding a secure place to store it while\nhe perfected it. And then, if something went wrong when he was in midair,\nhe wouldn’t be able to simply patch it quickly with blue. If something went\nwrong, he would crash, and all his work would be for naught. If he knew\nthat he was going to be searching the sea for six months, it would be worth\nit. But he didn’t know that.\nBeyond infuriating.\nAnd his Tyreans needed him. Their few drafters would burn themselves\nout helping with clearing forests and building shelters if Gavin didn’t lend\nthem aid. Corvan had convinced the Seers Islanders, who were almost all\ndrafters, to help in exchange for future work, but there was still always\nmore work to be done. Instead of trying to do it all himself, Gavin put his\ncopious drafting abilities to work in a way that first amused himself, and\nthen astounded everyone else: he built bricks.\nYellow luxin bricks. With what they’d learned building Brightwater\nWall, his architects and laborers built forms for interlocking solid bricks.\nGavin would walk around the forms every morning for an hour, filling them\nwith yellow luxin, drafted perfectly, sealed perfectly, practically\nindestructible, and then he’d head out for the day. The laborers took the\nbricks and built everything out of them.\nAt first content to simply guard him on the island and while they\ntraveled, Karris had eventually begun helping out on her own. She trained\nthe best of the locals in fighting, sometimes organizing javelina hunts.\nThough javelinas and the rarer giant javelinas had long been native to\nTyrea, there hadn’t been any close to Garriston for decades, and facing the\ndangerous, unpredictable animals was the next best training to actual\nwarfare.\nWhenever Gavin and Karris returned to the island, he was always\nsurprised. With plentiful free building supplies and fifty thousand willing\nworkers and friendly locals and good governance, their little port went from\na camp to a settlement in quick order.

There were no walls, as per Corvan’s\nagreement with the Third Eye, who thought that mutual vulnerability was a\nbetter guarantor of peace than mutual defensibility. But every other possible\nstructure was springing up. Gavin felt proud to be part of building\nsomething for once.\nHe spent most evenings with Corvan, talking governance, mulling over\nproblems, making plans, even playing a game or two of Nine Kings. It was\ngood to talk, to jest, to drink too much wine every once in a while.\nAnd he’d kept Karris at arm’s length, desperate for her companionship,\nand desperately fearful of her. Treating those closest to him worst, indeed.\nHe set the charts down. He hadn’t even been looking at them for the last\nfew minutes.\nThis wasn’t about Kip, he realized. At least not purely about Kip. For\nKarris, this was about the path not taken. Kip was of an age where he could\nhave been their son, had Gavin not broken his and Karris’s betrothal. Karris\nwasn’t saying, How can you keep your distance from a bastard you\nunknowingly whelped on some peasant? She was saying, Is this the kind of\nfather you would have been to our son?\nOrholam have mercy. It was a punch in the stomach.\nAnd she was right.\nKip was a good boy, but Gavin barely knew him. And he certainly didn’t\nknow what to do with him. He should have kept him here, should have\ntrained him himself. It hadn’t even really occurred to him. He’d seen Kip as\nbaggage, a burden to be passed off to Commander Ironfist as quickly as\npossible.\nEveryone had demands of the Prism, and that had been one too many.\nKip was a good boy, but he wasn’t Gavin’s son. Gavin could tell the whole\nworld that he was; he could take the disgrace of having fathered a bastard;\nhe could even face his own father over it. But there was a difference\nbetween a grand gesture and daily decency.\nAdd Kip to the list of problems awaiting him when he got back to the\nChromeria. Not waiting, festering—many of them problems that he\ndesperately wanted to go tackle, but he felt trapped until he found the blue\nbane.\nThe next morning, Karris greeted him as if nothing had happened, and\nhe let it lie, too. There was nothing he could do about Kip or anything else\nuntil he found the bane.\nSo he stopped whenever he saw ships out in the open sea, transformed\nthe skimmer into a dory and rowed to them, asked his questions and\ndeflected theirs, and kept searching. The problems elsewhere had to be\ngrowing. If he was gone too much longer, the Chromeria would declare him\ndead, despite the letters he sent with ship captains and the return letters\nfrom the Chromeria that he ignored. But he couldn’t leave his search. He\nhated blues too much. This, too, was part of his five purposes—to destroy\nall wights. He owed Sevastian that. Nothing would keep him from it.

The\nThird Eye had let slip that everyone in the proximity of a bane would be\naffected, but drafters most powerfully. Gavin’s plan was to use Karris to\nfind it, and then go back the next day without her to destroy it. She would\nbe furious with him, of course, but he didn’t care.\nAnd the days passed, and passed, and passed. Two months passed.\nThree.\nChapter 52\n“I can give them to you,” Janus Borig said.\nThere had to be some catch, of course. No one was going to give Kip\nsomething he needed so desperately. The black cards had to be priceless.\n“But it’s going to cost me something,” Kip said. She closed the door\nbehind him, threw many latches and bolts home.\n“No,” she said. “Free gift. Which, come to think of it, is redundant, isn’t\nit?”\n“But…” he led.\nShe poked his chest with the stem of her long pipe. “But do you know\nwhat it’s like to carry around an item of total wealth in your pocket?\nWalking down a back alley and knowing that you could buy every single\nhouse and shop on the block with what’s in your pocket? It’s terrifying. One\nof these cards is worth that, Kip. If I give you a deck, you’ll be carrying\nmore than you may make in your entire life. And the wealth isn’t simply\nmonetary. You’d be carrying history. History you could drop in a puddle\nand utterly ruin, or that could be quite literally stolen and gone forever. Do\nyou have any idea how frightening that is?”\nKip was thinking of the dagger that might or might not still be in the\nchest in the barracks. He swallowed. “That’s something that’s been\nbothering me,” he said. “Your home here. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice and\nall, but… it’s here. It’s not where I’d expect to find fortunes.” Which, he\nrealized, might be the point.\n“My husband and I built this house. Nigh unto fifty years ago now. I like\nit here.” She shrugged. “I know it doesn’t seem like a safe place to keep\nwhat I have here, but it’s more secure than you know. I spend a fortune to\nmake it secure. The Prism and the whole Spectrum couldn’t come take\nsomething that I didn’t want to give them.” She grinned. “Now. Now. Now.\nWhere were—Ah. The black cards. The question is, do you want the black\ncards because they’re forbidden, or do you simply want to beat Andross\nGuile?”\nKip scowled. It felt like the wrong answer, but he said, “I just want to\nbeat Andross Guile.”\n“In that case, you don’t need a full deck of black cards.” She groped on\nthe counter for a jar with more tobacco while talking.\n“I don’t?”\n“The cards weren’t outlawed because they made good game cards, Kip.\nThey were outlawed because they told stories that the Chromeria no longer"

They’re not finished, and when they are, my life\nwill be in greater peril than usual. I’ll accept that risk when the time comes,\nbut not yet.”\n“Someone would kill you, over cards that are true, that must be true?”\n“Especially over such things, Kip. If I could just make up whatever I\nwanted, then, well, who am I?” She tamped some tobacco into her pipe. It\nseemed awfully dark. “Some old woman. No one. Truth gives power. Light\nreveals—”\nA sparkling, crackling whoosh of fire from the tip of her pipe interrupted\nher. It leapt up to the ceiling. She cried out a curse and dropped the pipe\nshe’d loaded with black powder. She stamped on the scattered flames trying\nto set the garbage alight, but soon the gunpowder burned itself out.\n“Dammit, second one this week.”\nKip was round-eyed. “Are you—are you in danger?” he asked.\n“Of course I am,” she said. “But I’m very hard to find. And I’m very\nwell protected.”\n“I found you no problem.”\n“That’s because I meant you to find me, little Guile. Besides, haven’t\nyou seen my men?”\n“Um…” Kip had thought he’d been watched.\n“Black clothes, silver shield sigil? Hmm, say that six times fast. Well,\ngood, then perhaps they’re almost worth what I’m paying them.” Janus\ngrabbed another pipe off the wall and tamped it full of tobacco. “Now\nwhere were—Oh, never mind, come upstairs.” Kip followed her as she kept\nspeaking. “Here’s the catch.”\nI knew it!\n“I won’t let you take a card until you’ve lived it.”\n“Lived it?”\n“Lived the memory in the card. Like before. In case you lose it, I don’t\nwant those memories lost.”\n“How about, um, instead of taking your worth-a-fortune original cards,\nhow about I take copies? You know, like people usually play with? Normal\npeople, I mean.”\nJanus Borig scratched the side of her nose with her new pipe’s stem.\n“That is… that is the most sensible idea I’ve heard in a long time. It would\nalso allow me to put the blind man’s marks on the cards, which would make\nLord Guile far more likely to allow you to use them. Kip, you’re brilliant.”\nBrilliant? She hadn’t even thought of using cheap cards. Janus Borig\nwas so smart, it was a miracle she could get dressed in the morning.

There was something important about this one. He\nhad to find the right time. He had no idea what he was doing, but he had to\nlearn. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.\n~Gunner~\nCaptain Burshward is a bit crabbed this morning. That might have had\nsomething to do with us killing two of his men and presently attempting to\nmake off with his fine galley, his excellent rowers, his rich cargo, and his\nmiserable self.\n“Captain Gunner is going to ask you one more time, Cap’n Burst Wart,”\nI say. “I need that chain key.” I scowl. “I suppose that wasn’t a question,\nwas it? But that was.”\nThe captain and his brother and two officers are seated, hands tied\nbehind their backs, on the gunwale. And on this galley, it is a gunwale.\nTheir two cannons are propped up on it. It was only twenty years ago that\nall ships were thus, before some genius had the idea to make gunports. In a\nmere two decades, the idea spread all around the Cerulean Sea—but maybe\nnot beyond it. Guns braced on the gunwale are less accurate left to right,\nand of course, they can’t shoot low—ships have to stay far out, because if\nthey get closer, they’d just be blowing away each other’s rigging. When\nfighting oar-driven galleys, that isn’t the best way to cripple a ship.\nThe captain looks furious, his brother gray despite his naturally ruddy\ncomplexion, the two sailors with them terrified.\nThey’re Angari folk, from beyond the Everdark Gates. Big, burly men,\nwear their blond hair long and braided. Matrilineal. Sons a disappointment.\nOdd barbarian customs and strange cloying drink made with honey, but\ngreat sailors. Worthy of respect for being able to shoot through the Everdark\nGates.\nIt is one thing that Captain Gunner hasn’t done. Yet.\n“Where is the chain key?” I ask, real nice like. A finger’s breadth from\nhis face.\nThe key is for the galley slaves’ chains, belowdecks. Not to free them or\nsome such silliness, but because the oars are locked in place. It isn’t\ncommon, or I would have prepared for it.\n’Course, it is just a chain. We can get through it. We have tools; we have\npowder. I can make a perfect charge in probably three minutes, and most\nlikely not even set fire to the boat or kill anyone. But a key’s faster.\nAnd the majority of Burshward’s men are coming back to the galley\nright now from shore leave in the city of Ru, their rowboat ambling over the\nwaves, men hungover and sloppy. Not five hundred paces out. There isn’t\neven a swivel gun on deck to take care of them. We’ve only found two\nmuskets so far, old matchlocks that I don’t want to trust my life to. If his\nmen make it to the galley, they’ll likely kill us all."

Faster, but more likely to get the\noars crossed, eh?”\n“Tenth fastest in the blue god’s fleet, which means it’s the fastest fookin’\ngalley in Ceres’s piss puddle by a long tom’s shot,” he says. “Best oar boys\nin the world. Didn’t foul the sweeps once, not even coming through the\nGates themselves.” I’ve noticed his galley slaves aren’t the usual skinny lot\nthat stupider galley captains keep. You let your rowers waste away to\nnothing, and they get weak, and you get a slow boat. Burshward is smarter\nthan that. His slaves are thick-muscled men, clean, no diseases, and big.\nExpensive to keep slaves in that good of shape, but worth it. Worth it\ndouble for a pirate, especially if they’re well trained. I’m taking a richer\nprize than I’d realized. If I can get away with it.\n“Chain key,” I say. Real polite.\nHe says nothing. Brave man, balancing precariously on the gunwale. I\ncan admire that.\n“Rinky, sinky, dinky, or doe?” I ask.\n“Rinky what?” Apparently he’s not familiar with the game.\n“Rinky ’tis.”\nI kick the first man in the chest. He flies overboard, lands with a yell and\na splash. It isn’t easy to swim with your hands tied behind your back, but it\ncan be done, for a while.\nBut not by Rinky. He panics. Thrashes. Sinkies.\n“Gimme a number, Captain.”\n“Wh-what?” A sudden look of fear.\n“Ceres’s tits, Gillan!” the brother says. “Pick a fookin’ number!”\n“Rinky, sinky, dinky, doe.” I pull out my pistol and point at each man in\nturn as I singsong the words. “Once was a pirate by the name of Slow.\nPicked a sinner as a winner, and here’s the way ’twould go—”\n“Three!” the captain said.\n“One…” I stick the barrel of my pistol against the captain’s forehead.\nCock it. Watch him shiver, go blank. Grit his teeth in defiance an instant\nlater.\n“Two…” I release the hammer and bring up my knife with the other\nhand, to the brother’s throat. I draw the knife up to his chin through his\nthick braided blond beard. His eyes are squeezed tight shut.\n“Three…” I pull the dagger back. “And this is the way it shall be.”\n“No no no!” the third man yells.\nI poke him hard in the forehead with one bony finger instead of stabbing\nhim. He tries to keep his balance, but I keep pushing. He tumbles off into\nthe water.\n“Cap’n, we ain’t got much time,” one of my men tells me.\nI look at him. “This is me hurrying,” I say.

His\nbrother is barely conscious. I’ve heaved them both back onto the deck.\n“Told you I wouldn’t,” I say. “And I’m the son of a whore and an\napostate luxiat. My word is my bond.” I grin crazily at him.\nHe goes white.\nI tie a narrow rope tight around his brother’s leg to stop the bleeding.\n“You want your brother to live a cripple, or die?” I ask.\nHe swallows. “Live.”\nI take the captain’s sword—odd Angari thing, it’s fat down at the point,\nsweeping broadly so there’s no way you could put it in a scabbard. But I’ve\nused more awkward things to kill a man.\nI slash the blade into the brother’s leg, just above the knee and below the\ntied rope. I’m wiry, but I’m strong, and I know how to put a lot of speed\ninto a blade. It lops the limb clean off.\nNot clean clean. It still bleeds, of course. Tourniquet only does so much\ngood.\nThe man screams and kicks. The captain looks like he’s about to vomit. I\ntoss the blade aside, check the progress of the rowboats. The men in those\nboats realize something is wrong; they heard my pistol shot, and now\nthey’re rowing with purpose. It’ll be a near thing.\nI roll One Leg over and pour black powder on his bleeding stump. He’s\nwhimpering, thrashing weakly. It takes three tries before I can get a spark to\ncatch. Then it flares, filling the air with smoke and the smell of frying pork,\ncauterizing the stump. Odd how appetizing cooking man smells.\nOne Leg passes out. The captain is looking at me like he doesn’t know\nwhat the hell I am.\n“Lash ’em to barrels,” I order those of my men who are just standing\nabout. “Empty barrels, you morons!”"

Raiders can’t be choosers, I\nguess.\nCaptain Burshward is staring at me still, shaking and shivering, but now\nwith fury. “The old gods are being reborn,” he says. “All of this is dying,\npirate. The Everdark Gates will open, and we’ll descend on you like the\nRaptors of Kazakdoon. We won’t be exiled forever, thief. The White Mists\nwill part for us. Our time is—”\nI punch him across the face. Motion to my men.\n“Mot is being reborn even now, pirate!” he shouts, bleeding. “Can’t you\nfeel it? We’re here to announce his coming! Your days are over!”\nMot, the blue god. I’ve got my hands full with one blue goddess already.\nMy men throw the captain and his brother over the side. They land with\na huge splash, and bob to the surface by the buoyancy of the barrels, but\nthen roll underneath the water by them. Have to fight to breathe, as do we\nall, every day.\nThe Angari men in the rowboats are shouting now. The galley’s oars dip\nand sweep, slow.\n“That’s your captain and his brother,” I shout. “Save ’em or let ’em\ndrown. It’s all the same to me.”\nGiving the men in the rowboat the choice of rescuing their captain or\ncoming after us divides their attention, gives us another few seconds. I see a\ncouple of muskets come up. I duck.\nThe rattle of muskets. Ceres, I love the sound. A few men even blow\nchunks out of the wood. Excellent shots.\nWish I could have them on my crew.\nThe first rowboat has gone after the captain, the second is coming after\nus.\n“Droose, tiller!” I order.\nHe takes it, and I leap up onto the gunwale and salute the men rowing\nafter us.\n“Good day, boys,” I shout to the rowers. “You’ve just been bested by\nCaptain Gunner. Ain’t no shame in losing to the best. You’ll tell your\ngrandbabies about this day. And you’ll live to do so! So turn back now.\nBecause I’m Captain Gunner, slayer of sharks and sea demons, and I’ll add\nyou to the tally if you want.”\nI’ve made a makeshift grenado, but I’d rather not use it. The fuse is a rag\nwith a bit of black powder rubbed into it. The grenado’s a flagon full of\nblack powder with a piece of wood shoved hard into the top. It’ll just as\nlikely blow up in my hand or not blow up at all. I need me a drafter. Magic\nmakes me nervous as a virgin pillow girl, but sometimes even Gunner don’t\nget what he wants.

I remove my hat with a flourish and bow, as the galley leaves\nits original owners behind.\nA few seconds later, I hear a couple of gunshots.

A measure for everyone, and two more tonight if you\nkeep me chippy!”\nChapter 54\nThe thirty-five scrubs stood in neat lines, hands folded behind their backs,\nlistening intently. Trainer Fisk usually handled their drills and conditioning,\nbut today they were to be addressed again by Commander Ironfist. Two\nstudents had left after speaking with their sponsors about the impending\nwar, but only two. Teia was proud of that; she was also keenly aware that\nbeing proud of ignoramuses who had no idea what they were getting into\nwas probably silly.\nCommander Ironfist walked to the front of the class, his head freshly\nshaven and oiled. His Blackguard garb, cotton fibers infused with luxin to\nmake a stretchy second skin, showed the massive V of shoulders to waist,\nthe gold piping down his sleeves emphasized arms as big around as some of\nhis students’ waists, the thick butt of a man who could run down a horse,\nand legs like towers of the Chromeria itself. He was astonishingly beautiful.\nThe man’s muscles had veins bigger than Teia’s muscles. And all loose,\neasy, relaxed.\nTeia knew that the relaxed, loose composure of a warrior meant speed.\nTrainer Fisk was shorter and thicker than Commander Ironfist, but literally\nmuscle-bound. His heavy muscles actually slowed his motion—compared\nwith Ironfist. Compared to Teia, of course, the trainer was fast as a loosed\ncrossbow bolt.\n“Your training is the best in the Seven Satrapies,” Commander Ironfist\nbegan. No preliminaries, it wasn’t his way. “Your training is necessary and\ngood and effective. But your training—even here, even among the best—\ncan hamstring you. When we practice punches, we pull them short, because\nif we don’t, we’d lose you all to injuries. But when you pull punches ten\nthousand times, it’s hard not to on the ten thousand and first punch: the\npunch that you throw at a real attacker.\n“Our necessary safeguards can make you bad fighters. Blackguards can’t\nbe bad fighters. Your class will be called on to fight and perhaps to die,"

Your class will be called on to fight and perhaps to die,\nperhaps soon, and if you don’t know how to kill your opponents first, a lot\nof you will die. Your class may have fourteen pass. May. Not will. So your\nclass’s training is going to be different. Accelerated. Harder. We will not\nallow you to be second-rate. There is no substitute for experience, so\nexperience you will get. This experience will cost some of you injuries that\nwill put you out of contention for those fourteen slots. We’ve never done\nthis before because it’s dangerous and it isn’t fair. But we’re out of time, so\nwe’re doing what we have to. For some of you, the tests will be easy. For\nsome they will be boring. For others, they will be literal fights to the death.\nThese experiences will not be safe, will not be controlled. They may be too\nhard. You may be crippled or die. If you can’t accept this, you may leave.\nNow.”\nNo one left.\n“Failure on these tests will not automatically bar you from advancement.\nBut it will matter. You fail, you drop three spots. Blackguards deal with\nwhat we get, not what we want. Here are the rules: You and your partner\nwill be taken to a point in Big Jasper in one of the worst neighborhoods.\nYou’ll be given a handful of coins publicly, and then you must get those\ncoins to the Great Fountain. You are forbidden to bring weapons or draft. To\npass, you must bring back six of the eight danars you’re given. However\nmany you bring back, you and your partner get to keep. If you don’t make it\nin three hours, we’ll come looking for you. But don’t expect any help.\nYou’re alone out there.”\nThey drew straws for the order and an odd thing happened. The first\nteam to draw drew number one, the second team number two, the third team\nnumber three. Trainer Fisk scowled and mixed the straws again. But the\nfourth drawers drew number four, the fifth number five. He mixed again,\nsix, seven, eight, nine, ten. He frowned, but said nothing, and they\ndismissed it as a weird coincidence.\nAdrasteia and Kip got a straw that put them in the last third. Not an\nauspicious beginning. Then they walked across town, led by Trainer Fisk\nand several of the older Blackguard trainees. Commander Ironfist didn’t\naccompany them. He had duties elsewhere.\nThe first pair to go was the mountain Parian girl, Gracia. She was lean as\na willow and taller than most of the boys. Her partner was another Parian,\nstill tall and lean, but not so dark as Gracia, and a lot uglier, Goss. He was\none of the best fighters, but he had a habit of picking—scabs, nose, earwax\n—and eating it. He was within a hair’s breadth of earning the obvious\nnickname.\nA sizable crowd had gathered to see what these Blackguards were doing\nin a bad neighborhood, and not all of the faces were friendly.

No\none in the Blackguard and no one in the Chromeria is going to help you. If\nyou lose these coins, it’s on your own head. You’re not allowed to use\nweapons. You’re not allowed to draft.”\nMurmurs went through the crowd watching them. It wasn’t a fortune,\nbut for an unskilled laborer it was as much as they could make in two\nweeks. And these children had it. And the watchers knew where the\nchildren were taking it, so they could guess what routes they’d take. And\nTrainer Fisk had just announced that the children wouldn’t be protected\nfrom on high.\nGracia and Goss were smart, though. Smarter than Teia would have\ncredited. They ran.\nIf they went by a direct route, they would travel faster than the news\ncould. In fact, depending on how long Fisk made the teams wait in between\nattempts, the same strategy might work for the first few teams. Anyone\nhoping to ambush the Blackguards coming through would have to hear the\nnews and then have to take the time to gather their gang to do so.\nAfter five minutes, Trainer Fisk announced it all again, bound the red\nhandkerchiefs around the brows of the second team, and handed them their\nmoney. They ran, too.\nThe crowd of the curious continued to grow, but Kip was watching the\nedges of the crowd to see who was leaving, and Teia followed his gaze. She\nsaw several young men go different ways, each looking furtively back\ntoward the circle, as if afraid that their payday would leave.\nThe scrubs were talking among themselves, trying to figure out\nstrategies. If Teia was doing the arithmetic right, she and Kip had almost\ntwo hours before it would be their turn. When she thought about how many\nthugs could be gathered in that time, her mouth went dry. They would come\nfor money like sharks came for blood.\nShe was still thinking about it when she noticed that Kip had walked\naway.\n“Where are you going?” Teia asked.\n“Where all of you should be going,” Kip said.\n“What?” she asked.\nEvery scrub’s eyes were on Kip, and no few of the crowd’s, now that he\nhad been called out. “Scouting,” Kip said.\nThe scrubs looked at Trainer Fisk. He shrugged. “No rules but the rules\nyou were given,” he said, bored.\nKip was brilliant. He’d seen it in a second: don’t obey what the rules\nmean, obey what the rules say. That was the test as much as getting the\ncoins through safely.\nWithin another ten seconds, all the scrubs scattered, except those who\nwere up next. Ferkudi and Daelos went from looking excited to be going so\nearly to looking stricken, keenly aware of their sudden relative ignorance.\nTeia and Kip made a slow circuit of the nearby streets. They didn’t\nspeak.\nAfter a while, they heard the sounds of a fight one block over. Teia ran"

Kip followed close after, though he was slower than she\nwas.\n“We don’t even have the money yet, you morons!” a wide girl whose\nname Teia didn’t know was shouting at some bloody-nosed tough on the\nground in front of her. “Do you see the red kerchief?”\nThe girl’s partner, Rud, a squat coastal Parian who wore the ghotra,\ndidn’t look angry or triumphant. He looked scared. He was bleeding from a\ndeep gash in his shoulder.\n“I should kill you!” the scrub girl shouted.\nThe tough scrambled back on all fours, then turned and ran.\nTeia said, “We need to get you back to Trainer Fisk, Rud. Right away.”\nHe nodded, and together the four of them walked briskly the four blocks\nback to the square. Rud leaned on his partner and then on Kip, too, as his\nblood loss made him nearly faint. Teia walked ahead of them, on the\nlookout for threats.\nOn catching sight of them, Trainer Fisk ran to meet them. The\nBlackguard scrubs were only steps behind him. They took Rud, made him\nlie down, and instantly began tending to the cut.\nTeia heard someone say, “Bite down on this, Rud. This is going to hurt.”\nThen there was a quick flash of fire, and the stench of burned flesh and\ntea leaves and tobacco as they cauterized the cut with red luxin. Rud\ndrummed his heels against the dirt and made a high-pitched whimper that\ntrailed off quickly into deep, fast breaths.\nOne of the best boys in the class, Jun, came back into the square,\npressing through the crowd. The next team was just about to leave, two\nskinny brothers who were in the bottom third of the scrubs.\nJun kept his voice down, but Teia heard him tell the brothers, “Don’t\ntake Low Street. There’s a roadblock there. Twenty thugs, some of them\narmed. They already got Pip and Valor.”\nOh, lovely, that was where Teia was hoping to go. Well, that left only—\n“Corbine Street’s blocked, too,” Jun’s partner Ular said.\nJun said, “The alleys through Weasel Rock looked clear, but they’re so\nnarrow, two men could hold them.”\nAfter making sure Rud was okay, and checking the wound, Trainer Fisk\nmade his announcements again and handed the money to the Oros brothers.\n“I’ve got a plan,” Teia said.\n“Huh?” Kip said. “What is it?”\nShe made a noncommittal noise. “You’ll see.”\n“Teia? Teia, you’re my partner. That means I’m your partner, too. You\nshould tell me the plan.”\nShe grinned. “And spoil it for you?”\nHe glowered. “Fine, then. You have any food while I wait? I’m hungry.”\n“No!”\n“No, really, I am hungry. I wouldn’t lie to you about that.”\n“Don’t be thick,” she said.\nKip held his hands up to himself as if measuring his thickness. He"

He\nsighed. “Can’t help myself.”\nShe cracked a grin despite herself. “Give me your coins, when we start.”\n“So I can’t buy a sweet roll?”\n“No!”\n“Yes, sir,” he said, rolling his eyes.\n“It’s a good plan,” she said, suddenly defensive, suddenly aware of who\nshe was teasing. You’re a slave, Teia.\n“Mm.”\n“It’ll work,” Teia said. “Promise.”\n“Betcha anything it won’t.”\n“What’ll you give me if it does?” Teia challenged.\n“A kiss,” Kip said. Then his eyes got round. Like he couldn’t believe\nwhat he’d just said.\nTeia felt totally frozen. Was he making fun of her? Wait, a kiss if she\nwas right?\nKip saw the look on her face. He said, “I… um…”\n“Kip, Teia, you’re up!” Trainer Fisk said. “Rud getting hurt put us\nbehind schedule. Let’s go.”\nTrainer Fisk ran through the announcement again, but Teia barely heard\nit. She handed her coins to Kip, not looking him in the eye. Trainer Fisk\nbound the red kerchiefs around their brows, and then Kip took off.\nDespite his bulk, Kip seemed to have no trouble keeping up with her as\nshe snaked through the crowd. She went down one block and then turned\ninto a cooper’s shop, then through a smithy’s yard connected to it, and then\nducked into another shop.\nTeia was already at the counter when Kip joined her. “At the Great\nFountain within two hours?” she said.\n“Our man’s headed up that way in half an hour, so that’s no problem,”\nthe grizzled old man behind the counter said.\nTeia put the coins on the counter. “Delivery either to Kip here or Trainer\nFisk, or Commander Ironfist?”\nKip tugged at Teia’s sleeve. “What are you doing?”\n“It was your idea that got me going. Now shut up.”\nShe gave brief descriptions of Trainer Fisk and Commander Ironfist.\nThen she paid the courier fee—one danar—and asked, “Do you have a back\ndoor?”\nThe old man waved toward it.\n“Thank you,” Teia said. She took the red kerchief off, and motioned for\nKip to do the same. It wasn’t exactly a disguise, but with the Blackguard\nscrubs garb, she wasn’t going to be able to get both of them into disguises.\n“Kip, take off your kerchief.”\n“Huh?”\n“Off. Unless you want to get jumped.”\nKip took off his kerchief, getting it.\n“Hold on,” Teia said.\n“What?”\nShe licked her lips. “This was your idea, understand?”\n“My… what? You know, I usually feel smarter than this.”\n“I want you to act like all this was your idea.”\n“Why?”\n“Just do!”\nHe stood there, as mobile as a sack of paving stones, nonplussed."

Ingenious.”\n“Look at me,” she said. “I’m not tall, not muscular, not a bichrome. I’m\nfast, but I’m a girl and a subchromat. I want everyone to underestimate me,\nKip. If they think I’m smart, they’ll take me seriously. If they take me\nseriously, I won’t make it in.” She gripped the little vial on her necklace\nunconsciously. “Without my mind, I’m not good enough to make it in.\nPlease.”\nHe raised his hands. “I’ll help you however I can. You’re sure?”\n“A thousand times yes.”\nHe followed her lead. They walked to the Great Fountain via Corbine\nStreet. They passed one group of young men who gave them hard stares,\nbut by now the gangs had heard about the scrubs with money wearing the\nred kerchief, and because the scrubs’ training clothes didn’t have any\npockets and Teia’s and Kip’s hands were open, it was clear that they didn’t\nhave anything.\nThe men, some of them bloodied from encounters with the other scrubs,\nlet them through without saying a word.\nWhen they got to the Great Fountain, though, only Commander Ironfist\nwas there.\n“You can show me your money,” the commander said. He looked\npointedly at their lack of red kerchiefs.\n“Where are the others?” Kip asked instead. Teia watched him nervously.\nSo rude!—and to Commander Ironfist!\nThe commander leveled his gaze on Kip and said nothing.\nKip looked away, glowered, but said nothing either.\nAnything Teia said would just bring her between Rock and Hard Case,\nso she kept her peace. What did her father like to say? “She who gets in the\nmiddle of a pissing match will only get wet.”\nThen she realized Kip was doing it for her. He wasn’t being obstinate,\nhe was pretending to be obstinate to deflect any questions. He was\nalienating himself from Commander Ironfist—for Teia’s sake. It almost\nmade the brittle, fearful part of her soften. She knew how much Kip thought\nof the commander.\nThe Great Fountain capped the artesian well that provided much of Big\nJasper’s freshwater. Large underground pipes took water to four other\npublic areas of the city and each of the embassies, and the Chromeria had\nits own well, but for the poorer residents, the Great Fountain was their sole\nsource of water. Most made the trek at least once a day, if not multiple\ntimes.\nThe fountain itself was crowned by a glass statue of Karris\nShadowblinder, the second Prism. She’d been Lucidonius’s widow. Face\nupturned toward heaven, toward Orholam’s eye, instead of standing, she\nwas suspended by the twin jets of luxin pouring out of her hands toward the\nground.

Like the drafters who would follow her, Karris the\nFirst’s body had been shaped by the pure physical work of hurling luxin as\nmuch as she had shaped history by using it.\nAt all hours of the day, at least one of the Thousand Stars cast its light\non the glass statue, illuminating it more brightly than the sun alone could.\nAnd several would illuminate it with the last and first rays of every day,\nmaking it a beacon in the darkness.\nAround the merry splashing of the fountains’ multiple jets, the seven-\npointed star took water out to seven jets, allowing for lines to form easily\nand move efficiently.\nAt this time of day, there were only a few people in short lines, filling\ntheir buckets, setting them on yokes that they lay across their shoulders—or\nover their heads, in the case of the Atashians—and heading home. A\nnumber of shops lined the circle around the Great Fountain, and all of them\nwere prosperous. No stalls were allowed here, nor beggars, which meant\nthat both moved to clog the streets leading to the circle.\nTeia sat on one of the benches at the fountain’s edge. She wanted to\ntouch the water, but she didn’t. Jasperites were fiercely particular about\ntheir water. Some overzealous chirurgeon had given them notions that you\nwould get sick if you so much as drank a cup of water from the same trough\nwhere you’d washed your hands. No arguing with people’s superstitions,\nTeia supposed.\nShe hadn’t been daydreaming for five minutes when she heard yelling.\nTriumphant vaunting. The rest of the scrubs. They were carrying Cruxer on\ntheir shoulders, almost the whole class—minus her and Kip.\nThe boys put Cruxer down in front of Commander Ironfist.\nCruxer beamed, but tried to put on a serious face.\nTeia studied them. At least a dozen of them had obviously been in a\nfight. Clothes disheveled, a chipped tooth in a grinning mouth there, a\nbloody nose here, an eye swelling shut on one of the prettiest girls in the\nclass, Lucia, a number of them favoring sore hands, bleeding knuckles.\nCruxer waved a hand forward. The class lined up before Commander\nIronfist, and now Trainer Fisk who rode in on a horse and dismounted to\nstand beside his superior. Each team came forward and presented\nCommander Ironfist with their coins.\nIt wasn’t everyone. Eight teams had failed, and they glumly walked off\nto one side, empty-handed.\nTeia searched the crowd and finally found Kip. He looked nervous.\nGreat.\n“Cruxer, report,” Trainer Fisk said.\n“Sir, after my partner Lucia and I brought our coins here, we went back\nand rallied the others. Together, we broke the gang’s blockade and brought\nour coins through.” He swallowed. “You did, um, say that the only rules\nwere the rules you’d said.”\n“So you took what I’d designed to be an individual test and turned it into\na corporate one,” Commander Ironfist said flatly.\n“It was too danger—”\n“Yes or no.”"

He swallowed again, but didn’t look away.\nIronfist said, “Well done, Cruxer. This is exactly what I was hoping for.”\nA cheer broke out and Cruxer seemed to deflate with relief.\nWhen the scrubs quieted again, Ironfist said, “You stood together and\nyou accomplished a job you couldn’t have otherwise. For the Blackguard,\nthe job is all that matters. To the evernight with your pride. You accomplish\nyour job in the most efficient way possible, and the safest way possible. We\ndon’t do this for valor or for glory, we do our job. Now, anyone else, or are\nwe finished?”\nThe courier rode up then. She was a skinny Tyrean woman, wearing a\nsword and a brace of pistols. “Pardon me, my lords. Commander Ironfist?”\n“I am he,” the commander rumbled.\n“This package is for you, from a Kip and Adrasteia.” The courier handed\nover a bag and then left. The commander opened it, poured the coins out\ninto his hand.\nMurmurs. Not altogether appreciative.\n“Kip,” Commander Ironfist said. “I assume this was your idea?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kip said. Teia could practically hear Kip gulping from here.\nShe said nothing, hoping the commander would ignore her. It\nsimultaneously elated her that her gambit was working and broke her heart\nthat Commander Ironfist assumed it had been Kip’s idea.\n“You took your coins to a courier, and then just walked through?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kip said.\nTeia knew Ironfist’s face would tell her nothing, so she looked at the\nfaces of the other scrubs. Chagrin, consternation, irritation. They had\nneeded to fight to get through. Or run like hell. Kip had cheated. Kip had\ncheated. They didn’t even see her.\nOf course, they had cheated, too, but their cheating had still involved\nfighting. Their cheating had been honorable. Surely Kip and Teia would be\npunished.\nCommander Ironfist raised a hand, palm down. “Everything has a price.\nYou lot chose to pay the price in flesh. Kip chose to pay in coin. Some of\nyou got off without getting hurt, but some of you did. Our bodies are our\ncoin. Our bodies, ultimately, are all that we Blackguards have. You chose to\nrisk your bodies.

We look after each\nother.”\nAnd so they did. They ate and drank—Commander Ironfist paying for\ntheir meals, the scrubs buying each other drinks until they all got tipsy and\nTrainer Fisk cut them off. They regaled each other with tales of their own\nheroics and reenacted epic fights, perhaps a little exaggerated. Eventually,\nboth the commander and trainer excused themselves, no doubt to do more\nwork.\nAt first there was some carping against Kip and Teia taking the easy way\nout, but when Cruxer came over and praised them as doing a smarter thing\nthan even he had done, the complaining was ended, the rift was mended,\nand they became one class again, with Kip and maybe even Teia held in\nhigher regard than before.\nTeia barely spoke all night, but she soaked it up. It was light and life to\nher. She’d never felt part of something before, and she would pay anything\nto keep this. When she found herself stroking her necklace, she realized that\nfor the first time, she was touching it with hope in her heart. Hope that she\nmight actually throw the damned thing into the fire, and to hell with Aglaia\nCrassos.\nLater, she was finally coaxed into drinking a single huge glass of ale.\nShe felt like she was floating the rest of the night, drunk on companionship,\ndrunk on belonging, maybe just drunk.\nThe scrubs walked home in a raucous pack, and no one even shushed\nthem. But as they passed over the Lily’s Stem, Kip and Teia walking at the\nback of the pack with Cruxer and his partner, Lucia, Teia remembered\nsomething.\n“Hey, you know that Blackguards are forbidden to have relationships\nwith each other, right?” Teia was talking to Kip, but Cruxer and Lucia shot\nstartled, guilty looks at her.\nKip looked terrifically scandalized. “Um, yes? Sure. Of course.”\n“Then you should know that this isn’t that,” Teia said, still feeling warm\ninside. “This is just because of our ridiculous bet.”\nKip shrank into himself. “Um, you really don’t have—”\nTeia put her hands on both sides of Kip’s face and kissed him full on the\nlips. When she released him, he looked so poleaxed that she burst out\nlaughing.\n“Ooh, I want to make a ridiculous bet,” Lucia said.\n“No!” Kip said, jolted out of his stupor, hands rising defensively.\n“Not with you, Kip!” Lucia said, laughing.\nKip put his hands over his face. “Let me die now, please.”\nCruxer threw his arm around Kip’s shoulders as the rest of the youths"

They do it to us all.”\nChapter 55\nGavin was out skimming at dawn again. Today he was alone. Karris had\nbeen training some of the Seers in self-defense yesterday, and a storm had\nkicked up in the evening, trapping her in their little town on top of the\nvolcano’s rim, Highland. Gavin yawned as the sun rose and took his eyes\noff the waves at just the wrong second. The skimmer turned a bit to the side\nand Gavin’s hands came off the reeds.\nThe loss of speed made him pop up on the next swell. The skimmer\nlanded sideways in a trough, and Gavin went flying. He hit the waves at\nbreathtaking speed, skipped across the top of one, and then was crushed by\nanother.\nGavin swam back to the skimmer, which was bobbing merrily in the\nwaves without him, and, fully awake now, pulled himself up on the deck.\nWhat had he told the Third Eye? Something about not making mistakes\noften? He laughed quietly at himself. Then froze. She’d asked him if he was\na swimmer; he’d said only when he made mistakes skimming; and she’d\nsaid, “I see.”\nNote to self: when a Seer says, “I see,” pay attention.\nHe’d been heading west this morning, to start part of his grid from\nwithin sight of the Red Cliffs. He’d already been skimming for an hour.\nThe Third Eye had told Gavin, “Three hours east, two and a half hours\nnorth. Get there before noon.” Five and a half hours from now put him an\nhour and a half after noon.\nIf she was talking about right now, there was no way he could get there\nbefore noon. So she must not have been talking about…\n‘You like to cut corners, don’t you?’ she’d said.\nClever witch. Playing with him.\nHe didn’t need to go directly east and then directly south, he needed to\ngo southeast… He did some figuring, his fingers flicking little imaginary\nbeads. Taking the hypotenuse would take him… Four hours. Noon exactly.\nOf course.\nSo he turned his little craft southeast and raced the sun.\nHours later, noon was nearly on him, and he thought he must have gone\nthe wrong way or misunderstood the directions. It was a big sea, after all.\nBut there was nothing for it but to keep going.\nAnd then the sea changed, began to get calm. There was something odd\nabout it. Gavin stopped the skimmer. He looked to either side. There was\nsomething like a shadow on the waves. It was as if a thin cloud were\nblocking the sun and he could see the edges of that shadow in the difference\nin color of the waves. But there were no clouds in the sky. This was some\nkind of slick, like oil calming the waters.\nGavin knelt on the edge of the skimmer and put his hand in the water\nand scooped up a handful. It was like thin slush, except it wasn’t cold."

        "text": "Gavin knelt on the edge of the skimmer and put his hand in the water\nand scooped up a handful. It was like thin slush, except it wasn’t cold.\nGavin looked at it closely. There were thousands, tens of thousands of tiny\nspars, like needles, like fragments of snowflakes, and they were all lined up\nthe same way. He couldn’t see blue, couldn’t draft it. If he could, maybe\nthere’d be no mystery here. He smelled the water: salt, and the faint\nephemeral smell of resin, the chalky mineral scent of blue luxin.\nThe waves were awash in blue luxin, trying to form itself in crystals,\nsomehow spontaneously coming together, rather than breaking apart and\nbreaking down in the sunlight as it ought to.\nAs his hand cupping the water turned, he noticed that so, too, did the\nlittle spars, like a compass needle. One end pointed toward the outer edge of\nthe slick. So the other way had to be pointing toward the center—where he\nneeded to go.\nHe was as ready as he could be. He strengthened and narrowed the pipes\nthat propelled the skimmer, thought again, and made them join to one pipe.\nHe’d want a hand free. Then he skimmed toward the center.\nThe water thickened, though his scoop extended beneath the sludge and\nstill propelled him at good speed. Then it thickened more until he could see\nthat the scoop pipe was swirling the water like a spoon stirring soup.\nThen the crystals of blue luxin began to clump together and form larger\nsheets. His passage made a sound like rumpling rice paper as he broke the\nluxin ice.\nAhead, he could see a blue island, floating where no blue island should\nbe. It bobbed very slowly in the great, crusty water, cracking huge sheets of\nthe luxin ice with every move. Some of it melted immediately in the sun,\nbut other parts had become so infused with blue luxin that they held.\nThen he saw something that made him stop drafting altogether and\nfreeze. He was in shallows now, solid luxin ice floating maybe one pace\nbeneath the waves. With that white background, he could see that there\nwere bodies floating in the shallow waters. Dozens—no, hundreds—of\nbodies, bobbing at the surface, naked and encrusted with crystals.\nOh hell. Not bodies. Blue wights. Not dead, but absorbing the sun and\nthe luxin. The water was so heavily infused with luxin it was helping them\nmake the transition to blue wights.\n“Get there before noon,” the Third Eye had told him. Gavin suddenly\nhad a sick intuition of what happened to the sleeping wights at noon.\nHe drafted an oar and maneuvered his way through the bobbing,\nunconscious wights until he reached the shore, his heart thundering in his\nchest. He threw his anchor ashore and jumped onto the ground. It was solid\nblue luxin.\nIt made an alien landscape. There were crystals as long as Gavin was\ntall. The action of the waves had shattered many of them, but the spars in\ngeneral were pointed in the same direction—inland, always inland.\nSo Gavin began running. His goal was a huge spire at the center of the\nisland, perhaps half a league distant. At first it was slow going, the ground"

        "text": "So Gavin began running. His goal was a huge spire at the center of the\nisland, perhaps half a league distant. At first it was slow going, the ground\nsimply so broken that he had to jump from gnarled crystal to odd glittering\nbeam. Periodically, the ground would crack and a jet of blue crystals was\nshot into the air. Above, odd tornadoes circled, twisting top to bottom in\nmesmerizing mathematical motion. Twisted triangles like glass birds gyred\non invisible zephyrs.\nCrystal crunched beneath his feet like snow, but left glass behind, taking\nthe heat and pressure of even his steps to make greater perfection.\nAs he moved inland, the order of blue began to assert itself more\nstrongly.\nHe saw one spar, which was sticking at an angle to the ground, shiver.\nThen it slid even with the ground, seamless. The entire island here was flat,\nperfect. Ahead of him, he saw twelve shards of crystal, pillars arranged in a\ncircle around the base of the great spire.\nThe twelve pillars were each three paces tall. As Gavin approached the\nnearest, he saw inside it the most perfectly formed blue wight that he’d ever\nencountered. It had fully sloughed off its human skin. In its place was a\nwoven tapestry of gems, the weaves themselves altering for exactly how\nmuch motion the muscles beneath demanded of the skin at each point. It\nwas terribly beautiful, like someone had painted a masterpiece with blood.\nGavin didn’t hesitate. He ran toward the central spire. There were stairs\nup the outside of the thing in an odd square. No railing. Gavin ran up them,\ntwo at a time.\nNinety-seven steps to the top. The first thing Gavin noticed as he came\naround the corner was that he could see the White Mist from here. The mist,\nand the reef it hid, was legendary. Tales of its exact location varied, but all\nagreed it was somewhere in the middle of the Cerulean Sea. Maybe at its\nexact center, like a spider in the middle of its web.\nWhat the hell was this floating island doing so close to White Mist Reef?\nIt could be a coincidence. Lots of those, recently.\nThen his eyes fell on the pillar that shared the top of the spire with him.\nIt was filled with bubbling water and churning gases—gray to Gavin’s eyes,\nso he had to believe it was blue. There was something inside, but he\ncouldn’t see what it was. He leaned close. The sun, nearing its zenith, cut\nthrough the roiling gases. Gavin saw a curve at his eye level.\nOh no.\nThe sun reached the peak of the heavens and its pure light illumined the\npillar fully. That curve at Gavin’s eye level was a shoulder.\nIt was noon.\nA tremor passed through the entire blue island. The ground cracked,\nshooting splinters of crystal into the air at high speed. Only the pillar itself\ndidn’t shake. In each of the twelve pillars surrounding him, Gavin saw\nmovement. But he fixed his eyes on the one central pillar in front of him.\nA huge figure was forming inside the pillar. Gavin was watching the\nbirth of a god.\nHe drafted a yellow luxin sword, painfully slowly sealing it as the half-\nformed god’s eyes flicked open, focused far away, then noticed Gavin all in"

Light swelled within the pillar, and finally the sword was sealed.\nGavin rammed it through the pillar under the god’s chin and out the back of\nits head.\nIts eyes flared and exploded goo onto the glass.\nWell, that was easy.\nGavin twisted the sword hard with both hands, feeling bones grind and\nyield. Then he drew the sword out. Goo slopped onto the ground at his feet.\nHe pulled in intense sub-reds and red into his hand, set it afire, and punched\nhis fist through the broken luxin. He found the creature’s neck, grabbed it,\nand ripped the figure out of the pillar.\nThis was no wight. This was Mot himself. Human flesh becoming one\nwith luxin, even the human skeleton distending, yielding to this new, larger\nshape. This giant was imperfect, not wholly formed. It had been coalescing,\nand Gavin had aborted it.\nGavin hacked off the god’s head. He hacked off its skeletal arms, hacked\noff its legs—calves wholly formed, thighs still bony. He cut the spine—all\nin quick succession. There would be no resurrection. He picked up a gold\nnecklace the creature had been wearing, adorned with a single black jewel,\ntucked it away, and sprayed the creature with pyrejelly, coating every limb.\nHe set it aflame, stoking it with such deep sub-reds that it would be\nconsumed utterly.\nMot melted, puddled, evaporated, burned completely away.\nOnly then did Gavin let his attention shift to what was happening on the\nisland, to the island. Something was shrieking, distant, inhuman. The air\nwas warmer. The triangle-birds were diving—no, falling, lifeless. The sun\noverhead had regained its normal hue. The tornadoes had turned to mist,\nand were everywhere blowing away.\nHalf of the twelve pillars had shattered. From one of them, a perfect blue\nwight was breaking free. The whole of the island seemed to be melting, and\nwater was standing on the surface. The stench of released luxin was\neverywhere.\nAnd in the distance, Gavin could see hundreds of blue wights standing\nfrom their pools, screaming.\nNot least, he realized too late, the spire on which he stood was cracking.\nNot good.\nThe spire split, and the chunk on which he stood sheared off to one side.\nIt slid and then dropped fifteen feet, its jagged point stabbing into the island.\nFor one second, Gavin thought he was just that lucky, and it was going to\nhold. Then the spire cracked again, and this time the fragment on which he\nstood leaned over crazily and threw him off.\nThrowing jets of red luxin and fire downward worked only if you could\nfind “downward.” Gavin was tossed upside down, twisting, flipping. He\nbarely found down and threw flames that direction before he splashed at\nhigh speed into the ground. High speed sideways, fortunately, and the luxin\nground was evaporating, leaving water. Soft, glorious, nonlethal water. He\nplowed through the water for what seemed like forever."

He\nplowed through the water for what seemed like forever.\nWhen he came to a stop he found himself staring into the eyes of one of\nthe perfect wights. Its head was cocked to one side. It was very much\nawake.\nBlue wights are bad at acting before they understand a thing. Gavin had\nnever shared that flaw. He came up out of the water and skewered the blue\nbastard. He splattered a ball of flame over its face, then decapitated the\nmonster. He began running through the knee-deep water. He came out of\nthe water and over a slight rise and found himself facing thirty howling blue\nwights. They raised their hands in unison, light flooding into their palms,\nprojectiles forming in a fraction of second.\nThe whistling of dozens of flechettes passed over his head as he hit the\nground. A moment later, he was up, sweeping his hand, bringing up a huge\ngreen shield in front of his body. He charged. The woody shield jumped and\nshivered in his hand as dozens of projectiles hit it and stuck.\nThen some of the wights started shooting longer, larger projectiles at\nGavin. Then all of them copied the first in a moment. Damn giists, always\nunderstood what other giists were thinking in an instant. Gavin took a\nsecond longer, his body understanding before his brain did.\nThe huge shield was getting heavier by the second, and the big\nprojectiles put that much more mass on Gavin’s arms.\nGavin’s brain had almost figured it out before the shield dipped\ndangerously low. Too late. The bottom edge of the shield hit the ground at\nhis feet and stopped abruptly, and he ran right over himself, flipping\nforward, exposed, dropping the shield. He splashed in ankle-deep water,\ncaught his shoulder, and rolled.\nHe came up in fire. His arms swept left and right in great billows of\nflame. He dropped as the stronger of the blue wights still managed to get\ntheir blades through the wall of flame.\nThere was no way to keep this up forever, though. In about two seconds,\nthey were all going to realize that he was lying down, and they’d aim their\nmissiles at the source of the flame.\nThen Gavin got incredibly, ridiculously, mercifully lucky. The ground\ndissolved fully beneath them, dumping them all into the ocean.\nGavin got one good breath in before he went under.\nHe never thought he’d thank a sea demon, but his little fight by his fleet\nhad taught him how to make himself move through the water like a fish.\nGavin put his hands down at his waist, opened his palms, and began\nshooting out disks of green, each shot propelling him through the water.\nSteering around the mechanically swimming blue wights was simple,\nand in thirty seconds Gavin found his skimmer, still floating. He shot\nhimself up out of the water, took a huge gasping breath, and then shielded\nhimself. A few lonely missiles thunked into his shield, but in moments he\nwas up manning the reeds, picking up speed. He could hear the wights’\nkeening shrieks.

Why?\nBut he didn’t have time to think about that. Even now, some of the blue\nwights were trying to draft boats to escape. One would figure out how, then\nthe others would copy it. Gavin couldn’t let that happen.\nGrimly, he drafted pontoons onto his skimmer and drafted yellow\nswords onto those, pointing downward into the water.\nHe skimmed in murderous circles at high speed, running over the\nswimming once-men, the sound of their glassine flesh being torn muted by\nthe waters and his speed. Each death was announced by little more than a\nsound like a wagon wheel sliding off a particularly large cobblestone,\nsometimes accompanied by a rush of bubbles coming to the water’s surface,\nalways by a blossoming of blood.\nThe Prism was a peerless warrior, and slaughter, too, is the necessary\nwork of war. He was a tireless worker, circling, circling, like a buzzard. He\ncircled until there was no more shrieking, until there was no more hatred,\nuntil crimson blood no longer sluiced from the pure yellow decks of his\nskimmer, until the full harvest of death was brought to hell’s gates.\nChapter 56\nAglaia Crassos found the visitor waiting in her parlor. He was fair, freckled,\nand bore a fringe of orangey-red hair combed over a knobby bald pate. He\nheld a landed gentleman’s petasos in his hand, and wore a fitted coat in the\nnew Ruthgari fashion. He looked like a solicitor or a banker, but broad\nacross the shoulders. But then, who knew about these monkeys from Blood\nForest?\n“Welcome to my home, Master Sharp,” Aglaia said. “My man said you\nhad some sort of proposal for me?”\n“Indeed.” He helped himself to a seat and crossed his legs.\n“I wouldn’t usually do business with a total stranger, but your references\nwere sterling.”\n“Mm. I went to a great deal of effort to extract those references.”\nWhat an odd man. “Well then…” she said.\n“Well then,” he said. He stared at her with unsettling eyes. She hadn’t\nnoticed until now, but he had amber eyes. Not eyes dyed from a life as a\ndrafter, simply the vanishingly rare true amber. “What is the worst deal you\nhave ever accepted?” he asked. He was playing with a strand of pearls he\nwore under his shirt. Pearls, on a man? Was this a new fashion she hadn’t\nseen, or a quirk?\n“Pardon me?” she asked.\n“Worst deal.”\n“How rude.”\n“You have something Lord Andross Guile demands,” Master Sharp said.\n“Pardon me?”\n“The slave girl, Teia.”\n“Who?

How long should I\ngive you to reconsider?”\nAglaia turned her back and strode toward the mantel where her slaves’\nbell sat. She wasn’t even aware of Master Sharp moving, but suddenly he\nwas holding her from behind, one arm around her ribs as if embracing her,\nbut the hand a steel claw around her throat. His other hand stabbed behind\nher ear into a spot that eviscerated her with pain.\n“I want you to know. I intend to enjoy this,” he whispered in her ear. His\nbreath was sweet, minty. “You have very. Nice. Teeth.”\nThen he released her. He was out the door before she even rang the\nslaves’ bell.\n“Go after him,” she told the muscular young slave, Incaros, her new\nfavorite. “Take Big Ros and Aklos. Beat that son of a bitch. Badly. Break\nbones. Go. Now!”\nShe ordered her chamberlain to call up more guards and then went up to\nher chambers. She tried to comfort herself with the thought that even now\nIncaros, Ros, and Aklos were beating the hell out of that bastard, but he’d\nshaken her. She was trembling, and furious that she’d been so frightened.\nShe closed her door and rubbed a kerchief across her brow.\nA fist smashed into her forehead and her head slapped into the wooden\ndoor she’d just closed, stunning her. She fell, and hands guided her down.\nThe man straddled her, and when she tried to scream, he stuffed something\nthick and sharp and metallic into her mouth. He strapped it onto her face\nquickly, expertly.\nThe gag held her tongue down and blocked air from her mouth, so she\nstarted screaming through her nose, and he simply pinched her nose,\nholding her down with one hand by her throat.\nHis amber eyes smiled.\nShe stopped screaming and he lifted her to her feet, mostly by her throat,\nand moved her to a chair.\nHow had he gotten here? Climbed up the outside of the house and\nbroken in through a window as soon as she’d thrown him out? That fast?\nAnd no one had seen it?\nFurious, she thrashed. He punched her so hard in the stomach that her\nbreath whooshed out of her and she unwittingly bit down on the gag. It was\nlike a horse’s bit, but sharp, and it dug into her teeth and tongue cruelly. She\nhad to keep her mouth open as widely as possible.\nIn moments, she was strapped to her own chair with broad leather straps.\nMaster Sharp stepped back, pushing his floppy fringe of red hair back\nover his head from where their wrestling had thrown it askew. His pearl\nnecklace had come out of his shirt—and those weren’t pearls."

He lost twice, quickly. He walked out onto the\ntesting field again, flexing the fingers of his left hand lightly. It still hurt like\nsmall animals were gnawing at every joint and sprinkling salt on the flesh in\nbetween courses, but it hurt less than the beating that was to come. He\nstared at the youth across from him. Come on, turtle-bear, come on.\nThe wheels had come up Red, and Unarmed. Red was lucky, very lucky.\nKip had just been practicing it last night with Teia. He could finally, finally\nmake a stable red—though that was all he could do. He’d only figured out\ntwo ways to use the sticky stuff. One was flammable goo, and setting\nopponents on fire was decidedly frowned on. The downside was that the\nboy across from him, Ferkudi, was a blue/green bichrome, currently two\nplaces above Kip. There were about fifty people gathered around the circle,\nwatching closely. Between injuries and nervous sponsors, there were now\nonly twenty-eight scrubs left.\nFerkudi was short and thick through the chest, but strong as a bull, and\ndeceptively quick. Kip had watched him fight, and the boy was better at\ngrappling than almost anyone else. The fights that Ferkudi had lost, he’d\nlost because his reach was short. On a good day, and with the colors he had,\nhe’d be in the top three or four fighters. It was just bad luck that he was\nfighting for position fifteen right now.\nKip shrugged his shoulders, rolled his head to stretch out his neck, and\nsignaled that he was ready to fight.\nThe corner of Ferkudi’s mouth twitched. He thought he was going to\ndestroy Kip in a quick hand-to-hand fight.\nNo reason to let the other guy know what cards you’re holding, is there?\nThank you, Andross Guile."

He threw\nall of his desire for the boy to be imprisoned into that drafting.\nFerkudi obviously hadn’t been prepared for Kip to be drafting red, but\nKip wasn’t prepared for it either. The color breathed life onto the flames of\nhis rage. He wasn’t mad at Ferkudi, but red obliterated reason.\nHe closed the distance and, before he even knew what he was doing,\nburied his fist in the astonished boy’s face.\nThe late-night training sessions seemed to be doing something, because\nthe punch went right where he wanted it to—he punched low, straight for\nFerkudi’s chin; and exactly as Commander Ironfist had said, the boy\ninstinctively ducked his chin, and Kip’s fist smashed his nose. With his feet\nstuck in red luxin, the boy toppled straight onto his back.\nKip sprayed red luxin around the fallen boy so he was stuck to the\nground. He raised a foot to stomp on the boy’s head—and barely stopped\nhimself as the whistle shrilled.\nFrightened at what he’d almost done, Kip flung away the red luxin.\nOrholam’s beard, for a moment there, he wanted to kill the boy.\nThe red luxin disappeared, and Ferkudi sat up. “Oh,” he said. “I think\nyou broke my nose.” He squeezed it gingerly, plugging its bleeding. “I\n’idn’t even owe you could draff red. Nice!” He grabbed the bridge of his\nnose, took a quick breath, and pulled it back into place. Groaning, he\npunched the ground twice. “Oww, oww.” Blinking tears from his eyes, he\nextended his hands and some friends helped him up. “Nice one, Kip,” he\nsaid.\nJust like that? No anger?\n“Uh… sorry,” Kip said. “About your nose. The red sort of came over\nme.”\n“Ah, it’s nuffin. ’Snot the first time.”\n“Nor probably the last, you big ugly mug,” Cruxer said, coming up to\njoin them. “Take a seat, Kip. I don’t think you’re going to have to fight\nagain today.”\n“Really?” Kip asked. He was exhausted. The long workouts, the late\nnights, then not sleeping, then when he slept only having nightmares.

        "text": "again today.”\n“Really?” Kip asked. He was exhausted. The long workouts, the late\nnights, then not sleeping, then when he slept only having nightmares. He\nwas hanging on by one frayed thread. He threw himself down into a camp\nchair.\nCrack! The back legs of the chair snapped and Kip felt a stab of panic as\nhe lost his balance and toppled flat on his back.\nFatty.\nThe scrubs laughed. Everyone laughed. Kip felt his face turning red as\npyrejelly. Even Cruxer was laughing.\nKip jumped to his feet, but then couldn’t move. Damn me. Just when I\nwas making inroads. Just when I was starting to belong for once. Sick self-\nloathing shot through him, froze him. What could he do?\nHe hated them. He didn’t want to be part of this anyway. They could all\ngo to hell.\nCruxer raised his hands. “That clinches it! Kip, I already knew you\nneeded a new name among us. Kip is no Blackguard name, and we’ve seen\nthat you most certainly need one.”\nWas Cruxer making fun of him? What did he mean, “You need one”?\n“I don’t understand,” Kip said quietly, wary of a trap.\nTrainer Fisk was standing there, looking bemused. “I’m sure you’re not\nthe only one. How many of you lot grew up in Paria?” Less than half raised\ntheir hands. “Well then, story time. Not everyone’s third-generation\nBlackguard, Cruxer.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nTrainer Fisk glowered at the ground, as if he didn’t know exactly where\nto start. “When Lucidonius came, he was protected by thirty mighty men,\nsome of whom he first had to defeat. Many of these men had been heroes\nand priests of the old gods and had names taken from those false gods, like\nEl-Anat and Dagnar Zelan and Or-mar-zel-atir. They couldn’t keep their old\nnames, so they took new names. Though some of them went nameless until\nthey felt they’d earned a new name in service of Orholam. El-Anat became\nForushalzmarish for a time, but then as the light spread beyond Paria, more\nof them took names that the locals could pronounce—or fear. So\nForushalzmarish changed his name again, and went by Shining Spear. Now,\nthe Blackguard names don’t mean quite what they used to now, because\nnone of us is shedding a name associated with those old blasphemies. You\ncan take a name, or not. If you’re given a name, you can choose whether\nyou want to use it all the time or just among the Blackguard. Names\ngenerally spread widest that are best earned, and best fit their wearer. It’s up\nto you.”\n“But I’m not a Blackguard yet,” Kip said. What if they gave him a\nname, and he didn’t make it in?\n“The tradition is that if the name is adopted, it’s only used among your\nfellows until you become a full Blackguard.” Trainer Fisk shrugged. “But\nthen we get children whose parents give them Blackguard names before\nthey even come to the Jaspers… like Cruxer here.” He seemed amused.\n“So, Cruxer?”"

Arm-breaker,\nWill-breaker, Rule-breaker, Nose-breaker…” He paused for effect. “Chair-\nbreaker.” The scrubs roared.\nWith a flourish, he said, “Kip, we dub thee Breaker.”\nThe scrubs cheered and laughed. It was the perfect Blackguard name: it\ncould be used to laud or to lampoon. Kip rolled it over on his tongue.\nBreaker. Despite everything, despite how he could excuse how each of the\nincidents that led to him earning the name weren’t really indicative of his\ncharacter, just accidents, he liked it. It sounded tough.\nA reluctant grin broke over his face like dawn over Atan’s Teeth. “I’ll\ntake it,” he said. “Among you, Breaker I am.”\nChapter 58\n“Breaker, huh?” Andross Guile said, sardonic. “I feel like I’m being visited\nby a high personage.”\n“And I feel like I’m visiting a bitter, hateful old man. Oh.” Kip sat down\nin his chair opposite the old man.\nAndross laughed. “So, Breaker, does your little friend Adrasteia know\nthat we’re playing for her future right now?”\n“No.”\n“And which will you break, her heart or her maidenhead? Ha-ha! Mmm.\nYou play like a failure, Kip. Do you know why you didn’t tell her? Because\nyou thought that if you lost, whatever happens to her could just be a tragedy\nthat you could pretend you had nothing to do with. You didn’t want her to\nhate you if you lost. Poor Kip. Poor orphan boy of a haze-addled mother.”\n“Shut up and play,” Kip said.\n“Kip the Lip. You never know when to stop, do you? Lean forward, lard\nboy.”\nHe obeyed. The blind man groped, found his face, and slapped him\nheavily.\nKip accepted the blow. There was something purifying in pain. He was a\nmadman. He spat bloody penance on Lord Guile’s floor. Kip the Lip. Ramir\nhad called him that, mocked him.\n“Boy, your defiance is inspiring, but be aware that I set the rules, and I\nhave no compunction about changing those when I please. You think you\nhave nothing to lose? Fool. Don’t vaunt until you’ve won, don’t scream\ndefiance until you’ve lost.”\n“Well then, I hope you’ll accept my vaunting in about half an hour.”\nAndross said, “Let’s get to it, then. Best two of three. Which deck would\nyou like today? I’ll be taking the red.” He gestured. He had white and\nyellow decks set out for Kip.\n“I’ll pass,” Kip said.\nThin eyebrows appeared briefly over the top of Andross Guile’s huge"

Show it to me.”\n“They’ve got the blind man’s marks,” Kip said. “Here.” He handed over\nonly one card.\nAndross rubbed the corner where the marks were, as if looking for a\nreason to reject it, but it was perfect work. Janus Borig wouldn’t do less.\nKip half expected the old man to tell him he couldn’t use other cards. It\nwas a rule that had never been addressed.\n“If any of the cards don’t have the marks, I’ll reject the entire deck, and\nyou lose, understood?” Andross said.\n“Understood.”\n“Wondered how long it would be before you finally made your own\ndeck,” Andross said. “Slower than I thought you’d be.”\n“Mm-hmm,” Kip said. The insult meant nothing, not in the same breath\nas the much larger victory of being allowed to use his own deck. “Me first?”\nHoping that the old man would contradict him and go first.\nIndulgent smile. “Be my guest.”\nSo Kip set the field of play to outside. Outside made it harder to control\nthe light, which was usually a good call against red. So many of the sources\nof light indoors were torches or fires—light sources that gave yellow and\nred and sub-red easily—that it was harder for greens and blues to source\ntheir spells.\nBut Kip going first meant Andross got to draw an extra card.\nThey established the area quickly, the art on the cards giving them an\nimaginary space—outside the red walls of a castle. Grass, forest. Blue sky,\nof course. These were the sources. Either could draft from them, but Kip\nwas on the forest side, so he could draft more quickly from it, powering his\ngreen drafting quicker, while the converse was true for Andross and the red\nwalls.\nNow that Kip knew the rules, Andross played a fast variant of the game.\nThere were two tiny sand clocks, five seconds each. Absent the visual cues\nof seeing the grains drain through, the luxlord had a fantastically worked\nmodel that rang a bell each time a player ran out of time. If you didn’t play\nduring your five seconds, you lost your turn. As he liked to say, in real life,\ndrafters fought each other simultaneously, each drafting as quickly as they\ncould, deciding on the fly what to do, making mistakes.\nAndross Guile’s blindness was the one huge advantage Kip had. He\ncould see his opponent’s card as soon as it was turned over, where Andross\nhad to reach across the table and feel for his. Kip put his new card in the\nsame place every time so that the handicap was as little of one as possible,\nbut it was still at least a second per turn extra that he had. And Andross had\nto remember everything on the play field.\nIn the normal variant, turns were taken in a leisurely fashion with no\nclocks, but Andross despised it, said it taught nothing. Life and death and\ndrafting were fast, he said. The sands of our lives are always pouring out,\nalways too fast."

The sands of our lives are always pouring out,\nalways too fast.\n“Ominous name,” Andross said. The first few moves never took too\nmuch concentration.\n“What’s that?” Kip asked, trying to decide whether to spend his turn\nestablishing more colors in the field or putting on his spectacles.\n“Breaker.”\nSpectacles. He didn’t want to be unarmed for any longer than absolutely\nnecessary. “Ominous how?”\n“You didn’t put him up to it? Here I was giving you credit for doing that\nbehind the scenes. Clever move, I thought.”\nClever move? Apparently Kip’s silence spoke for him.\n“You’d have me believe you getting that name was a coincidence?”\n“What’re the two things that are coinciding?” Kip asked.\n“Breaker’s one of the epithets the prophecies apply to the Lightbringer.”\n“It was a joke. I broke a chair.”\n“Funny,” Andross said, tone flat.\n“And I broke a boy’s nose. And a bit of drafting someone was doing.”\nThe Lightbringer? Something in Kip’s soul soared at the very thought.\nHe was distracted by talking and almost missed his turn. He played quickly,\nputting Damien Savoss on the field and flipping Andross Guile’s clock.\nOh hell. That was one of the forbidden cards. Kip had meant to hold on\nto those for another couple of turns.\nAndross ran his fingers over the marks. Hesitated. Ran his fingers over\nthe marks again. “This is Damien Savoss,” he said. “This card is illegal.”\nHe was one to talk.\n“Illegal to possess,” Kip said quickly, “but the justiciars of the game\nnever declared them illegal to play.” He flipped his sand clock over.\n“A fine distinction.”\n“A fine distinction? I only learned about the black cards because you\nplay with them!”\n“Some of the black cards were withdrawn, others were outlawed—” The\nbell rang, signaling the end of Andross Guile’s turn.\nKip played another card quickly, cementing the luxlord’s missed turn.\nRage washed over Andross Guile’s face. The loose flesh below his\njawline quivered. But he said nothing. He played.\nIn five minutes, Kip won. The additional turn and the surprise of playing\nagainst cards he hadn’t seen in more than a decade threw off Andross\nGuile’s game. Still, it seemed like the man played defensively. Unusual.\n“It was a good trick,” Andross said afterward, while they shuffled their\ndecks. “You shouldn’t have wasted it on the girl. That’s the kind of trick\nthat only works once. You should have seen if you could beat me once, and\nthen played that deck for the tiebreaker if you couldn’t. Beyond that, you\nshould have waited until your own future was in jeopardy, not spent it on a\nslave girl. Foolish.”\nKip turned to Grinwoody. “Some water, please.” He forgot again that\nyou don’t say please to a slave. He was always forgetting that.\nBut the water wasn’t the point. Kip had figured out that the big\nspectacles Grinwoody wore somehow allowed him to see in the darkness."

Kip had figured out that the big\nspectacles Grinwoody wore somehow allowed him to see in the darkness.\nWith them, Grinwoody was Andross’s eyes. As soon as the old slave turned\nto grab the pitcher, Kip brought the other deck out of his pocket quietly,\nspeaking to cover the noise of it. “There’s a thousand things you could\nteach me, Luxlord Guile. You’re brilliant and experienced. But right now\nyou’re my enemy, and you’re trying to inflict horrors on someone who is\ndear to me. So I’ll keep my own counsel, thanks.”\nLord Guile’s face cleared. “You are learning, aren’t you? Ignorant,\nnaïve, but not altogether as stupid as I thought. I know you may not believe\nthis, Kip, but I actually like you. A little. How’s your hand?”\nIt took Kip a moment to understand he didn’t mean his cards, he actually\nmeant his hand. “Better.” His fingers still wouldn’t straighten all the way,\nbut his grip was strong, and he was working on them.\nAndross Guile made some noncommittal noise and picked up the yellow\ndeck that he’d set out for Kip earlier. He opened a box off to one side,\ngrabbed out a few cards, took some out of the deck, and shuffled the new\nones in. You were allowed to switch or modify your deck between rounds,\nto adapt to your opponent’s strategies. “So have you thought about it? Most\nboys do, eventually.”\n“Thought about what?” Kip asked. The old man started speaking about\nwhatever he was thinking of at times, not bothering to connect them for his\nlistener.\n“Whether you’re the Lightbringer, of course.” There was a savage,\namused edge to Andross Guile’s tone, like he was juggling fire and\nthrowing it to Kip still burning.\n“No,” Kip said. Something in him seized up. “Let’s play.”\n“He’s supposed to be of mysterious birth, and yours is at least dubious—\nwhich could be close enough.”\nKip flushed. “Your turn,” he said.\n“The old word that says he’ll be a ‘great’ man from his youth could be a\npun in the original Parian—another meaning of the word ‘great’ is ‘rotund.’\nWhich… well.”\nDie, you old cancer. “Your turn,” Kip said.\n“But I am moving, don’t you see?” Andross asked. “When the\nLightbringer comes, he’s going to upend everything. Anyone who has\nwealth, position, or power will fear him because he could take it all away.\nBut everyone who doesn’t have any of those will love him, hoping he’ll\ngive all that to them. So what part will you play, Kip? Garden.”\nGarden? Oh, he was declaring the setting.\nKip drew—and got lucky. A hand full of time control cards.\nUsing his first turns to gather the light he needed in various colors, he\nappeared to do nothing.\nAndross played a Superchromat, a powerful card for a yellow deck,\nmeaning his spells wouldn’t fail, and then he drafted a yellow sword, which"

He wasn’t\naware of any green deck that used the strategy Kip was employing.\nAndross’s five-second sand clocks were swapped out for four-second\nclocks.\nAnd the pleasure of playing a Panic on the cold old man, who had\nprobably never panicked in his entire life, was a joyous dagger-twist.\nAndross attacked, and Kip didn’t even try to stop it. It took off nearly\nhalf his life.\nKip played another Panic. Four-second sand clocks were replaced with\nthree-second clocks.\nIt was, of course, a completely unfair strategy. It already took the blind\nman at least an additional second longer than a sighted man to tell what the\ncard played was, and three seconds was no time to come up with any sort of\ngood tactics.\nHe attacked again and took Kip within a hair’s breadth of death. Then\nKip followed up with a few weak attacks, barely staying alive. Between his\nown draw, reading his own card, and reading Kip’s, Andross had no time at\nall.\nKip Disarmed him, playing his own cards as quickly as he could to\ndeprive Andross of as much of his time as possible. Within five more turns,\nby a hundred weakling cuts, he’d killed the old man.\nAndross’s fist crashed onto the tabletop and he swept the sand clocks off\nthe table, smashing several against the wall. He balled his hands and his\nfists shook.\n“Give me your deck,” he said, barely leashing his rage.\n“It’s on the table. In front of you,” Kip said. His voice sounded thready\nand tight. Some dim part of him wondered why he was so terrified of an\nold, infirm man, but he was.\nAndross went through the deck with surprising speed, given his\nblindness. “You switched decks,” he said. “Grinwoody?”\n“My lord, I didn’t see him do it. It was my failure.”\nAndross screamed, voice raw, “I know it was your failure!” Kip was\nsuddenly intensely aware that Andross Guile was the Red. He’d been using\nred luxin for twice as long as Kip had been alive. The darkness of the room\nwas to keep Andross from becoming a color wight—and the man might be\nvery, very close to the line. “Out, bastard! Out!”\nKip sat very still. Licked his lips.\n“I said, out!” Andross roared.\nKip cowered. Very quietly and respectfully, he said, “I need Teia’s writ,\nmy lord. And my deck. Please.”\nAndross snarled and flung Kip’s deck in his face. He whirled and\nstormed to his bedchamber. He paused at the open door, but didn’t turn his\nback. “Grinwoody!” he barked.\n“Yes, my lord,” the slave said. After their years together, the little man\nwas able to discern exactly what the Red wanted from the barest\nmodulation of his voice."

Kip was dimly aware that even in this\nloss, Andross Guile was getting some information out of him. Kip had no\nidea what the information was good for, but he knew the spider was\nspinning silken snares with every breath.\nGrinwoody filled out the forms, affixed the seal, and handed them to\nKip.

Enjoy.”\nChapter 59\n~Shimmercloak~\nTap, tap, tap, tap…\nOut of time. Out of place.\nDissolving.\nAs his fingers touched each point, he felt as if a scroll unfurled. Not\nsimply the senses: the five central colors offering sight, touch, hearing,\nsmell, and taste, but more. Superviolet and blue came together through his\nthumb at the bottom left of the card: cities and superstructures, their\noutlines burning in tight, logical lines, then rising up out of the page, lines\nof reason, of thought, of history, causality lifting up—and still deeper he\nplunged.\nGreen through his forefinger at the top left of the card. Embodiment: the\nhealth, the shape of the body that he now knew he would inhabit, but also\nthe bodies around him, the physical presences, the lives—the sick, the\nweak, the vivacious. Even the flashes of the fishes in the bay, the\nbackground light of the life in the waves, and the cool peace emanating\nfrom the grasses and the trees of this island. His body in this card was\nstrong, a man in his prime, some aches, though. Perhaps a warrior of some\nsort? An old back injury, never quite healed. An ankle that he’d rolled a\ndozen times, always weak. And then, deeper, he felt the strength of his\nmuscles, the grace of a fighter who’d grown up in a dance troupe, felt the\ndammed-up libido of a man traveling with a woman he desires.\nThe next finger to touch was his ring finger. Top right corner. Orange.\nWhere green was life, the orange was the connections between the living.\nThose glowing blue lines of causality, of logic, now came alive. Those\nlines, without this, were meaningless. Some of those blue structures were\nthe lies he’d told, the foundations he’d placed for falsehoods, false trails,\ndeceptions that made sense to his inquisitors.

It’s why I’m still alive, twenty years later. My first three\npartners hadn’t been as careful as I am. I barely recovered Gebalyn’s cloak\nlast time, and wasn’t able to pull it out of the fire before it lost six precious\nthumb-widths off the hem. That cloak would always have to go to someone\nas short as Niah now. It was already hard enough to find lightsplitters—now\nmy matron would have to find a short splitter.\nNot my problem.\nAll I hope is that this job hurts the Chromeria. Atirat is far more\naccepting of my little quirks than Orholam and his Chromeria would ever\nbe. The green goddess doesn’t chain those who love her. Atirat saved me\nfrom a life of self-loathing. She gives me freedom, acceptance. These cattle,\nthese chattel, would never know that.\nThe taxmen don’t stop me, don’t search my bag. Though they have the\nright to do so, the volume of people who come through is simply too high to\neffectively stop all of them. They do spot checks instead, pulling people out\nof the lines and searching for ratweed, for jewels, for saffron, for any items\nthat are small enough and precious enough that individuals could smuggle\nan untaxed fortune’s worth in their pockets.\nMaybe I don’t look the type, though in my experience smugglers do\nlook as bedraggled as I must. My beard needs a fresh oiling at the least. If I\ncan find an Atashian barber, I’ll get the whole beard redone—unbraided,\nbeads removed, combed out, face massage, dyed to cover the patchy gray,\nthen rebraided and tied, with gold beads perhaps instead of the blue glass I\nhave now, maybe some gold wire woven in. Gold wire, that’s how I’ll\nreward myself for this job, whatever it is.\nI catch up with Niah an hour later, after both of us have taken rooms in\nan inn, separately. There are good operational reasons for doing so, but\nNiah didn’t mention those when I suggested we save money by sharing a\nroom; she simply said that she’d kill me if I ever came into her room.\nSometimes I think she doesn’t like me much.

You need to go take\ncare of something before we can talk?” Spunky. Like that about her.\nI glance back up to her eyes. “You don’t want me to look, don’t show\n’em off. I’m free to look; you’re free to cover up. What’s the job?”\nShe looks around, making sure no one is close enough to listen in. She\nlowers her voice. “They want us to kill the Witch of the Winds. They want\nus to kill Janus Borig herself.”\nMy eyes go dark even as I feel dread shoot down into my stomach.\nSound ceases. I’m losing feeling, losing my train of thought. I’m being shot\nup and out and back.\nI hover, suspended between my own body and the body of a fat young\nman. Ugh, fat, after the glorious utility of my warrior-assassin’s frame, after\nthe grace earned by ten thousand hours of training. I’m sitting in the—\nWhat the hell?\nWhat was—\nHe was back.\nChapter 60\n“You won me? You won me in a card game?” Teia asked.\n“Yes?” Kip said.\nIt was after their midnight workout and drafting practice. Teia had\napparently noticed that Kip was acting strange and had cornered him. Now\nthey were sitting in his new room. He was still hot from their exercise,\nwearing a towel around his shoulders, having a hard time making eye\ncontact. He wasn’t even sure why he felt ashamed.\n“What did you bet against me? I mean, what stakes did you put up?”\nTeia asked. “You don’t own anything. I mean, no offense. I don’t either,\nbut…”\n“It wasn’t really a bet like that. The Red was—I don’t know—seeing\nhow much strain he could put on me, I guess. It was you against… a secret\nthat he thinks I have.”\n“I… see.” Teia’s nose wrinkled for a second. She saw that he wasn’t\ngoing to trust her. “I’m sorry, I’m not at my best when I’m tired,” she said.\n“They gave you my papers?”\nKip waved toward his desk where the stamped paper sat. “I already\nregistered it with the head scribe. He said they have to query the Abornean\nsatrap’s embassy to make sure there’s no liens on you, but with it\ncountersigned by Andross Guile, he was sure there would be nothing\nwrong. He already entered it in the Chromeria’s books.”\nTeia was still blinking like a child who’s fallen and can’t decide whether\nshe’s hurt or not. Is the right response tears, or just getting back up and\nwalking away? “You won me?” she asked again. “What… what are you\ngoing to do with me?”\nHer eyes flicked to his bed, back to his eyes, then down.\n“No!” Kip said. “Like you said, that’s forbidden for Blackguards. I…”\n“For full Blackguards, not for scrubs,” she said quietly. “Not until you\ntake the vows.”"

I…”\n“For full Blackguards, not for scrubs,” she said quietly. “Not until you\ntake the vows.”\nNo woman would ever take Kip to her bed willingly. Not for himself.\nHe’d have to get a room slave to do it, or a prostitute. He was fat, a bastard,\nstupid, ugly, awkward, Tyrean, mixed-breed. He didn’t know how to talk to\ngirls like other boys did. This was his only chance. Teia wasn’t exactly\nvolunteering, but she didn’t seem disgusted by him either. Andross Guile\nwas right.\nHe could always free her later. Or if they both became Blackguards, they\nwould take the vows, and it would end there.\nKip would get something for himself for once. He’d earned it. All those\nhours studying, memorizing decks and strategies when he could have been\nstudying drafting instead. He’d known that he shouldn’t use the black deck\ntrick saving Teia. He should have held on to that to save himself. He was\nrisking his own future for her. She owed him. Without Kip, she’d belong to\nAndross Guile. He’d saved her from that spider. What was so wrong with\nwanting a little gratitude in return?\nGratitude, huh? Is that what you’ve been fantasizing about, Kip?\nTeia set her bag down. Her voice was distant, empty. “Do you want me\nto wash up first? Or I could bring up hot water and we could wash together.\nOr… I’m sorry, Kip. I mean, my lord. I’ve never done this before. I don’t—\nI didn’t expect my mistress to sell me. She seemed very set—I—I’m talking\ntoo much, aren’t I?”\nAnd he had fantasized about Teia. And felt awful afterward.\nKip scrubbed his towel over his face. She was a slave. He hadn’t\nenslaved her; it was just how things were. All this wasn’t his idea, and he\nhad to pay penalties for how things were, too. He hadn’t chosen to be a\nbastard, but he had to live with that, didn’t he? He took his lumps, it was\nonly fair that he get some of the rewards. He deserved this. Besides, just\nbecause it was a duty didn’t mean it had to be unpleasant. Kip would be\ngood to her. He would care about her. He would be better to her than any\nslave girl could hope a man would be.\nTeia swallowed. “I’m a virgin, but the room slaves talked about their\nwork—a lot.” She blushed. “I think I know what to do.” She swallowed\nagain.\nAnd really, what could she hope for that was better if he freed her? Did\npeasants have things so much better than slaves?\nTemptation is a slow and subtle serpent.\nI am the turtle-bear. I’m fat and ungainly and ridiculous, but at least I\ncan be honest with myself. I want to take her because I’m terrified I’ll never\nget the chance to bed anyone ever again. And I’ll be nice to her because I\ndon’t want to feel guilty afterward.

I didn’t mean anything\nby it. I’m sorry. I’m all thumbs at this. I should shut up and—” She crossed\nher arms and grabbed the hem of her shirt.\nKip grabbed her arm before she could strip, stopping her. He ignored the\nbewildered look on her face, went to his desk, and grabbed the papers. He\nhanded them to her, avoided her eyes.\n“You’re free. I won’t be able to get it registered until the first transfer\nclears the embassy—I tried, but as far as I’m concerned, you don’t belong\nto me.” That sounded bad, for some reason. Kip rubbed his face with the\ntowel. “No one had slaves where I grew up, so I don’t know how people\nusually do this, but… I don’t want to know how it works. The idea of\ncompelling you to… to do the things that awful old man suggested… I hate\nmyself enough already.”\n“You haven’t been sleeping, have you?” Teia asked.\n“What’s that got to do with anything?”\n“So you haven’t.”\nKip looked away. “I have… bad dreams.” Bad dreams. That was putting\nit mildly. “Whether I sleep or not, I’m more tired in the morning.”\n“Go to bed, Kip. We’ll talk about this in the morning.”\n“I’m serious, Teia.”\n“Me, too. To bed,” she said firmly.\n“I thought I was the master around here,” Kip said. He regretted saying\nit immediately, but she laughed and swatted his butt. She’d laughed a little\ntoo hard, though, obviously at least as relieved as he was.\nHe went to bed and, miracle of miracles, slept.\nIn the morning, Kip felt ridiculously well. For ten seconds. He caught\nhimself humming.\nThen he thought about the dagger.\nHe sponged himself clean, put on fresh clothes, and then poked his head\nout of his door quickly. No spies, at least none that he noticed.\nHe used the stairs to go down to his old barracks level. He still didn’t\nhave a plan, but he knew he couldn’t leave a priceless relic in some random\nchest forever. He slipped into the barracks and walked quickly down the\nrows.\nThe bed under which he’d hidden the dagger had been claimed. The\nchest was moved to the foot of the bed, like all the other occupied beds.\nKip’s throat clamped shut.\nHe threw the chest open. A change of clothes, an extra blanket, a few\ncoins. No dagger. Oh hell. Oh hell no. Dear Orholam no.\n“What are you doing in my stuff?” a voice said from the latrine\ndoorway. It was a new boy, someone Kip had never seen before. Pimply,"

There was just the standard blanket when I\ngot the chest. Are you stealing from me?”\n“Oh shut up,” Kip said.\n“You’re Breaker, aren’t you?” the boy asked.\nGreat. Kip didn’t say anything. He left.\nHe went downstairs and got in a student line. He was here during\nlectures, so the line was empty. The secretary obviously knew Kip was\nskipping lectures, too. He took his time coming over.\nKip bit his tongue.\n“Are you lost, young man?” the secretary asked him. The man was\nholding a steaming cup of kopi.\n“No, but something of mine is. Do you have an area where you keep lost\nitems?”\n“Indeed,” the man said. “What have you lost?”\nKip swallowed.\n“Please don’t tell me you’ve lost a number of coins, but you can’t\nremember exactly how many.” The man smiled humorlessly and sipped at\nhis kopi.\n“No. Um.” Kip lowered his voice. “A knife in a sheath, about this long,\nwhite ray skin on the um, grip, some um, glass embedded in the blade?”\n“You boys and your games.”\n“I’m serious.”\nThe man took another sip of his kopi, rolled his eyes, and went to a box\nbehind his desk. He began rummaging through old cloaks and trousers.\n“Slaves clean the rooms, you know. Shifty lot. No morals. Thieves half the\ntime. You really shouldn’t leave anything out that—” He stopped speaking.\nKip heard the unmistakable sound of a blade sliding out of its sheath.\nHis heart leapt.\nThe man came back to the counter and laid the blade on the counter. It\nwas the real thing. His eyes were wide.\nKip swept it off the counter. “It might, uh, be wiser for you to not tell\nanyone about this,” he said. “Um, I didn’t mean that to sound like a threat. I\nmeant it’s kind of incredibly important, so if anyone else comes looking for\nit, maybe you haven’t ever seen it and don’t know what they’re talking\nabout? And if you ever find out which slave brought it here, tell them\nthanks. I probably owe them my life or something.”\nThe man sipped his kopi nonchalantly. There were beads of sweat on his\nforehead, though.\nI don’t have anywhere to conceal a big knife.\nAs if it weren’t terribly conspicuous, Kip took the knife and stuck it up\nhis sleeve, the hilt concealed as much as possible in his hand. He swallowed\nand tightened his belt with one hand.\nGirding up my loins, I guess.\nLoins. Kip didn’t like the word.\nThe secretary cleared his throat. “Is there anything else I can help you\nwith?” he asked.\nOh, Kip was stalling.\n“No. Thanks again.” Then he was off."

He didn’t have any safe place to put\nsomething worth a fortune, but he found himself walking toward Janus\nBorig’s house. She had things that were worth a fortune, hidden in plain\nsight. Maybe she could give him some advice.\nWhen he got to the entry hall, he realized that everyone coming inside\nwas soaking wet. He thought about going back up to his room and getting a\ncloak, but his room could well have a spy on it, and he already was doing a\nbad job of protecting the dagger. Getting lucky once was great, but\nexpecting it to happen again was too much.\nHe’d just have to get wet. Orholam knew he had enough insulation to\nkeep warm. He braced himself against the downpour and started jogging.\nWhen he reached Janus Borig’s house, sopping wet and freezing cold,\nhe found the door bashed in, torn off its hinges, the iron twisted and ripped.\nHe smelled something in the air. Blood. Blood and smoke.\nChapter 61\nKip could feel fear trying to paralyze him, but fear was slow. Fear could\nonly perch on his shoulders and spread its black wings over his face if he\ngave it a place to roost. It flew around his head, stabbing its bloody beak for\nhis eyes, but Kip was faster. He burst inside.\nHe ran into something as he stepped through the torn door. Something\nyielding and invisible. Not something. Someone.\nKip’s weight did something useful for once, and he fell forward,\nstaggering into Janus Borig’s house and knocking over the invisible figure.\nHe saw the flash of a trouser leg through an open cloak, as the man tumbled\nover a shattered bookshelf.\nThere was a small explosion of cards. The man must have had his hands\nfull of them, and as he hit the ground, they went everywhere.\nThen, in a rustle of cloth, he disappeared.\nKip jumped to his feet, slipped on the trash on the floor, and saw dead\nbodies. Armed men, perhaps half a dozen, all uniformed in black with a\nsilver shield embroidered on their chests. Janus Borig’s guards. All the dead\nwere her guards. They hadn’t killed anyone in return.\nThe sound of steel being drawn cut through the muted hiss of the rain\nand wind outside.\nKip widened his eyes to the sub-red spectrum—and the invisible man\nsnapped into focus. Cloaked but still radiating more heat than his\nsurroundings. He was walking straight toward Kip, not bothering to lower\nhis own center of gravity. Kip must look like easy meat.\nLooking around frantically like he had no idea what was going on, Kip\nwaited until the cloaked man stepped closer. Apparently the cloak only\nconcealed what was beneath it, so the man had only a short sword, and he\ncouldn’t lift it until the last second or it would be revealed, hanging in\nmidair.

He leapt toward the\nman and to the side, left arm sweeping in a block that batted the man’s\nsword arm even as it came up, and his right hand burying his own dagger in\nthe man’s chest.\nSub-red was bad for making out detail, or Kip was just clumsy, because\nhis feet landed on books and apple cores and flew out from under him. He\nlost his dagger.\nHe popped back up to his feet, the battle rush making him shake. The\ninvisible man was now very much visible, flopped on his back, arms wide,\nunmoving, Kip’s dagger staked straight through his chest.\nKip looked around frantically. Janus had had a thousand muskets in\nhere. Why couldn’t he find any of them now? Nothing seemed to be on fire\nnow, though the smell of smoke was heavy in the air. He also smelled the\nresinous, fresh cedar smell of green luxin. They’d smothered fires with\nluxin. Fires. Janus Borig had said she’d booby-trapped the cards upstairs.\nMaybe she’d laid traps down here, too.\n“Vox?!” a woman’s voice shouted from upstairs. “What was that?”\nSnatching up his dagger from the dead man, Kip charged up the steps, as\nstealthy as a rhinoceros falling onto a crate of porcelain. The woman was\nstanding at the wall of cards, pulling them down, sticking them into a\nwooden case with dividers, but she was already looking alarmed when Kip\ncame into her view. She dropped the case onto a table and pulled her cloak\naround herself.\nWithout noticing, Kip had let his eyes go back to normal vision, and he\nsaw the briefest glimpse of the upper room. Janus Borig lay in a bloody\nheap by her desk, dead. One smooth section of the wall had been broken\nopen, revealing a hiding place that must have held cards or other treasures,\nand half the wall was bare.\nThe shimmer came toward him, and he relaxed his eyes. The invisible\nwoman became a warm glow, coming fast toward him, raising her short\nsword at the last second. These assassins must be used to easy kills, because\nwhen Kip dodged, she was so surprised she didn’t even try to adjust. He\nspun as he jumped past her and lashed out.\nHis dagger brushed something and then pulled through. Kip thought—\nhoped—that it was the side of her neck. He crouched low, out in the middle\nof the room.\n“You’re a sub-red,” she said. “Always hated sub-reds.” She shimmered\nback into visibility. She was a petite woman, blonde hair and pale skin, blue\neyes made mostly green by drafting. Eyes narrow, face like a ferret. Her\nhair was pulled back into two braids. One of them had been cut halfway\nthrough by Kip’s dagger. She drew a pistol.\nKip snatched up Janus’s little chair and threw it at the assassin. She\njumped aside, but had already pulled her trigger. The gun roared, its sound\namplified in the small room. A series of loud whines, one on top of the\nother, rang out as the lead ball ricocheted off the walls."

A series of loud whines, one on top of the\nother, rang out as the lead ball ricocheted off the walls.\nThe woman cursed and grabbed her leg, either hit by the bullet or faking\nit. Kip had no idea how badly it had wounded her. She threw the pistol at\nhim, missed, and then attacked him with the short sword.\nHer blade wasn’t a fencing weapon by any means. Short and broad, it\nwas meant for stabbing the unsuspecting, and making sure that single stab\nwas lethal. Kip’s blade was almost the same length, but narrower, sharper,\nand held by a much worse fighter and a much bigger target.\nBut the woman was hurt. Kip got into a knife fighting stance, trying to\nremember everything his trainers had ever said. The assassin might be\nfeigning that her injury was worse than it was to lure Kip into doing\nsomething stupid.\nPatience. If she was hurt, she’d do something reckless to try to end the\nfight quickly.\n“People will be here any second,” Kip said. “You might as well—”\nShe lunged at him and he batted her short sword aside and punched her\nin the face with his ruined left hand. At least it made a good fist—and good\ncontact. She staggered back, wobbling a bit on her injured left leg.\nIf he’d followed hard after that strike, he could have ended the fight\nthere, but he was tentative, worried she was tricking him.\nShe recovered, nose streaming blood, weaving. Maybe exaggerating the\nweaving a little.\n“Every guard captain in five blocks has been bribed,” she said. “And\nyou hear that?”\nKip wasn’t sure what she was talking about. Oh, the thunder.\n“That means no one who’s heard the shots will think anything of it.\nYou’re going to die here, fire boy.”\n“Why’d you do it?” Kip asked. Stalling. He could see a bloodstain\nspreading on her dark trousers. The ricochet had hit her.\nThere is no cheating in war; there are only survivors and victims.\nTrainer Fisk had pounded those lessons into his class. Blackguards weren’t\ntaught to duel; they were taught to kill.\nKip was no knife fighter, but he was stronger than this woman,\nespecially as the blood loss weakened her. Their slow circling had brought\nhim back within reach of the stool.\n“Orders,” she said. “And who the hell are you, so I can report who we\nkilled?”\n“Kip Guile,” he said.\n“Guile?”\nKip hurled his knife at the woman. It was never a good idea to throw\nyour knife, unless you know how to throw knives. Kip didn’t. But she\nwasn’t expecting it—and it hit her, right in her chest. Hilt first.\nBut she jumped back, cursing, and Kip grabbed the stool, swinging it\nwith both hands in a great arc.\nThe assassin tried to move back farther, but she was right against the\nwall, there was nowhere to go.

She was reaching over to grab it with her left hand when Kip\ncrashed into her, smashing her against the wall with his lowered shoulder.\nHe heard the whoosh of her breath being crushed out of her, and then\nthey were both scrambling for her dagger.\n“Niah!” A voice cried out from the stairs. “Get down!”\nKip turned to see the other assassin—the one he swore he’d killed—\nstanding there, pistol leveled. The assassin, Niah, tried to wriggle away\nfrom Kip and dive to the floor, but he held her, absorbed by the tiny orange\ndot hovering above the man’s pistol—a burning slow match. It slapped\ndown into the pan.\nKip spun with Niah, face-to-face, abandoning all thought of the dagger\nbetween them.\nA boom, and she snapped her head forward into his face. Her headbutt\ncaught him in the nose and lip. His eyes instantly flooded with tears.\n“Niah!”\nKip stumbled backward, tripped, fell on his ass. The assassin Niah\ndropped like a pile of meat, the back of her skull exploded. What Kip had\nthought was a headbutt was her brained skull snapping forward into him\nfrom absorbing a bullet.\nHe smacked his head on the wall as he fell, not so hard that it dazed him,\nbut it still hurt.\nI’m a moron. He reached into a pocket and snatched out his green\nspectacles.\nThe other assassin, Vox, was staring in horror at the shattered head of his\npartner, whom he’d just killed. But Kip’s movement made him spring into\naction, leaping forward and kicking Kip in the head.\nKip’s shoulder took most of the blow, and he rolled with the kick,\nputting as much distance between himself and Vox as he could. He saw the\nassassin snatching up Niah’s short sword. Kip staggered to his feet,\nunarmed, trapped in a corner of the room, just as Vox settled into a fighting\nstance. From the stance alone, Kip could tell he was a warrior.\nKip’s spectacles were bent but still in his hand. No time. He’d get them\non his face about the time the sword ended his life.\nBoth he and the assassin lunged at the same time: Vox lunging for Kip,\nKip lunging for the cards on the wall. Kip raked his hand down the wall,\ntearing off four, five, six cards.\nA gush of flames shot straight out of the wall. If Kip had been standing\nin front of the cards, he would have been consumed. Instead, the flames\nmade a wall between him and the assassin, who skidded to a stop. Kip\npulled on his spectacles, bending them roughly into place and sucking in\ngreen. Vox saw what he was doing, and as the curtain of flame dwindled to\nnothing, they both threw up an open hand to fling luxin at each other."

Then Kip’s green missile speared through his stomach.\nThe man fell to the floor and wailed. “Atirat! Atirat, come back. What\nhave you done to me?!” he shouted at Kip. He wasn’t looking at his\nstomach. He wasn’t looking at his death wound. He was looking at his\nhands.\nKip coughed. The wall holding the remainder of the cards had caught\nfire. Some of the cards sparked and spat, like tree sap in the blaze. Others\nsat placid in the flames. The fire was spreading, fast.\nA breathy, labored voice said, “Kip.”\nIt came from the corner. Janus Borig. She was alive.\n“Get the knife, you fool,” she said.\n“What?” Kip asked, like a simpleton. Oh, his knife. The one he’d\nthrown away during the fight. That knife.\nKip had to step over Niah’s body, her exploded head still leaking blood\nin an expanding circle. He looked away quickly so he didn’t vomit.\nThe other assassin was babbling something about being unclean,\nunworthy, ruined. He was weeping, gasping, but he didn’t seem like he had\nthe strength to make any trouble. Kip found the dagger and stood up into\nthe smoke just as he heard a scream.\nHe flinched, ducked low, and was in time to see Vox—who had taken off\nhis cloak and his shirt for some reason—slash open the side of his own\nneck. Blood fountained out, and the assassin stared at Kip, his brown eyes\nfull of hatred, for a single moment, then he slumped over, unconscious.\nWhat the hell?\nKip ran back to Janus. “Cloaks, Kip.”\n“We can get you a cloak once we get out of here,” Kip said.\n“Stupid, wonderful boy. Their cloaks.” Her voice was weak.\nKip obeyed. His brain didn’t seem to be working correctly, so he was\nglad to have the direction—even if the direction didn’t make sense in a\nhouse that was rapidly filling with smoke. The man had thrown his cloak\noff, so that was easy to grab, but the woman’s cloak was still around her\nbody. Kip looked away as he rolled her off it, but still it stuck, and he saw\nthat the cloak was bound to a choker collar of gold around the woman’s\nthroat.\nFocusing just on his fingers so he didn’t get overwhelmed by the gore\nand lose control, he unclasped the choker and finally pulled the cloak away.\nHe took a deep breath in the less smoky air down by the ground, and\nmoved over to Janus Borig. He lifted her in his arms. Then he saw the cards\nagain, and it hit him.\nThe precious cards lining the walls were aflame, each a little torch as the\nluxins within them flared.\n“Don’t worry about them.

They’re worth a—”\n“Go, Kip.” Her voice was weak.\nKip stumbled down the steps, with the old woman in his arms, his head\ncoming dangerously close to the open flames, the heat a wall.\nThe flames were crawling down the side of the stairs, and Kip saw\ngarbage smoldering as they reached the ground level.\nOrholam have mercy, this room wasn’t only full of garbage. It was full\nof black powder.\nKip pushed toward the door, having to step deliberately to get around\nthe trash, his arms full of old lady, cloaks, and one big-ass knife.\n“One moment,” Janus said in Kip’s ear right before he carried her out\nthe door. Her voice was a whisper. “Turn a…” He turned her and she\nreached out toward her tobacco box.\n“Are you kidding me?” Kip asked. “You want a smoke? Now?”\nShe rooted around in the box for one moment more, and from beneath\nthe tobacco she pulled out a small lacquered olivewood and ivory box, only\nlarge enough to hold a single deck of cards.\n“Ha! They didn’t get ’em.” She gave a wan smile. “What are you\nwaiting for? This place is on fire.”\nKip carried her out into the night. It was storming, hard, lightning\nflashing, thunder shaking the buildings, rain smothering the streets. No one\nhad noticed that the small building was on fire yet. Kip carried Janus down\nthe street and had barely turned into an alley when he heard an explosion\nfrom her house. Then another, much bigger. He stumbled, fell, barely able\nto cushion the woman’s fall.\nHe propped her up in the wet, dirty alley, abruptly exhausted.\n“I don’t suppose you grabbed my brushes,” she asked, eyebrows lifting.\nThe rain had washed the blood from her face, but she was looking\nunhealthily pale, somehow luminous. “Because…” She smiled, her eyes\nunnaturally bright. “I know who the Lightbringer is now.”\nAnd then she died.\nChapter 62\nThe Color Prince’s army had fought through the pass into Atash with few\ncasualties. Liv hadn’t seen any of the fighting, and all the evidence of it was\ngone by the time she’d gone through.\nAfter they made it through the pass, everyone had assumed they’d head\nstraight for Idoss, the largest city in southern Atash. Instead, while smaller\nparties of foragers fanned out through the Atashian countryside to feed the\narmy, the prince had taken the bulk of the army south, deeper into the\nmountains. He cut across the river and the main road, and then marched\nupstream, instead of downstream to Idoss.\nEventually, they came to the great silver mines at Laurion. Liv had never\nseen anything like it. The hills for at least a league in every direction were\nstudded with holes. Three hundred and fifty mines, the prince said, worked\nby thirty thousand slaves. The mines were owned by the Atashian\ngovernment, but nobles throughout the Seven Satrapies leased them and\npaid rents and a share of their profits to the state. Liv had heard of slaves"

The mines were owned by the Atashian\ngovernment, but nobles throughout the Seven Satrapies leased them and\npaid rents and a share of their profits to the state. Liv had heard of slaves\nbeing sent to the mines, but she’d never had any real concept of what it\nmeant, other than that it was something bad that owners could threaten\nrebellious or lazy slaves with. Some Atashian students had mentioned their\nfamilies renting out their slaves for the months after harvest to rich\nslaveholders who would transport them to the mines, work them, and send\nthem back before planting. Apparently, a lot didn’t come back, and most\nfamilies would only rent out their slaves that way if they desperately needed\nthe money.\nAround the hills beyond the mines was a ring of wooden towers. The\narea inside was too vast to enclose with a fence, but the land had been\ncleared of timber. Any escaping slave would have to cross a great deal of\nopen ground. Each wooden tower had a small complement of guards,\nhorses, and several slave-hunting mastiffs.\nA small town called Thorikos sat below the mines on the river. Here, the\nore was loaded onto barges, food was brought in from the surrounding\ncountryside, trade was conducted between slaveholders, medical treatment\nand tools were sold, and disputes were adjudicated. Thorikos was mostly\nempty, though. Everyone who could flee had. Left behind were only an old\nassemblyman and those citizens too old or ill to make the trip. Liv\nwondered at the cowardice of their families. Who would leave his mother to\nan advancing army? War brings out the worst in many, and the best in few.\nThere was no battle. When the overlords of the mine saw the forces\narrayed against them, they knew it would be suicide. The soldiers stationed\nat Laurion were guards who kept the slaves in and captured those who\nescaped, not disciplined fighting men. They had only half a dozen drafters,\nnone of them women skilled in battle. All those had been withdrawn to\nIdoss.\nThe assemblyman met the Color Prince outside of town. He looked quite\nfrightened by the sight of the prince. Liv had forgotten how overwhelming\nhe was at first. But the old man surrendered gracefully and begged for\nmercy.\nThe Color Prince granted it. He swore no one would be killed or\naccosted, that nothing would be stolen except food and tools.\nAnd he was true to his word, though it caused grumbling. It would have\nbeen harder, Liv realized, if the army had experienced any privation. Since\ntheir food stores were still well stocked and no one had yet died in claiming\nplunder, it was far easier to ask the army to go without.\nThe prince took great care in how he seized the mines themselves. He\nsent soldiers to circle through the hills to capture each wooden watchtower\nto keep the slaves from escaping in the chaos. If he really did mean to free\nthe slaves as he’d claimed, he meant to do it at his own pace, in his own\nway.\nAnd so it was. Koios White Oak loved a spectacle. As the evening sun\nset the sky alight with fire, he spoke to the thirty thousand gathered slaves.\nAll would be released immediately as soon as they listened to his few, poor\nwords. He would clothe and feed them all tonight. They were free to go"

They were free to go\nwherever they pleased so long as they didn’t steal from his people or join\nthe Chromeria against them. Or, he said, they could march with him, and\ntake equal shares of the plunder with the rest of his soldiers, and exact\nvengeance, and perhaps make enough to start a life, to earn a plot of land if\nthey wished to farm or a grant of money if they wished to live in the cities.\nThey had ten days to decide, but they had to decide before he assaulted\nIdoss. If they chose to march with the army, they would be choosing to live\nby the army’s rules. But it was their own choice, freely given, and they\nwould from this day never be slaves again.\nWith his own hands, he struck the chains off an old slave’s hands.\nIt was a huge gamble, and the next day it looked like it was one that had\nfailed spectacularly. The slaves sent to the silver mines weren’t the best and\nmost temperate men. They were the captured pirates, the violent, the\ndisobedient, the lazy, the rebellious. They were the kind of men who hated\nhaving rules at all, and only perhaps a tenth showed up for the drills the\nnext morning. The army spent that day training, and only began its march at\nnoon the next day.\nBy the third day, Liv realized what the prince had been betting on. The\nfreed men, though now clothed and unbound, had no food. The Color\nPrince’s foragers had denuded the land of crops and livestock. No one\nwould beat the freed men, but no one would feed them either. Of course,\nmost of them were very familiar with privation; starving the slaves was\nseen as the best way to cure lustfulness and laziness. They could deal with\nthe pain of an empty belly. For a while.\nThere was no traffic on the roads except other slaves, so there was no\none to rob even if they wanted to. One small band had attacked the camp,\nmaking off with food, but not horses. They’d been hunted down, tied up,\nsprayed with red luxin, and set afire alive. As three days turned to four,\nlarge groups began traveling parallel to the slow-moving army.\nOn the fifth day, at dinner, thousands came into camp. They were given\ncrusts, nothing more. Free men work for their meat, they were told. The\nnext morning, thousands more were at the drills.\nBy the tenth day, twenty-two thousand men had been added to the army.\nOf course, adding such huge numbers of untrained, undisciplined men to\nan already undertrained and undisciplined army caused huge problems. Liv\nwould listen to the advisers bickering late into the night about it, even\nraising their voices to the prince. Should the slaves be put into their own\nunits, or incorporated into existing ones? (The latter.) What was to be done\nabout slaves who accosted women or men in the camp? (Immolation.) The\nslaves were all men, and only the camp overseers and their favorites—\nwho’d all fled—had been allowed to visit the prostitutes in Thorikos.

Could\nanything be done for them?\nThe prince had addressed that by bringing together representatives of the\nslaves, his generals, and the prostitutes—who hadn’t been organized in any\nsort of a guild, but did so rapidly when they were told that they could thus\nmake a fortune. Liv’s ears burned as she listened, but the prince never asked\nher to leave. He got the Mother of the Companions, as the prostitutes\nwished to be called, to tell him how many clients their women could serve\nin a day. He had two-thirds that many chits made up, made of bronze, each\nstamped with a lewd act. Then he made up a much smaller number of silver\nchits that could be used for the best Companions—he left it up to the\nMother to decide how she wished to choose those women. He distributed a\nthird of the chits to the generals, a third to the head of the foragers, and a\nthird to his bursar.\nChits were to be given to men who gave extraordinary service—either\nbringing in many more crops or volunteering for particularly hazardous\nassignments for the generals. At least half of the chits had to be distributed\nto slaves, and if there was any corruption in hoarding chits or dispensing\nthem only to favorites, the corrupt man or woman would be drawn, hanged,\nand immolated. Then, every day, the Companions would turn in the chits\nfor reimbursement. The last third could be purchased by anyone in the army\nfor set prices, helping offset the subsidy for the others.\nThe prince said, “For the next two weeks, I want you to do your best to\nfind ways to give out as many of these as possible, and not to the same men\nover and over. Give everyone a chance to earn one. After that, we’ll scale\nback. We don’t want riots or rapists this week, but we don’t want financial\nruin next week either.”\nThe next day, it seemed the camp shrank by a third as the newly freed\nmen went out on volunteer missions in every direction.\nAs they approached Idoss, the towns got bigger and the loot got better.\nNone resisted until they were almost on the outskirts of Idoss itself. This\ncity, Ergion, had a stone wall, archers, a few drafters. Liv couldn’t figure\nwhat the people of the city were thinking—Idoss, which might be defended,\nwas only a day’s trip away for a family, two days for an army. An easy trip,\nwhen fleeing for your life. But somehow the city elders had convinced\nthemselves they could scatter a slave army like chaff.\nThe headsman spat from the ramparts and instructed his archers to fire\non the Color Prince when he came forward to parley. The Color Prince’s\ndrafters deflected the arrows easily.\nWith drafters providing cover from the archers, their sappers—former\nminers, half of them—placed gunpowder charges under the wall within an\nhour. They blew open a hole and had the city in flames in another.\nThis time, the Color Prince gave orders for no quarter to be given. This\nwould be an example, he said. He only wanted five hundred women and\nchildren left alive.\nThe army went mad, and Liv stayed in the camp. Even dressed as a rich"

Even dressed as a rich\ndrafter and well-known as she was, it wasn’t safe in Ergion for a woman\nalone. She didn’t want to see what the freed men were doing to their former\nmasters anyway.\nThat night, a hugely muscled man whose status as a former slave could\nonly be noted by his sheared ear was allowed into the prince’s tent. He\nbowed and presented a sack. The city headsman’s head was inside.\nThe Color Prince gave him a handful of silver chits, looked him in the\neye, and nodded. As the brute left, leaving the disfigured head oozing blood\non the prince’s carpet, Koios White Oak simply said, “Amazing what a man\nwill risk for a few minutes with the mouth of a talented woman.”\nChapter 63\n~Samila Sayeh~\nTap, superviolet and blue. Tap, green. Tap, orange. Tap, yellow. Tap, red\nand sub-red.\nI’ve been having these waking dreams. Before the Guiles’ War had come\nto Ru, my favorite little cousin Meena was given an Ilytian dragon.\nEverywhere she’d gone, the toy had bobbed along in the air above her, tied\nto her wrist with a string, never deflating in the two months she had it.\nMeena had skipped everywhere, singing. Seven years old, and already she’d\nbeen training for two years. Her voice had a purity that transfixed soldiers\nand courtiers alike, but as often as not she’d make up her own nonsense\nsongs, skipping through town.\nMeena is dead. She would have been twenty-three years old now. She\nwanted to go to the Chromeria with me. I told her no. Of course, her mother\nnever would have let her go even if I’d asked. Most likely. I hadn’t tried.\nMeena died in General Gad Delmarta’s purge, her body tossed down the\nsteps of the Great Pyramid along with those of the rest of our family. Fifty-\nseven dead at the pyramid alone. Many more within the city, though those\ndeaths were more pedestrian, somehow mattered less—at least to my\npeople.\nI wonder if Meena would have become a drafter, a warrior like me. I had\nno interest in fighting until that butcher killed all my people. I became quite\na warrior, though. But evidently not enough of one.\nAnd now my time is done.\nWith the precision only the best blues can manage, I study the red tent\nthat is my cell.\nThe battle for Garriston was to have been my last fight. Usef and I had\nbeen overwhelmed by the wights and separated from the other veteran\ndrafters who’d volunteered to fight to the death instead of joining the\nFreeing.\nUsef and I had fought on opposite sides of the Prisms’ War, the False\nPrism’s War, the War of Guiles. One of my best friends from the Chromeria\nkilled Usef’s first wife. And Usef had killed her in turn. Usef and I had\nample reason to hate each other. Instead, we’d fallen in love.

All the veteran drafters had\nbeen broken into pairs, each armed with a pistol and a dagger. All of us\nwere close to breaking the halo, so whoever broke first would have their\npartner put them out of their madness. And if she was left alive alone, each\nwas responsible for ending her own life.\nI wondered if Usef could kill me, when it came to it. Usef was a blue,\nbut he was also a red. It was how he’d gotten his nickname, the Purple Bear.\nHe hated that name with a passion, thought it made him sound ridiculous.\nBut as I pointed out, it was really the only nickname possible. Usef was six\nand a half feet tall, barrel-chested, burly, and hairy, with a full, wild beard\nand long, wild dark hair and heavy brows. He was a bear, and a red and blue\ndisjunctive bichrome. His growling in response to people calling him the\nPurple Bear had only made the name stick.\nUsef’s chest exploded when a shell hit the building behind them.\nImpossibly, he’d stood, looking for me, relieved to find me, relieved that I\nwasn’t injured. His mouth moved. And then he’d died.\nI’d picked up my musket, and his, but instead of turning it on myself, I\nattacked the bastards. Found the cannon team. Massacred them. And there I\nbroke my halo.\nAt first I thought I’d been hit with musket fire. I lost consciousness, and\nfully believed I was dying. I was content with that.\nI love you, my Purple Bear.\nI woke in a blacked-out wagon, sick as a dim.\nEventually, perhaps weeks later, the wagon had been commandeered for\nother uses and set off from Garriston. I recovered, and now find myself\ndaily in this tent. I pick up snatches of conversation from the soldiers and\npeasants who pass too close, but all I can construct is speculative.\nObviously, we’re marching at the direction of this Color Prince and\ncovering a good distance daily, despite what seems a vast caravan.\nFrom the excitement on certain days, and the smell of smoke that isn’t\nwoodsmoke, I know we must have cut far enough south that they avoided\nthe Karsos Mountains, and that we have invaded Atash.\nEvery day, I’m chained and blindfolded carefully before we move, but\notherwise I haven’t been accosted. An odd mercy. I’m on the wrong side of\nforty years old now, but as a warrior, I long ago prepared myself for\noutrages, should I be captured. Weak men like to humble women, especially\ngreat women who make them feel as inferior. I do that constantly.\nSo what’s the game?\nI’m a formidable blue warrior, perhaps even a legend. And I’ve broken\nthe halo.\nAnd there it is. This Color Prince, whoever he is, wants me to join him.\nHe thinks that the longer he lets me sit in my blueness, the more likely I am\nto go mad and join him.\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve been underestimated. I don’t like it any\nmore now than I did as a young woman."

I don’t like it any\nmore now than I did as a young woman.\nMy tent isn’t large; I can’t stand up straight without brushing my head\non the fabric. My hands are manacled in front of me, and the manacles\nattach to the iron collar around my neck. My legs are hobbled with chains\naround my ankles, held apart by an iron pole.\nAll in all, it gives me reasonable freedom of movement, but little\npossibility of attacking anyone. Truth is, I’m no Blackguard: I wouldn’t\nknow how to attack someone with my hands even were I free. Well, I know\na few punches, but that’s a far different thing than being dangerous. Truth\nis, without drafting, I’m simply another helpless woman.\nBut I’m not ready to give up drafting yet.\nThey haven’t taken my ring—which absolutely must mean that the\nColor Prince intends to recruit me. They’d taken a long, hard look at the\nruby on my finger, another at the broken, pure blue halo in my eyes, and let\nme keep it.\nIt takes me two days to form my plan. The tent is red, so the light that\ncomes through it keeps me from panicking like darkness would, but it’s\nworthless to me for drafting. However, the tent is also made of cloth.\nStanding on tiptoe, I can pull a bit of the tent that is usually covered by the\nframe underneath it and gnaw on it. It takes me two days to chew a hole big\nenough to let in a tiny spotlight of clear, white light—but still small enough\nto be hidden to the eyes of those who fold up the tent every morning.\nThe next day, I nearly panick when I find that the hole isn’t there. But\nthere is no punishment, no mention of it. There must be more than one blue\ndrafter imprisoned as I am; our tents had merely been switched during the\nmarch.\nI begin again. This time, I’m luckier: I keep my own tent. On the twelfth\nday, the army takes one of its daylong breaks, camping in one spot for some\nkind of festival I can dimly overhear. No matter: I’m ready, and the tent has\nbeen aligned north-south, the most advantageous way with where I’d\nchewed the hole. I can peek out.\nAbove the tents is a large white canopy. I’d thought it had merely been\nclouds overhead, diffusing the blueness. Clouds that might burn off under\nOrholam’s gaze and give me the blessed blue of pure sky. It is white canvas\ninstead, allowing in light, but blocking my color. If I had spectacles, it\nwouldn’t matter. I don’t. I’m no Prism; white is as useless to me as no light\nat all. So this Color Prince isn’t stupid. He must know the tents are\nvulnerable. I hate him and admire him for it at the same time. But it doesn’t\ndissuade me.\nSilently blessing Usef for giving me the ring, I brace myself and begin\nslamming the “ruby” against my manacle. After a dozen attempts, I hit it\nright, and the top half of the jewel shears off, breaking the glue that held it"

I spend the next twenty minutes searching my tent for the fragment\nthat split off.\nAfter I find it, I put it in my mouth, moistening the glue. The red half of\nthe ring is useless to me, but if I’m interrupted I’ll need to put it back onto\nmy ring as quickly as possible.\nThe bottom half of the ring is sapphire blue. It’s tiny, but if it were\nlarger, it wouldn’t have escaped my gaolers’ notice. I pull the fabric of the\ntent to the left of the frame, slowly, carefully. Two hours before noon, the\nsun is high enough that pure light pours through it in a tiny speck, a\nspotlight, a pinprick of power. The fact that my hands are chained to my\nneck becomes another blessing, a gift from the distant Orholam. It allows\nme to rest my hands and yet keep them in place.\nI bathe my ring in that tiny spotlight, and it sends me thready blue\npower.\nIt takes hours, hours of barely blinking, of shifting minutely every\nminute as Orholam’s Eye climbs to the peak of the heavens and then begins\nits slow descent.\nWith evening coming, and the certain arrival of the steward who checks\non me, I bring the red glass chip to the front of my mouth and slowly reaffix\nit to the ring. Then I carefully move the blue luxin around beneath my skin,\npacking it so that it will inhabit my skin only under my clothing. I haven’t\nsoaked up much, despite the hours, but if my steward sees it, all my efforts\nwill have been in vain. So I move the luxin into my back and butt and\nthighs. They have respected my privacy so far, and if they do so for one\nmore night…\nThe steward comes. He sniffs once or twice, but seems to think he is\nallergic to something in “this damned country.” He leaves me the daily\nration. Then comes and takes the plate away when I’m finished.\nHe will come again at curfew. It gives me two hours. Two hours is\nplenty of time to die.\nWith trembling hands, I draft a tiny, sharp knife of blue luxin. More like\na nail, really. It isn’t as dramatic as slashing my wrists, but cut wrists can be\nbound, my life saved. A nail driven through my own heart? That is\nirrevocable, and reasonably quick. Even if my flesh betrays me and I cry\nout, there will be no saving me.\nI should have died in Garriston. I should have died with Usef. I hadn’t\ntold Usef that Gavin is really Dazen. I hadn’t trusted how he’d respond. I\nregret that now. He should have known for whom he died.\nBut no. He died for me. He didn’t care about this war. He didn’t care\nabout Orholam. He cared about doing what is right, gods or no gods,\nChromeria or no. And he cared about me. I should have told him. I should\nhave trusted him. It was a betrayal.\nI’m sorry, Usef.

I will go\nmad. I might already be mad.\nBut I don’t feel mad. I feel remarkably like… myself.\nMaybe that is the sign that I am mad—that I can’t see my own madness.\nBut that doesn’t make sense. Anyone in the world might be mad if thinking\nyou aren’t mad is a valid criterion.\nMaybe blue is seducing me. Yes. Maybe it is.\nBut if so, it is a logician’s seduction, not a lothario’s. If the blue is some\nseparate spirit, whispering sweet sins in my ears, I ought to be hearing\nthem. Instead, I simply have the vague reservation that what I’ve been\ntaught doesn’t align correctly with what I’m experiencing.\nI consider a thought that I had found disgusting in the past: remaking\nmyself with blue luxin.\nStill sounds disgusting.\nHow about something more borderline, like making permanent blue\ncaps for my eyes, to function as blue lenses?\nThat sounds difficult. If you cut off the eyes from air, they don’t do well,\nthat has been proven, but if you leave air holes—\nI’m getting caught up in the problems. Just like I always have. So… not\nchanged. Not changed at all.\nMaybe it is the drafting that changes you. Maybe once you start drafting\nblue after breaking the halo, it runs away with you. But I drafted blue just\nnow. Small amounts, sure.

It had been stuck to his face since her head had been blown apart. Kip\nconvulsed, flung it away.\nHe had to get out of here. First, he wrapped the cloaks around his body.\nWithout whatever magic had animated them before, they now seemed like\nvery pale, worn cloaks. Nothing special. The gold chokers dangled quite\nnaturally inside the cloak, as if they were often hidden from sight that way.\nKip pulled the hood up. The woman’s cloak was too small to fit him\ncomfortably, but he made it work. They were very thin, almost silky, and\nnot fully waterproof, but they were better than nothing. Kip didn’t even\nopen the box of cards—not in this rain.\nLast, he picked up the knife. He hadn’t put it in its sheath, just blandly,\nblindly carried both when he’d picked up Janus Borig and all the other stuff\nhe’d pulled out of the burning house like a looter. But there was something\noff. He swore the sheath was too short for the blade. No, it couldn’t be.\nHe sheathed the blade, and as he pushed it home, lightning flashed,\nilluminating the entire alley, blinding him momentarily. Blinking, he stared\nat the sheathed blade. The sheath fit perfectly. Still, he swore it looked\nlonger and wider than it had been before.\n“Fire! Fire!”\nSomeone went running past Kip’s alley, and suddenly he was starkly\naware that he was standing over the body of an old woman who’d been\nstabbed to death—with a knife in his hand, in an area that was going to be\nswarming with people soon.\nAnd so it was. Kip took off, and saw dozens, hundreds of people come\nout into the streets. “Lightning strike! Fire!” people shouted, pounding on\nthe doors of their neighbors.\nIn a city, fire was everyone’s problem, even in a storm. The storm was a\nblessing, of course, the rains helping the crowds extinguish the fires, but"

The storm was a\nblessing, of course, the rains helping the crowds extinguish the fires, but\neveryone turned out to battle the blaze lest it spread.\nKip got out of the neighborhood, made his way back toward the great\nbridge, the Lily’s Stem, but didn’t cross. He’d gone to seek Janus Borig to\nask her where to hide a great treasure: now he had four treasures.\nWhat the hell was he doing with four treasures?\nThe more relevant question was what the hell was he going to do with\nfour treasures?\nHe stood for a minute in the rain, probably wealthy beyond the dreams\nof satrapahs and queens, and he couldn’t afford a dry place to lay his head.\nIronfist. If Kip could get to him.\nHe walked across the bridge, tucking the dagger in his belt and covering\nit up, but making sure he could reach it quickly if he needed to.\nThere was no one outside except a pair of guards standing in their sentry\nboxes to avoid the rain, and they didn’t look interested, though Kip’s\nimagination made him paranoid. He made it to the lift without incident.\nKip had been a child for too long. He’d come to the Chromeria, and as\nsoon as Andross Guile had found out about him, an assassin had tried to\nthrow him off the tower. By playing the black cards, Kip must have\nrevealed that Janus Borig had helped him defeat Andross Guile in a game.\nAnd she’d been murdered almost immediately.\nWith the amount of time that Kip had spent with the old man, it was\ntempting to humanize him, to believe that Andross might feel something for\nKip. It wasn’t true. There were monsters in the world, and Andross Guile\nwas one of them.\nKip got off the elevator a few levels short of the top of the Prism’s\nTower. The Blackguards made their barracks here.\nThe first man he saw was a skinny Ilytian with a burn scar across one\ncheek, sitting on his bed, reading. A few other men were dicing a ways back\nin a common area, others were sharing rumors about assassinations in\nAbornea from comfortable chairs. “This area is for Blackguards only, boy,”\nthe man said.\n“I need to see Ironfist,” Kip said. “I’m Kip, Gavin’s bastard. It’s an\nemergency. I may be in danger. And it’s secret.”\nBlackguards didn’t get to be Blackguards by being indecisive. The man\nstood. “No one will harm you here. I’ll take you to the commander’s\nquarters. He’s out on rounds right now—he always works longer than any\nof us—but he’s usually back by an hour after midnight.”\nAn hour after midnight? Of course. Kip hadn’t realized that his own\nmidnight training sessions with Ironfist were actually part of the man’s\nnormal workday—he worked from dawn until an hour after midnight.\nEvery day.\nThe Blackguard walked Kip past the others, who looked askance but\ndidn’t object, and took Kip to a small room. He opened the door, which\nwasn’t locked.\n“No one except the commander will get in while any of us live.” He"

He opened the door, which\nwasn’t locked.\n“No one except the commander will get in while any of us live.” He\nhesitated, then said, “Do please note that if you steal anything from this\nroom, the consequences will be dire.”\n“Yes, yes, thank you. Of course,” Kip said.\nHe felt a huge wave of relief, quickly replaced by exhaustion and then\ndiscomfort as he looked around Ironfist’s room.\nFor some reason, it felt oddly intimate to be here. Kip had never really\nimagined the huge Blackguard commander as a person who had a room.\nRidiculous thought, of course. Where’d you figure he sleeps, Kip?\nThe room fit the man: tidy, not large despite his exalted position, finely\ncarved lean black oak chairs with no cushions, the narrow bed covered with\na green-and-black-checkered blanket, a rack of many fine weapons on one\nwall and one gorgeous painting opposite the bed. It was of a young woman,\nhair knotted and piled atop her head, dark eyes glimmering with orange\nhalos, beautiful, chin lifted, hint of a playful twist to her lips. Kip didn’t\nknow anything about painting, but it was clear even to his untrained eye\nthat this was exquisite.\nA knock on the door interrupted his reverie. He opened it. The solemn\nBlackguard handed him a towel. “He lets guests sit in that chair,” the man\nsaid, pointing. “You can pull it by the fire. Is it the kind of emergency where\nwe need to send runners for him, or can you wait?”\n“Wait. Waiting is fine,” Kip said. “Thank you.”\nThe door closed with a click, and Kip’s heart went out of him. He\nwanted to be a Blackguard so much he thought he’d die if he didn’t make it.\nQuiet and calm in the face of an emergency, decisive in the face of\nuncertainty, dangerous, masterful, confident.\nHe toweled off as well as he could, then stretched the two cloaks out to\ndry and sat in the chair by the fire.\nStanding there in the warmth of the fire, Kip was struck by a thought. He\ndrafted sub-red directly from the fire and pulled it through his skin. He was\nwarm instantly. He could, in fact, dry his clothes—though not too quickly\nor he’d burn himself. Hell, if he weren’t such a moron, he could have gone\nback into the building when it was on fire. He could have drafted the heat\naway from himself—and then what? Recovered a few treasures and still\nbeen inside the building when it exploded? Maybe he could have drafted\nshields around the kegs of black powder. If he’d been thinking.\nHe hadn’t even thought to draft himself an umbrella on his way back to\nthe Chromeria to stay dry. It simply hadn’t occurred to him. He just wasn’t\nmentally fast enough for this. A failure, stupid, his mother would say.\nBut then, he’d been not a drafter for his whole life, and only a drafter for\na couple months. Nothing was instinctive yet. He pushed the thought, the\nworries, his mother’s lies, away.\nThe card box smelled of cherry cavendish, tobacco like fruit leather."

        "text": "a couple months. Nothing was instinctive yet. He pushed the thought, the\nworries, his mother’s lies, away.\nThe card box smelled of cherry cavendish, tobacco like fruit leather.\nJanus Borig had hidden her most valuable cards in her tobacco. And it had\nworked. Funny old coot.\nKip had liked her.\nHis quick grin faded. Orholam. She was dead. Murdered.\nBy Andross Guile. A soul-deep loathing settled in him. He stood. Go\nright to the gut, Kip. See if the man only has the balls to hire murderers. Kip\nput the card box on the table. Don’t stop moving, Kip. Weakness and fear\nbeckoned. He tossed his knife on the bed. It was safer here than anywhere.\nHe went out the door. “I’ll be back in ten minutes,” he told the skinny\nIlytian standing guard by his door. He wanted to tell the man to guard that\nroom with his life, but anything Kip said like that would sound\nmelodramatic, hysterical. Besides, who was going to break into the\ncommander of the Blackguard’s room?\nKip hadn’t seen or heard any signal, but before he got to the lift, Samite\nfell in place beside him. She was still buckling her ataghan belt.\n“You’re not trying to stop me?” Kip asked as they got on the lift.\n“Not a Blackguard’s place to stop her charges from making mistakes.”\nThough her tone was light, Samite didn’t grin.\nKip set his jaw, hunkered into himself. He thought about Janus Borig. I\nam not going to be afraid. She deserves better. When they arrived, he\nknocked firmly on Andross Guile’s door. The door opened after a few\nmoments, and Grinwoody appeared. With the open door, Kip heard harp\nmusic float out.\n“I need to speak with him,” Kip said.\n“The High Luxlord is occupied.”\n“Now, Grinwoody.”\nThe Ilytian’s unpleasant expression turned angry at Kip using his real\nname.\n“Now, Wormwood!” Kip said.\nGrinwoody turned his back and closed the door. Kip stuck his foot in the\ncrack. The man looked at him, furious.\n“Try to throw me out, you simpering worm,” Kip said. “Try.”\nGrinwoody looked from Kip to Samite. “The young master will keep the\ndrapes closed,” he said. Then he disappeared into the darkness of the\nspider’s hole.\n“You see superviolet?” Kip asked Samite.\n“No.” Her tone carried a slight accusation: If you’d needed someone\nwho could see superviolet, you could have said so, knucklehead.\n“My fault. Wait out here. If they kill me, you’ll know who did it.”\nDrafting his own superviolet torch, Kip went inside, not waiting for\npermission.\nHe almost collided with Andross Guile.\n“You are not to come here without permission!” Andross shouted. He\nswung a slap at Kip. Kip dodged.\n“You fucking murderer!” Kip shouted back in his face.\nThe harpist, a young woman sitting in the chair Kip usually occupied,\nstopped playing, looking terrified in the darkness."

He hadn’t even noticed\nGrinwoody slipping around him, and in an instant both of Kip’s arms were\nknocked down, twisted, and put in elbow locks. Kip lost the superviolet and\nwas plunged into blindness. He was driven to his knees.\n“Janus Borig? How do you know her?” Andross demanded.\n“You killed her! I just came from her house!” Kip was suddenly jagged,\npowerless, a furious child. Damn me, a furious child.\n“Why would I kill Janus Borig?” Andross Guile asked.\n“She gave me the black cards I used to beat you!”\n“You think I’d kill a demiurge over a card game? Where was she? She\nwas here? On the Jaspers?”\n“Don’t lie to me! You knew she was here. You’ve had me followed\neverywhere I go.”\n“I have? And every bad thing that happens in the world is my doing?\nWhat a simple world you live in,” Andross Guile said. “She was killed?\nYou’re certain of this.”\nKip realized suddenly that he was on the verge of making a tremendous\nmistake. Anything he said could give Andross Guile information he hadn’t\nhad before. Even coming here did that. “Why should I believe you didn’t\nkill her?” he said.\n“Because she did me two great favors a long time ago,” Andross said.\n“We were friends, for a time. She had a history of that, you know.\nBefriending people, using them for her art, and then disappearing. She was\ndoubtless using you, too.”\nNo, she hadn’t been doing that. Not to Kip. Lies. “What favors?”\n“She was making new Nine Kings cards. Did she not—No, of course\nshe wouldn’t have told a child. She made my card first.”\n“So?”\n“You’ve never seen the true cards, have you? The cards let a drafter live\nthe memories of those they depict—but only up to the moment when the\ncards were drawn. Janus Borig enshrined me as important enough to\ndeserve a card, and did it without threatening me. At best, an enemy could\nlearn my thoughts and plans as of what, twenty-eight years ago? I am the\nonly important person alive to whom those new cards are not a threat.”\nWhich meant he would want Janus Borig to finish as many of her other\ncards as possible. Of course he would do anything to get his hands on the\nfinal product, but he wouldn’t kill her before she finished.\n“And the second favor she did you?” Kip asked. He was deflating,\nthough, defeated already.\n“You tell me what happened, and I’ll tell you.”\nKip slumped, and Grinwoody released him. “I went to her home tonight\n—”\n“Where?”\n“On Big Jasper.”\n“Where?”\nKip told him. “When I got there, the house was on fire.

They thought it was a\nlightning strike, but they found her a couple streets over, with no cloak, and\nstab wounds all over her. I could barely even recognize her.” If Kip had\ngotten there late, even if Janus Borig had taken something out of the house,\nthere was no way to tell who might have found her first, who might have\nstolen what she had.\n“Did you see anyone suspicious?” Andross asked.\n“You know what?” Kip said. “Forget it. I’m not trading with you. You’re\nbetter at this game. I don’t need to play.”\nKip drafted a superviolet torch and saw that Samite was standing behind\nGrinwoody, the point of a knife a finger’s breadth from the back of his neck.\nIn the utter darkness. She was that good.\n“She gave me my card, Kip,” Andross Guile said. “So I could see\nexactly what was in it. She could make copies, of course, but they’re always\nweaker. She feared me. I know that. But I had no reason to hurt her.”\nAnd Andross Guile never did anything without a reason.\nChapter 65\n~Skirting the Issue~\nTap. Superviolet-blue. Tap. Green. Tap. Yellow. Tap. Red, sub-red.\nThe young Blackguard steps back from the precipice. The smell of\nburning homes, burning livestock, and burning human flesh wafts up from\nthe valley floor.\n“I can make the jump, Commander,” he says. Skinny, long-legged, hair\nperpetually askew, Finer is the young man I hope will succeed me as\ncommander one day. If this kind of mission doesn’t kill him. The boy says,\n“It’ll take us twenty minutes if we go down the trail.”\nNormally so decisive, I hesitate.\n“It’s not incarnitive, sir.”\n“It’s real damn close.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nWhat Finer has discovered is that if he stabs points of green luxin from\nthe braces into his knees, it allows him to keep the luxin open, fluid. This\nitself is no great discovery, of course. As long as luxin is touching blood, it\ncan be held open. But external, attached luxin with direct control? That’s\nperilously close to what wights do.\nWith the seals held directly at his knees, Finer can run with the braces\non and have them not encumber his motion, but when he falls, he can close\nthe weave. The stiff springiness of the green luxin will keep him from\ndestroying his knees. It also seems that with the luxin inserted at his knees it\nreacts faster, instinctively opening or closing for what the body knows it\nneeds.\nThis is exactly what leads otherwise good men and women to become\nwights: the realization that luxin is better than flesh. At certain things. But\nthe more you experiment with it, the greater a hold it gets on you. There’s\nalways a good reason to use more.\nAnd yet.\nOrholam hates war, and yet he allows war in certain exigencies. So.\n“Do it,” I breathe."

The box, the only thing\nthat was left of Janus Borig’s life’s work, was made of olivewood and\nlacquered ivory inlaid with electrum. Kip rubbed his hands on his shirt to\nget as much of the oils off them as possible, then cracked open the box.\nThe cards slid into his hand. Originals. He could see the tiny\nbrushstrokes on them; the paint had a thickness to it, rising from the surface\nof the cards where details had been meticulously applied. But they weren’t\njust originals. The names on the cards were names—both people and game\nmechanic cards—that Kip knew had never been in the game before: Talon\nGim, Deedee Falling Leaf, Izem Red, Orea Pullawr, The Prisoner, New\nGreen Wight, Polychrome Wight, Orlov Kunar, Jing, Black Powder Charge,\nLuxin Grenadoes, Sea Demon Slayer, Flintlock, Shimmercloak, Heresy,\nThree-Eyed Ben, Usem the Wild, Ganesh the Bear—Kip stopped.\nShimmercloak? Orholam’s balls. The painting depicted a sneering man\nwith heavy brows: it was Vox. His gray cloak was visible at the neck where\nthe chains bit into his throat, and then his body disappeared below that. The\ntext read, “If Lightsplitter, grants invisibility except against sub-red and\nsuperviolet.”\nIf Lightsplitter?\nKip stared at the two cloaks drying by the fire. The cards were real. They\nwere of real things, and they told the truth. They were new cards—and they\nwere of people who had been alive recently. Kip knew some of those names\nhad been drafters whom he’d seen at Garriston.\nAnd if the cards were of those who had recently been alive, it was\npossible that there were cards of those who were still alive.\nKip began flipping through the cards faster, not trying to grab all the\ndetails, not trying to savor the art—he was hunting.\nThe Fixer. The Shadow. Tala. Flamehands. Aheyyad Brightwater. Samila\nSayeh. Halo Breaker. The Fallen Prophet. The Black Seer. Mirrorman.\nMirror Armor. The Technologist. The Novist. The Color Prince."

The Angari Serpent. Andross\nthe Red.\nKip felt ice in his veins.

The Color Prince’s Rifle. Rifle?\nKip didn’t even know what the word meant. Not that that was terribly\nuncommon. Incarnidine? If he had time, he could probably figure some of\nthem out from the pictures, but time felt compressed. Like someone was\ngoing to come along any moment and take the cards from him, and they’d\nbe lost forever.\nSkimmer. Condor. Incendiary Musket. Gan Guvair. Helane Troas. Viv\nGrayskin. Yras the Caster. Iron Elm. Pleiad Poros. The Butcher of Aghbalu.\nFlashbomb.\nAgain Kip stopped, went back. The Butcher of Aghbalu. The man was\nsplattered with gore, a fiery scimitar in one hand, stylized blue fire around\nthe other, no armor, just a torn, bloodied tunic, revealing massive ebony\narms and shoulders. The bodies of the dead lay all around him, in a palace.\nThe man was young, wearing no ghotra, his kinky hair worn in a braided\nstyle Kip had never seen before, but it was undeniably Commander Ironfist.\nKip had thought Janus Borig was working on his card, a one-eyed man—\nand it hadn’t looked like this, but this was Commander Ironfist. Younger,\nbut definitely him. Kip’s heart seized.\nThe Butcher?\nKip looked at the weapons rack on the wall. The scimitar from the card\nwas there, at the top. Spine blackened, blade shining. Garnets and\nscrimshaw, turquoise and abalone.\nPart of him wanted to draft and jump into that memory instantly, but he\ndidn’t. He needed to go through all the cards before someone interrupted\nhim. Surely someone was looking for him, surely he couldn’t be allowed to\nknow everything; it was somehow too easy.\nHe tucked that card away with the others he wanted to examine later and\nshuffled through the rest quickly. The Butcher of Ru was the next card, the\nart paired with Ironfist’s card. Kip’s stomach turned. He knew about\nGeneral Gad Delmarta’s massacre.

What if getting into that mind\nwasn’t terribly difficult?\nThis was living history. He could learn things from these cards that no\none else knew, that no one else had any way of knowing.

This wasn’t just a treasure\nwith a titanic monetary value, it was insight; it was a stripping bare of lies.\nAnyone in power would want it for what it could tell them about their\nenemies. Anyone with a secret would want to destroy it lest their enemies\nfind it.\nAnyone with a secret.

Didn’t want to wake you.” He knelt to help Kip pick up the\nscattered cards.\nHe scowled at the very first one he picked up. Looked over at Kip.\n“These are… real?”\n“Yes, sir.” Kip finally got up and started helping the commander gather\nup the cards.\nThey stood, and Commander Ironfist handed Kip a stack of the cards.\nHe kept one in his hand. “I’ve never seen originals before. Does it work?\nLike they say?”\n“Yes, sir.

Our advisers told us as much. But we were\nyoung men, and though the Tiru’s candidate was not ugly, she was not a\nbeauty to make the heart race either. We were young fools, and I cared what\nmy brother thought. We chose the Tlaglanu princess Tazerwalt because she\nwas prettier than any of the other candidates by far. Her tribe was hated, and\nthough she fell madly in love with Hanishu—pardon, that was my brother’s\nname, before—even though she loved him and respected him, she was\nhaughty before everyone else. Despised them. It made them hate her more,\nand made them hate him, too. The competing Tiru had crippled her father\nduring a raid when he was still young, and she was no peacemaker. She\ntook every opportunity to snub and shame them.”\nHe sighed, but continued, “I had just finished my training when the\nFalse Prism’s War began. There was no question that we would support\nGavin. Dazen made some abortive overtures to Paria, but we were too\ndeeply indebted to Andross Guile and his father Draccos Guile to take those\novertures seriously. You wouldn’t know it from Gavin’s coloring, but no\nsmall amount of Parian blood flows in the Guile veins. Anyway, we sent our\nentire army, and still Andross demanded more. Most of the palace guards\nwent. They ended up barely making it in time, but that’s another story.\n“Seeing this weakness, the Tiru tribesmen came from the mountains and\ninfiltrated the capital city of our dey, Aghbalu, as civilians, and then one day\nwhen my brother went out hunting with fifty of the few remaining soldiers\nwith him, the Tiru attacked.\n“Hanishu and his fifty were alerted by some refugees, and they came\nback to the city as fast as they could. The Tiru had already set up camp in\nthe palace, feasting around the still-unburied bodies of those they’d\nmassacred. My brother and his soldiers arrived in the middle of the night.\nThe Tiru were scattered, sleeping, or drunk, and my brother fell on them\nlike a lion. He was eighteen years old, and he already had two daughters\nand a son. He found his wife’s and children’s bodies. The Tiru had done…\nunspeakable things to them. My brother went mad. A warrior in his prime\nand a wild drafter.\n“The Tiru panicked, attacked each other, and my brother slaughtered all\nthose he found. They said that he fought like a god, like Anat had possessed\nhim. He killed through the dawn. The people of Aghbalu rallied around him\nthen, and they rounded up the Tiru tribesmen, the old men and the young,\nthe traders and camp followers and the wives and the shepherds… and…”\nHe swallowed. “And Hanishu slaughtered them all.

You may\ncarry what you find forever.”\nKip knew he should keep his mouth shut, but he couldn’t help it. “What\nif the truth in that card is different than what you were told?”\nThe big commander turned mournful eyes on Kip. “I don’t think it\nwould matter. I lost most of the people I cared about, and I lost my brother.\nHanishu is no more. He was broken by what he did. Still a peerless warrior,\nbut he doesn’t trust himself anymore. He can’t lead. He’s not even a watch\ncaptain. Can’t bear the weight of responsibility. Every time I go back into a\nfight with him, I lose him for weeks afterward.” He ran a hand over his\nshaven, bare head. “I’m afraid I’ve eaten too much truth recently. So this is\nwhat you came to speak to me about?”\n“Will you swear not to tell anyone else?” Kip asked.\n“You can’t ask me that, Kip. I need to do what I think is right.”\n“I’m asking,” Kip said. “If you won’t promise, I can’t tell you\neverything.”\nCommander Ironfist heaved a deep breath. “You’re as bad as any Guile,\nyou know that?”\n“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.”\nCommander Ironfist stared at the floor for a while. “I don’t know why\nyou drag us in your wake. Even a child of the Guiles is pulling me along\nlike a leaf in a gale.” He shook his head, and there was bitterness in his sad\neyes. “Very well, you have my word.”\n“Janus Borig made the cards. I was down at her house—”\n“Janus Borig? She’s a myth, Kip. The old Witch of Wind Palace?”\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Kip said. “She’s just an old\nlady with a little shop.”\n“A shop?”\n“On Big Jasper.” Kip looked at him, confused.\n“You found a True Mirror, hiding in plain sight. You’ve been in this city\ntwo months? How’d you find her?”\n“The librarian told me—”\n“Which librarian?”\n“Rea. Rea Siluz.”\n“Hmm. I’ll check into that. But never mind that for now. Tell me.”\n“I went to Janus Borig’s house tonight. She was murdered. By a man\nand a woman wearing those cloaks. Shimmercloaks. Made them mostly\ninvisible, except in the sub-red and superviolet.”\nFor a moment, Ironfist’s face twisted like Kip was a little boy telling the\nmost outlandish lies. Then he looked at the cloaks.\n“Show me one of those cards.”\n“Which one do you—”\n“Doesn’t matter.”\nKip pulled out a card at random and Ironfist drafted a sliver of blue and\ntouched the card for an instant, then snatched back his finger.\n“Another,” he said.\nKip extended one, fanning out the cards, but Ironfist chose another. He\ndrafted, touched it, and pulled his finger back as if burned."

He\ndrafted, touched it, and pulled his finger back as if burned.\n“My apologies, I had to know for myself. They’re real. They’re all real.\nTell me everything, Kip.”\nSo Kip did. It was like an enormous burden being lifted from his\nshoulders. Abruptly, he felt like he was a child again—except it felt good.\nThere were things in the world too big for him to deal with by himself, and\ntrusting Ironfist felt really good. “So what’s it all mean?” he asked.\n“I thought war was coming, but I was wrong,” Commander Ironfist said.\n“War is already here. And you’re in tremendous danger, and so am I.”\nIt seemed like as much of a global summary statement as Kip had ever\nheard, and he felt totally inappropriate when he said, “Oh, um. There’s one\nmore thing.”\n“Found some other artifact of world-altering power to go with two\nshimmercloaks and an entire set of original, new Nine Kings cards?”\nCommander Ironfist asked archly.\nKip’s mouth worked.\n“It was a joke, Kip.”\nKip pulled out the dagger slowly and laid it across his palms. It was\nlonger. He was sure of it now. The white seemed whiter, the black whorls\nseemed blacker. There was also another difference: of the seven diamonds\nembedded in the blade, one burned bright blue as it had since Kip had\nrecovered it from Zymun, but now a second was lit from within, too. It was\na dull green.\nSwallowing, Kip looked up at Commander Ironfist.\nChapter 67\nDazen Guile was trembling, shivering. His eyes were dry, scratchy from not\nblinking enough.\nHe was in a race against his own mortality and a timer with some\nuncertain amount of sand in it. He’d recovered from his fever, but was still\ndeathly weakened from it. His body, struggling to heal itself from the fever\nand from the dozens of cuts he’d sustained in crawling through the\nhellstone tunnel, was desperate and weak. Gavin’s fool lackey kept\ndropping the blue bread down the tube. The more of it Dazen didn’t eat, the\nbetter his source of blue and the faster he could draft. But the more he\nstarved himself, the weaker he became.\nAnd the bread only lasted so long. Once a week—assuming, always\nassuming that Gavin had arranged for him to be fed once per day, rather\nthan some odd fraction thereof—once a week, the cell was flooded with\nwater.\nAt first, so many years ago, Dazen had thought this was a mercy. The\nwater was soapy, warm. He could regain a modicum of cleanliness once a\nweek. If he tried, he could comb the tangles out of his hair and beard. And\nthen he’d tried saving his bread once—and saw the water bleached it, or\nstained it a dull gray. A blue-gray, it had been in the blue cell, of course,\nreflecting the blue light of the walls.\nIt had been a mercy. It had been Gavin’s way of keeping his brother\nfrom getting some disease that fed on the muck and filth his own body"

It had been Gavin’s way of keeping his brother\nfrom getting some disease that fed on the muck and filth his own body\nproduced. It had also been Gavin’s way of making sure that whatever Dazen\nmight have hidden away in a week, from his own body’s effluents or from\nhis food, would be washed away, leached of power.\nDazen had needed to swim before he’d broken out of the blue cell,\nholding the oily cloth he’d woven from his own hair out of the water\nseveral times when the torrent had come, and now, in this cell, the\nbleaching water threatened again. He was too weak to do more than float\nand save perhaps one blue loaf, so every week he would starve himself for\nthe first couple of days and start drafting again, and his drafting would\nspeed up as the week progressed. Then he would devour all the stale bread\nhis belly could hold before the flood came to wash all away again.\nMy will is indomitable. Unshakable. Titanic. I cannot be opposed. I\ncannot be stopped. I will win. There is only winning. And I will crush my\nbrother. This is the fire, this is the fuel, this is the hope that sustains my\nbroken body.\nBlue was harder than green. Blue was all Dazen needed to break out of\nthis level of hell.\nIn another hour, Dazen’s right arm was full. He scooted over to his seat\nagainst one wall. He nestled his back firmly against the green luxin and\nbraced himself. For weeks now—months?—he had been shooting out blue\nprojectiles at the highest speed his body could handle, and bracing himself\nagainst the wall kept him from being flung about and destroyed.\nThe green luxin wall opposite him was pitted and chipped to a depth of a\nhand. It had infuriated him at first. His brother had made the blue chamber\nthinner, and the blue drafter in Dazen had expected every chamber to have\nexactly the same dimensions. But his brother knew that green was weaker\nthan blue, so of course he’d made the green walls thicker. It was logical.\nThe blue in him had calmed.\nHe picked his targets with arithmetic precision to exploit the structural\nproperties of green luxin. He didn’t know, of course, if he’d picked the\ncorrect wall. The ball shape of his chamber prohibited that. If his brother\nhad irrationally made one wall thicker than the others, Dazen might simply\nget unlucky and pick the thickest wall.\nThat infuriated him. The uncertainty of it. The imprecision. It was\nwrong. He’d wasted at least a day in a weak stupor trying to figure out if\nthere was some way to tell which wall was the right one. Hours wasted in\ncalculation when action was required.\nIt was a warning sign of how deep the blue had sunk into him.\nBut he’d overcome that, as he’d overcome every struggle. As he would\novercome even his brother.\nHe breathed deeply, ten breaths, gathering his will. Every projectile he\nfired hurt him, crushed his weakened body against the wall. But Dazen\ncouldn’t yield, couldn’t shoot weakly. Shooting weakly meant that he’d\nwasted the days it took to draft the blue he needed. The wall could give"

It could give to this very shot.\nOr, of course, it could take another twenty, and at any time, Gavin could\ncome back and—\nNo! Don’t think it. Do this. Pain is nothing. Pain is an obstacle on the\nroad to freedom. I cannot be stopped. I will not be stopped. I will have my\nvengeance and my freedom, and those who have done this will tremble.\nHe took the tenth breath, braced his right arm with his left, and gathered\nhis power. Old scars ripped open on his palm as the blue luxin tore through\nhis skin.\nDazen screamed rage and despair and hatred and pure, glorious will. A\nmissile burst from him with incredible power.\nDuring the False Prism’s War, he’d been hit in the chest with a war\nhammer once. It had cracked his shield and a rib. With his weakened body,\nthis was worse. He passed out.\nBut when he opened his eyes, he saw his victory. The green luxin was\nbroken. A few fibrous tendrils held on, but it was broken. He could see\ndarkness beyond. His prison was broken.\nWith a calm willpower that would have stunned a younger version of\nhimself, he drank some water, ate a little of the bread. Not so much that his\nlong-empty stomach would revolt.\nThen, only then, did he draft a tiny thread of green. It was light, it was\nlife, it was power and connectedness and well-being and strength.\nOnly then did he allow himself a moment of triumph. He had done it. He\nhad done it. He really was unstoppable. He was a god.\nHe stood, grinning, legs trembling, but strong enough to allow him to\nstand, and tottered over to the hole. He tore away the green luxin with his\nbare hands, opened the hole enough to peer through. To crawl through, once\nhe gained a little more strength.\nPoking his head through the hole, he drafted some green imperfectly\ninto his hand, bathing the darkness in weak green light. The green egg in\nwhich he’d been imprisoned was, it appeared, contained within a greater\nchamber, only a little larger than the egg itself. It wouldn’t have mattered\nwhich wall Dazen broke through. All of them were equal.\nFor one stupid moment, he was furious at the time he’d wasted,\nwondering which side to attack. But then that passed. That day of\nvacillation was gone, it couldn’t be called back, and it was illogical to fret\nover it, to waste more of the present on the past. He pushed it away, and his\nsmile came back.\nTo one side of the chamber, he saw a tunnel, floor glittering with sharp\nshards of hellstone.\nDazen laughed, low, quiet. It was a laugh at finally, finally being\nunderestimated.\nNo, brother, that won’t work. Not this time.\nChapter 68\n“Corvan, am I a good man?” Gavin asked.\n“You’re a great man, my friend.”\n“Not the same, are they?” Gavin asked.

There had been blood in his\ndreams, blood staining the water from the blue he couldn’t see to the red he\nmost certainly could. Red on gray. In his incipient blindness, he’d traded\nblue beauty for blood, all unwillingly.\nCorvan said, “When you move the world, some will be crushed. How\ncould it be else? When you sank the pirates at Tranquil Point, the slaves\nchained to the oars died first. What else were you to do? Leave the pirates to\ncapture and make slaves of thousands more? But that’s not what I meant,\nmy lord. You are a great man.”\nGavin chewed on that, put it in the hold of his memory. “And you,\nCorvan? What kind of man are you?”\n“I am simply competent. A red by training but not by nature. Not a\nleader except when leadership is lacking. But you know these things better\nthan anyone.” A quizzical, amused expression.\nNot a leader except when leadership is lacking? It was true: Corvan had\nproven himself to be perfectly content to take orders—even orders he didn’t\nunderstand—from those who had won his trust. Then, without changing his\nnature, he’d assumed command of entire armies. He knew what needed to\nbe done, and did it, somehow without it changing his appraisal of himself.\nHe probably really had been content as a small-town dyer.\nGavin wondered how Corvan did it. He himself had never been content\nin any place but the first. Even under those wilier than he, like his father, or\nthose wiser than he, like the White, he’d chafed. Burned.\nIt was, no doubt, a flaw in his character.\n“I’m making you a satrap,” Gavin said. And let be crushed by that\nwhoever may be.\nCorvan coughed up tea. Most satisfying.\n“Are you insane?” Corvan asked. “My lord.”\n“It’s pretty much what you already are, and I am still the Prism. It is my\nprerogative. They’ll try to stop me, but so long as you don’t massacre the\nSeers, no one of the other satraps or members of the Spectrum are losing\nanything. I will propose that you get to name a Color on the Spectrum, but\nallow myself to lose on that point so they have some victory for their egos.\nYour new satrapy will be a second-rate satrapy for a few generations. Those\nwill be political battles those who follow us will have to fight. Survival\nfirst.”\n“But why?” Corvan asked. “What do you get?”\n“We’ve already discussed this. Food. Seeds. We already know things are\ngoing to be tight, but the island is big enough to keep us from starvation\nuntil spring. But if we don’t get seeds for next year—”\n“That’s not what I meant.”\n“I give our people a sense of purpose, and I give them another reason to\nobey you, to make a new life here and stay, even once things start to go well\nenough that they could leave.”\nCorvan set his teacup down. “Your pardon, Gavin, but you forget how\nwell I know you. There’s more to it than that.”"

There’s more to it than that.”\nGavin smirked. “I need you to believe in me, Corvan. When the time\ncomes. There are crises coming, and I will need to move quickly. I need to\nknow you have my back, instantly.”\nCorvan’s back stiffened, brow darkened. Gavin hadn’t seen the man\nangry in many years. “My lord, some men believe in Orholam, some\nbelieve in gold, but I believe in you, and to this I will hold. Fealty to One,\nas you should know.”\n“You think it unworthy of me to question you?” Gavin asked.\nCorvan’s lips were tight, eyes lidded.\n“It is,” Gavin said. “You’ve more than proved yourself. But your faith\nwill be tested.”\n“And will come through the fire purer than before, doubtless.”\n“Thank you, Corvan. Your pardon. Satrap Danavis.”\n“My lord,” Corvan said quietly. “Thank you for what you did. With the\nblue bane. I know… I know it must have been awful, but thank you for\ndoing it.”\nGavin stood, said nothing. Popped his neck right and left. He’d\nsummoned the people to the great square. There were plans to build a\nstadium, but they hadn’t progressed far on it yet. Regardless, he was going\nto have to give a talk. Bolster support for Corvan.\n“Lord Prism,” Corvan said quietly. “I don’t know if I can be a satrap.\nNot even of a second-rate satrapy.” It was a mercy, switching the subject,\nsaying his piece about Gavin’s slaughter and then letting it go.\n“Nonsense. It’s just like being a general, except that if you’re any good\nat it, you’ll rarely have to watch your people die.”\nThe general snorted. It would be harder than that, in the environment he\nwas leading his people into, and they both knew it. Then Gavin’s friend\nsquinted. “My lord,” Corvan said. “The rebels have my daughter. You\nmaking me a satrap will make Liv a thousand times more valuable to\nthem.”\nCorvan always was quick.\nGavin stood, and looked to the people crowding the stadium, gathering\nto listen to him, hoping he’d speak, but willing to just get a glimpse of him.\nHe said, “You know what you can’t do with a satrap’s daughter when you’re\nlooking for support among neutral parties?”\nFor once, Corvan didn’t have a ready answer.\n“Kill her,” Gavin said. “I hold you in my eyes, Corvan. I won’t forget.”\nThe man’s face contorted for an instant with sudden grief, sudden hope,\nand his shoulders heaved. He looked away from Gavin, trying to control\nhimself. Then he dropped to his knees, and farther, lying prostrate at\nGavin’s feet. More than respect and thankfulness, it was veneration.\nWorship.\n“You would do this, for me?” Corvan said.\n“I do it for many reasons, my friend. There is no unadulterated\naltruism.”"

They’d lost everything because he’d failed.\nNot one had eaten his fill for the last months, because they didn’t know how\nlong their food would last. Everyone had worked from dawn to dusk and\nbeyond, every day. They lived in great longhouses, not homes, stuffed with\nstrangers. They had no wealth, little hope, and lots of pain, and yet what\nlittle they had, they offered him freely.\n“My people!” Gavin shouted, pitching his voice to his orator’s tone, his\ngeneral’s tone. “Downtrodden, destitute, devastated but not dismayed. My\npeople, dearest to my heart…” And so he spoke. He bade them rise, and\nthey rose. He could bid them into the teeth of hell, and they would descend,\nsinging praises all the way. He was good at this. Not born to it, but he’d\nstolen this crown and worked it so long in his hands that now it fit him.\nHe addressed their fears, and fired their desires, and acknowledged their\nsorrows and their sacrifices, and braced them for coming hardship and made\nthem feel noble about it all.\nBy what right do I bend men to my will? Or is there no right, only\nability? Are these women here mere slaves on my pirate ship? Are these\nchildren mere victims in the path of my plague?\nBut on he spoke, urging peace and honest dealing with the people of\nSeers Island, laying foundations, frankly assessing the difficulties coming\ntheir way, and throwing the full weight of his support behind Corvan.\nHe swore he would be with them when he could, and that when he left\nhe would go to better protect them, and that he would always come back.\nHe would work beside them, and prevent the suffering that he could, and\nmourn the dead beside them when death couldn’t be avoided.\nGavin saw that there were at least two scribes copying his every word in\nshorthand. He was surprised that there were scribes here among the poor,\nbut he shouldn’t have been. Corvan would have, of course, scoured the\nrefugees for scribes so they could distribute copies of his decrees to those\ncamped far out in the woods and send messages to the Seers.\nIt made him temper what he would say. He hoped it would take months,\nbut eventually, his father would end up with a copy of every word. Still, the\ngood it would do in spreading support through the refugees was worth the\ndamage it would do him later.\nNot even you will be able to stop this, father.\nAnd last, bracing them that the Spectrum and the other satrapies would\nlook down on them—as if they should care about such things when their\nbellies were gnawing on their navels—he built up the audience and himself"

He\nwondered that he was the only one who knew it.\nHalf an hour later, he and Karris skimmed away with little more than\nthey’d brought with them three months ago. He didn’t explain himself.\nShe’d seen the blood on him when he got back last night. She’d seen the\nlook on his face. She didn’t berate him for leaving without her. She knew\nhim. And without asking whether they were leaving, she’d said her\ngoodbyes. She knew.\nThe crowds gathered once more as they walked to the beach, and they\nroared as he waved to them. Men and women wept for him. It was an\ninsanity of kindness that Gavin couldn’t understand, but he treasured it\nnonetheless. And then they left.\nAs Seers Island slowly disappeared into the distance behind them, Gavin\nexamined it over his shoulder, discomfited. He and Karris talked little that\nday, each introspective, and camped on a beach near Ruic Head in Atash.\nThe next day, as Gavin switched the skimmer for the manual labor of the\nscull to close the final leagues to Little Jasper, he spied the towers, rising\nmajestic against the noon sun. Against the stark colors of the other towers,\nthe blue sat mute, gray. Its sister tower and neighbor, the green tower, was\nadorned with illusions beneath the luxin to make it look like a towering tree\n—this year they honored Atash by depicting the extinct atasifusta. But the\ncolor wasn’t right. Before the war, Gavin had seen the last grove of\natasifusta.\nThere were storm clouds gathering over the Chromeria, and at first\nGavin thought perhaps it was simply a trick of the light, but as they got\ncloser, he became certain that wasn’t it.\nWhy would they make such a mistake? Surely some Atashian who\nremembered the trees would complain. The leaves of the giants were\nvibrant, radiant, a perfect complement to the green tower, not this sickly,\ngray-green mishmash.\nOh hells. Gavin drafted the green he needed for the scull’s flexibility. He\ncould still do it, but it was like he was building the whole damn Brightwater\nWall all over again, just to give a few corners of his boat some flexibility.\nIn that moment, he knew: after all he’d just done to save the world from\na blue calamity, now he was losing green.\nChapter 69\nCommander Ironfist breathed. “Kip, do you have any idea…”\n“No! I don’t.”\nCommander Ironfist was already looking at the blade intently. “Strange.\nWhy are two of the jewels colored and the others clear?”\n“I was sort of hoping you’d tell me. Sir.”"

I\ndon’t know what it does besides look pretty, but people have killed for this\nknife. Literally. More than once. These materials—white metal, and\nblack…” He reached a finger to touch them, but then stopped.\n“Luxin?” Kip asked. “White and black luxin?”\nIronfist looked troubled. “I’d always thought black luxin was simply\nobsidian. Hellstone. This…”\nKip hadn’t noticed, maybe hadn’t really looked since he’d first\nexamined the blade in the dim light of the barge, but the black metal\nthreaded down the middle of the white blade looked different than he\nremembered. It looked like it shimmered dully, a tiny thready pulse.\nOther discipulae had asked about white luxin and black luxin in Kip’s\nclasses. The response had been tart—you’re not ready for those talks. All\nKip knew was that no one had ever seen either, so he’d concentrated on\nmore direct worries—like trying not to get his ass kicked and figuring out\nhow to use a stupid abacus and memorizing seven hundred and thirty-six\nidiot cards that didn’t even include all the forbidden cards that were,\napparently, all the most interesting ones. Kip reached out.\n“Don’t touch the blade!” Ironfist said. “They call it the Marrow Sucker\n—and I don’t want to find out why the hard way.” Then his visage\ndarkened. “This looks familiar. Where have I seen this?”\n“Zymun, sir. This is the knife he tried to kill the Lord Prism with.”\n“The assassin boy? From the barge?”\nKip nodded.\n“How do you know his name?”\n“He tried to kill me back in Rekton.”\n“And how—never mind. You need to hide this, Kip.

Kip did, and Ironfist cracked the door.\n“Jade, I’m occupied. Don’t let in any messengers.

Who used those secrets.\nTwenty years ago, and still we remember. It’s not terribly uncommon that\nsomeone leaves right before they sign, but it wastes a huge amount of our\ntime and effort. We go to all the work of training someone, and they leave\nus high and dry.”\n“Grinwoody?” Kip asked. He couldn’t get over it. “That old stump was\nalmost a Blackguard?”\n“He’d be dead by now if he had been a Blackguard, of course. The\nconstant drafting. So maybe he’s the smart one.”\n“Doesn’t make it any less a betrayal,” Kip said.\nAfter Kip pulled down his trouser leg to conceal the sheath now\nstrapped to the outside of his calf, he extended a hand toward the\ncommander for the knife. Ironfist looked at him, eyes hard. “Kip, thank you.\nThank you for trusting me. And now, don’t ever do that again.”\n“Sir?”\n“Kip I know you’re lonely, and I know you want to trust someone. I\nunderstand. But you’re not in that place anymore. You don’t know what\nkind of pressure Andross Guile can bring to bear against me. You haven’t\nknown me for three months, and you’ve just handed four great treasures\ninto my hands. I could take them from you now and have you thrown out. I\ncould buy myself a satrap’s seat with what you’ve got. You think I’m\nimmune? You think I’m too good a man to do that?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kip said.\n“But you don’t know.”\n“A man’s got to act without knowing everything, or he’ll never do\nanything.”\nCommander Ironfist’s lip twitched. “So you’re a man now?”\n“I’ve taken lives, and I’ve taken my own life in my hands and trusted a\nfriend with it. Yes, sir, I’d say that makes me a man.”\n“Neither makes you a man. The first makes you a killer. The second\nmakes you a fool. Either may get you killed.”\n“But not today?” Kip asked. For all his bravado, he couldn’t help but\nswallow, looking at the bare knife in Ironfist’s hand.\n“Not today,” Commander Ironfist averred. He offered the blade to Kip.\nKip took it with a weak smile and sheathed it, then bloused his trouser\nleg over it.\n“Now, let’s talk about the other things that can get you killed here,” the\ncommander said. He picked up one of the cloaks. “One, shimmercloaks.\nFantastic.” Commander Ironfist sighed, as if he’d blown through his entire\nallowance of incredulity in one orgy of wild spending. “In legend, there are\ntwelve shimmercloaks. Supposedly, they always worked in pairs.\nAssassins.”\n“Like the Order of the Broken Eye?” Kip asked."

Supposed? You hold the fabric of legends in your hand.\nLiterally.”\n“So it seems.”\nKip showed Commander Ironfist the Shimmercloak card. “This man was\none of them. His name was Vox, and his partner a woman named Niah.”\n“And how did you kill two professional assassins, Kip?”\n“He killed her. On accident. And I got lucky. They didn’t expect me to\nsee them, and I did. They kept their weapons down until the last second so\nthey wouldn’t displace their cloaks and then—”\n“Rhetorical question, Kip.”\n“Oh.”\nCommander Ironfist sat on the edge of his bed. “Just when a man makes\na decision that everything he’s believed his whole life is a lie, something\ncomes along tempting him to believe again. Vanity. Quicksand.”\n“Sir?”\nCommander Ironfist rubbed his stubble-fuzzy scalp. “The pagans\nbelieved in separate gods, as you know. Either real, living entities that\nrequired their sacrifices and could be wooed by human gifts or, as other\npagans believed, simply as facets of humanity itself—as greed is part of\neach of us, or ambition, or passion—they believed the gods should be\nacknowledged only for how they revealed truths about our own souls. But\ntalking about pagans as if they were one camp is an oversimplification.\nEven if you talked about the worshippers of Atirat—as apparently Vox was\n—you’d be speaking too broadly. They all agreed on the existence of\nmultiple gods, but the agreement didn’t extend much beyond that.\n“They were men like us: some were good, some evil, some believed\nnonsense. There were religious proscriptions that made no sense—like a\ndeep suspicion that the use of spectacles was sinful, unnatural. But then\nsome sects were happy to sacrifice their firstborn to bribe the gods to give\nthem a fruitful harvest. Some venerated their color wights. Others drove\nthem out. Others stoned them. The successful wights—for they claimed that\nsuch existed—would reign as demigods.”\n“I don’t understand how this connects,” Kip said.\n“Just because a man bases his entire life on nonsense doesn’t mean\neverything he believes is wrong.”\nKip raised his eyebrows. So…“The suspense is torture, sir.”\n“Some pagans believed light splitting was a separate gift. Our teaching\nhas been that light splitting is the sole gift of the Prism. It’s not holy writ,\nbut it has been the teaching for hundreds of years.” Commander Ironfist\nwaved the Shimmercloak card. “This is one card. It says, ‘If\nLightsplitter…’ Which means light splitting is possible. Even if people\ndenied what happened to you, these cards are true. They can’t be denied.\nThis one card wouldn’t destroy the faith, but it would make every luxiat\nwho’s ever spoken about light splitting look like a fool.

A few scholars had been whispering the same things for five hundred\nyears before him, but no one thanked him for making fools of the luxiats.\nThe navigational corrections that his better calculations allowed all came\nabout years after he was lynched.”\n“Lynched?” Kip asked, eyebrows climbing.\n“For something else altogether—he proposed that light was an absence\nof darkness, rather than the inverse.” Seeing the befuddled look on Kip’s\nface, he said, “Don’t worry about that. Point is, light splitting is real. Some\nof us had always suspected as much, which is why the Blackguard has\nalways recruited drafters like Adrasteia. Not just because she can see\nconcealed weapons, but because she could see an assassin who is invisible.”\n“But how does it work?” Kip asked. “I didn’t think such things were\npossible.”\n“You’re a dim, Kip. You don’t have the background to understand—”\n“And if I did, I’d only know wrong things. So you don’t have to unteach\nme all the things I think I know.”\nA dip of the head and a momentary grin conceded the point. Ironfist took\na breath. “Light is power. The power always goes somewhere. Sunlight hits\na cherrywood floor. We know that the sunlight is full-spectrum, from sub-\nred through superviolet, but the floor reflects only reddish brown. Where\ndoes the rest of the light go? It’s absorbed. And years later, compare that\nwood floor with a section of the same floor that was covered with a rug, or a\nshadow. The sun-exposed part is bleached. The light very slowly changed\nthe nature of the wood itself—broke it down. Just like light darkens a man’s\nskin or lightens a woman’s hair. Just like a color does to a drafter’s body.\nPrisms don’t break the halo despite drafting vast amounts of light because\nthey’re able to release all the light that hits them. The rest of us are less\nefficient, more susceptible to the damage. The point is that the light hitting a\nsurface can’t be changed unless you can put a lens over the sun. The energy\nis constant. It must be dealt with.\n“If it works the way I’ve heard guessed at, a lightsplitter acts like a\nwedge in the stream of light, lengthening the long spectra and shortening\nthe shorter, so that all the visible light hitting her is released above and\nbelow the visible spectrum. If she does it perfectly, she’ll glow bright as a\ntorch in the superviolet and the sub-red. I’ve heard tales of lightsplitters\nburning up if there’s too much light to handle, say on a bright day—because\nthey’re turning so much visible light into heat, they can burn out. These\ncloaks make what they do easier. Like lenses make it easier for a drafter to\ndraft her color.”\nKip had seen so many wonders in the past months, he had no trouble\nbelieving it. “So you’re telling me there may be hordes of invisible people\nwalking among us?”\n“Not hordes. Splitting light well enough to be invisible is probably close\nto impossible. And there are only—if the legends are right, which is a big if"

Some have surely been lost or destroyed, and we now have\ntwo of them. So at most there are five more teams of assassins out there.\nMaybe only two or three. Maybe none.”\n“At least we have these cloaks now.”\n“Which is better than our enemies having them, but they’re probably\nuseless to us. Having denied their existence, I don’t think the Chromeria has\nany method of testing drafters to find lightsplitters. Even if someone knew\nof such a thing, could they be convinced to share it when the very idea\nverges on heresy? The Atashian luxors suppressed something\nuncomfortably similar a hundred ten, maybe a hundred twenty years ago\nnow.”\n“And that’s one card,” Kip said.\n“And you have a deck full. Breaker indeed.” Commander Ironfist started\nlaughing quietly.\n“What’s so funny?” Kip asked.\n“I was just thinking that with how important these cards are and who\ncan view them most clearly, you’ve probably just condemned a few of my\nleast favorite people to spending the rest of their natural lives in a library\nsomewhere, touching cards and taking notes.”\n“You realize,” Kip said grumpily, “that that may well be my future\nyou’re laughing about?”\n“Doubtful,” a voice said behind Kip. “I imagine that you’ll be killed\nwithin the next year or live forever.”\nKip turned around, and there, in front of the most silent door in history\nstood Gavin Guile, his Gavin Guile smirk on his lips.\n“But I wouldn’t bet against the boy who convinced Janus Borig to give\nhim her life’s work.”\nKip couldn’t speak. Gavin’s presence filled the room.\n“How is the old goat?” Gavin asked.\n“Dead,” Kip said, his voice flat and lifeless. He hadn’t realized how\nmuch he’d cared for the woman until now.\nA respectful pause. “I should have gathered as much from the cloaks. No\nevidence who sent them, I suppose?”\nKip had nothing to say. Obviously, his first instinct had been wrong.\n“Don’t look at me, Lord Prism,” Commander Ironfist said. “I wasn’t\nthere. I didn’t kill them. Kip did.”\nGavin shot a look at Kip. “You killed them? That’s a story I’ll want to\nhear. But later. Well done, son.”\nSon. Son! With one word, Gavin was overturning months of Lord\nAndross Guile’s torment. Kip wanted to fall all to pieces. He wanted to\nshove all the cards and the knife into his father’s hands and blubber.\nGavin raised a finger. “First things first. Commander, your Blackguards\nsent Grinwoody packing. I intercepted him. He was on his way back to my\nfather.

You’re certain he’s wrong, and you’ve done nothing, and\nyou’re sure Carver Black will save you?”\nCommander Ironfist’s face clouded. “I suppose there are a couple things\nthat could… cause problems.”\n“What?” Kip asked. “What have you done?”\n“It’s not what I’ve done,” Ironfist said. “I’ve been looking into some old\nm—Lord Prism, Breaker, excuse me. I have urgent matters to attend to.”\nHe stepped out the door, then turned. “Breaker,” he said. “You can trust\nCruxer. And… just so you know, you’d have made an excellent\nBlackguard.”\nHe was leaving. Kip had the sudden fear that he’d never see the big man\nagain.\nKip ran over and hugged him.\nIronfist grunted, surprised. Then he hugged Kip in return. After a\nmoment, he pushed Kip back.\nGavin had an odd look in his eye at seeing Kip embrace the commander.\nA distance between them. But in a blink, it was gone. He tossed the man a\ncoin purse. “Commander, just in case. And honestly, I don’t know for\ncertain that they’re coming after you.”\n“I do,” Ironfist said. “Orholam give you light, Lord Prism. Be well,\nBreaker.” Then he was gone.\nChapter 70\nIdoss was a city of ancient ziggurats. Some luxiats said they were man’s\nattempt to scale to the heavens. They called them blasphemy. But those\nluxiats’ attempts to have the ziggurats torn down had never been successful.\nThere were thirteen of the great terraced pyramids in the city arrayed\ngeometrically, six and six around one. The central one was easily taller than\nthe Prism’s Tower that Liv had thought was the tallest structure in the\nworld.\nHaving surrendered to Dazen’s general Gad Delmarta rather than fight\nduring the Prisms’ War, Idoss had escaped the torch and the sword and the\nflux. Most of the men pressed into service in Dazen’s army—at least those\nwho survived the Battle of Sundered Rock—had made their way home\nwithin a couple months and the city had recovered more quickly from the\nwar than any other city on the southern rim of the sea.\nThe city’s corregidor was the Atashian satrap’s son, Kata Ham-haldita.\nThe term was Tyrean, one of the few remnants left of the time when Tyrea\nhad included what was now eastern Atash. When the corregidor came out to\nparley, the Color Prince had the central avenue up which the young man\ntraveled lined with all the color wights in the army, and instructed them to\nall be outside and in full view, but to ignore the corregidor and go about\ntheir chores so that he might believe there were far more of them in the\narmy than there were.\nIt doubtless made for a terrifying walk, and the boy arrived rattled.

And\nboy he was, for though he nominally ruled one of the richest cities in the\nSeven Satrapies, he was only twenty years old, and clearly young for his\nage.\nLiv met Corregidor Ham-haldita and his two bodyguards outside the\nColor Prince’s tent. Her presence seemed to brace the young man. He\nsmiled at her as if he was used to wooing women with that smile alone. He\nwas a pretty boy, though skinny and narrow-shouldered. Liv preferred a\nman who looked like a man; she gave a pleasantly neutral nod. In truth, her\nheart was pounding—not from the boy, but with being trusted to be here.\nShe’d worn the nicest of her dresses, and she could tell that the young man\nappreciated it.\n“Corregidor, we’re delighted that you’ve come to join us. The prince is\nresting within. Will you join us?” she asked.\nHe looked at his bodyguards, but Liv stepped inside the tent, not waiting\nfor a response. After a short hesitation, the corregidor and his men followed\nher.\nThe tent was dark, darker than usual, darker than necessary. There was\none chair inside, a throne, and nothing else, not even rugs. In the chair,\nslouching, sat the Color Prince. He didn’t move when Liv came in. Then,\nwhen Corregidor Ham-haldita came in, the Color Prince lifted his head, and\nhis eyes began to glow dull red, the color of new-forged iron. He stood, and\nthe layers of luxin scraping across each other gave a sound like steel rasping\nover steel.\nA shimmer of pale yellow light passed down his form, illuminating\nevery crack and joint and seam, he flexed as if shaking himself from sleep,\nand every blue plate of armor on his body glowed, dimmed, then every red\nseam, then every green joint, all the way up to the barely visible pale violet\nthat pulsed around his head in a crown.\nThe slack-jawed expression on the corregidor’s face almost made Liv\nlaugh aloud, but she tucked her chin and bit her tongue. His men were right\non the verge of pulling their weapons, but they looked terrified, too.\n“Corregidor,” the prince said. “Welcome. Walk with me?”\nThe corregidor had to clear his throat before he could speak. “Of\ncourse.”\nLiv joined the leaders and their guards, walking as she’d been instructed\non the corregidor’s right while the prince walked on his left. Trapped\nbetween hope and fear, the prince had said.\nHope of what? Liv hadn’t quite dared to ask.\nShe didn’t think she was pretty enough to catch a future satrap’s eye,\nthough if the Color Prince was successful, this boy would never be a satrap.\nBut he didn’t know that yet. What then? A mistress? A night’s\nentertainment?

Not exactly the\ngreat purpose that the prince kept alluding to, but she wasn’t the person who\ngot to choose, was she?\nA quiet fury rolled through her.\nWhen they strode into the full sunlight, the corregidor missed a step\nagain. Seeing the Color Prince’s luxin form fully lit with natural light was at\nleast as impressive as seeing him glow in a darkened tent. Again, not a\nmistake.\nThe Color Prince led the way through the camp, as if walking aimlessly,\nthough Liv was sure he wasn’t. He didn’t leave much to chance.\n“You’ve come with something to say,” the Color Prince said. “A deal,\nperhaps.”\n“The city mothers have asked that I tell you we wish only peace, but if\nwe must fight, you will pay dearly to take this city, and perhaps not before\nour reinforcements arrive.”\n“Which I’m sure you expect any day.”\n“Yes, we do.” The boy colored, as if fearing he was being made fun of.\n“And we can hold you until they arrive and smash you against our walls.”\nThey passed by Zymun, who was training with the other drafters. He\nstood shirtless, lashing an old tree with great whips of fire, awing his\nfellows. He stopped when they walked by, bowing respectfully to the Color\nPrince, his eyes full of jealousy at the sight of the other young man.\nZymun’s wounds had faded, and if his shirtless body didn’t fill Liv with the\nspeechless desire that Gavin Guile’s once had, he was still quite handsome.\nPowerful, intelligent, charismatic—and always, always interested in her.\nAlways flattering. Always flirting.\nShe’d flirted with boys at the Chromeria, of course—mostly before that\ndisastrous Luxlords’ Ball. But those had mostly been the flirtations of\nimpossibility: playing at being adults. Playing at being outrageous. Zymun’s\nflirtation was the flirtation of possibility. She had only to say the word, just\nonce, one night when he came by her tent and asked politely if he could\ncome in. That she could say yes, that none would stop her, that none would\neven question her was more of an erotic charge than that she could say yes\nto Zymun in particular, dashing as he was.\nHer students would envy her the assignation, of course, for she had\nstudents now. Not discipulae, not among the Free.\n“So Delara Orange has been successful in persuading the rest of the\nSpectrum to go to war? Or am I to be on watch for the elite Ruic troops?”\n“Both,” the boy said. Even Liv could tell he was lying.\n“You are a young man,” the prince said. “And I think you’re a hair’s\nbreadth from being stripped of your position by those frightened old\nharridans.”\nThey walked through a narrow alley between two tents, stepping over\nthe guy wires. As they emerged, the corregidor’s guards found themselves\nlooking into the barrels of twenty loaded muskets and at half a dozen\ndrafters with arms loaded with luxin.\n“Disarm them, and keep them thirty paces away, but don’t harm them,”"

Or are you just guessing?” the corregidor\nasked, trying to keep his voice level.\n“Can’t we?”\nThe corregidor choked down his fear. “Very well. I’m—I’m sure we can\nsettle this together.”\n“Mmm. I believe in choices, Kata. We are free men, making free\nchoices, and bearing the consequences. So here are yours: First, you can\nsurrender. I will give you less than generous terms. You will free your\nslaves, the city will pay a million danars, and you will give us twenty\nthousand ephahs of barley, sixty wagons laden with fruit, ten thousand\nbarrels of wine, and twenty thousand barrels of olives. You will give us five\nthousand swords or spears and a thousand working muskets, with five\nhundred barrels of gunpowder and a hundred barrels of shot or eight\nhundred bars of lead. You will send with us fifty smiths and fifty\nwheelwrights and half a dozen chemists, and you will pay them double\nwages while they’re gone. You will empty your city of brothels—the\nprostitutes can make their own choice on if they travel with us, but you will\nnot allow any of them within your city for one year so as to encourage them\nto choose wisely. You will send all of your drafters to speak with me. Same\nwith the slaves. They will be allowed to choose whether to join us or to go\nelsewhere, but they won’t be allowed to return to your city until the war is\ncompleted, on pain of death. You will arrange a parade through the city,\nwelcoming us with trumpets and hailing us for giving you freedom. And\nbefore we come into the city, you will send all your luxiats out to this\ncamp.”\nThe details were washing over the young man, and he grabbed on to the\nlast like a raft in a maelstrom. “What is to happen to them?”\n“We’ll kill them all,” the Color Prince said bluntly. Then he continued as\nif the man hadn’t interrupted. “Then, in every church, you will allow to be\nestablished new forms of worship: one for each of the old gods. You will\nnot be required to maintain or attend services at any of these, however, and\nour new priests will abide by your laws so long as you don’t interfere with\ntheir worship.\n“In return, you and the city’s mothers will be allowed to retain your\nlives, your estates, and your positions, unless you betray me.

He gestured to a large group of wretched people\nbehind them, guarded by soldiers. It was the five hundred women and\nchildren captured from the small town of Ergion. “These unfortunates were\ntaken from the last city that opposed us. They will be herded in front of our\narmy for the first attack. When your ballistae and cannons and catapults\nstart, you will massacre them—or do you think perhaps the city mothers\nwill instruct you not to fire? And there will be attacks within your city. You\nknow I have people inside. You don’t know how many. I know about your\nsecret exits along the river and below the Great Abbey.”\nThe corregidor’s eyes widened for a fraction of a second. Either surprise\nthat the prince knew about this or surprise that there was another exit he\nhadn’t known about.\n“You remember the stories about the massacres at Ru, which led to Idoss\nsurrendering during the last war? I will simply do the same, in reverse.\nIdoss will be a beacon to the world, and you get to choose which kind—a\nbeacon of my munificence, showing how kind I can be to those I conquer,\nor a beacon of my malfeasance, showing how ferocious I am with those\nwho oppose me. The children in your city will be killed—too many mouths\nto feed, too likely to get sick or bear grudges when they’re grown. The\nwomen will be killed or put to service if they’re pretty or useful enough.\nThe only men and women who will survive unmolested will be your slaves.\nAnd they will be free to keep any of their masters’ goods they wish.

If by some chance you do hold out\nfor a week, two weeks, a month, do you think the slaves might join us?

I will cut off your arms and legs and dress you in purple and put a\ncrown on your head. I may blind you. I haven’t decided yet what makes a\nbetter example. Tongue, no tongue? It will probably depend on your\nattitude. Regardless, I’ll take my time. You will live a long time, and in\ngreat pain, I promise you.”\nThe corregidor looked positively sick. “You’re insane,” he said. “You\ntalk one second like you’re some luxiat and you have all these principles,"

Those two, and perhaps a few others like the\nWhite were far above Liv. But no one else was. She could have done better\nhere than this boy was doing—and he was two or three years her elder and\nhad all the benefits of being raised as a satrap’s son. The reason the Color\nPrince was treating her as a capable adult wasn’t because he was flattering\nher—though he was, and they both knew it—it was because she deserved to\nbe treated as such. It wasn’t that she was so incredibly gifted; it was that the\npeople she had always assumed were incredibly gifted were in fact no more\ngifted than she was. She was their peer. And she was young yet. In time, she\nwould be superior to most. Why hadn’t the Chromeria ever treated her this\nway?\nWhy hadn’t her own father?\nThe Color Prince said, “We all make choices, and then we bear the\nconsequences for those. Unfortunately, right now, you get to make the\nchoices for those people and for me. They’re your victims, not mine. When\nI’m in charge, they’ll be free to choose for themselves. There’s no way to\noverturn the Chromeria without people like you forcing massacres. If there\nwere, I’d take it in a heartbeat. This is the only way I can bring the change\nneeded, so this is how I will do it.”\n“You’ll do it because you can,” the corregidor sneered over his fear.\n“Because I can. Because I will it.”\n“So might makes right?”\nThe Color Prince was steel. Unamused, unapologetic, unyielding.\n“Might doesn’t make right. Might makes reality.” He stared at the\ncorregidor for long enough to drop the weight of certainty on the boy, then\nturned and looked at the women and children. His gaze was sad but\nresolute. He would march these people to their deaths to shield his own\npeople’s lives, and he would blame the corregidor for it.\nIf it was a bluff, it was as brassy a bluff as Liv had ever seen. But she\ndidn’t think it was a bluff. Neither, she could tell, did the corregidor. His\nface slowly worked through horror, revulsion, astonishment, and finally\nresignation. He wasn’t facing a man, he was facing a force of nature. There\nwas no reasoning with a cyclone, no pleading with a hurricano. You batten\ndown the hatches and ride it out, praying you survive.\n“We don’t have close to a million danars,” the corregidor said, and Liv\nknew he had surrendered.\n“Not in your treasury, you don’t. You’ll let every rich and noble family\nin the city know that if they don’t pay their share, they’ll be first to die."

You may not\nhave that much barley. You can make it up in other grains. And the fruit will\nbe difficult if you don’t hurry. We won’t take spoiled produce. One noble\nfamily will be killed for each wagon you’re short.”\nThe corregidor blanched. “I’ll have to take this to the city mothers, of\ncourse. It’ll probably take two days.”\n“In one day, our catapults will be constructed. We’ll start hurling one\nwoman of Ergion over your walls every quarter hour. We won’t stop until\nthe luxiats arrive. I know your guns will be able to reach our catapults, so\nplease know that the women and children of Ergion will be camped around\nthe catapults as well. Your gunners are half-trained at best. There’s no way\nthey’ll be able to hit our catapults on the first shot—or even the tenth.”\nThe corregidor swallowed. “I understand.”\n“My people will post lists of the women’s names in the order they will\nbe flung, so that people inside Idoss can know when to listen for their\nfriends’ deaths—or perhaps their enemies’, I suppose. We’re starting with\nknown acquaintances of the city mothers. My engineers tell me that the\nforces generated in the catapult’s sling will have an even chance of killing a\nwoman before she’s even released. I’ve told them to work on it. I want you\nto hear their screams as they fly.”\nKata Ham-haldita cursed quietly and left. He glanced at Liv, glanced\naway, ashamed.\n“So that’s it?” Liv asked once he was gone. She wouldn’t have dared\nask, before. She would have been too awed, too frightened. But now she\nwasn’t going to waste the opportunity to learn from the best.\nThe prince was still looking at the women and the children. The children\nwere playing together, shrieking and squabbling, unaware of their probable\nimpending deaths. “Most likely,” the Color Prince said. “It all depends on\nhow smart young Kata is. One of the city mothers is a shrewd old harpy\nnamed Neta Delucia. The guards were her men. If Kata isn’t careful, he has\njust signed his own death warrant by meeting with me privately. She’ll\nknow immediately that I offered to buy him off. And I put Mother Delucia’s\nenemies at the top of the list of women to be killed. With her friends right\nbehind them. The mother and the corregidor will fight. If Mother Delucia\nwins, we’ll fling half a dozen women into town, and suddenly Idoss will see\nreason. If Kata wins, it make take more or less time, depending on how\ndecisively he moves.”\n“And either way, you win?” Liv asked.\n“We choose freely, Aliviana. That doesn’t mean we can’t set up the\nchoices so that both benefit us.” He smiled, and that smile reminded Liv of\nGavin Guile’s crazy reckless indomitable smile, but without the warmth.\n“That’s not really freedom then, is it? Not for them,” Liv said."

For without power, your\nfreedom can be taken.” He smiled again. It was a hard smile, but this was a\nhard world.\nChapter 71\nIronfist was on his way to the White’s quarters on top of the tower when he\nsaw Blackguards standing outside the Prism’s apartments. Since he’d just\nleft Gavin, they could only be hers.\nThe commander knocked on the door.\n“Come in,” the White said.\nThe White was in her wheeled chair. Before her, Gavin Guile’s room\nslave Marissia was on her knees, laying her head in the White’s lap. Tears\nstreaked the room slave’s face, and the White was soothing her.\n“Gavin Guile’s back. He’s one floor down,” Ironfist said. The sometimes\nfractious relationship between the White and the Prism didn’t need the\nadditional strain of Gavin finding the White in his room. Gavin liked his\nprivate space.\nMarissia hopped to her feet, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. “Oh!\nI cry once a year and he invariably—Mother, thank you. I will do as you’ve\nsaid.”\n“Orholam bless you, child. We’ll leave now so we don’t make your life\nany more complicated than necessary,” Orea Pullawr said. “Commander?”\nHe wheeled her out into the hallway. It was much faster for him to do so,\nbut it was also evidence of her growing frailty. Not two months ago, she\nwould have angrily refused to let anyone push her around like she was an\ninvalid.\nNor did she take over when they went down the hall. She seemed tired.\nOne Blackguard preceded them, and the other took their backs. Even\nhere, they guarded.\n“One thing I never considered about getting old,” the White said, as\nIronfist rolled her in front of her desk and then released her, to sit opposite\nher. “It makes spying so much harder.”\n“I thought that you had people for such things,” Ironfist said.\n“You can never leave such things entirely in other hands. It puts you at\nthe mercy of your own spymaster. Or spymistress, as the case may be.”\nSpymistress? What? Did she mean—“Marissia?” Ironfist asked,\nincredulous. “She’s your—”\nThe White said nothing for a long moment, and Ironfist’s mind whirled\nat the implications. Marissia did have unfettered access to this floor at all\ntimes, but she could also move freely among the other slaves in the tower.\nHer position as a slave to the most important man in the world made her\nexist in a social gray zone: if needed, she could mix socially with the lowest\nscullery boy, or she could chide the richest merchant on Big Jasper. A smart\nwoman would exploit the advantages of such a situation, and Ironfist knew\nthat Marissia was definitely a smart woman.\n“No, she’s not,” the White said finally. “But just now, you were thinking"

As Gavin must think.”\n“That’s harder than juggling the odds of a rival pulling a good card,”\nIronfist said.\n“One gets better with practice. But I prattle.” She tented her hands in her\nlap, sat quietly. She glanced at his bare head, then back to his eyes. Waited.\nIronfist rubbed his bare head, the stubbly hairs growing in like stubborn\nweeds of faith he could cut but not uproot. If he couldn’t trust the White,\nwho could he? Even if she was faithless. Of course, he was faithless now,\ntoo. Did that make him less trustworthy?\nHe laughed quietly to himself. Truth was, he didn’t know.\n“I may be on the verge of losing my position. What was your big\ngamble?”\n“Cards on the table, huh?” the White said.\n“I at least appear to have very little to lose.”\n“Those who fold have no right to see the cards of those who stay in the\ngame,” the White said.\n“Metaphors break down.”\nThe White was quiet for a long moment, staring into the depths of him.\nHe was impassive under her gaze. “You’ve stopped wearing your ghotra.\nIt’s hard to fail to notice such a thing. How should I react to that,\nCommander? Personally, or politically?”\n“What do you mean?” he asked.\n“Politically, you may have just made it impossible for me to save you.\nYou’ve gone apostate. Most people don’t wear the evidence of their faith on\ntheir heads—or take it off when they have doubts. You do. If the Black lists\nyour apostasy as a reason to remove you from office, you’ll admit it’s true.\nSo, politically, you’ve put the knife to your own throat.”\nHe hadn’t even thought of that. His religion—or lack thereof—wasn’t\nsome public show. How could not the outer man reflect the inner?\n“Of course, you could defang that by simply putting your damn hat back\non. Explain to anyone who asks that you removed it in mourning for your\nlost, which is true. Partly. But you won’t do that.”\n“To be a man is to bring together that which you should be and that\nwhich you are. Deception is darkness.”\n“And did not Orholam himself set the world to spinning, so that there\nmay be both times of light and times of darkness? The greater light and its\nnightly mirror do not shine on all the world constantly.”\n“That’s generally understood to allow for moral exceptions to the rule in\nthe case of war,” Ironfist said, a little stiffly.\n“Do you think we have not been at war these sixteen years?” the White\nsaid quietly.\n“Does being the White mean getting to define war as anything you want\nit to be?”\n“You met Corvan Danavis, did you not?” she asked. “Oh yes, of course\nyou did, at Garriston. He used to say, ‘Not all sharks and sea demons swim\nCeres’ seas.’ ”\n“We’re awash in metaphors, Mistress. I’m a simple man.”"

I’m a simple man.”\n“Simplicity has its own power, Harrdun. As well you know. Yes, then.\nYes, being White means I decide what is war. And when to threaten it.” She\nsmiled thinly.\nIronfist waited.\n“As you know, I select the commander of the Blackguard, and the Black\nhas the power to remove you. It’s meant to balance our power. Really, it’s\nmeant to diminish mine. But what perhaps you don’t appreciate is that after\nyou are removed, I could simply appoint you again.”\n“And he would remove me again.”\n“Precipitating a crisis. But if you stayed, retained your quarters,\ncontinued giving orders, assigning shifts, how many of your Blackguards\nwould abide by your choice and mine, over Carver Black’s?”\nWhat she was proposing could precipitate civil war. Ironfist raised his\nhands. “Hold. Wait, wait, wait. I’m not worth the kind of carnage you’re\ninviting here.”\n“No, you’re not.”\nShe wasn’t making sense. Was she finally going senile? No, the intensity\nin her desaturated blue, gray, and green eyes showed that nothing had\nshaken her deep intelligence.\n“So what is it? I’m another front in your war?” Ironfist asked.\n“Precisely. Carver Black doesn’t hate you. In fact, he likes you. Andross\nGuile has something over him. I haven’t ever been able to find out what it\nis, but we can put the problem back in his court: ask him if he wants to\ndestroy the Blackguard, now, over his dirty laundry.”\n“So you’re hoping Carver Black blinks.”\n“That’s right,” the White said.\n“Well, at least you realize that Andross Guile won’t.”\n“Never.”\n“I don’t want this on my head. I love my people. I don’t want to gamble\nwith their lives. That’s a game for worse men.”\n“Or women,” she said lightly. Meaning herself?\n“Or women.” He refused to be taken in by her self-deprecation. Her\ncharm. She was smarter than he was, fine. He didn’t have to play this game.\n“I am the best of the Blackguard for my position, but every man and woman\nis loyal to our task. Losing me is a serious loss, but not one from which the\nBlackguard cannot recover.” He stood. He was finished with this. He\nwouldn’t miss all of it.\n“You assume your successor would be chosen from the Blackguard’s\nranks.”\nHe blinked. “I suppose you can choose anyone you want. You aren’t\ngoing to choose someone bad for the job simply to spite me. You can\nthreaten it now, but I know you too well. Once I’m gone, there’ll be no\nreason for you to hurt yourself.”\n“Stop playing against me, you simpleton! Understand how Andross\nGuile works.

Your successor, perhaps young Lord Jevaros—\nperfect because he’s a loyal idiot—will report his concerns about my\ndeteriorating mental condition. Incidents will be arranged to make me look\nsenile. My duties will be further circumscribed, and I will be strongly\nencouraged to withdraw until Sun Day.”\nShe was making guesses, of course, but they all made sense to Ironfist.\n“But… what does he want? Lord Guile, I mean? Why go to so much\ntrouble? What’s his goal?”\n“If I had to guess, I’d say he simply wants control. I know this man. If\nhe could, he would dissolve the Chromeria, dissolve the satrapies, renounce\nthe Prism, and become emperor of the known world. I think he would hold\nthat position for one day. One. Then he would feel either the triumph of\nobliterating all before him or the emptiness of holding power for no reason\nother than his own lust—and he would kill himself. Because there is no\nreason why he wants to rule. He simply believes he should. It irks him that\nhis lessers should rule where he believes he ought.”\n“You make it sound so simple, and empty.”\n“Evil is simple and empty. Evil has no mysterious depths. We stare into\na dark hole and fill it with our fears, but it is only a hole.”\n“Do you believe in Orholam, or was that a necessary lie, too?”\n“I have big questions for him; he hasn’t deigned to answer them.”\nHe’d believed something similar, as a young man. He thought Orholam\nheard the prayers of the great and the holy. He’d prayed with blood on his\nhands, so he hadn’t been heard. Excuses. He’d been making excuses for\nOrholam for more than twenty years. Because the alternative was too\nterrible. But here it was. He would believe lies no more.\n“But I do believe,” the White said. “I believe profoundly, my friend.”\nShe held him with her gaze, and he was reminded that this was a woman of\nwill. Will great enough to become the White, and great enough to not use\nher magic for years and years.\n“Would you lie to me?” he asked.\n“Absolutely. But not about this.”\n“You would turn me into a liar.”\n“You would not be the first good man I’ve seen live a lie.”\n“Riddles.”\n“Perhaps.”\n“You mean Gavin, presiding over all the rituals. He’s an atheist, isn’t\nhe?” When he said “atheist,” it was a slur. He realized he said it as a slur out\nof force of habit. He’d always thought it the worst thing a man could be.\nAnd now he was one himself.\n“I prefer to think that he’s struggling through a lack of faith,” she said\ncarefully.\nHe sneered.

If he didn’t deserve the full truth from\nher, then she didn’t deserve it of him.\nThere was a knock on the door. “Mistress,” one of the Blackguards, a\nstocky woman named Samite said, “now that the Prism has returned, the\nSpectrum is proceeding with that emergency meeting. We need to head\ndown in ten minutes.”\nThe White nodded to her, dismissing her. She looked burdened, bitter,\nfor one second. “Your people are kind to me, Commander. Telling me about\n‘that emergency meeting’ in case I’d forgotten that we have to decide\nwhether we go to war today. But such kindness is dangerous when my body\nis betraying me and the Red is already trying to paint me as lost in my\ndotage.”\n“I’ll speak with her.”\n“Delicately, if you will. I know she means well.” She turned back to\nIronfist. “I’ve already told the Black that he can’t remove you. The Red\nhates you for reasons I don’t know and that you won’t tell me, but he can’t\nhave you while I breathe.” She waved her hand, and that was that. Ironfist\nwas saved. “Now. My bet. I can’t tell you what it was, but I can tell you\nwho it was on. I bet everything on Gavin. I bet the world on him, and I may\nnot live long enough to find out who wins.”\nIronfist exhaled. Since when did I become a keeper of secrets and teller\nof half-truths?\nHe fished in his pocket. He pulled out a white rock, the size of his hand.\nHe tossed it on the White’s desk as if it were trash.\nHer eyes went wide. “Commander, is that…?” She reached for it.\n“White luxin,” she whispered.\n“Gavin drafted it at the Battle of Garriston. He doesn’t know he did it.”\nShe picked up the white luxin with trembling hands, and for the first\ntime that Ironfist had ever seen, she quietly wept.\nLots of crying women today.\nChapter 72\n“Aliviana, come, I have something for you,” the Color Prince said. He\nturned to the engineer in charge of the trebuchet. “Ten chits if you make it\ninto the city on the first shot.

The people still\ndidn’t know how much deference to pay to the Color Prince.\nThe entire camp had turned out for this. Noon was coming, and\neveryone knew that noon was the deadline. The guns on the city’s walls\nwere trained on them, but they hadn’t fired during the entire setup of the\ntrebuchet, three hundred paces from the city’s walls. Some of the prince’s\nfollowers stayed farther away, fearing that the guns would open up and try\nto destroy the trebuchet first, despite the women and children of Ergion held\nhostage around its base.

This is our path, and you must\nknow it. I trust you with hard truths.” She caught his implication: Unlike\nher father. Unlike the Chromeria.\nShe would be worthy of that trust. So she watched, from close up. The\ncrowds didn’t jostle her. Her violet and yellow drafter’s dress guaranteed\nthat. Drafters were treated as lords and ladies. They had power, and power\nwas a virtue.\n“You said you had something for me, my prince?” Liv said.\n“A letter came for you,” he said. “And before you ask, of course I read\nit.”\nHe gestured, and a steward brought a letter. Liv knew the handwriting.\nShe felt tingles up her arms, up her neck. It was from her father.\nThe Color Prince said, “It’s time for you to decide who you are and who\nyou will be, Aliviana Danavis.”\nThe engineers began cranking the great counterweight up into the air,\nsticking long staves into a wooden gear, ratcheting it down. The\ncounterweight rose, slowly racing the sun, which was approaching its own\nzenith.\nLiv opened the cracked seal: “My Dearest Aliviana, Light of my Eyes.”\nA rush of tears came to her eyes, just at seeing her father’s hand. When Kip\nhad told her Corvan had died in Rekton, Liv’s world had ended. She blew\nout a slow breath, blinked.\nThe crowd was jubilant and nervous by turns. The cannons could open\nup at any moment, spraying death everywhere, or the gates might open in\nsurrender, or in attack, or nothing at all might happen. Men laughed too\nloudly. Some placed wagers. Liv could hear the women who were in line to\nbe thrown over the walls crying quietly. Quietly only because they were\ntrying not to upset the children, who still had no idea what was happening.\nShe kept reading: “Daughter, please come home. I know you think I’ve\nforsaken my oaths. I have not. I can tell you no more in a letter that may be\nintercepted, but I will tell you when you come.” What he said was true, but\nit was infuriating, too. She’d been with him.

The engineers didn’t leave off their\nwork, though, rushing around checking how their machine was bearing up\nunder the pressure, preparing the basket for the woman, warning the crowds\nbefore and behind the trebuchet to move back.\nEventually, the chief engineer came to the Color Prince. “We’re ready,\nsir, should we load the cargo?”\nCargo.

Her clothes had been rich, Liv could tell, and she\nhad the pale skin of a woman who’d never worked outdoors in her life.\nWavy, silvered hair, brown eyes. Out of all the people staring at her, she\nsaw Liv, and met her gaze.\n“It’s a bluff, isn’t it?” the old woman asked. “Or am I fooling myself?”\nLiv looked away. Trust me, her father had said. Was that just another\nway of saying, submit?\nThe woman let herself be folded into the net, meek, powerless. “Keep\nyour head resting on the ropes,” the chief engineer said. “Relax.”\nRelax, we’re trying to win our chits, lady.\n“Ready,” the chief engineer said quietly to the Color Prince.\nThe prince beckoned Liv forward. His eyes were swirling red, and then\nblue, and then red. “Tell me, Liv. Should I wait until noon, or show them\nwhat it means to cross me?”\nIt was less than a minute until noon. Liv saw at once that part of him\nwanted to punish the city for standing against him, wanted to make them\npay, was afraid that they would surrender too soon. Liv hadn’t finished her\nletter. She hesitated, somehow thinking it was important. “You might stiffen\ntheir resolve if they think you haven’t been fair. You’ve set up a deadline\nand a consequence, let it be their fault if this woman dies.” For some\nreason, she had to finish the letter before that woman died.\nThe Color Prince relaxed. “Yes, yes of course. It would be wrong to\nblink first.” Then orange flooded his eyes, and suddenly he seemed to be\nenjoying the tension he’d created.\nShe’d been right, she realized. He had asked her opinion because her\nopinion was valuable. She—she—was smart enough, strong enough to be\ntrusted. She was no child.\nShe read: “Livi, I don’t know what lies they’ve told you, but you’ve\njoined monsters. If you stay with them, you’ll become monstrous yourself.\nOur home is gone, but come home, Livi. No matter what’s happened. No\nmatter what you’ve done. I love you. Papa.”\nCome home, and admit you were wrong. I’ll enfold you in all the old\nrules you understand. I’ll embrace you into childhood again. And it will be\nwarm and safe.\n“It is monstrous, isn’t it?” the Color Prince said quietly to Liv. He didn’t\nturn from looking at the gate.\n“I suppose it—”\n“Monstrous how they keep a place like Laurion, and call us the beasts,\nbecause we’re willing to punish one slave owner, this woman. How many\nslaves do you suppose she kept? How many did she beat, or send to the\nmines, or the brothels? Or allow her husband to dishonor? Monstrous, how\nthey turn our very hearts against our own interests. They’ve trapped us in\nthis, Aliviana. They made this system. They made it so that we can’t change\nit from within. They made it so we must kill to break it. If we be monsters,\nwe’re monsters made in their image.”"

The top of the city’s walls\nwas crowded with spectators as well.\n“Regardless of whether they fight or surrender, Aliviana, fewer will die\nhere than died in one year in Laurion. And we ended Laurion forever.\nSacrifices, Liv. Sacrifices must be made.”\nThough she knew better, Liv hoped that the gates would open at the last\nsecond, that a fluttering flag would appear. It didn’t.\n“Noon,” an engineer intoned.\n“Proceed,” the Color Prince said loudly.\nThe old woman screamed, “No, please! I haven’t done any—”\nThe release pin was pulled. The great counterweight came barreling\ndown, swinging beneath the great groaning struts, and the longer arm\nwhipped forward, the ropes pulling the basket skyward at incredible speed.\nThe sound of the ropes whipping the air layered below the woman’s shriek.\nShe flew through the three hundred paces between the trebuchet and the\nwall so fast it was hard to follow, but Liv could see the woman clearly flail\nfor one moment before crashing headfirst into the wall, halfway up.\nGasps rose from the entire crowd simultaneously, and then cheers and\nlaughing and cheerful insults for the engineers. To Liv, it was all distant and\nhorrifying. There was a splotch on the great tan walls, like a giant had\nswatted a mosquito on its arm.\nLiv drafted superviolet and felt the paradoxical relief of not feeling.\nThere was logic here, logic to this horror. If they attacked the city, how\nmany men and women would die in the first charge alone? Better for one\nwoman to die noisily and horribly—but quickly for all that and without\nmuch bodily pain—than for thousands to die in taking the city. And tens of\nthousands to die when they took the city itself. Once the Idossians had\nspilled the blood of thousands of the Free Men, there would be nothing the\nColor Prince could do to keep those men from exacting a terrible\nvengeance. This wouldn’t be like retaking Garriston, which had been the\narmy’s own city, a place they wanted to preserve as much as possible so\nthey could live in it themselves. This would be annihilation.\nThough slaves no more, the slaves of Laurion weren’t blank slates,\nweren’t merely innocent farm boys who’d been made slaves and now might\nrevert to a peaceful life. Many had been brutes before being forced into the\nbrutish life of a mine slave. Outlaws, pirates, rapists, rebels, and those\nwho’d fomented revolt among slaves went to Laurion. What proportion\nthose men made up of the total, Liv had no idea, but even in her drafter’s\nrobes there were times walking the camp late at night she felt nervous.\nThose men, cut loose in a city that had killed their friends?\nThis was better, for everyone except a few unfortunate women.\nSacrifices.

Given war, this was the most moral way to\nwage it, horrible though it still was.\nWith no return fire from the city walls, the atmosphere quickly relaxed.\nMen began taking bets, serving food, spreading blankets on the grass,\nmaking a picnic of the day.\nThe Color Prince turned to Liv. She was struck again by his visage, but\nnow her shock lasted only half a second. He did look a monster at first\nglance. And yet he’d been nothing but honest with her, even when the truths\nwere hard. Especially when they were hard. He’d seen her for what she\nwas, for who she was. And though she was a young Tyrean girl, he’d treated\nher as she deserved. He said, “I’ll give you a horse, two sticks of tin danars,\nand letters of passage.”\n“That’s not—” Liv started.\n“I’m not finished. If you go, you never come back. You’ll be my enemy\nand I’ll never trust you. And if you don’t go now, you never go. You choose,\none way or the other, today. I’ve been patient with you, but I need to know\nif I can count on you. So this is it. Look at us at our worst, and decide. You\nhave until the city falls. Then march in with us, or go your own way.”\nThe second woman screamed the whole time they brought her forward,\nshrieking loudly enough that Liv had no doubt she could be heard on the\nwalls. The Color Prince told the men not to silence her. When she tangled\nher limbs into the ropes of the basket, the engineers were stumped for a\nmoment. With the incredible forces applied, the woman would still fly out\nof the basket, but she could seriously hamper the distance and trajectory,\nmaking them fail again.\nThey solved the problem by pulling her out of the basket and crushing\nher hands with a rock. Then they broke her elbows for good measure. She\nshrieked and shrieked, and Liv found herself wishing the woman would\nshut her mouth and just die.\nBut the Color Prince waited until the fifteen minutes had passed. On the\ngrain, he said, “Proceed.”\nThe straining whomp of the counterweight falling and whooshing and\nthe long arm flinging the basket forward drowned the woman’s screams.\nMaybe it knocked the wind out of her, because for a moment she was silent.\nThen, airborne, they heard her scream again.\nTo be fair, this woman had much longer to scream. The engineers had\nshifted the release peg, and the woman flew high, high into the air, hundreds\nof paces deep into the city.\nThe crowd cheered, although some seemed a little disappointed not to\nget to see the woman die in such a spectacular fashion as the first one had.\nThe Color Prince seemed to have had enough. He retired to his tent,\nhanding over control to one of his favorite blues, a powerful young man\nnamed Ramia Corfu. Liv was transfixed, the letter in her hand. There was\nnothing more.

There were no hidden\nmessages.\nTwo hours and seven deaths later, the gates opened, and four hundred\nand fifty black-robed luxiats were marched out, under guard. The Color\nPrince’s men met the guards in the very shadow of the walls. The prince’s\nmilitary adviser had suggested that the besieged might dress up armed men\nin luxiats’ robes and then attempt an assassination when they got close to\nthe Color Prince.\nInstead, the hundreds of luxiats docilely accepted the change of guard,\naccepted being checked for weapons, and marched willingly to the Color\nPrince.\nOdd, Liv thought. Suicidal. Using their freedom to lose their freedom.\nSurrendering power. Insane. She looked at the letter again.\nWhen they were finally brought forward, the Color Prince met them\nhimself. He was mounted on his spectacular white stallion Morning Star.\n“Why Neta Delucia, I had no idea you’d taken the black robe,” the Color\nPrince said, addressing a woman in the front row. “Your devotion, though\ndeluded, is… refreshing.”\nNeta Delucia was the city mother who the prince had said would head\nthe opposition. So apparently the young corregidor had been successful\nafter all.\nNeta spat toward the Color Prince. “You bought him. That little coward.\nThat little traitor. I knew you would.”\n“I knew you were the only one who had a chance to stop him,” Koios\nsaid. “So how he’d win, your bad luck?”\n“He struck half an hour before my men were to arrive to take him to\nprison.”\n“I could use a smart woman willing to do what needs to be done,” the\nprince said.\nNeta looked like she couldn’t believe she was being given a second\nchance. After a moment, she fell to her knees, heedless of all the\ncondemned men watching. “My lord, I would be happy to—I would be\ndelighted and honored to serve.”\n“Who’s the traitor now?” the Color Prince asked. He turned his back on\nher.\n“But my lord! You said you needed me!” she shrilled.\n“Enough,” the prince said.\n“My lord! My lord! Please! Please!”\n“Silence her,” the prince said.\nA soldier stepped forward and slashed a dagger across her neck. Blood\nsprayed out of her throat and she crumpled. She lay on the ground, gasping\nout her last breaths.\nLiv felt a wave of nausea, and quickly drafted superviolet to gain control\nof herself.\n“I didn’t mean kill her!” the prince said. “I—it doesn’t matter. She didn’t\ndeserve to be with these servants of Orholam anyway.” He raised his voice.\n“Luxiats, I detest everything you love, and I hate what you’ve done to the\nSeven Satrapies. But I admire your courage. Your deaths will spare\nthousands on both sides. For this one act, I admire you. Die well.”\nThe Color Prince turned to the soldiers guarding them. “Bind them,\nhand and foot. All of them.” Some few wept, but none fought, none\nscreamed. Then, as hundreds of soldiers descended with ropes and bound\nthe unresisting luxiats, he turned to his own gathered people."

Then, as hundreds of soldiers descended with ropes and bound\nthe unresisting luxiats, he turned to his own gathered people.\n“My brothers and sisters, today is the first day of a new order!” Cheers\ninterrupted him, and he had to wait while they quieted. “Today, we take our\nfirst steps out of darkness.” More cheers. If anything, to Liv Koios looked\nirritated that he wasn’t able to finish. She gathered that he hadn’t spoken to\nhuge groups very often, especially not huge and enthusiastic groups flushed\nwith victory and bloodshed. “We have been kept chained by the Chromeria\nand by her luxiats. Are we going to stand for it any longer?”\n“No!” a few men cried.\n“Are we going to let the Chromeria tell us what to do?”\n“No!” the crowd joined in, now catching on. It was like the old call and\nresponse, but this time against the luxiats, rather than with them.\n“Are we going to go quietly into the darkness?”\n“No!” This time, everyone joined, even those far enough back that they\ncouldn’t possibly have heard the prince’s question.\nThis is the mob, Liv thought. This is the beast. But beasts can be\nharnessed.\n“Our future lies before us. Our victories lie before us. They lie there!”\nHe pointed to the city, where the gates were opening even now.\nNice timing, Liv thought. But then, maybe he’d been stalling until he\nsaw the gates about to open. Well done, regardless. Well played.\nA huge cheer, but the Color Prince wasn’t done. “Between us and our\nfuture stand the luxiats.” He pointed to them. “Are we going to let them\nstop us?”\n“No!”\n“Then I say we march. I say we march right over those who would stop\nus.”\n“Yes!”\n“If sacrifices must be made, let them be their sacrifices!”\n“Yes!”\n“Are you with me?”\n“Yes!”\nHe glanced at Liv and said quietly, “Are you with me?”\nShe swallowed. Looked at the letter one last time. Dropped it in the\nmud. “Let’s go.”\nAnd, so help them Orholam, that’s what they did. The soldiers laid the\nbound luxiats across the road, and the whole army marched over them. The\narmy kept in lockstep, marching heedless, as if they were simply traversing\ndifficult terrain, ignoring the living beneath their boots.\nAfter the army passed, the Color Prince’s white-robed drafters followed.\nTheir long white robes and dresses trailed into blood and took on a scarlet\nedge.\nThen all the rest of the people came. Some tried to step around the\ngroaning, screaming men and women. Others deliberately stomped groins\nand fingers, carried rocks to crush heads. Soon, it didn’t matter. The bodies\nturned to jelly, the road bloody mud as gore was churned with the uncaring\nsoil. Liv heard later that through good luck or bad, some of the luxiats had\nsurvived until the heavy-laden wagons’ iron-rimmed wheels passed over\nthem at the tail end of the army.\nThe army entered the city, victorious, cheering, drunk on their own\nomnipotence.

And soon they were marching on, but now they had names,\nnames they’d won in blood and battle. Names for their implacability. Some\ncalled them blasphemers, and so they were. Some called them luxiat-\nhunters, and so they became. Some called them Red Robes, and saw the\nblood as a sign of their viciousness. They accepted them all, and marched.\nAnd among them, every drafter cherished the blood on the hem of her robe,\nand after washing, they would dip their hems in cow’s blood to renew the\nstain. It gave a stench to them, especially when they passed en masse. But\nthey called it the smell of freedom, the sacrifice of others. Some quietly\ncalled them animals. They called themselves invincible. They called\nthemselves the Blood Robes.\nLiv’s status meant she stayed in one of the Idossian nobles’ own\napartments that night. She got drunk, and when Zymun came knocking on\nher door once again after midnight, this time she didn’t turn him away.\nChapter 73\n“You’re going to take them from me, aren’t you?” Kip asked. The words\ncame out all raw and jagged. Harder and harsher than he intended.\n“What?” Gavin asked. He scowled.\nIt was as if while Ironfist had been here, Kip was able to be the Kip who\nwas training for the Blackguard, the Kip who had some tenuous friendships\nand was starting to be good at some things. And now, with Ironfist hinting\nthat Gavin was going to yank him out of the Blackguard, everything else\ncame flooding back. Not just nearly getting killed tonight and having Janus\nBorig die in his arms, but his mother dying in his arms, bitter and\naccusatory. “I knew it. I knew if I didn’t look at them right away, someone\nwould steal them. I just didn’t think it would be you.”\nKip knew he wasn’t mad about the cards—he was mad at being helpless.\nBefore Gavin Guile had come along, sweeping everything up in his wake,\nKip had had his own shitty life in his own shitty town with his shitty, shitty\nfriends. Ever since Gavin Guile had come into his life, he felt like he’d been\nplunged underwater. And now his last breath had escaped and he was\npanicking, flailing, punching whoever happened to be nearest.\n“What are you doing?” Gavin asked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Why are you acting like this? You were sane just two seconds ago!”\n“You left me!” Kip said. The sense of abandonment made his throat feel\ntight. It was hard to swallow. He hadn’t even known that was in there, but\nnow he felt horribly exposed, weak, ashamed. It was the prospect of\nCommander Ironfist leaving forever—just like everyone left him.\n“I—what?!”\n“You left me here,” Kip said. He was already recoiling from his own\nstupidity.

I haven’t accomplished anything you asked of\nme.” He couldn’t look at Gavin. “You said I had six months, and the only\nway I could think of accomplishing anything was to get into the forbidden\nparts of the libraries, and the only way to that was as a Blackguard. And I\nhaven’t gotten there yet. I don’t think I’m good enough. And I failed with\nyour father, too. He hates me.”\nGavin cursed under his breath. “I wish my mother was here,” he said\nsuddenly. “I’d ask her… Kip, there’s probably nothing you could have done\nto please my father. Nothing. And that other thing… We got unlucky and\nthe Color Prince moved faster than I thought he would. I still might be able\nto get around that obstacle we talked about anyway.”\n“So everything I’ve been doing is extraneous?”\n“Kip, in a very short time you’ve become one of the most important\narrows in my quiver. But you’re not the only one. Orholam help me if you\nwere.”\nIt was a slap to his whiny, fifteen-year-old face. And a well-deserved\none.\nGavin cursed again. “I didn’t mean it like that. I meant I can’t do what I\nhave to do with one weapon, no matter how sharp. Kip, you deserve more\nof my time, but right now I have about three emergencies to deal with, and\nmy enemies are probably moving fast. Can you wait?”\nEmergencies. Important stuff, like saving the world, preventing wars—\nor maybe winning them—fates of hundreds of thousands in the balance.\nAnd Kip wanted him to what? Sit around and talk? Wrestle? Play a card\ngame?\nI’m needy. Weak. A distraction from the important things. People could\ndie because of my pathetic whining. Orholam, Kip, be a man.\nKip swallowed and straightened his back. “Yes, sir. I’m fine.”\nGavin hesitated. “If it… if it makes any difference, I, I should have\ntaken you with me. I should have taught you personally. I didn’t—I didn’t\nthink of it. I’m not used to thinking of anyone but myself. And… I’m\nsorry.”\nKip didn’t know what to say.\n“How many colors can you draft now?” Gavin asked.\n“Sir?” The question seemed out of nowhere.\n“Colors?” Gavin insisted.\n“Um, four, five? Your father made me wager my right to the practicum,\nso I haven’t been able to work on it as much as I’d like.”\nGavin frowned. “Tell me what you can do.”\n“Only blue and green are stable. Red’s inconsistent. Yellow’s all over the\nplace, and I haven’t drafted sub-red again since Garriston.”\n“You know they say the Lightbringer will be a genius of magic.”\n“I’m… I’m not that, sir.” He’d said “will.” That meant his father\nbelieved that Lucidonius hadn’t been the Lightbringer, that the Lightbringer\nhadn’t come yet."

Not because you’re not a genius. You may be. Not\nbecause you’re not tremendously talented, smart, and gifted, and mentally\nnimble. You are. You’re not the Lightbringer because there is no\nLightbringer. It’s a myth that’s destroyed a thousand boys, and led a\nhundred thousand men to cynicism and disillusionment. It’s a lie. A lie more\ntempting the more powerful you are. Like all lies, it destroys those who\nlong entertain it. And that’s why I lied to you.”\n“Huh?”\n“You’re a polychrome. If you’re angry at me because your test didn’t\nshow that, I deserve your anger. You’re both privileged and despised for\nyour birth, for one parent or the other, depending on who’s hating you at the\nmoment. You’ve got a right to have a chip on your shoulder, but I didn’t\nwant you to become a monster. So I didn’t want you to know how powerful\nyou were going to be. That’s why I falsified your test.”\n“Wh-what?” Kip had been denying all the evidence of his expanding\ncolors because of that damned test. He’d been wasting his time practicing\nthe bouncy balls of doom while he could have been working on other\ncolors?\n“I don’t apologize for it, Kip. I wanted you to grow up a little. I wanted\nyou to get the measure of yourself before we added the burdens of vast\ntalent onto your new burdens of being the son of the Prism, having\neveryone you ever knew murdered, and moving to a new home and jumping\ninto social circles you probably never imagined.”\n“So why do you get to decide? Because you’re the Prism?”\n“Because I’m your father. I had to grow up too fast, and I didn’t do it at\nall well. You know what it is to start a war when you’re seventeen?”\n“I thought you were eighteen.”\n“Young, regardless,” Gavin said, but a quick expression leapt across his\nface, a tightening in his eyes, passing so fast Kip couldn’t read it. “Long\ntime ago, but I remember wanting to be an adult so bad it stuck on my\ntongue. I wanted people to take me seriously, to care what I thought. To\nlisten to what I said without that amused, tolerant look on their face—‘Here\ngoes the young lord again.’ I’ve been there, Kip, and people died because I\ndidn’t handle it well. Orholam send that the price you have to pay is never\nso high, but I didn’t want to force you into a position where any mistake\nyou made could get you or others killed.”\nKip glowered. “Well, when you say it like that it all makes sense and\nstuff.”\nGavin took his cloak off. “Come. Fold those up tight,” he said, pointing\nto the shimmercloaks. “We’ll talk about them later.”\nFather and son folded up the cloaks carefully and bundled them inside\nGavin’s cloak. Gavin folded it over his arm nonchalantly. He grabbed the\ndeck box in his hand, concealed again by the cloaks."

I mean, I want you to be the Prism\nforever. But…”\n“But if you’re not going to be the Prism, and there’s no such thing as the\nLightbringer, then that means you’re going to be nothing?” Gavin asked.\n“Yes, sir,” Kip said, averting his eyes. “Sounds… awful, huh?”\n“Yes,” Gavin said. “Let’s go.”\nKip was a muddle. No Lightbringer? But Janus Borig had said she knew\nwho the Lightbringer was—when she was looking at me. Afterward, when\nhe finally thought about it, Kip had dared to hope that meant…\nExactly what his father had thought Kip would hope it meant. She could\nhave meant, I know who the Lightbringer is… the Lightbringer is no one.\nOr, the Lightbringer is Lucidonius. Or she could have just been wrong.\nRight?\nShe’d said that her paintings had to be true, but Kip didn’t know that to\nbe true. Even if her paintings had to be true, that didn’t mean her words did.\nShe could easily have been lying, or just wrong. Even if she was right, and\nGavin was wrong, she hadn’t painted the Lightbringer. Maybe she wouldn’t\nhave been able to. Or maybe it would have been too obscure to tell\nanything. Even then, she’d said that sometimes her paintings weren’t literal.\nKip followed Gavin out of the Blackguard barracks. A man and a\nwoman Blackguard fell in behind them, natural and unobtrusive. Kip\nwondered how they did that. Long practice, he supposed. Just like\neverything in the Blackguards’ lives.\nMaybe that was why being a Blackguard appealed so much to him.\nEverything they got was earned. Not like Kip’s life. They didn’t care whose\nson he was, they cared if he could do the work.\nGavin set the weights in the lift—Kip had never really noticed it before,\nbut though the Blackguards guarded Gavin’s life, they weren’t servants. Kip\nwondered if that was because Gavin had established that he wanted to do\nthings for himself, or if the Blackguards simply refused to do more than\nprotect him. They headed up, surprising Kip, who thought Gavin would\nmake him go back to his own room.\nThey were deposited on the top floor. Gavin’s and the White’s floor.\n“So your grandfather gave you trouble?” Gavin asked.\n“Sir,” Kip said. “Your father… um, he’s denied me, sir. You know,\ndenied that I’m your son.” Kip swallowed. Of course he knows what it\nmeans, moron. “That’s what I meant when I said I failed.”\n“Really?” Gavin said. “This is going to be fun, isn’t it?” There was no\nmirth in his tone.

He turned to one of the Blackguards, a lanky Ilytian with\na crooked smile. “Lytos, this is my son, Kip. Kip is my son.”\n“Yes, sir,” the man said. He had a strangely high voice. “I understand.”\nOh, a eunuch. Kip had heard that some Ilytians believed eunuchs were\nbetter drafters than boys. His teachers had ridiculed the idea, though:\ncutting a man’s balls off doesn’t change his eyes, she’d said. Cutting off one\nend of a man doesn’t change the other. On the other hand, it did obviously\nchange a man’s voice, so maybe the idea wasn’t that ludicrous. Or maybe it\nkept a man’s voice from changing, which obviously wasn’t the same thing.\nUnless there was something about puberty that also changed a man’s eyes—\nmaybe imperceptibly, but enough to skew men’s color vision and make\ntheir magic fail more often than women’s.\nAgain, the problem was that you couldn’t tell what exact tones another\nperson perceived, so everyone made the best guess they could. And\napparently some people were confident enough in their guesses to cut off a\nchild’s testicles.\nKip was living in a mad world, among people who were happy to do\nworse than he could dream. He shivered.\nGavin looked at him, and understood. He touched Kip’s shoulder briefly.\nLytos peeled off as they walked through the security checkpoint and\nspoke to the officer in charge. Not five seconds later, Lytos was walking\nquickly to catch up with Gavin and Kip. Another Blackguard—Kip’s\nBlackguard, he supposed—was with him. Samite. Kip was glad to see her\nagain. He hadn’t seen her much since the day he’d first arrived. He grinned\nat her. She simply raised an eyebrow.\nThey walked to Gavin’s room, went inside. Gavin beckoned Kip to\nfollow him. Like a particularly squat shadow, Samite followed Kip in and\ntook her place behind the door. She was Kip’s bodyguard now, and that\nmeant guarding him even in Gavin’s room. Even from Gavin, if it came to\nthat?\nA mad world.\nThe big, open room was spotlessly clean and as beautiful as the last time\nKip had been here. But now he knew a lot more about drafting than the first\ntime he’d been here. Knowing more, he was more impressed. There were\nhellstone panels in the walls that you could hit with superviolet luxin to\ncontrol the windows and the artificial lights above. There was sub-red luxin\nwoven through the floors and the ceiling to keep the room warm,\ncounteracting the chill that invaded through the dozens of floor-to-ceiling\nwindows.\nBut before Kip could marvel at the workmanship and luxury even of the\nwindows themselves, he saw Marissia, Gavin’s room slave. She must have\nhad warning that Gavin was coming, because she was wearing finer\nclothing than Kip had ever seen her in before. He supposed that the gray\ncolor technically was in obedience to the sumptuary laws, and her hair was\ncarefully kept free of her ears to show where they had been snipped"

She took a steadying breath, desperate for approval, eager\nfor favor, eyes only for Gavin.\nKip had seen dozens, hundreds of people look at his father with\nadoration in their gazes. He’d seen people look at him with veneration in\ntheir gazes. This was love.\nAs fast as if he were trying to follow a cannonball in flight, Kip looked\nover to Gavin’s face.\nThe Prism was obviously pleased. He smiled widely, and Kip saw his\nfather’s eyes sweep over Marissia’s body appreciatively.\nEw. That’s my father. Looking at a woman like—\nKip didn’t want to think about it. He looked away.\n“Marissia,” Gavin said.\nMarissia hurried over and knelt at Gavin’s feet. She kissed his hand.\n“My lord.”\nKip couldn’t help but look back at them.\n“You’ve been crying,” Gavin said.\n“Yes, my lord. I have much to tell you.” She glanced over at Kip. Ah, in\nprivate.\nGavin handed Kip the cloaks and the card box. He walked to a closet,\nrummaged for something.\nKip cleared his throat awkwardly and walked over to one side of the\nroom where there was a table and chairs. Marissia had already risen by the\ntime Kip sat, and was speaking quickly to Gavin, with her hand to the side\nof her mouth, in case Kip was a lip-reader, he guessed.\nThese people know what they’re doing, and they’re playing for keeps.\nKip felt the familiar sinking feeling. He was so far out of his depth all he\ncould do was flail.\n“No!” she said, her voice rising just enough for Kip to hear it. “No\nalarms. I’m certain—” She lowered her voice again.\nGavin asked several quick, sharp questions, heard the low answers, then\nnodded a few times. There was a knock on the door. Gavin appeared to\ncurse. “Yes?” he said.\nThe door cracked open. Kip couldn’t see who it was, and Gavin made a\nvery subtle gesture to him to stay where he was. Always keeping secrets, his\nfather. Not letting anyone know anything that might endanger them all.\nSamite, blocked from sight as she was by the open door, remained silent,\nunseen.\n“Gavin,” an older woman’s voice said. “I was hoping you might\naccompany me downstairs. It is your business that will be before the\nSpectrum, after all, but I’d enjoy a word first.”\nThe White. Gavin was talking to the White. Kip swallowed again.\n“Of course,” Gavin said.\nHe turned around and addressed Marissia, but Kip could tell that he was\nreally talking to him. “I’ll be back in an hour. Stay out of trouble.”\nMarissia curtsied deeply. She knew when to play along. Gavin"

        "text": "really talking to him. “I’ll be back in an hour. Stay out of trouble.”\nMarissia curtsied deeply. She knew when to play along. Gavin\nnonchalantly tossed something onto his bed, flicked his eyes to Kip to let\nhim know it was for him, and then left.\nAfter the door closed, Marissia turned to Kip. “It appears you’re to stay\nhere, young master. Do you have any needs?”\n“Perhaps a bite to—”\n“Excellent. Then if you’ll excuse me, I have urgent errands for the\nPrism. Please do stay out of his things. He’s not very understanding about\nthose who violate this, the only sanctuary he knows.”\n“I under—”\nBut she was already gone, the door snapping smartly shut behind her.\n“—stand,” Kip said. He glanced, chagrined, at Samite beside the door.\nHer lips were pursed, trying to keep from grinning, no doubt, but otherwise\nher face was expressionless.\nHe sat down at the table. Stay out of trouble, huh? He looked over at the\nbed and then at the deck box, and, for one proud moment, thought of not\nopening it.\nHell with that.\nThe cards practically leapt into his hands.\nThe door opened, and Kip slammed the cards back into their box and hid\nit under the cloaks.\nOh, it was just Teia.\n“Hey, Master,” she said, eyes twinkling. “The Prism’s slave told me you\nmight still be here. We’re supposed to go to practice.”\n“We need to talk about that master thing,” Kip said.\n“No, we need to talk about our strategies for the Blackguard testing.\nAfter practice.”\n“We don’t need to talk about strategies yet, do we?” Kip asked.\n“We don’t.”\n“They sent you in here to distract me,” Kip said, understanding.\n“Commander said you’d just been through something traumatic. Your\npartner’s supposed to look out for you. Now come on.”\nIt was almost like having a real friend. But of course Teia had to look\nout for Kip. She was his slave. Kip gave a wan smile. “Almost a real\nfriend” wasn’t half bad, considering.\nHe picked up the card box again as he stood. Samite cleared her throat.\nKip looked at her. She returned his look blandly. He put the box down,\nfeeling like a chastened child. He gestured toward the bed: Can I get that at\nleast, Mom?\nBe my guest, her expression said, tolerantly amused.\nKip picked up a little stick of ivory from the bed. He had no idea what it\nwas.\n“Oh, that’s a testing stick,” Teia said, coming over to stand beside him.\n“From the Threshing. It shows what colors you’ll likely be able to draft.\nWhy’d he give you a testing…”\nThe stick lay across Kip’s open palm. It had all seven colors.\nChapter 74\nGavin greeted the White with a smile as their Blackguards fell into place\nbehind them. Elessia, a petite woman, light-skinned for the Blackguard, was\npushing the White’s wheeled chair. This was a change. The White was\nweakening, then."

        "text": "behind them. Elessia, a petite woman, light-skinned for the Blackguard, was\npushing the White’s wheeled chair. This was a change. The White was\nweakening, then.\nFor some reason, though he had feared her for nearly two decades, the\nthought brought him nothing but dread. She was dying, and so was Gavin.\nAnd if she continued drafting so much, so, too, was Karris. Maybe this\ngeneration’s time had passed.\nMeanwhile, the heretics under the Color Prince grew strong. Kip\nwouldn’t be ready in time. Not with Gavin dying at this rate. He’d lost two\ncolors in what, four months?\n“So you faked Kip’s test so your enemies wouldn’t know he was a full-\nspectrum polychrome?” the White said.\nYes, let’s do jump right in. Anything to not give her a commitment to\nbalance while she watched. “Pretty much, though someone sent an assassin\nafter him immediately, so it obviously didn’t work.”\n“It appears someone is trying to start up the Order again. There have\nbeen a few unexplained murders in the time you’ve been gone. But we can\ntalk about that later.”\nThey entered the lift together. Gavin took his time setting the weights.\nFirst, he wanted to get the weight exactly right so the stop wouldn’t be\njarring for the old woman. Second, he wanted her to hear what he had to\nsay.\n“If you told me your plans beforehand every once in a while, I could\nhelp you, you know, Gavin.”\nBut that would require me to trust you.\n“But that would require you to trust me,” she said.\nScary. Too much time with the old goat. He wondered if he was\nbecoming more like her, or she him. Now there was a scary thought.\n“What’s the endgame, Gavin?”\nEndgame? He thought of his seven purposes. Seven purposes in seven\nyears. He was two years in now. And he didn’t have five years left anymore.\nHe’d learned to travel faster than anyone ever had. Hell, he’d learned to fly.\nHe’d failed at freeing Garriston—though if he followed Corvan’s argument,\nhe’d actually succeeded by saving the people. He still hadn’t told Karris the\ntruth, but he’d do that once he left here. And the other four? Well, he’d be\nworking toward all of them in this meeting. And he certainly couldn’t tell\nher about any of—\n“So there is an endgame,” she said. She lifted her eyebrows, coolly\namused.\nShit. He’d forgotten who he was talking to here. Forgotten to guard his\nevery expression. Forgotten to lie first and think later. Protect. Guard. Hide.\nThe fugitive’s motto. Honesty is death. Loneliness is weakness.\n“War,” Gavin said darkly. “The end is always war.”\n“I don’t even know that they’ll declare war, but if you think they’re\ngoing to declare you promachos again, you’re insane,” she said as he\napplied the brake. He stopped them perfectly even with the level so that her\nwheeled chair could exit smoothly.\nHe strode ahead, not waiting for her.\n“They’re too afraid of you, Gavin.”\nToo afraid? They’re not afraid enough.\nGavin stepped into the meeting room and took a seat on the far side. The"

They’re not afraid enough.\nGavin stepped into the meeting room and took a seat on the far side. The\ntable around which they met was a circle, but Gavin wanted to be able to\nsee who came in the door. A few of the Colors were already seated. Sadah\nSuperviolet, representing Paria, sat next to Klytos Blue. Sadah was from\nminor nobility in a clan that wielded little clout in Paria. Mountain Parian.\nShe’d attained far more in her life than anyone would have expected\nthrough cold intelligence and fierce ambition. Indeterminate age, limbs\nlean, hands as gnarled as a yucca palm branches, skin as psoriatic as a\nyucca palm’s trunk. She wore her kinky hair gathered in small knots and\nwore a tight-fitting cap of woven gold that sat tight against her scalp, with\nlittle gaps for each knot of hair. An odd style that, so far as Gavin knew, had\noriginated with the woman herself. Like the superviolet she was, Sadah\nbrought a dispassionate perspective to all her votes, and was often the swing\nvoter because she was immune to any pressure but that of logic. Hated lies.\nKlytos Blue was Ruthgari through and through, but represented Ilyta. He\nwas a coward. Intelligent, but lacking substance, no gravitas. He did what\nAndross told him on most matters. Gavin sat next to Klytos, greeting him as\nif he didn’t despise him. He was happy to sit next to the man—not for his\ncompany, but because it’s hardest to surreptitiously study the expressions on\nthe faces of those who sit right next to you. Klytos didn’t matter; Gavin\ndidn’t have to be able to study his face.\nJia Tolver, the Yellow, nodded to Gavin, smiled. At the center of the\ncolor spectrum, yellows could be truly fearsome: great souls who brought\nunder their power the appeals of emotion and reason in perfect balance. Jia\nwas no great soul, though she liked to think she was. In truth, she really just\nended up being perfectly susceptible to appeals of reason and emotion both.\nShe was Gavin’s, almost always. She’d been infatuated with him for years.\nHis smile was enough to get her vote, though it had been a delicate act to\nkeep her from trying to get into his bed. She tried her wiles on him every so\noften, and he deflected her propositions rather than rejected them. Vain\ncreature. Good enough looking, but too much makeup, though she had cut\nback on the perfume after Andross made numerous explicit references to\nrooms smelling like cheap whores whenever she entered. She was proud of\nher unibrow, kept it perfectly coifed.\nAs he sat, Gavin smiled at the hairy caterpillar perched on her brow. Jia\nbeamed.\nThe others came in together, chatting. They were friendly, but tense.\nDelara Orange, the red/orange bichrome whose bosom was so large it ought\nto have had its own vote, looked drawn, grim, older than Gavin had ever\nseen her. She represented Atash: her country had been invaded by the Color\nPrince, and doubtless she would advocate war. Doubtless, she had been"

Doubtless, she had been\nadvocating war since she’d first heard of the invasion.\nThe Sub-red was Arys of the Greenveils. She was perhaps eight months\npregnant now, serially pregnant always. In her, the passions of sub-red were\nwedded to a cultural imperative for drafters to breed so as to replace the\ndead for the once-interminable wars between Blood Forest and Ruthgar.\nShe was, Gavin thought, perhaps thirty-five, and she had twelve children.\nNot a one, if rumor was correct, by the same father. She had a curtain of\nstraight red-red hair, freckles, and blue eyes sparkling with the crystalline\ndetritus that marked a longtime sub-red. She had perhaps two years left. Her\nthirteen—or by then probably fourteen—children would grow up honored\nin Blood Forest. They would also grow up without a mother.\n“Where’s Lunna Green?” Gavin asked Klytos.\nKlytos blanched. “I’m so sorry, Lord Prism…”\nLunna, despite being Ruthgari, was Gavin’s. He’d carefully built up\nenough credits with her that if he called them all in, she would do almost\nanything for him.\n“What?” Gavin asked. Oh no.\n“She had a stroke. She died.”\n“She wasn’t even forty-five,” Gavin said.\n“I’m so sorry, Lord Prism. She was right at the verge of breaking the\nhalo for some time, and…” Klytos lowered his voice. “There were rumors\nshe wasn’t going to take the Freeing. You understand?”\nThat she was trying to become a green wight, and she’d failed. No, she\nwouldn’t. Would she?\nBut that was the thing about facing death and insanity, wasn’t it? You\nnever knew what a person would do. Gavin had seen all sorts over the\nyears.\nThis was a disaster. A declaration of war required a simple majority.\nEight votes were possible—one for each Color, and one for the Prism. In\ncase of ties, the White got a vote. Gavin’s count had included Delara\nOrange, who was Atashian and would definitely vote for war, and Arys\nGreenveil, whose Blood Forest was directly on the warpath and who wasn’t\naverse to war regardless. His own vote, with Lunna’s, would bring it to four.\nThat would kick it up to the White, who he thought would vote for it. She\nwasn’t a fool.\nBut without Lunna, Gavin would have to sway Jia Tolver or Sadah\nSuperviolet. Jia voted with him often, but the Aborneans had no stake in a\nwar, and wouldn’t mind seeing Atash burn for a while as they pretended\nthat their reluctance to help put out the flames was born of pure, high-\nminded pacifism. Sadah Superviolet was even harder to judge. Paria was\nalso far away from the fighting, and wouldn’t want to send its young men or\nits wealth—but Sadah would do what was right. He hoped.\nGavin would have to move fast if he was going to have a chance.\nPerhaps the new Green would be amenable. If she or he wasn’t, Gavin"

If she or he wasn’t, Gavin\ncould structure the vote. His father would have already sent in his vote on\nwar as a no, but if Gavin was tricky and quick, he could make there be\nvotes on issues that the Red hadn’t sent his vote down for. By not calling a\nstraight up-or-down vote on declaring war, Gavin might be able to\noutmaneuver the old spider. Difficult, but possible. He would turn the old\nman’s proud disregard for the Spectrum on its head.\nFor all the satisfaction you get out of despising us, father, there are costs.\nLunna Green, though? She wouldn’t have gone wight, would she?\nBut if she hadn’t… Dear Orholam, the murder of a Color? Surely the\nOrder wasn’t that good.\nThis wasn’t the right way to do this. He knew that. He wasn’t prepared\nfor this meeting. Not that it was his fault—they’d called for an emergency\nsession weeks ago, to be held as soon as he got back. So he couldn’t wait,\ncouldn’t put it off. The longer he spent with these people, the more\nopportunities they had to notice that something was wrong with him. His\neyes had still looked prismatic when he’d only lost blue—he’d asked\nCorvan. But then, his eyes’ natural color was blue. Now that he’d lost\ngreen, wouldn’t his eyes start changing color?\nThis was all madness and stumbling in the dark.\nThere was conversation from the hall and, wearing a luxurious green\nsilk cloak, in came none other than Tisis Malargos, the astoundingly\nbeautiful young green who’d sabotaged Kip’s test. The woman who hated\nGavin, because her family had reason to hate the real Gavin. The woman\nwhose father had been murdered on Felia Guile’s orders, because he could\nhave exposed that Gavin wasn’t really Gavin.\nShe laughed at something her interlocutor said outside, then shot a look\nat the Prism. Hazel eyes, heart-shaped face, pale skin, the preciously rare\nblonde hair, generous curves. An exotic beauty who hated him for nothing\nhe had actually done. Perfect. Very, very young to be on the Spectrum,\nthough. How had that—\nAnd then her interlocutor stepped into view, wearing large blacked-out\nspectacles under a crimson hood, and robes the color of blood.\n“Father,” Gavin said, his heart icing over. “What a surprise.”\nChapter 75\nTrainer Fisk was running the scrubs through takedown drills when Karris\nWhite Oak came in. Teia immediately took notice. For one thing, she wasn’t\nvery good at the throws they were practicing—it was one area where her\nlack of body weight made things much more difficult for her. She could still\nthrow a boy who weighed twice as much as she did, but she had to get the\nleverage perfect. Getting things perfect seemed beyond her right now.\nSecond, Karris was her hero.

Fast and tough,\nmentally and physically and magically. Smart, confident, and beautiful on\ntop of it all. She was everything Teia hoped to be, even if some of those last\nthings were out of reach.\nThird, learning that Kip was a full-spectrum polychrome had kind of\nfrightened her. And it had scared Kip, too. Attending Blackguard training?\nThat was normal. She could handle that.\n“Watch Captain White Oak, it’s an honor to have you come,” Trainer\nFisk said.\n“I wish I could visit more often. I hear this is a very talented class.”\nShe had? They were? Everyone perked up at that, even Kip.\n“I wonder,” Trainer Fisk said. “Would you be willing to show us a quick\ntakedown? Some of the girls have been very quietly grumbling that these\ndrills are too hard because they don’t have the body weight.”\n“Really?” Karris said. “Very quietly, I might imagine. Or at least I\nhope.” She arched an eyebrow at one of the girls, who withered. “I’d be\nhappy to. Who’s the best fighter in the class?”\n“Cruxer,” someone said. The rest of them mumbled agreement.\n“Cruxer, defend yourself,” Karris said.\nShe walked toward him and he got in a ready stance, one foot forward,\nhands lightly balled and held up. She snapped an attack, a knifehand, right\nat his eyes. His hands shot up to block, palms out.\nThen his hands and hers entwined, and Cruxer dropped to his knees as\nfast as he could, yelping. He had barely touched them to the dirt before she\nwas moving in, sweeping him off his knees to the ground, rolled over,\nfacedown, one of his hands still clasped in hers, her knee on his neck.\nUnhurriedly, she drew a pistol from her belt and put it to the back of his\nhead.\nIt was over that fast. Against Cruxer. Teia looked over at Kip. He had\nthe same wide-eyed look she did.\nThen Karris tucked her pistol away and got up. The class started\nbreathing again. Karris made it seem so effortless. She hadn’t even gotten\ndirt on her knees.\n“It’s one of those tricks that works well against those who’ve never seen\nit,” Karris said. “It’s instinctive. You go for the eyes, and your target will\nopen his hands to fend off the strike. A quick fingerlock, and you can drop\nhim. From there, you’ve got all the leverage you need. Less weight and less\nstrength just means you need to be smarter.”\n“Nicely done, Watch Captain. I haven’t seen that one in years. I’m afraid\nit would have worked even on me,” Trainer Fisk said.\n“Mm, maybe,” Karris said. She smiled. “Although I’m not too eager to\nreenact our last fight.”\nHe shrugged. “Extenuating circumstances,” he said. “You were tired.\nNot many people trade five fight tokens.”\n“Can I take one of your students for the afternoon?” Karris asked. “I’ve"

Then, finally, she pointed at Teia. “You,\nyou’ll do.”\nFor some reason, Teia was sure that she hadn’t been picked randomly.\nBut that night, Karris just trained. She said nothing except to give\ninstructions about how to hold the kick bags or which exercises she wanted\nTeia to do with her.\n“Excuse me, Watch Captain,” Teia said finally. “But why are you\ntraining with me? I can’t hold a candle to a lot of the fighters you work with\nevery day.”\nKarris said, “Sometimes it’s good to fight people who don’t know what\nthey’re doing. It reminds you how most of your opponents in real life flail.\nIt’s less predictable.”\nOh. Well then.\nNeither of them said anything else.\nChapter 76\nGavin had almost forgotten the visceral effect his father had on people.\nAndross Guile had sequestered himself by degrees starting almost a decade\nago. Most men would be diminished by their absence. Andross had grown\nin people’s minds, in their dread. He’d become the bloated spider at the\ncenter of the web. And now, returning, weak, near blind, somehow he was\nstill a titan. He was old. Drafters never got old. Becoming old meant you’d\ndone the impossible. The casual destructions of age—the sagging\ntranslucent skin, the liver spots, the frailty—these had become badges of\nhonor, proof of godlike will, self-discipline, power.\nWith the assistance of his lapdog slave Grinwoody, Andross Guile sat.\nHe ignored the greetings of the other Colors and lifted his chin as if staring\nin the direction of the White, who alone seemed unmoved.\nWell, if Andross Guile’s presence swayed everyone else in the room\nagainst Gavin’s proposal, at least it swayed the White toward it. But though\nher instinct would be to oppose anything Andross wanted, she wouldn’t let\nthat override her concern for what was right, what was best for the Seven\nSatrapies and the Chromeria. Even she couldn’t be counted on.\nTrying not to let how utterly furious he was show on his face, Gavin\nlooked at his father. The bastard sat there, basking in his own excellence.\nThe rules didn’t apply to Andross Guile. He was above them. The world\nbent to his will. Ridiculous.\nGavin chuckled.\n“Is something funny, Lord Prism?” Tisis Malargos asked.\n“Just had a small personal revelation.” He smiled indulgently, and didn’t\ntell her more, just to infuriate her. You’re playing with the big guns now,\nTisis, are you sure you’re ready?\n“And that is?” she asked, insincerity oozing down her chin.\n“Why you don’t like me. Which isn’t the reason you shouldn’t like me.”\n“Perhaps we should get started,” the White said quickly. Ever the\npeacekeeper, if not always a peacemaker. “Andross, it is so good to see you."

Would you like to lead the invocation?”\n“No,” the old man said. He didn’t elaborate, excuse, or apologize.\nThe White tented her fingers. Waited a long moment.\nKlytos Blue couldn’t handle the tension. “I—I would be happy to—”\n“Are you feeling unwell, Andross? Too feeble for a prayer?” the White\nasked.\nGavin saw where that was going. Implied weakness, implied unfitness to\nremain on the Spectrum. It was unusually blunt for the White, who\npreferred a gentler hand. But she also didn’t suffer rudeness.\nAndross cocked his head, as if admitting a point scored by his opponent.\n“Of course not,” he rasped. “My voice is no longer a thing of beauty. The\nravages of many years in Orholam’s service. I thought perhaps the\nmellifluous tones of Tisis Green’s voice might be more uplifting for us all.”\n“Orholam judges the hearts of men, not their voices,” the White said.\n“He hears any prayer lifted to him in humility.”\nSo my father might as well save his breath.\nGavin let his bemusement show on his face. His father, his eyes\nshuttered even beneath his blacked-out spectacles, was literally playing\nblind. Taking on the whole Spectrum, without being able to see anyone’s\nfacial expressions? Balls.\nPerhaps it was handicap enough to help Gavin.\nBut his father’s words actually cast doubt into Gavin’s mind. Why\nwould Andross point to the new Green? Of course she was young and\nbeautiful, and she did have a pretty voice, all things that Andross did\nappreciate, Gavin knew. But by singling her out, Andross suggested that\nTisis was his.\nGavin had assumed she was. But why would Andross need to point it\nout to everyone, unless perhaps she wasn’t? Or wasn’t fully.\nThe tightness around Tisis’s eyes, above her phony smile, told Gavin his\nfather was pushing it. Greens hated to be bound, hated to be controlled.\nCareful, father. I might just pull that jewel away from you. Despite\neverything.\nRelaxing his eyes into sub-red, Gavin looked at each member of the\nSpectrum in turn, doing his best to be subtle about it. In sub-red, the\nnuances of a person’s facial expressions couldn’t be seen: that spectrum of\nlight was too fuzzy for fine details. What he could see was the temperature\nof each person’s skin. It varied from woman to woman, of course,\ndepending on their natural temperature and how close their blood vessels\nwere to the surface of the skin, but if you could establish and remember a\nbaseline for each person—and Gavin had very carefully done that over the\nyears for everyone here except Tisis—you could tell when someone was\nfeeling unusual stress. As their heart pounded faster, even if they were able\nto control more overt signs like swallowing, fidgeting, or clenching their\njaws, they would glow hotter in sub-red.\nOf course, a person could be nervous for dozens of reasons, and their\ntemperature could be affected by any number of factors from drinking a"

With this group, he needed every\nadvantage.\nAndross Guile prayed. “Father of Lights, we humbly beseech you attend\nour supplication.” Andross despised prayer, Gavin knew. He could do what\nhe had to do, of course. He knew all the rituals backward and forward, and\nin front of the common folk was capable of all apparent sincerity. Here,\namong those he could almost consider peers, he had more trouble hiding his\ncontempt. To him, the entire religion was a con, but a con on which all their\npower rested.

May our labors flower in your\nsight, with peace and truth and long-suffering.”\nCrotchety old bastard.\n“Thus be it,” Andross ended.\nThey all made the sign of the four and three. “So may it be,” each\nmurmured.\nThe White looked furious. But the sledge of her gaze had no effect on a\nblind man.\n“Gavin,” she said, “your meeting.” You want to sow the wind? she was\nasking Andross.\nHis father’s hatred of the White and his contempt had pushed her too far.\nPresiding was a huge advantage, enough of one to give Gavin a fighting\nchance. He took a deep breath. “Clearly some things have changed in the\ntime I was gone.” He stared at Tisis Green. “For all of us.”\n“I was rightly appointed to this body—” Tisis said, bristling.\n“Tisis!” the White said. “Gavin is presiding. All Colors will be\nrecognized in due course and heard fully, but we are a collegial body, and\ninterruptions shall not be tolerated.”\n“As you are no doubt aware,” Gavin said, as if the interruption and\ncounterinterruption hadn’t happened, “when last I met with you—that is,\nthose who were present at that time, and those who were not have doubtless\nread the minutes of that meeting pursuant to diligent fulfillment of their\nduties—” That is, if you don’t know what I’m talking about, you’re lazy\nand bad at your job, Tisis. Gavin had no doubt that his father had\nmemorized the minutes from the last meeting. He’d gotten his memory\nfrom the old man, after all.

If anything, he looked perversely\nproud of his son.\nWhich didn’t mean he wouldn’t yank the rug out from under Gavin as\nsoon as the opportunity presented itself.\nFor a moment, Gavin wondered. What if Lunna Green had been\nmurdered, but not by the Order? What if his father had done it?\nNo, that wasn’t Andross Guile’s way. He would bribe a Color, or\nblackmail her, but not murder. On the other hand, it would be vintage\nAndross Guile to have a plan to replace each and every one of them, in case\nthey did break the halo or resign. Andross would be ready. That didn’t mean\nhe would get an ideal candidate in place each time, only that he could steer\nthe nomination. Perhaps that was why Tisis wasn’t fully his.\nIf Andross really was willing to murder a Color, he would have made\nsure that he murdered one whose replacement was fully his. Right?\nOtherwise, why risk murder?\nGavin was taking too long. Take the facts as they are, and work with\nthem. Move forward. Figuring out the past can wait. What advantages did\nhaving Tisis on the council give him?\nThe Spectrum expected Gavin to head straight for the discussion of a\ndeclaration of war. Then they thought he’d ask to be made promachos\nagain. So Gavin said, “In truth, I don’t think the first thing we should\ndiscuss today is the war raging in Tyrea and eastern Atash.”\nKlytos raised his finger again. Gavin motioned for him to speak. “We’ve\nnot established that the troubles in Tyrea and eastern Atash are war, Lord\nPrism,” Klytos said.\nHe was about to go on, but Gavin knuckled his forehead and said, as if\nmystified by Klytos’s stupidity, “Precisely. Which is why I said we wouldn’t\nbe talking about it first. We are a deliberative council; such matters should\nbe discussed, but not necessarily first. Like I just said.”"

She wanted to talk about\nwar, too, immediately. She clearly hoped Gavin would be the last vote she\nneeded. She never had been very good at the arithmetic of these situations.\n“The satrapy of Tyrea was a place of dishonor and war,” Gavin said.\n“Since Satrap Ruy Gonzalo sided with my brother Dazen, his satrapy was\ndoomed. It waged war, and destruction was visited by its sons on others,\nand by others’ sons on it. After the war, Tyrea was stripped of her\nrepresentation on this council and looted—” Seeing Delara’s raised finger,\nGavin amended, “—forced to pay reparations that left her destitute. For\nmany good reasons and a few ill, Tyrea became a husk. Satrap Garadul\ndoomed that husk. He made war on Garriston and the Seven Satrapies and\nthis council thereby, and declared himself king. I fought him in Garriston,\nand I lost. Of course, the good news is that the so-called king was also\nkilled in the last battle.\n“There are many things we need to do today and I apologize for the\nmany hours we’re going to spend here—I’ve arranged for refreshments to\nbe brought up in two hours—but the first item is very simple.” Every one of\nthem hated these meetings, and every one of them except Blue and\nSuperviolet hated the formal order to them that made even the simplest\nresolution take half an hour. By raising the specter of being stuck in the\nmeeting all day, Gavin hoped to make them a little careless. It would\nespecially needle a green. He also did have a history when the White let\nhim preside of tackling whatever business was before them in a logical\nmanner—first agreeing on what everyone could agree on, and then moving\nforward as efficiently as possible while letting everyone have their say.\n“There are people in Tyrea who have now been deprived of their leader\n—people who didn’t care if he called himself satrap or king. They followed\nRask’s father and most of them liked the old man. In the course of a life that\nis rarely touched by politics, most common folk will simply go along with\nwhoever is giving the orders. They had no reason to think Rask Garadul\nwas illegitimate, and no reason to think his successor is, especially if we\nwho divine Orholam’s will say nothing against the new king—as this Color\nPrince will no doubt declare himself. So, before we get to the meat of\ntoday’s proposals, I suggest we draft a simple resolution, condemning King\nRask Garadul for waging war on the Seven Satrapies.” Gavin opened the\nfloor for comments and debate, as if he wanted to get this out of the way.\nHe stared at Tisis. Beautiful girl.\n“It would certainly strike a blow against the legitimacy of this Color\nPrince,” Delara said. The woman had drafted enough red in her life that her\nrage was overpowering. Anything that hurt the Color Prince was something\nshe would vote for.\n“And the man we’re condemning is dead,” Sadah said. “So we wouldn’t\nbe further alienating a man with whom we might need to make peace in the"

If we’re able to settle things down in eastern Atash with this\nman, it would put us in a better negotiating position. We would visibly have\nto move farther to meet him in the middle, making the halfway point\neffectively closer to our side of things.” Ah, Sadah, seeing political\nproblems as if they were points to be plotted on a graph. Orholam love her,\nthe fool.\n“No, no, no,” Klytos Blue said. “I see what you’re doing here, Lord\nPrism.”\nGavin lifted an eyebrow, like, What is this moron doing? “Yes, I’m\ntrying to weaken a rebellion before it sweeps up half the lands in the Seven\nSatrapies,” he said.\n“Which is a noble goal that I share,” Klytos said. He glanced over at\nAndross, but without eyes, Andross couldn’t give him subtle cues of\nwhether Klytos was on the tack Andross wanted him to take. “But even if\nthe man called himself a king, I think that gives him too much prestige.”\n“It is what he called himself,” Jia Tolver said impatiently.\n“We needn’t give him that moral high ground; he was rebel, nothing\nmore,” Klytos said. In sub-red, he was clearly warmer than before. But\nKlytos always got nervous when he spoke, even in front of a group this\nsmall.\n“What would you prefer, then?” Gavin said. “Illegitimate king, so-called\nking? Illegitimate satrap?”\n“Clearly,” Sadah Superviolet said, scratching at one psoriatic arm,\n“declaring oneself to be a rebel would vacate one’s legitimacy, thus\n‘illegitimate satrap’ would be an accurate descriptor.” She clearly intended\nthis as an olive branch to Klytos Blue.\nGavin turned his hands palm up toward Klytos, as if surrendering the\nissue to him. “Very well, we can back up further. Would you like to dictate\nthe document, Klytos?” Gavin asked.\nKlytos hated public speaking. As the Blue, he felt that he should get all\nthe technicalities exactly right on the first try—and he never did. “No,\nplease, go ahead,” he said, as if he were being polite.\nGavin turned to the chief scribe in the room. “By order of the Color\nSpectrum, with the full imprimatur of the Prism, blessed by Orholam’s\nradiance, etcetera.”\nThe woman scribbled in a few lines, skipping space to fill in the official\nlines.\n“I must confess,” Gavin said to the Spectrum as she scribbled, “I’m\ndisappointed something so simple wasn’t done during my absence. Surely\nsuch a condemnation would seem pro forma—never mind. Please interject\nif you have any suggestions.”\nThere was still some niggling done over the word “war.” Gavin and\nDelara championed it, but eventually it was stricken in favor of a\ncondemnation of “visiting violence upon the innocent peoples of the Seven\nSatrapies” and the illegitimate Satrap Garadul condemned, though the word"

Gavin grimaced briefly, as if this were a setback,\nbut not a huge one. It was a brief document, and he took care not to feign\ntoo much boredom.\nThe “war” bit was the canard. Let them think that he was angling subtly\ntoward declaring war later in the meeting. But don’t overplay your hand.\nAs soon as the scribe finished, Gavin signed the document and sent it\naround the table for signatures.\n“Now,” Gavin said, not waiting for the signatures, not giving them any\nweight. “The urgent matter. The reason we’ve come here today: refugees,\nand war. The fact of the matter is, I do have some personal investment in\nthis issue. I’ll put that on the table. I failed to stop Garadul, and Garriston\nwas lost because of that. I went to fight—perhaps rashly—without the full\nweight of the Spectrum behind me, and I lost. In losing, I lost face, and\nsome of the people for whom I was fighting lost faith in the Chromeria.\nObviously, the former isn’t a problem for this body, but the latter is. I feel a\nresponsibility for the people who have fled. I would like to see this council\nmake some efforts to provide for them. So, again, easy issues first: I’d like\nto draft another resolution that our satrapies send food, clothing, and\nsupplies to those who’ve been displaced.”\nHe recognized Delara. “And arms!” she said. “Those refugees will join\nthe fight—at least some of them will—against the Color Prince.”\n“I agree with you,” Gavin said. “But I would suggest we put the more\ncontentious issues into a separate resolution, so that we can do the sane and\nhumane thing in providing for those who’ve been attacked by the late Rask\nGaradul as soon as possible. Will the Spectrum agree to address these issues\nseparately?”\n“Let’s agree to what’s immediately obvious to all of us,” Arys Sub-red\nsaid. “These refugees are doubtless starving. We can agree that we must\nsend them help. Later we can argue about exactly how much of a share of\nthat burden each of us should send.” Ah, the brass tacks. Arys was\nruthlessly practical, even in her charity. Gavin liked that about her.\nThey agreed by acclaim to consider the issues separately. The first\nresolution had made it halfway around the room. Gavin had passed it to\nKlytos, who’d signed it. The White had passed it on. Because she only\nvoted in the case of ties, she never signed any resolution until at least a\nmajority had. Delara signed it and passed it on to Sadah Superviolet. She\npaused, and Gavin couldn’t tell if it was because she was thinking about the\nsecond resolution, or if she had some sudden qualm about the first.\nSadah Superviolet stared at Gavin. She didn’t say anything, but she\nhanded on the resolution without signing it. Arys did, Delara did, and she\nslid it to Tisis. Tisis gave one more glance to Andross, got nothing, and\nsigned it."

Do you know what you can do to\nan enemy but not to a friend? Stab her in the back.\nCarver Black slid the paper over in front of Andross. Carver had a voice\non the Spectrum, but no vote. Andross whispered to Grinwoody, who\nresponded. Andross asked him another question in a whisper.\nGavin narrowed his eyes to sub-red. And instantly, he saw his father\ngetting hotter, though the man’s expression didn’t alter in any other\nperceptible way.\nAndross started laughing suddenly, and signed his name. Given his\nblindness, his signature was only in approximately the right place.\nThe discussion stopped instantly. It was rare to hear Andross Guile\nlaugh.\nAndross turned to Tisis. “Do you know what you’ve done, girl?”\n“What?” she asked, suddenly worried.\nGavin leaned over and quickly took the parchment from in front of his\nfather and cocked an eyebrow at Sadah. “Will you make it unanimous?”\nGavin asked.\n“Of course,” she said. It was a moot point now. She signed it, handed it\nto the White, who sighed, and signed.\n“What?” Tisis asked, more insistent.\n“Why don’t you explain, son?” Andross Guile suggested.\nThe head scribe brought the resolution to Gavin, who brought his stick\nof official sealing wax up to his finger, drafted sub-red directly to it, and\npressed his seal on the document, making it official. “Of course, father,”\nGavin said. He handed the document to the head scribe, who handed it off\nto a secretary who would enter it in the annals and publish it.\nWhen the door closed behind the man, Gavin said, “The fact is, we are\nat war. None of us wants this. I don’t want it. You don’t want to admit it\nbecause you’re afraid I’ll press you to declare me promachos again. I\nunderstand that fear. Surrendering power is terrifying, though Orholam\nknows I’ve not given you any reason to distrust me. Tyrea is gone. I\nsuppose that’s just as well. We can fight about what to do next. We can fight\nabout how we fight. But while we bicker, the people who fled Garriston\nhave lost everything. I’m sure you know by now that they’ve found refuge\nupon Seers Island, and I will report on that fully later today, but winter is\nupon us. There’s no time for them to plant a harvest. If we don’t provide for\nthem, they’ll die. We brought this on them, and even if you reject that, they\nare still the subjects of the Seven Satrapies. It is our duty.”\n“The point being…” Andross growled.\n“The point, dear father, dear friends, is that I won’t stand for these\npeople to suffer any more than absolutely necessary to make their new\nlives.

In the resolution we just signed unanimously, this council has\ndeclared Satrap Garadul’s satrapy illegitimate. Rask Garadul was installed\nlegitimately, was corresponded with as a legitimate satrap for a time. If he\nbecame illegitimate, but not through his personal treason, it is because his\nsatrapy itself is illegitimate. Which is a simple acknowledgment of truth.\nTyrea has not been a real satrapy in sixteen years. It had caretakers in its\nformer capital, and its seat on this council was seized by another satrapy. So\nthis is as it should be. However, a satrapy can only be dissolved by a\nsupermajority vote of this council. We have so voted.”\n“That’s a lot of interpretation you’re layering onto a simple document,”\nthe White said. She didn’t, Gavin thought, necessarily disagree with him,\nbut she didn’t like at all how he’d done it.\n“Yes. But it is the Prism’s prerogative to define satrapies, and I have\nalready done so. I settled the refugees of Garriston onto Seers Island—a\nplace where they will not be flooding your cities with their destitute tens of\nthousands, for which I hope all your satraps thank you endlessly. And me.\nAnd I declared Seers Island a new satrapy. The new satrap, I’m afraid to\nsay, could only be Corvan Danavis.”\nThey knew he hated Corvan. They knew he’d fought against him, and\nhad lost friends in those fights. That Corvan might be the new satrap was at\nleast one thing that undercut Gavin’s personal power—so they thought.\n“By endorsing that we are indeed still seven satrapies, you’ve endorsed\nmy new creation.”\n“This is an outrage,” Carver Black said.\n“I think we can all agree that what you’ve just tried to do is, is, is\nunacceptable,” Klytos Blue said.\n“Surely he doesn’t have the power to establish new satrapies on his\nown,” Tisis said. “High Lady Pullawr?”\nThe White shrugged. “Look at any history, it will tell you the Prism\nestablished the Seven Satrapies. Of course, things have changed greatly\nsince those times, but it clearly was in the Prism’s purview, of old.”\n“And has never been removed from the Prism’s purview, as you put it,\nHigh Lady,” Gavin said. Of course it hadn’t. There wasn’t anywhere else to\nput another satrapy, and no one would ever agree to splitting their own.\n“Let’s just vote to undo this,” Tisis said.\nSeveral other Colors voiced their approval.\n“I agree,” Gavin said, “but pardon me, I’m still presiding here today, and\nwe’ll still follow the proper procedure. You wish to dissolve Seers Island as\na satrapy?”\n“Yes!” Tisis said.\n“Then you’ll need a supermajority to pass your resolution. As we’ve just\nsaid, dissolving a satrapy requires a supermajority.”\n“Fine.” He could see others looking around the table, sliding the beads.\nWould anyone hold out on this?\nThey brought the resolution.

Several of the Colors looked at Gavin like\nhe was insane. Why would he pull such a thing, and then allow it to be\nrescinded immediately?\nThe White knew. He could see it in the tightness of her face. And\nAndross knew. He was rubbing the bridge of his nose, where his heavy dark\nspectacles had worn lines into his skin.\nTisis, furious, dictated the resolution. Gavin made no objection. When\nthe head scribe brought it to him for his inspection, he nodded and handed\nthe document to Tisis first.\n“And on whose behalf are you signing, Tisis?” Gavin asked.\n“My own,” she said, as if it were a trap.\n“Our service on the Spectrum is never on our own behalf, child,” the\nWhite said. She sounded tired.\nTisis sneered. Unwise. She was mad at Gavin, not the White, and it\nnever paid to sneer at the White. “So be it. I sign on behalf of…” All the\nblood drained out of her face. Her voice dropped to a whisper. She was\nRuthgari and her seat was used for Ruthgar’s benefit, but it was a seat held\nin protectorship. “I sign for Tyrea,” she whispered.\n“There is no satrapy of Tyrea,” Gavin said. “Your position no longer\nexists. As this meeting is a closed meeting of the Spectrum, you’re\nexcused.”\nDead silence fell on the room.\n“You can’t do this,” Tisis said.\n“Not alone. We did it together. You helped.”\nGavin’s Blackguards were at his side, somehow sensitive to the\nimminent threats.\nTisis looked around the table in disbelief.\n“Don’t worry, you’ll be right back,” Klytos said. “We’ll have the vote\nimmediately. It’ll be five minutes.”\nTisis sneered. “You idiot, you think he took it this far without a plan?”\nShe stood sharply and strode out of the room, slamming the door shut\nbehind her.\n“As the satrap of Seers Island hasn’t yet appointed his Color, the Prism\nholds his vote in trust,” Gavin said. “And believe me, he wouldn’t want me\nto use his vote to disband his satrapy.”\nTwo votes then for him. He gave them a second to finish the arithmetic.\nTisis was gone. They needed a supermajority of five, so Gavin only needed\nfour to stop them. No tie was possible, so the White couldn’t vote. The\nBlack could never vote. They knew Delara would vote with him because\nshe needed his help on the war. Jia Tolver always voted with him. Four.\nAnd that was if all the others broke Andross Guile’s way.\n“Is there anyone who wishes to call the vote?” Gavin asked. Daring\nthem. Supremely self-confident.\n“I do,” Klytos said immediately, finding his courage somewhere.\n“Is there a second?”\n“Raka,” Andross Guile said to Klytos. It was a heavy insult. “You want\nto put a loss in the records and establish precedent?”\nKlytos paled, then stared around the room, looking for allies.

I want to say one thing,” he\nsaid as the Colors were scooting their seats back, getting ready to leave.\n“You did this. It didn’t have to be this way. If you’d listened to me, Tyrea\nwould still exist, and the Color Prince wouldn’t be rampaging across Atash.\nIf you’d sent a bare thousand soldiers or a hundred drafters, we could have\ndefeated King Garadul. But you, you sent a delegation to study the\nproblem.”\n“Peace should be maintained at almost any cost,” Klytos interrupted.\n“As the blessed Adraea Coran—”\n“War is a horror, yes. I know. I know. And pacifism, which you claim to\nvalue so highly? Pacifism is a virtue indistinguishable from cowardice.” He\nsneered. “This war could have been ended before it began in half a dozen\nways. If you’d taken your boot off the throat of Tyrea one second before it\ngot strong enough to throw you off, this wouldn’t have happened. I tell you\nthis, if you won’t do what’s right, I will. Things are going to change around\nhere.”\nAndross Guile yawned.\n“Starting with this,” Gavin snapped. “Father, you’ve treated Kip like a\nbastard. He’s not. His mother was a free woman that I elevated to a ladyship\nduring the war. As promachos, that was my right. We married in secret\nbecause I was young and I was afraid of what you would say. But we did\nmarry. That’s why I’ve never married since. She’s dead now, but she\ndeserves this of me: Kip is my son, not a bastard, a full son. That you’ve\ncast aspersions on this, that you’ve doubted my own word is, I’m afraid,\nfurther evidence of your advancing senility. You’ll join the Freeing this\nyear, my son. If you don’t feel you can hold out for another eight months I\nwill be at your disposal for a more private ceremony sooner.”\nNo one moved. No one even breathed. A small, detached part of Gavin\nmarveled. He could dissolve an entire satrapy and unseat one of the Colors,\nand they were perturbed—but see him cross his father and they were\nflabbergasted.\n“Senility?” Barely more than a whisper. Dangerously amused.\nAnd now we find out how far gone to red he is.\nBut Andross Guile was as cold as an old red could be. He saw the trap.\nIf he screamed, if he lost his temper, he’d be making Gavin’s case.\n“If that is what my Lord Prism believes, I shall of course go to the\nFreeing at the time you appoint.

She held him by the force of her\npersonality, let her question hang in the air, demanding an answer.\n“I lied and cheated and manipulated, and I won. And I did it all for good\nreasons.

Karris paused, comb in hand. “What’s going\non?”\nSamite sat heavily on the edge of Karris’s bed. “K, you know how the\nlords and ladies of the great houses are always trying to get to us\nBlackguards and make us spies or deserters?”\n“I—What does that have to do with anything?”\n“One of them got to me. Years ago.”\n“What?! Sami, stop! What are you doing?”\n“What I should have done a long time ago.” Samite’s face was grim but\nstubborn. She sat with her elbows on her thighs, hands clasped across each\nother.\n“Who?” Karris barely breathed the word.\n“Lady Felia Guile.”\n“Lady Guile subverted you?” Karris asked.

Had thought for years that the woman would be her mother-in-law, and\nthe closest thing to a mother Karris would ever know. “How’d she—No,\nnever mind. I don’t need to know. Sami, she’s gone. You don’t need to do\nthis.”\n“It was nothing untoward. Two of my brothers were captured by Ilytian\npirates and made galley slaves. My family didn’t even know where to start\nlooking, much less how they’d afford a ransom. I went to her. She had\npeople track them down, and ransomed them herself. She brought them here\nso I could see they were well. She nursed them back to full health, and paid\nfor their passage home. I could never have paid her back; I mean, I used my\nbig Blackguard payout to buy my family a store and a farm. I offered, and\nshe refused. She knew it would ruin my family. She said nothing about it\nfor months, and when she asked me for information later, there was no way\nI could refuse her.”\nA velvet leash, held only by Samite’s sense of honor, of debt. Yes, that\nwas Lady Guile’s style. She’d been a gentle Orange, but an Orange\nnonetheless.\nSamite continued, her voice a dull monotone, as if marching to her own\ndeath. “She said she was merely trying to protect her son, and I believed\nher. He’s the Prism, so I figured we were sharing the same goal. It wasn’t\nreally a betrayal, right? I knew better in my heart, which is why I’m telling\nyou now. But I can’t bear to tell Commander Ironfist. I can’t bear to see the\ndisappointment in his eyes. Regardless, the last duty she entrusted to me\nwas this: she said that after she died, I was to give you this note.”\nSamite handed Karris a small note on Lady Guile’s stationery.\n“I don’t blame her, you know,” Samite said. “She might have destroyed\nme, but it wasn’t about me. It wasn’t even about protecting her family. She\ndid what she did for the Seven Satrapies. Sometimes, sacrifices must be\nmade, and it’s usually us small folk who pay, and we don’t always get to\nknow why. When I was young, I hated that, but I’ve made my peace. It’s the\nway of the world.” She cleared her throat again and stood. “I’ll, uh, I’ll wait\nfor you outside.”\n“Dammit, Sami, why couldn’t you have just left the note on my bed?”\n“The secrets were eating me up inside. I can’t live like that, Karris. Not\nanymore.”\nKarris rubbed her temples, trying to collect herself as Samite left. The\nBlackguard couldn’t afford to lose a woman as levelheaded as Samite, not\neven normally, and definitely not now, not after they’d lost so many at\nGarriston. She opened the letter.\nIn Lady Guile’s beautifully practiced hand, it read, “Dazen loves you,\nKarris. He’s always loved you.

        "text": "Karris. He’s always loved you. If you’ve confronted him with the truth\nalready, please take the time to ask him what really happened at your\nfamily’s estate. I know you don’t want to hear this, but a comforting lie has\nbeen poisoning your whole life, and that lie is this: that your brothers were\ninnocent in the tragedy that destroyed your family. They weren’t.”\nKarris felt like she’d been punched in the stomach. She was breathing\nfast and shallow, holding on to read it all. Lady Guile was not only\nadmitting that Gavin wasn’t Gavin, she was going from that point to tell\nKarris things Karris didn’t know. And maybe didn’t want to know.\n“Your maid Galaea betrayed your elopement to your brothers. They laid\na trap at the estate, and tricked Dazen into coming inside. They had chained\nall the doors shut and only had red light sources, knowing him not to be a\nred drafter. He alone got out, Karris. And perhaps he set the fires, but he\ndidn’t chain the doors. I don’t wish to speak ill of the dead, Karris, but the\nblood spilled that night isn’t on my Dazen’s head.\n“Of course, there was no easy way to let you know what really\nhappened. I had several people over the years try to introduce the topic to\nyou obliquely. You rebuffed any discussion. Please pardon my clumsy\nattempts to make peace.\n“My dear child, Dazen thought you’d fallen in love with Gavin and that\nwas why you’d become betrothed to him. He thought you could never\nforgive him for what you thought he’d done. After Sundered Rock, I urged\nhim to marry you quickly before Andross could interfere. He refused,\nKarris. He said he could kill his own brother, and he could lie to all the\nworld, but the one thing he would never do was take a woman to bed who\nloved his brother. He couldn’t lie to you. Silly fool, he broke his betrothal to\nyou because he loved you.”\nKarris wanted to be sick. She couldn’t stop reading.\n“And he loves you still, Karris. Believe me, I eventually gave up hope\nand urged him to marry other women, but he could never get you out of his\nheart. Please forgive him, child, and please forgive me, too. By putting\nthese truths in writing, I’ve delivered our family into your hands. You can\ndestroy Dazen if you so desire, and this will be proof. I would trust no one\nelse with such power over my son, but I see no other way. I wish only that\nI’d had the opportunity to say this all to you myself, and that I had done\nbetter at making peace between you, that I might see my grandchildren\nbefore I died. May Orholam’s light shine on you, Karris. Sincerely, Felia\nGuile.”\nKarris felt numb. She read the letter again, and wondered at herself.\nHow had she believed such preposterous lies in the first place? On the night\nthey were to elope, Dazen had sneaked around her family’s estate and\nchained every door shut and then set the place afire? Or he’d arrived with a\ndozen men to do the same task—men who had never been found or"

Or he’d arrived with a\ndozen men to do the same task—men who had never been found or\nmentioned again, after Gavin got the armies marching after his brother?\nNo, this made much more sense. Why else had her father insisted on\ngetting Karris out of the city that very night? Because he knew about the\ntrap his sons had planned, perhaps that he had helped them plan.\nAnd then when it went bad, her father had gladly covered up his sons’\nmurderous guilt in the deaths of everyone at the estate, and had done so\nwith Andross Guile’s complicity, because it rallied the other noble families\naround Andross’s favored son Gavin. It had been a conspiracy, just not the\none Karris had always thought.\nThe drums of war had started pounding, and Karris, young and weak,\nhad simply believed that her elders must know things she didn’t. Things\nthat made the war inevitable, that made Dazen’s guilt indisputable.\nSince then, Karris had always struggled to bring together the two Gavins\nshe’d known: the one who’d been betrothed to her but then used her cruelly\nand cast her off like she was garbage, and the later one who broke their\nbetrothal and her heart but then treated her kindly. The inexplicability was\nwhat had twisted her into knots: if she’d known Gavin was a cruel cad, she\ncould have written off her infatuation as the stupidity of a young girl\ndeluded by a man’s good looks and charm and power. It was the parts of his\ncharacter that seemed totally contradictory that kept her in limbo.\nAnd now, instead of the hard revelations prompting gales of tears at\nyears lost and lies believed, Karris felt relieved. At peace.\nShe took each page of the letter and held it over a candle. Each burned\nin a flash.\nKarris grinned at that. Fire paper. Lady Guile might have trusted her, but\nthat didn’t mean she wanted the letter to be hard to destroy.\nDazen loved her. Dazen had always loved her. And he was holding\nterrible secrets. Alone. His respect for her, his love for her, had made him\nkeep her nearby. It had made a thousand hard tasks harder for him. If he’d\nwanted, he could have had her cast out of the Blackguard easily. He could\nhave had her imprisoned. He had never taken the easy way out, not where\nshe was concerned.\nShe stood, feeling lighter than she had in sixteen years, and walked to\nthe door. Samite was standing there, waiting for her. She had her hands\nbehind her back, as if hiding something.\nSamite said, “Lady Guile said that after you read that note, you’d have\nneed of some serious firepower, one way or the other.” She brought her\nhands out from behind her back. In one hand was a large old pistol. In the\nother was a painfully beautiful lace chemise and a matching corset with\nshort stays that would cost a Blackguard a year’s wages. “So which is it\ngoing to be?”\nKarris stared openmouthed. Lady Guile! Scandalous! And Sami was\nholding that up in the middle of the barracks, for Orholam’s sake! “Who’s\non Prism duty tonight?”\n“Think it’s some of the new boys.”"

She grinned.\n“Karris, what are you…” Samite said.\n“Are you just going to stand there, or are you going to help me with my\nhair?”\nChapter 78\nMarissia’s brief, whispered report had been terrifying. The old familiar\npanic tightened Gavin’s chest. First had been news from all over the\nsatrapies: twelve sea demons, swimming together in three precise ranks of\nfour, circling all of Abornea five times before disappearing. A sheet of ice\ncovering all of Crater Lake by Kelfing, though it was too warm. Herds of\nwild goats a thousand strong, standing all in precise rows. Poets struck\ndumb. Musicians writing a hundred pages of notation in a day, forgetting to\neat or drink or sleep until they fell unconscious. Galley slaves rowing until\nthey died, afraid of falling out of tempo. Captains plotting out constellations\ninstead of piloting, running onto rocks. Mothers engaged in menial tasks\nabandoning their mewling infants until the tasks were complete.\nThere was a certain irony to order going out of control, but it wasn’t one\nthe dead would appreciate. And that wasn’t the worst.\nThe alarm on the blue hadn’t gone off. She hadn’t known that Dazen had\nbroken out. When was the last time Gavin had checked that mechanism? A\nyear? A year and a half?\nIn the third year of Dazen’s imprisonment, hoping it would alleviate his\nterrible nightmares, Gavin had built in fail-safes. He thought. If Dazen\nbroke into any prison, that very action was supposed to activate a glowing\nwarning at the top of the chute: the alarm.\nEither Marissia had been turned—no, the shock on her face had been\nreal—or Gavin’s mechanism had failed.\nIf the chutes hadn’t switched over, Dazen would have starved to death\nby now. Gavin had made it so that if Dazen tried to throw luxin up the\nchute, it would switch it over as well—but if one mechanism had failed,\nothers might have, too. Dammit. He hadn’t made them to last forever. Luxin\ndecayed, even in darkness, and he’d crafted almost every part of the prisons\nfrom luxin.\nIf he’s dead, I’d have felt it, wouldn’t I? I knew something was wrong\nwhen Sevastian died. Surely…\nThe lift shuddered to a stop, just a couple floors down. Not many people\nhad the keys to stop the Prism’s lift.\nIt was Grinwoody, giving his thin, unpleasant smirk, happy to interrupt.\nHe extended a hand silently. Gavin took the note from the slave. He already\nknew what it was going to say.\n“Son, come to my chambers. This is not a request.”\nPretty much as he guessed.\nFirst, it was Kip and Samite in his room, keeping him from checking the\nchute’s alarm immediately. Then it was the “emergency meeting.” Now this.\nBut there was nothing for it. If Dazen had escaped, he was long gone by\nnow. If he’d been starved, he was dead by now. Orholam have mercy, this"

Orholam have mercy, this\nput the wights’ talk about Dazen Guile coming to save them in a different\nlight, didn’t it?\nThey knew. They’d been working to free him all along.\nPeace, Gavin. Patience. If it’s done, it’s done. If not, don’t tip off the\nmost cunning man in the world by acting strangely. He went with\nGrinwoody. There was nothing to be gained by putting it off. He wouldn’t\nbe any more ready to face off with the tyrant later, and time wasn’t going to\nmake Andross Guile’s anger cool. Indeed, getting to him now, when he was\nstill fresh in his fury and hadn’t had time to plan his vengeance, might be\nbest.\nGavin made his way into the dark room. The air was oppressive, hot. He\nhated it in here. Even illuminated with his superviolet lantern, there was a\ndarkness here that clung to the bones and weakened the will.\n“Gavin,” Andross Guile said. His voice was level, gravelly.\n“Father.” He mustered what respect he could.\n“You stabbed me in the back in there.” Andross Guile’s face was\ncovered, of course, but his tone was almost bemused. He relished this,\nGavin realized. There was nothing left to the old man now except proving\nhis mastery, and there was no game that could compare to Gavin\nchallenging him.\nAndross was also certain that he would win, which frightened Gavin.\n“I did what you taught me, father.”\n“Stuck up for some wandering wretches from Tyrea?”\n“Won. I won.”\nThat earned some silence.\n“So you get your own satrap. By itself, worthless. This new Tyrea may\nnot even survive. So you get a vote on the Spectrum you can count on for a\ncouple years. No subtlety, though. If you want to own Colors, there are\nbetter ways. Why did you defy me?”\n“Funny,” Gavin said. “That was exactly my question for you. Why\noppose me, father? What do you care if we fight or not? It’s not like\nanyone’s going to ask you to take the field. What do you care even if I\nbecome promachos again? What could be better for our family?”\n“You forget who asks the questions here,” Andross snapped.\nGavin sat in one of the old armchairs. Once regal, it was now shabby.\n“So you’ve been playing Nine Kings with Kip? How good is he?” It was a\npetty defiance, asking more questions by misdirection when his father had\nlaid down the law. But he thought Andross would find it irresistible. The\nman had nothing but his games now.\nAndross smiled, a rictus bent upward. “After the war, you lost your\nfocus, Gavin. You could have been as good as me. Now you’re running out\nof time, and you’ll never be my equal. I’m sorry I misjudged you.”\nMisjudged me? There’s an understatement. You saggy-drawered\nmonster. Mother took one look at me after Sundered Rock and knew me."

Mother took one look at me after Sundered Rock and knew me.\nYou’ve talked to me a thousand times since, and still don’t know me. You\nnever knew me, you blind old fool. “You don’t know what it does to me to\nconsider that I might not be like you,” Gavin said, tone flat.\n“It’s time for you to marry,” Andross said.\nGavin had thought the old man might have forgotten. He himself nearly\nhad. It was a shot in the gut.\n“I’ll only marry one woman,” Gavin said.\n“I’m only asking you to marry one. You’ve got five years. If you can\ngive me four sons, perhaps one of them will have a spine on which I’ll have\na chance at rebuilding this family.”\n“I have a son,” Gavin said. Kip, who was actually his brother’s son.\nWhat a horrible mess.\n“A bastard.” Andross waved a hand. “He will be pushed aside in due\ntime. Until your true heirs reach majority, Kip will serve in other ways. To\nserve as a focus for other families’ assassination attempts and so forth. But\nKip will never carry this family’s name forward.”\nGavin tented his fingers, sneering, but of course Andross couldn’t see it.\n“What’s your master plan, then?”\nAndross Guile’s lips thinned. He sat across from Gavin. “I was going to\ngive you your choice of a wife. There were three strong contenders from\nfamilies wealthy enough or connected in useful ways, and the girls young\nenough to give you children quickly. Young enough to be… malleable.\nSolicitous.”\n“You mean you could control them after I die.”\n“Of course. You bed a strong-willed woman and she might steal your\nfuture and disappear.” Andross gave a malicious grin.\nGavin froze. From the tone and the smile, the sentence was meant to be\na knife under his armor—under Gavin’s armor—and he had no idea what\nhis father was talking about.\nSay the wrong thing, and he’ll know.\nSo he said nothing, as if stricken. Which he was, if for the wrong\nreasons.\nThe knife. It had something to do with the knife.\n“Are you curious who they were?” Andross asked.\n“Please,” Gavin said lightly. He swallowed.\n“Your little temptress Ana Jorvis, Naftalie Delara, and Eva Golden Briar.\nI was even going to add Liv Danavis, if you’d managed to save Garriston\nwith her father’s help. Of course, now you’ve bound the Danavis clan to us\nforever in another way so it’s a moot point. Regardless,” Andross Guile\nsaid, “now you’ve destroyed that choice for yourself. I’ll give you this, son,\nyou present me with interesting challenges.”\nGrinwoody brought them tea. Gavin picked up his cup. “Father,\nspeaking of moot, all of this is moot. I’m not going to marry—”\n“Tisis Malargos.”\nThe teacup hovered in front of Gavin’s mouth. “Pardon?”\n“She’s nineteen. Not so young she’ll get pregnant if you sneeze at her,\nbut young enough to bear quickly. Pretty, too, or so Grinwoody says. Her"

Her\nolder sister Eirene took over the family’s financial affairs after Dervani\ndidn’t come back from the war. Brilliant merchant, Eirene. She’s built the\nfamily into a financial juggernaut, and the dowry she’s promised for Tisis,\nwhilst enormous, pales in comparison to the wealth Tisis will inherit when\nEirene dies.”\n“What? Why would Tisis inherit from her sister?”\n“Eirene’s a tribadist. And not fond enough of children to get on her back\nfor any man. Smart enough, though, to carry on flirtations with many men\nin order to secure better business deals for herself, and, she thinks, to keep\nus in line if her sister does marry you. In this, she’s partly correct: there will\nbe no divorce or flagrant affairs while you are married to Tisis, Gavin.”\n“What?!” Gavin still hadn’t processed the first part. His father wanted\nhim to marry Tisis? She was the woman who’d sabotaged Kip’s testing. She\nwas the woman Gavin had just thrown out of the Spectrum.\nOrholam have mercy. Gavin’s mother had confessed to ordering Dervani\nmurdered—because he knew Dazen’s secret. And now his father wanted\nhim to marry a woman whose father Felia Guile had murdered.\n“You see the beauty of it? Eirene holds her inheritance against us, and\nwe hold Kip against her. If she leaves our family to inherit everything, we\ndisown Kip. It’s not the only card we have to play, but it is always a good\nidea to make your opponent pay you to sacrifice a card you didn’t want to\nplay anyway.”\nIn purely tactical terms, Gavin saw the appeal—not to his family, but to\nhimself. Tisis was a beautiful woman, who might still be turned into a\nfriend rather than the enemy he’d thought he’d just made. And by doing\nthis, he’d keep his father from destroying Kip. At least he would buy Kip\ntime. Gavin’s own time was drawing to a close, and there would be no one\nto protect Kip when he was gone—and if Gavin died before Andross did,\nKip would need that protection. But—\n“Father, why don’t you turn your mind to helping me for once? The only\nwoman I’ll consent to marry is Karris White Oak.”\nAndross Guile snorted. “And she brings what to this family? A few\nbarren estates? Her family alliances allowed to wither while she plays\nBlackguard? Don’t be ridiculous.”\nGavin took a sip of his tea. When his nerves steadied, very calmly, very\nquietly, he said, “It’s her or it’s no one.”\n“You were always my favorite son, Gavin. Thought I saw myself in you.\nThought I saw will in you. Perhaps I shouldn’t complain too bitterly that\nyou turn it against me now, though you have good reasons not to. You\nremember what we did to make you Prism. You owe everything you are to\nme, son. So now either you do exactly what I tell you or the cost will be\nmore swift and grievous than you can imagine.”\nGavin got up without saying a word."

He sounded weak.\n“Gavin!”\nChapter 79\n“Good evening,” Gavin greeted the Blackguards at the door to his rooms.\nHe didn’t recognize either man. They were young, maybe eighteen. They\nlooked like children—and when eighteen-year-old men look like children to\nyou, it’s a sure sign that you’re getting old.\nWhat did you do when you were eighteen, Gavin?\nToo much. But that was a distraction. Here were two Blackguards he\ndidn’t know, despite knowing all the Blackguards. Two Blackguards, alone\nwith him. This was how assassination attempts began. He’d been warned.\nThe men saluted him. “Lord Prism.”\n“What’re your names?” Gavin asked.\n“Gill and Gavin Greyling, sir,” the elder said.\nBrothers, of course. He should have picked it up. “Gavin?” he asked the\nyounger.\nThe boy beamed. “Yes, sir, named after—”\n“After our mother saw that he was a bit ill-favored, my lord,” Gill said\ndryly.\n“Hey!” Gavin Greyling said.\nGavin laughed. Of the two, Gavin was definitely the more handsome.\nThe younger Greyling looked relieved that the Prism had laughed. “I’m\nsorry my brother is horrifying, my lord. It is a real honor to serve you. A\nlifelong dream, my lord.”\n“An honor to have you in my service, Gavin, and even you, Gill. You\ntwo just raised?” A Blackguard, named after him. Good Orholam. He was\ngetting old. And going blind to prove it. His chest tightened. He hadn’t had\nthe heart to go straight down to the back entrance to the tunnels after\nmeeting with his father. He’d told himself that this would allow him to\ncheck the alarm first from his room. That it would give him warning if he’d\nbeen betrayed.\nReally, he just didn’t have the strength to go down there right now and\nface his brother—alive or dead.\n“Yes, my lord,” Gill said.\n“Doesn’t the commander usually have a veteran accompany the newly\nraised?” Gavin asked.\nGill flinched. “Yes, sir. With the personnel we lost at Garriston, it’s been\nhard to cover all the shifts.”\nGavin looked at each man in turn, widened his eyes momentarily to see\nhow hot each looked. Both were pretty warm, nervous. Of course, with no\nbaseline, and it being the first time they’d talked to him, that told him little.\nBesides, now that he thought about it, he thought he did remember\nseeing these boys train. Gill was quite a hand with stabbing spears, if Gavin\nremembered correctly. And what kind of assassin would risk antagonizing\nthe target by teasing him?

It was late, she might have gone to her bed in the little side room—\nmore a closet, really. But she didn’t answer. Which she wouldn’t, if she’d\nbetrayed him.\nBehind him, Gavin Greyling was closing the doors. “Um, she left about\nhalf an hour ago, sir.” She often worked late into the night when he returned\nfrom trips, giving him the most up-to-date reports the next morning and\narranging the most pressing business on his schedule. And if she was loyal,\nshe’d been doing everything she could to investigate her “failure.” Yes, that\nwas Marissia. That was the heart of the woman, dutifully looking to correct\nany error, even when it meant she’d forget that when he came home, he\nwanted her here. She didn’t have betrayal in her.\n“Ah.” Shit.\n“Is there anything we can do, my lord?” Gavin Greyling asked.\nGavin leveled a bemused gaze on the boy and said, “I have been\ntraveling for the past four months with a woman I find incredibly seductive\nbut whom I can never have. So no, I’m afraid that the duty I have for my\nroom slave to perform is not one I would ask of you.”\nGill started laughing. It took his brother longer.\n“Are you talking about Watch Commander Ka—Ow!” he said as Gill\nslammed the butt of his spear onto his foot.\nGavin Greyling looked at his brother, peeved, and then blanched. “Oh.\nOh. Um. I’m sorry, sir. Would you like one of us to go summon her? Her\nthe room slave, I mean, my lord. Not her the watch commander… Although\nI suppose… Ahem.”\nEven though they were offering, Gavin knew he wasn’t supposed to treat\nthe Blackguard as his fetch-and-carry boys. It would, quite possibly, get\nthese young men into trouble for having volunteered it. No, he’d spent the\ntime talking with them to gain some rapport and to make sure they weren’t\nassassins. He wasn’t going to throw away that rapport just for his\ncomplaining loins.\nBut it was close. He shook his head.\nThe doors closed behind him and he shuffled toward the painting. He\nwas exhausted, and there was a ball of despair swelling in his stomach. He\nlooked at the painting closely, examined the hidden hinge, saw no sign of\ntampering. The frame of the painting needed a new coat of paint, though.\nThe oils on his fingers had worn one edge smooth. He would have to\ndisguise that. He pulled the frame open.\nThe panel under which sat the liquid yellow luxin was undisturbed, inert\nuntil the alarm injected air into it to make it glow faintly. The alarm hadn’t\ngone off.\nHe drafted superviolet and reached deeper, pushed the superviolet into\nthe hellstone panel, felt the brush of the filaments he’d left there, so thin\nthey’d tear at the slightest touch—so thin they’d tell him if anyone had\ntampered with this. He felt the mechanism. It was undisturbed."

        "text": "they’d tear at the slightest touch—so thin they’d tell him if anyone had\ntampered with this. He felt the mechanism. It was undisturbed.\nFor one wild moment, he thought that it was all a mistake. Dazen was\nstill in the blue prison! Nothing had gone wrong! He’d merely panicked\nbecause he’d lost blue. Because he’d had a bad dream about Dazen\nescaping—which he’d been fearing for sixteen years, so that was no\nwonder, in the aftermath of losing blue.\nExcept that the Third Eye had said his brother had broken out of blue,\ntoo.\nBut fortune-tellers are often wrong, right?\nNot her.\nGavin drafted deeper down to the chute. It had moved over. It had\nmoved to green.\nSo Dazen had broken out of blue, but he was still stuck in green. The\nblue alarm had failed, but eventually Dazen had gotten food. He’d been\ngetting blue bread in the green prison, but he hadn’t broken out. Either the\ngreen had made him too wild to think clearly enough or the blue bread\nwhen illuminated by green light had been too spectrally close to give him\nusable luxin. He was in green and he was alive.\nDazen could never be counted out, but it wasn’t a catastrophe. Not yet.\nThe enormous weight didn’t quite lift from Gavin’s shoulders, but it\nshifted to a more comfortable position. This one emergency, at least, could\nwait until the morning. He wasn’t ready to face Dazen, not after this day.\nHe’d rest, and gather his wits, and then face his brother. Tomorrow.\nHe walked to his desk, took the folded shimmercloaks and the deck box,\nand tucked them in a closet. More problems for tomorrow. There were\nalways more problems for tomorrow. He went to his bed, stripping off his\nclothes. He threw them willy-nilly, suddenly peeved. Where was Marissia,\nanyway? What does one have a room slave for, if not for some damned\ncompanionship once in a while? Schedules could wait. He wanted her here.\nHe cursed, feeling peevish and petty.\nTruth was, he was angry at Karris for being so damned intractable. And\nhe missed Marissia, and not only for her admirable bed skills. He didn’t\nwant to sleep alone tonight. He wanted to hold her body, to feel the soft\ncomfort of her curves. To wake and embrace her and then sleep again. He\nwanted to take her in the bath in the morning, and then have her comb his\nhair, anoint him with oils, dress him, and send him off to conquer the world\nagain with a clear head.\nInstead, she was off doing whatever it was she did when she wasn’t\nserving him.\nThat was ungracious, unfair. Most of the time that Marissia spent away\nfrom this room was to serve him. He crawled under the covers and thought\ndark thoughts for a few more seconds, then surrendered to sleep.\nIn the middle of the night, Gavin must have gotten hot and thrown the\ncovers off, because he felt cold. Foggy-headed, he reached a hand to pull\nthe blankets back on him, but then he felt the sweep of long hair over his\nthigh, and then a kiss. She took his hands and tucked them firmly at his\nsides, telling him not to interfere."

She took his hands and tucked them firmly at his\nsides, telling him not to interfere.\nOh, Marissia, if a man could fall in love with a slave…\nMarissia pleasured him like she did everything: efficiently and well.\nShe’d done this before when he’d come back from trips and she’d been out\nwhen he got back, or even just when she’d sensed that he was hungry for\nthe pleasures of the flesh. She would wake him rapidly and pleasantly, and\nthen ride him to a quick climax. It was like providing a meal on the march:\nshe satisfied his hunger as quickly as possible, and interfered as little as\npossible with the business at hand. In this case, his sleep. Funny woman,\nbut Gavin wouldn’t trade her for the world.\nHaving roused him with admirable dispatch, Marissia crawled up\nGavin’s body. He reached for her breasts, but she grabbed his hands and\npushed them above his head. Marissia’s breasts got so tender some months\nthat she didn’t like Gavin to even touch them. She’d allow it if he insisted,\nof course—she served for his pleasure—but Gavin didn’t want to insist\ntonight. Not when she was being so solicitous.\nShe quietly moaned as she lowered herself onto him a little at a time,\nand the pleasure of it almost blotted out all thought for Gavin, but he\nopened his eyes. Marissia rarely moaned. The room was dark. Gavin could\nof course change that, but pleasure blotted out will. It had been so long.\nWhen she settled fully on him, though, even without hands, without\nsight, he knew this wasn’t Marissia. As he came out of his stupor, it became\nmore and more obvious. He knew Marissia’s body, how she moved, the\nsmell of her arousal and the smell of her perfume, and this was not—\nThat perfume. As his succubus began to rock her hips rhythmically,\nGavin was entranced by the competing soporifics of pleasure and memory.\nKarris almost never wore perfume. Only one day a year, and then only\nwhen she couldn’t get out of it. She only wore perfume to the Luxlords’\nBall. This perfume.\nOrholam have mercy. That was how she’d gotten into his room. The\nBlackguards knew they weren’t supposed to allow anyone in, but they\nwouldn’t stop Karris. Especially not after Gavin had told them that… Ooh.\nThe very thought that it was Karris brought Gavin fully awake, inflamed\nhim. His succubus was a little awkward, like she didn’t really know what\nshe was doing. Karris had only had two lovers that he’d heard about, and\nneither of them for long. She hadn’t had all that much practice. Still, in\nmost things she was more coordinated than this.\nGavin brought his hands to the softness of her hips to help guide her.\nKarris! After sixteen—\nSoft? Karris’s hips? A woman could be incredibly fit and still carry a\nlittle softness on her hips, of course, but…\nShe was moaning louder now, and her vocalizations almost covered the\nsound of voices outside Gavin’s door.

He stopped guiding her, but she only\nground against him harder.\nThe door opened and a woman bearing a lantern walked in.\n“Watch Captain,” one of the Greylings protested, “I really think you—”\nThe light from the lantern showed Karris standing at the foot of Gavin’s\nbed. The same light threw his succubus into shadow. Nor did the woman\natop Gavin stop, grinding lascivious hips against him for several long,\ndeliberate seconds after she must have become aware there were others in\nthe room.\nKarris flung the lever that opened the brightwater panels on the walls,\nflooding the room with light.\nFor one second, Gavin saw nothing as the light blinded him. Then, as his\neyes adjusted, the young woman atop him was illuminated fully: Ana\nJorvis, the student from the superviolets’ class. Ana, the little temptress\nwho’d tried to sneak into his bed before.\n“You mind?” Ana demanded, looking over her shoulder. She was\nunashamed of her nudity before both Karris and the young Blackguards.\nUnabashed at being interrupted in coitus. Even proud. Defiant. Haughty.\nBut Gavin had no thought for her. He was staring at Karris, who looked\nsuddenly dead. Her hair hung around her shoulders, not just loose, but\ncarefully combed and curled. The rouge on her cheeks was the only thing\nthat livened her pallid pallor. Her lips, too, were rouged. Karris never wore\nmakeup. She was wearing a fine cloak that he’d never seen before, and\nwhere it was open as her hand held the lantern, Gavin saw lace.\nA lace chemise. Karris. Midnight. His bed chamber. She had been\nplanning—\n“I said, do you mind? My lord and I are occupied,” Ana said. She took\none of Gavin’s hands from where it sat limp on her hip and pressed it to her\nfull breast. The breast she hadn’t let him touch earlier—lest he realize who\nshe was.\nKarris bolted.\nGavin flung Ana off with a curse and ran after Karris, going right past\nthe aghast Greyling brothers. “Karris!”\nHe heard the sound of glass shattering just as he got into the hall and\nsaw that Karris had dropped her lantern in her haste. Its reservoir smashed\nand oil coated the hallway. Gavin stopped.\nThe still-burning wick tilted slowly, slowly, and before Gavin could\ndraft, the hallway was alight. He smothered the flaring fire in seconds with\ngreat sheets of yellow. When he finally ran through, Karris had already gone\ndown the lift. He hung out over the lift shaft, ignoring the Blackguards\nguarding it.\nShe’d stopped one level down, the Blackguard barracks.\n“My lord!” the Blackguard Samite shouted.\n“Don’t even try to stop—” Gavin snarled.\nShe held her hands up. Peace. She tossed him her cloak to cover himself.\n“Good luck, sir.”\nGavin tied the cloak around his waist and jumped into the lift shaft. He\ndropped down one level.

He swung out of the shaft and stormed toward the\nwomen’s side of the Blackguard barracks. The door was closed.\n“Karris!” he shouted.\nBut as he approached, a dozen Blackguards, most of them only half\ndressed, formed ranks seamlessly in front of the door. They made a wall in\nfront of him.\n“That’s far enough, my lord,” Tremblefist said, gently. He was one of the\nhalf-dressed ones, and even though he wasn’t quite as big as Ironfist, he was\nstill bigger than Gavin. Enormous pectorals, shoulders broad enough to\nclose the Everdark Gates.\n“Out of my way!” Gavin shouted.\nThey said nothing, merely held ranks.\n“Damn you all, you can’t stop me!”\n“Yes we can,” Tremblefist said. “Now please, sir, leave. Leave before\nyou shame your faithful servants any more than you already have. We’ve\nnew men in our company. They can’t understand.”\nGavin screamed in frustration and stormed out.\nThe ride up one floor wasn’t enough to cool his rage. His young\nBlackguards watched him closely, aghast, but said nothing as he strode past\nthem and back into his room.\nAna should have been on her knees, weeping and begging for\nforgiveness. Instead, she stood in artfully meretricious pose that Gavin\nrecognized from a famous sculpture, the Maiden’s Gift. She’d even put on a\nfine silk shift identical to the statue’s: back turned, hair spilling over her\nshoulder, curves in an S, the side of one breast visible. It was so obviously\nstaged that Gavin would have laughed if he weren’t so furious. Instead, it\nstoked the fires hotter.\n“My lord,” she said. “Shall we continue? I’ve so many pleasures yet to\nshare with you.”\nGavin’s self-restraint had one last gasp. He closed his eyes, ground his\nteeth. Finally said, “Do you have any idea… I only—I thought you were\nher!”\n“What?! Her? She’s all muscly and gross. Karris is old enough to be my\nmother. I mean, if you want a sparring partner, I’m sure she’s wonderful,\nbut a lover? Bedding her would be like fucking dust. That old bitch—”\nA sound like an uncaged tiger tore its way out of Gavin’s throat. He hit\nthe lever that dropped all the windows in his room open and was on top of\nAna in an instant.\nThe night was moonlit, clouds being chased by buffeting winds.\n“My lord, what are you doing?!” one of the Blackguards yelled, but\nGavin didn’t even hear him. He grabbed a handful of the girl’s hair, walking\nher backward out into the cold night. “That bitch,” he screamed above the\nhowling wind, “is the woman I love!” With an inhuman roar, he flung Ana\nfrom him. Flung her so hard that she hit the railing of the balcony and\nflipped right over it.\nAnd fell.\nShe didn’t scream. She barely yelped, and Gavin barely heard it over the\nsound of wind."

Maybe someone had saved her?\nA fool’s hope, and Gavin knew it.\nRushing to the edge of his balcony, he looked over.\nOrholam have mercy. Hundreds of feet below, Ana had landed headfirst.\nHer body had crumpled all the wrong ways. From here she looked like a\ngrape popped between your fingers: all the skin gathered and juices\neverywhere.\n“My lord…”\nGavin turned and saw his two young Blackguards. The looks on their\nfaces told him that Ana wasn’t the only person who’d just fallen from\nheaven. He covered his face with his hands. He stepped back inside, and\none of them, wide-eyed, closed the windows. Gavin sat on his bed,\nconscious for the first time of his near nakedness.\n“Go tell who you have to tell,” Gavin said. “I’ll be here.”\nOf course, he lied.\nChapter 80\nWhen the pounding started on the door of the women’s side of the barracks,\nKarris thought it had to be Gavin come back again, but the voice was Watch\nCaptain Blademan’s. “Hey! Why’s this door locked?! I said all hands on,\ndammit! I don’t care if you’re naked or on the shitter, I mean now!”\nKarris threw the door open, instantly alert, tears forgotten. “What is it?”\nshe asked.\nWatch Captain Blademan looked at her, the cloak not covering her\nchemise, not covering her makeup, her perfume, her coiffed hair, her eyes\npuffy from crying. He hesitated only a moment, working through his\nsurprise, then decided that whatever this was, it could wait. “All hands on,\nKarris. You’re needed upstairs immediately. Some girl just took a dive off\nthe Prism’s balcony. She’s dead. We think he threw her.”\nGavin stared at the moon, drafting its feeble light slowly. His plan was\nsimple—to draft a rope and dangle it out the window, making them think\nhe’d escaped.\nBut he couldn’t draft green or blue now. A rope was impossible. He\nleaned on the doorframe, swallowed with difficulty. He’d never had to think\nthis way before. The simplest answer had always been the best. With every\ncolor in his palette, he’d simply had to figure out the best materials for the\njob. Now… now he was like some normal drafter, trying to solve a problem\nwith a limited set of tools. It was a totally different way of thinking. He\nhated it.\nAs he turned the problem over, he grabbed fresh clothes from his closet\nand got dressed. He could, he supposed, draft a yellow chain, but that would\nbeg them to ask why he would choose to draft only yellow, which was\nmuch more difficult and time-consuming. Questions like that could be more\ndeadly than killing a powerful nobleman’s daughter.\nHe pushed that out of his mind.

He threw on the larger\ncloak. He knew the choker had to be important, so he put it on, drew it\nsnug. He hated having things around his neck, and there were cold metal\nridges along the inside that dug into his skin unpleasantly.\nHe stepped in front of a mirror. He was still very much visible. He drew\nthe cloak closed. Still visible. He closed his eyes and imagined being\ninvisible, willed it, desired it, lusted after it, believed it. Cracked an eye.\nStill there.\nA soft knock sounded on the door. Gavin drafted instinctively to defend\nhimself.\nDaggers stabbed into his neck from either side. What felt like a sheet of\nflame shot up and down his body: cheeks hot, scalp aflame, chest burning,\narms burning, legs burning. Then the heat passed, leaving tingling, and the\ntingling turned to sensitivity, like a tooth shy of a cold drink.\nHe looked into the mirror—and saw through himself. His face was\nvisible, and a V of his neck where the cloak wasn’t fully closed. The collar\nhad injected two needles into his neck. Gavin pulled the cloak fully closed,\nand found there were tiny hooks hidden in the fabric to keep the hood\nclosed even over his face. Only his eyes remained. The rest of him was\ntranslucent—not perfectly transparent, but like looking through a dirty\nwindow. In low light, it would be more than acceptable. If he stayed still\nagainst a wall, it would be perfect. But moving fast in good light, he’d be\neasy to spot.\nLouder knocking. “Sir, please let us in!”\nGavin ducked his head, to see if he could hide his eyes under the flap of\nthe hood and thus be functionally invisible. When he did that, he saw\nnothing at all. Blackness so deep it struck a visceral fear into him.\nSo if he fell under piercing scrutiny, he’d have to make himself blind in\norder to be fully invisible. Lovely. Terrifying.\nThe window was already open. Gavin stood against a wall next to the\ndoor.\n“Lord Prism,” Commander Ironfist shouted, “we’ve come to take you to\nthe Spectrum. Please open the door, my lord.”\nThanks for the warning, old friend.\nThe Blackguards opened the door moments later. They had keys, of\ncourse. Ironfist led six men in. “Check the balcony,” Ironfist said.\nGavin snuck through the open door right behind them. The wind gusting\nthrough the open window and the hall made the cloak flutter around his leg.\nBut no one saw anything. He made it into the hall.\nFrom there, instead of heading for the lift, he walked the other way and\nwent to the stairs leading out to the roof. He cracked the door open, dealt\nwith another quick gust of wind, and slipped out quickly.\nIt was still hours before dawn. Gavin sat on a bench out of sight of the\ndoor. He had to see how bad things were before he did anything. But sitting,\nthinking, that was dangerous.\nOrholam have mercy, he’d murdered that stupid girl. He rubbed his face."

He rubbed his face.\nHe wished he felt worse, but it wasn’t his first murder. He’d been murdering\npeople every year in that damned barbaric ritual—hearing their sins and\nstabbing them in the heart. What was one more soul on his tally?\nIf he looked harder at that girl, doubtless he’d find out some pathetic\ntale. Like Ana’s family was on the brink of financial ruin, and she hoped\nthat by seducing him they would be saved. Or that his father had\nblackmailed her into going to Gavin’s bed so he could then blackmail\nGavin. Andross had said that Ana was in the list of contenders for a\nmarriage, hadn’t he? Or… it didn’t matter. What she’d done, why. How\nshe’d gotten past his guards. It might have been a conspiracy; more likely, it\nwas simply miscommunication and inexperience.\nBut Gavin didn’t usually lose control of himself like that. He was steady,\nlogical. For Orholam’s sake, Gavin was the whole man. Was. Had been.\nNo longer.\nHe’d lost blue. That wasn’t merely a magical fact, maybe it was a\npersonal fact as well. He’d lost the cold, hard, passionless practicality of\nblue. There had been no reason to kill the girl, nothing but passion and\nhatred had impelled him to do such a thing. Passion and hatred unbridled by\nreason.\nThe loss of his powers wasn’t only the loss of power; Gavin was\nbecoming less. Less in control, less intelligent, less of a man.\nHe’d thrown a girl off his balcony. What kind of a man did that? He\nhadn’t meant to—but that didn’t matter. He’d done it. And maybe he had\nmeant to do it.\nAnd he’d lost Karris. She’d come to his room, at midnight, dressed to\nmake love. His heart was in his throat. Orholam have mercy. He didn’t\nknow what she’d been doing, why she’d come now when they’d had every\nopportunity for months. But she’d come. Everything would be perfect if\nhe’d done anything differently—had he not charmed his guards and told\nthem he wanted companionship; had he awakened earlier; had he stopped\nan unknown woman before she mounted him, perhaps?\nI saw what I wanted to see, just like I always do. And my self-delusion\ncost me the real thing.\nHe wondered how long it would be before he lost yellow. How long\nbefore he lost the rest. It was another eight months until the Freeing. When\nhe’d found out he’d lost blue, he’d thought he could make it that long. That\nwasn’t going to happen, he knew that now.\nHe thought of his goals.\nLucidonius, were things so bleak for you when the Ur trapped you in\nHass Valley? Did you doubt yourself then? Or were you as willful as the\ntales tell? Were you just a man? You changed the world, but is this what you\nwanted to change it to?\nGavin had murdered his own mother, and she’d thanked him for it.

Huge blooms of algae in the sea, empty spaces, and then\nanother knot, just forming to the southwest. Where was that?\nOrholam. Just outside Ru.

Starvation, privation, and\nconstant war over scarce resources that might disappear completely in the\nvery next year. Nations broken down to tribes and clans. Cities burned.\nLibraries burned.

The trigger on the trap—for surely, surely, there\nmust be a trap—might be at any point in that hellstone tunnel. Until Dazen\nhad a plan, he’d be a fool to go into the tunnel looking for it.\nAnd he’d be a fool to sit too long waiting and planning. Gavin could be\nback at any moment. Coming to visit, coming to gloat. How Dazen wanted\nto smash that monster’s grinning face in!\nHe sat and ate, casting his mind about, searching, searching.\nKnowing it was second best, he got up after a while and stood at the\nmouth of that tunnel to hell, the tunnel to the yellow prison. Very carefully\nand very slowly, he drafted and sealed a long thin stick out of green luxin.\nHe probed the mouth of the tunnel, looking for tripwires concealed in the\ndarkness.\nNo, this was hopeless. If he was paranoid, he’d never get out of here. He\nhad to act boldly, had to take his own fate in his hands and smash through\nGavin’s plans, destroy them. He couldn’t let himself be trapped here. He\nhad to go, now! He had to—\nSlow down, Dazen. That’s the green talking. You’re weak, the luxin has\nmore power over you when you’re exhausted and sick.\nDazen released the green, emptied himself of it completely.\nWithout it, he felt wrung out, unbearably tired. No, the weakness was\ntoo great. If he didn’t take the green again, he’d sleep, and sleeping, he’d\ngive Gavin time to come back—\nBut if he took the green, he’d do something stupid, just as Gavin\nexpected. He’d fall right into the next trap, and that might leave him in a\nworse place than ever before. A yellow prison could well be unbreakable.\nHe’d been lucky in the green. Gavin had made a mistake, letting him get\nblue bread. Dazen couldn’t count on that twice. He needed to make that one\nmistake count.\nHe imagined Gavin coming back down here, grinning that lopsided grin\nat him, taunting—\nWait. Gavin came down here. When Gavin came down here, he had to\ntraverse this geometrical space.\nEven without luxin, Dazen felt a burst of energy, life. Gavin came down\nhere. That meant he had tunnels. He came close enough that he could talk to\nDazen. That meant those tunnels were very, very close.\nIf Dazen could find one of those tunnels, he wouldn’t simply get past the\nyellow prison, he’d break out of all of the prisons. He didn’t have to break\nout of each in turn, he could simply leave."

He didn’t have to break\nout of each in turn, he could simply leave.\nSalvation was that close. His heart leapt. His heart burned within him. It\nwas as if his fever was still burning him.\nNo, this was real joy. It had been so long since he’d felt it, he almost\ndidn’t recognize the giddy, skittish thing. He laughed aloud. Then he started\nmoving around the chamber surrounding the great green egg that had been\nhis prison, knocking on the walls.\nTap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tonk.\nTonk, tonk, tonk. The hollow sound was like a choir singing the Sun Day\nsalutations.\nJust to be sure, just to be careful, Dazen checked the rest of the chamber.\nNothing. This one section, almost four paces long, was the thinnest. He\nlooked for hidden hinges, but he couldn’t find any. Not that he expected\nthem. After the prison was finished, Gavin doubtless would have fully\nsealed the tunnel. No reason to leave a weakness where Dazen might find it.\nGoing back to the green cell was like going back to scoop up his own\nvomit and eat it. But back he went. Shivering with revulsion, he clambered\nthrough the hole he’d made and grabbed the husk of his blue bread.\nHe’d left all of the crust, broken open now to give him the maximum\nsurface from which to draft.\nHe climbed back out of the green cell, but stood in its light. It took him\nanother quarter of an hour to draft enough blue. It was a relief, though,\nwhen it came. The clarity of blue was a boon. He’d lived with blue for\nsixteen years, and he needed it. With the blue slowly filling him, he became\naware once again of how fragile his health was. It had only been months\nsince his fever had passed. The nasty cut across his chest had mostly healed\nin a nasty scar. His body had won the fight against the infection, but that\ndidn’t mean he was up to full strength.\nHe didn’t know how long he had. He needed to blast the wall open, draft\ngreen for the necessary strength, and go as fast and far as he could. Once he\nfound a safe place, he could worry about healing. It was a gamble, and his\nblue self hated gambles, but this was a gamble he had to play or die.\nHe thought of going back to the stone wall to knock again, to double-\ncheck, but he didn’t need to. He’d drafted blue for so long that he could\npractically see lines overlaying his vision that denoted the exact outline of\nthe hollow space. He could envision the probable thickness of the stone. It\nwas granite, and from some class he’d taken as a boy and had thought long\nlost, he remembered how granite broke.\nThat was blue for you, dredging up details from your own mind that you\ncouldn’t believe you remembered. Granite broke in predictable wedges, Xs\nat sixty degrees and one hundred twenty degrees. Of course, the blue\ncouldn’t tell him at what angle those wedges lay to him. So he braced"

Of course, the blue\ncouldn’t tell him at what angle those wedges lay to him. So he braced\nhimself and grasped his right wrist in his left hand. He gathered his will.\nThe first missile would need to be about the size of his thumb or the granite\nmight not crack and show him the appropriate angles.\nHe took a deep breath and gave the short, sharp cry. It tightened\nstomach, chest, and diaphragm, gave tension and a stable firing platform,\nand a small animal boost to the will. Mechanics meets the beast.\nThe blue bullet burst from him and smashed into the wall, in and\nthrough with a small explosion of granite dust and granite shrapnel.\nNo alarm sounded. At least none that he could hear. Dazen strode to the\nwall. It was too dark to see the hole well, but he traced his fingers around it,\nfelt the fractures. Aha, tilted about twelve degrees.\nHis blue-enhanced mind laid the lines out easily, compensated for the\nangles, picked out lines along which it would fracture, and exactly where he\nwould have to shoot the next missiles to make the hole big enough to climb\nthrough.\nTaking his place back far enough that he wouldn’t get hit with the\nshrapnel but would still easily hit his targets, Dazen braced himself, one\nfoot back, turned, both hands up. Each hand would shoot two missiles\nsimultaneously: there and… there.\nHe shouted, and the missiles blasted out from him, hitting the wall in a\nblue explosion as parts of the luxin were torn back into light. Dust filled the\ntunnel, and Dazen choked on it, feeling suddenly empty. He staggered over\nto the green cell and drew in liquid life.\nLooking at the hunks of blue bread at his feet, he had the passing\nthought that he should draft in blue as well, at least some, some thread—he\nate the bread. There’d be plenty more blue where he was going. He needed\nthe strength.\nA tiny part of him protested, but it was little, and weak.\nHe pushed through the dark hole into the dark tunnel. He drafted\nimperfect green into his hand. Green made lousy torches, and even in the\nstate he was in, he knew not to use all of his luxin up just to make it slightly\nbrighter.\nThe tunnel—Gavin’s tunnel—was simple, rough-hewn. It was a\nworkspace, barely wide enough for a man. Not really wide enough for a\nman with a torch, if he didn’t want to risk burning the hell out of himself.\nOf course.\nGavin would have used a luxin torch. Bastard.\nDazen hesitated once inside the tunnel. One way might gently slope up,\nand the other seemed to gently slope down, but he couldn’t be certain. His\ninstinct was to choose the upward direction, but when he thought about it\nrationally, there was no guarantee that simply because this one tiny section\nof tunnel had a slope that the slope continued all the way to the surface.\nReally, he had no idea which way was out.

And he’d certainly be wasting energy, and even with the\ngreen alive inside him, he knew his bucket had holes in the bottom of it. He\nwas emaciated, unhealthy underneath the veneer of wild energy green lent\nhim. So he forced himself to hold still, wait.\nThe blue saved him. He wasn’t drafting it, but it had changed him in all\nthose years. He stayed still and held his meager green light. The granite\ndust, still settling from the explosion and still settling from his own passage\ninto the tunnel, now resumed its natural patterns.\nThere was a slight breeze between the two newly connected passages,\ntoo slight for Dazen to feel on his skin, but enough to see the dust slide into\nthe tunnel and… up. If the wind was blowing that way, that was the way\nthat was open. That was his way out.\nDazen went up. Up was good. Up was out.\nA sudden sob racked his frame. Up was out. Dear gods. Up was out.\nChapter 82\n“Here’s what I’m curious about,” Teia said as they sat down in Kip’s room.\nShe was tired and her hair was askew from training with Karris White Oak.\n“I think Aram is the second best fighter in the scrubs.”\n“He’s the tall kid, muscular?” Kip asked.\n“And fast. And a yellow/green bichrome. He’s gotten some unlucky\nmatchups, but I’m wondering if he’s playing sand spider.”\n“Sand spider?” Kip asked. She’d said it like it was a saying he should\nknow.\n“Hiding in his hole so he can jump out at exactly the right time. He is a\nyellow. Maybe he thinks that he’s another Ayrad.”\n“When you use one reference I don’t know to explain another I don’t\nknow…” Kip said.\n“Ayrad was a Blackguard seventy, eighty years ago now. He entered at\nthe bottom of his class, at forty-nine, and each month at testing, he barely\nmade it into the next month. Forty-nine, to thirty-five, to twenty-eight, to\nfourteen. And then on the last week, he beat everyone. Turned out he’d\ntaken a vow or something.”\n“So on the last week, he fought, what? Fourteen to eleven, eleven to\neight, eight to five, five to two, and two to one? Orholam’s balls, that’s a lot\nof fights. I can’t imagine facing the best guy in the class after having\nalready fought four times.” It was one of the controls that the tests had built\nin. Someone could technically fight from the last place to the first, but\nbecause they had to fight again immediately until they stopped winning\nfight tokens, the exhaustion piled on—and with each new fight, the\nchallenger would be facing someone who was fresh.\n“Kip, Ayrad didn’t skip fighters. He beat all of them. From fourteen, he\nchallenged thirteen, from thirteen, twelve.”\n“You’re kidding.”\n“That’s the story.” Teia shrugged. “Karris did almost what you said, until\nshe faced Fisk. She finished third, after four fights. And Fisk barely got her,\nthey say.”\nWith all his study of magic and history and the cards, Kip almost"

        "text": "she faced Fisk. She finished third, after four fights. And Fisk barely got her,\nthey say.”\nWith all his study of magic and history and the cards, Kip almost\ndespaired as he saw that there was another gigantic area of lore that he\nhadn’t even touched: the histories of the great Blackguards.\nTeia picked up Kip’s slate and began writing on it.\n“So how did Lucretia Verangheti take it when she lost you?” Kip asked.\n“I never even heard how the Red got her to give up your title.”\n“I don’t know,” Teia said. “I haven’t seen her since then. Don’t want to.”\nShe shrugged, then pointed to the slate quickly. “This is what I think the\ntrue ranking of the Blackguard scrubs should be. What do you think?”\nThere was something about how she’d glossed over her slavery that\ncaught Kip’s attention, but then he got caught up in looking at the slate. Teia\nhad Cruxer at first, Aram at second (second?), herself at twelfth, and Kip\nat… eighteenth. He raised an eyebrow at her.\n“Um, sorry,” she said. “Maybe you could do better than that.”\n“You’re apologizing for the wrong thing,” Kip said. “I don’t belong at\neighteenth, do I?” He’d put himself around twentieth.\nTeia cleared her throat. “You’re a polychrome, Kip. It makes a big\ndifference. Huge, if you use it right.”\nKip scowled. A polychrome. They’d guessed that for a while. A full-\nspectrum polychrome? That was different. Totally different. And yet, with\nmissing the practicum every day, he didn’t have nearly the skills he should\nhave. In truth, as Teia had told him, if he really was a full-spectrum\npolychrome, all sorts of things would be different. They wouldn’t let him be\na Blackguard unless Gavin intervened—he was too valuable. And they\nwould want him to marry, young. It still wasn’t understood what made\ndrafters, but enough people believed that drafters had children who could\ndraft that the pressure for drafters to have children was intense. And more\nintense for the more gifted. Unless you got as powerful as Gavin Guile, and\nyou could do whatever you wanted and everyone else could go to hell.\nBut he didn’t want to think about all that right now. He went back to\nlooking at the rankings. “How’d you even arrive at this?”\n“Paying attention? Watching? First you have to take into account that\neveryone wants to finish as high as possible, but at least in the top fourteen.\nPeople also have friends that they don’t want to knock out of the top\nfourteen, so lots of times people won’t challenge three up from themselves\nif that’s where their friend is. Because win or lose, either they or their friend\nwill lose their challenge token. That’s less important in the top ten where\npeople will know they’re safe, but people heading for getting kicked out\naren’t going to want to ruin their friends’ chances.” She started drawing\nlines. “Person at the bottom goes first, so they might challenge the weakest\nperson in the three above them.

So let’s say Idus at twenty challenges\nAsmun at eighteen because even though he is allowed to challenge Ziri at\nseventeen, he thinks he can beat Asmun and not Ziri. If he wins, he moves\nup and then takes on Winsen, hoping to get lucky. So now the new person at\ntwenty is more likely to challenge Asmun who is now at nineteen, even\nthough that’s only one place up.”\n“Why?” Kip asked. The numbers were spinning in his head.\n“Because Asmun’s already lost. He’s got no challenge token, so he\nknows he can’t make it in this season at all. He won’t fight as hard because\nthere’s nothing at stake. See, you have to reshuffle the order every time\nsomeone wins, and keep track of who has and who doesn’t have their\nchallenge token. That way you can skip the more difficult fights. But of\ncourse, we have to keep in mind that some people will feign weaknesses\nuntil the last week so they have an advantage.”\n“Like you.” That was why Teia had wanted Kip to take credit for the\ncourier idea.\n“Yes, like me.”\n“Oh hell no,” Kip said. Talk about vast areas of lore he knew nothing\nabout. “No, no, no, this is hopeless. I can’t figure this all out!” He stood up.\n“No, I’m tired. Forget this—”\n“Kip, if you don’t figure this out, you’re not going to make it into the\nBlackguard. You’re not a good enough fighter, so you need to be smarter\nthan people who are better fighters than you. That is what people admired\nabout Ayrad.”\n“The man who defeated all the other fighters in the Blackguard wasn’t\nadmired because he was a good fighter? I find that hard to believe.”\n“Kip, he was able to figure out exactly how to finish last every month\nand still make it in. That means he was figuring exactly who would\nchallenge whom and who would win those fights—every month. If he\nfigured wrong once, he would have failed out early.”\n“So he’s admired for losing intelligently? That’s mad.”\n“He’s admired for knowing his friends and knowing his enemies and\noutwitting them all.”\n“So what happened to him?” Kip asked.\n“He became commander of the Blackguard and saved the lives of four\ndifferent Prisms over the course of his career—and then someone poisoned\nhim.”\n“So he wasn’t perfect,” Kip said grumpily.\n“He was perfect for twenty-four years. That’s a lot longer than most of\nus can even dream.”\n“Sorry,” Kip said. He could tell that somehow the dead commander\nmeant a lot to Teia.\n“Don’t pout. We’ve got work to do.”\n“Hold on, before we do all that, I want you to take your papers. You\nkeep on avoiding this. Look, all you have to do is sign them and we can\ntake them to be registered tomorrow.”\n“Kip, don’t be an idiot.”\nKip was so tired he wanted to cry. He lifted his hands helplessly.\n“What happens after you free me, Kip?”\n“Uh, you’re free?”\n“And poor.”"

And as soon as a scrub passes the test,\ntheir contract goes into escrow until final vows. If you free me now, you get\nnothing.”\n“I don’t want to own you, Teia. It doesn’t feel right. Do you even want\nto be in the Blackguard?”\n“Of course I do!”\n“I don’t even know if I should believe you. You can’t tell me that you\ndon’t, can you?”\n“What? I’m a slave, not a liar, Kip.”\nHe scowled. “It’s more complicated than that, and we both know it.”\nShe looked at him like he was crazy for a long moment, then the façade\ncrumbled. One second she was all breezy confidence and happiness, and the\nnext she looked terribly vulnerable and frightened. “Kip… I’ve been\nthinking about this a lot. Ever since you said you’d free me. You know that\nthe first thing I felt was angry—at you? Because as soon as you won me, I\nstopped getting my lessons in how to draft paryl. I’ll get them again, but I’ll\nhave to wait years. Nothing in my life changed except that, and I was mad\nat you. Stupid, huh? Kip, part of me tells me to take those papers and run to\nthe registrar. To take my freedom while it’s sitting there in front of me. It\ntells me slave owners are notoriously fickle. Sorry.”\n“No offense taken,” Kip mumbled.\n“My family’s in debt, Kip. My mother did some bad things, and my\nfather lost everything, including me and my sisters. He was a trader like I\nsaid, but his creditors won’t let him go on another voyage because they’re\nafraid he’ll flee, so he’s stuck working as a day laborer. With what he’s\nearning now, there’s no way he can pay off what he owes. He can’t afford to\nbuy inventory to trade at home. If I take those papers now, I’m condemning\nhim to poverty, and my sisters to early marriages to the first poor men my\nfather can convince to take them.”\n“What happened?” Kip asked.\n“Please don’t ask me that.”\nBut I already did ask—Oh, because she’s my slave, if I insist, she’ll\nhave to answer. Kip said, “Forget it then. Sorry. You have a plan?”\n“Hold on to my title for a few more weeks. Then when I go through final\nvows, you give me a fifth of what the Blackguard pays for me. That way,\nwe both get something—and you’ll need the money as badly as I do. I want\nto be a Blackguard anyway, Kip. There is nothing in life I want more. This\nway, the Chromeria pays us for it.”\n“That’s… sort of… brilliant,” Kip said.\n“And what’s the downside?” she asked.\nI don’t get to find out if you like me for me or if you like me because"

To\nanyone. I’ll serve you in our off hours, I don’t care. I’ve been a slave for\nyears, I can do it for a few more weeks, just promise that.”\n“I swear to Orholam,” Kip said, “on one condition.”\nShe looked dubiously at him.\n“That you take half of what we get for your contract.”\n“Kip, you’re a terrible negotiator.” She grinned, and Kip was struck\nagain by how different she was from Liv. Liv had lived in bitterness over\nher station, which had been unjust, but it hadn’t been as bad as being a\nslave. Maybe it was that Liv had seen how close a gloriously easy life had\nbeen, so she felt the sting of its loss. Or maybe Teia was simply naturally\nmore positive, but if he had to go through bad and unfair stuff, he hoped\nthat in the future he could be more like Teia and less like Liv.

A torch\ncould be a trap. He pressed on through the tight confines of the tunnel,\nbreathing deeply to try to keep himself calm. The tunnel wasn’t that tight,\nand the blackness wasn’t the dark. He could go through worse. He would go\nthrough worse, gladly, to get out of here.\nNo going back. Never.\nPerhaps a hundred paces later, he came to another torch, and he paused.\nThe light of his green luxin ball was feeble, and it was consuming his only\nluxin. He didn’t know how long it was going to have to last him. Hopefully\nonly minutes, but just in case…\nHe studied the torch like it was a serpent. The tunnel was too tight to\ncomfortably carry a normal torch with the attendant open flames and\ndripping pitch. To carry a normal torch without burning yourself down here,\nyou’d have to hold it directly in front of you. In his usual profligately\ndrafting way, his brother had made lux torches, made of a mundane shaft of\nwood. The ends had panels of imperfectly drafted yellow, covered\ncompletely by a thin layer of luxin or glass or even waxed leather. Sealed\nagainst the air, the yellow luxin lay dormant. When you wanted light, you\nsimply peeled back the sealant and had a perfect, single-spectrum yellow\nlight source.

Hideously expensive to buy and horribly difficult to craft; his\nbrother had liked to draft them to show off his superchromacy.\nThis one was his brother’s work, no doubt. Of course, his brother must\nhave done most if not all of the work on this prison himself. The lux torch\nwas set in a simple iron bracket. Dazen squinted at the little piece of iron as\nif it held the mysteries of the universe. But it was just iron. The fit didn’t\nlook particularly tight. It didn’t look like there was any way it could be\nsome kind of a switch so that when he lifted the torch it would pop up and\ntrigger a trap.\nBut it felt wrong.\nDazen cursed. And then he cursed some more. He liked hearing the\nsound of his words echo down the tunnel, disappear into the distance, rather\nthan simply bounce back at him from a few feet away.\n“A little dumb to be hollering when you’re trying to escape, don’t you\nthink?” a voice said.\nDazen felt a shock run down his spine. For one long instant he thought it\nwas all over. Then he recognized the voice.\n“Dead man,” he said.\n“But not as dead as you’ll be soon, I think,” the dead man said.\n“I thought you were back in your wall, where I left you. I don’t need you\nout here.”\nThe dead man chuckled from the darkness. “Thought you could lose me\nso easily? You’re an amusing little man, Gavin Guile.”\n“No, you’re Gavin. You’re the dead man. I’m done with that. I’m done\nwith losing. Now go away, I’m burning light here.”\n“Bet the torch is trapped.”\nDazen snarled. “I know the torch is trapped!”\nBut he didn’t know the torch was trapped. That was fear, paranoia. But\nhe couldn’t shake it. Cursing quietly, over and over and over, he studied the\ntorch. He couldn’t touch it.\n“Forget it,” the dead man said. “You’ve probably got fifteen minutes left\nwith the green. You might make it, if you don’t sit around and talk to\nyourself.” He laughed again, mocking.\nDazen stumbled down the hall. He was in bad shape. If he didn’t get\nsleep and real food soon…\nNo, worry about that later.\nThe tunnel curved slowly, and Dazen thought he was spiraling slowly\nupward. It felt like it was taking forever. It felt unbearable, but it couldn’t\ngo on for too long, could it? How deep would Gavin have dug?\n“Deeper than you can dig out, of course,” the dead man said. “He was\nalways that little bit smarter than you.”\n“Shut up!” Dazen’s leg folded and he fell. He caught himself, but it\nalmost cost him his concentration. He almost lost the green ball.\n“You remember how you were father’s favorite? I wonder if Gavin’s his\nfavorite now. You were always afraid father would realize how much\nsmarter Gavin was than you, weren’t you?”\n“Shut up,” Dazen said weakly. Orholam, he’d almost lost his only light."

Of course, that lux torch might\nbe dead. Been there a long time. They don’t last forever.

He\nstood, shakily, and even the dead man was silent.\nThen, salvation.\nHe saw another lux torch. He moved toward it slowly, carefully.\n“It’s trapped, you know that, right?” the dead man said. “I bet the last\none wasn’t trapped. He probably is so much smarter than you that he knew\nyou’d go past that one, and then get desperate. He’s got you figured pretty\n—”\n“Shut up! Shut up. Shut up!”\nThe green ball was smaller than Dazen’s fist now. He had five minutes\nleft, maybe.\nStill, he didn’t rush. He examined closely the iron bracket this torch sat\nin.\n“It won’t be a simple lever trap. Come now, Dazen would be more\nelegant than that, don’t you think? Dazen—”\n“I’m Dazen now!” Dazen hissed. But he didn’t even turn. He was right,\nit couldn’t be a simple lever trap. The bracket was solid. He stepped back\nand extended one finger and pressed on the bracket, ready to jump\nbackward if anything happened.\nNothing.\nHe squinted his eyes, trying to see into the superviolet, but he couldn’t\ntell if he was failing or there was simply no superviolet luxin to see.\nHe poked the torch. It shifted in the bracket and he jumped back. His leg\nbetrayed him again and he tumbled to the floor, barely able to break his fall\nby pushing himself against the wall.\nBut other than a complete loss of his dignity, nothing happened.\n“Loss of your dignity?” The dead man chortled. “You’re bloody, and\ndirty, and naked, you smell like shit, and you talk to yourself. What dignity\ndo you have to lose?”\n“I want you to know,” Dazen said, “when I get out of here, you’re gone.\nI don’t need you anymore.”\n“ ‘Need’ is such an interesting word, isn’t it?”\n“Go to the evernight.” Dazen stood wearily. “Let’s see what you’ve got,\nbrother,” he said. He grabbed the lux torch.\nAnd. Nothing. Happened.\nHe expelled a breath. He hadn’t realized he’d been holding it. Orholam"

        "text": "brother,” he said. He grabbed the lux torch.\nAnd. Nothing. Happened.\nHe expelled a breath. He hadn’t realized he’d been holding it. Orholam\ndamn you, Gavin, I really thought you were that diabolically clever.\nDazen pulled back the little clay tab over one square face of the lux\ntorch and a slow glow began emanating as the air got in through its many\ntiny holes. The torch was still half full of yellow luxin. With the quality of\nGavin’s drafting, that would be plenty.\nHope broke over Dazen’s heart like the sun breaking over the hills as\nthat pure yellow light blossomed. He jostled the lux torch and the light\nbloomed full. He peeled off another clay face and basked in the glow. There\nwas no trap.\nHe was really going to make it. He’d dug a fathom below that bastard’s\npetard.\nDrafting from luxin was horridly inefficient. The light being cast was\ncast because the luxin had been drafted incorrectly, so the only correct\nyellows you got were those shed through spectral scattering, and even then,\nyour own abilities and efficiency as a drafter dictated what was possible.\nBut Dazen wasn’t trying to draft something useful; he merely wanted to\ntaste yellow.\nIt leaked into him in a slow swirl, and after sixteen years of its absence,\nit was glorious. He felt sharper, clearer, able to go on, carefully.\nThe bare fact that Gavin hadn’t booby-trapped this lux torch didn’t mean\nthat there weren’t traps in the tunnel. Even if he’d never guessed that his\nbrother would get out this way, he might have worried that someone would\nfind it from the other end. Yes, he’d have to be careful.\nThank you, yellow.\nInvigorated, Dazen walked on.\nNot three minutes more, and he saw the rays of the lux torch illuminate\nthe mouth of a chamber. He slowed.\n“This will be where he gets you,” the dead man said.\n“Shut up,” he hissed.\nHe examined everything minutely. The walls of his tunnel before it\nemerged into the chamber; the floor; the ceiling—anything he could see, in\nevery spectrum. His heart pounded, but there was nothing, no hidden\ntripwires, no hinges, no inexplicable holes in the wall that would shoot out\nsome kind of gory death. He edged forward slowly. He could take his time.\nThe torch would last.\nOf course, his brother could be coming at any moment.\nThe chamber was perhaps ten paces wide in either direction. There was\na small table, small chair, small cot. No food, though. This must have been\na room where Gavin rested while he constructed the prison.\nDazen watched where he put every step.\n“I’m telling you, this is where he gets you,” the dead man said. “Go\nahead, go lie down in that cot. Want to bet you never wake up?”\nDazen didn’t touch the cot. He wasn’t going to sleep anyway, not with\nthe lux torch slowly burning out. He’d discarded the clay caps, hadn’t even\nthought about keeping them, dammit. Stupid mistake. Not that he had\npockets or free hands to carry them in. Still.\nSomething glimmered on the far wall, directly over the tunnel mouth."

Still.\nSomething glimmered on the far wall, directly over the tunnel mouth.\n“Oh, by all means, go look at the shiny. Right. That couldn’t possibly be\na trap,” the dead man said.\n“Why don’t you stay here, and I’ll go on without you?” Dazen said.\n“Then we’ll both be happy.”\n“By all means, I’m not the one talking to myself. You can leave me\nbehind whenever you’re good and ready.”\n“Go to hell,” Dazen said. “It’s over by the tunnel. I have to go that way\nregardless.”\nStill, he went carefully. It was easy to get fixated, get tunnel vision.\n“Ha! Punning!” the dead man said.\nWhat? Oh. “Bugger off.”\nDazen blinked, rubbed his eyes, studied the floor, tested every step. He\ncouldn’t go at this pace for long or he’d never get out. But it was worth it\nhere. No matter that the dead man was mocking him, he did have a point.\nWhatever the shiny was, it was etched into the rock. Perhaps a natural\nvein of some ore? Gold? Dazen knew nothing about mining, but he was\ndeep under the earth somewhere. The distribution looked random at first,\nbut as he got closer—\n“Trap. I’m telling you. Trap,” the dead man said.\n“I’m not touching it, you asshole. Stop distracting me.” Trap it might be,\nbut Dazen wasn’t going to put his head right underneath that thing to step\ninto the tunnel beyond it if it was going to snap down without a moment’s\nnotice.\nKeeping his distance, he stood up on tiptoe and held the lux torch high.\nWhatever it was, it sat deep in grooves, and only fell full under the torch’s\nlight when he lifted it. He heard a little hiss and he froze.\nThis was the trap. He needed to do something immediately, but he didn’t\nknow what.\nIn an instant, the luxin—for it was luxin—in the grooves ignited and\nglowed a dull, infernal red. Dazen remembered the formulation. Gavin’s\nwork, a blend of yellow and red so unstable that even being hit with light\nwould cause it to combust. He felt a stab of fury—and then the whole\ndesign bloomed with light, ignited by the light of his lux torch.\nIt was a single, roughly shaped word, two paces across, drawn with a\njaunty, cocky hand. It unfurled in yellow-red fire: Almost.\nDazen’s feet became unstuck and he leapt backward and ran for the\ntunnel behind him.\nThe light of his lux torch, which had been directed solely forward as\nhe’d entered the chamber, now cut into deep grooves in the wall back\nbehind him that he hadn’t even seen. These flashed to fire, the fires cut\nropes, and the floor dropped out from under him.\nHe tumbled head over heels into the darkness down a tube, then abruptly\ndropped straight onto a flat surface. He impaled himself on several tiny\nspikes, not longer than his first knuckle. It took his breath—and his luxin.\nHellstone!"

It took his breath—and his luxin.\nHellstone!\nThen that floor swung open and he tumbled down farther, farther. He\nsmashed into a door that swung open and then shut behind him.\nDizzy, back and arms bleeding from tiny stab wounds and disoriented,\nDazen nonetheless immediately knew where he was by the light that\nstabbed through his eyelids, mocking him.\nHe rolled over, opened his eyes. The room was shaped like a squashed\nball, one hole above for food and water, one hole below for his waste. And\nin the round, curving wall of his new yellow cell sat the dead man.\nIn a mad falsetto, he said, “Told you so.”\nChapter 84\nThe shimmercloak made it easy for Gavin to get back to his room. Indeed,\nhe passed only a single Blackguard who glanced toward the door to the roof\nwhen a bit of wind gusted in, but Gavin closed it quickly behind him.\nThe young woman looked up the stairs but dismissed it. Gavin made it\npast her, and when she finally decided to go check, he used the opportunity\nto slip into his room.\nClearly, they’d searched the room for him, but it had been a cursory\nsearch. What had he been thinking, inviting a search of his room? They\ncould have found the door in his closet.\nNot that it mattered now. Gavin went to the picture of the blue colossus\nand pulled it open. He almost laughed. The alarm panel was glowing\nyellow.\nHis brother had broken out of green, last night. Insanely, Gavin felt\nproud of him. He was a fighter. Maybe enough of one.\nWell, at least the second alarm worked. Gavin swung the painting shut\nand went to his closet and began moving his clothes.\n“My lord, may I help?”\nGavin wheeled around to find Marissia. She was kneeling beside the\nbed, head down. Apparently waiting for him, paying some sort of penance\nby making her vigil here. Her face was drawn, haggard.\nHe felt a rush of warmth for the woman. She’d been more than his room\nslave. She’d served with her whole heart, and in difficult circumstances.\n“Marissia, there’s a letter in my desk drawer. I’m sure you’ve seen it.\nPlease get it for me.”\nShe got it for him while he continued piling his clothes out of the way in\nthe closet. She brought it back, wooden. It was her letter of manumission.\nInstead of having the standard thing written up and then signing it, Gavin\nhad written it all in his own hand. He’d heard tales of room slaves being\naccused of forging their own manumission papers and kept in slavery\nbecause of it. Marissia was beautiful and valuable for a dozen reasons.\nGavin wasn’t going to let them have her.\nHe looked it over, though he had the contents memorized. It was not\nonly manumission, but also a grant of ten thousand danars. A fortune,\nenough to start a business and marry, or just to live off for the rest of her\nlife. He signed it. Then he grabbed another scrap of paper and wrote down a\nseries of letters and numbers. “My father might seize this money through"

They know I care about you, so they’ll suspect that\nI’d leave you something. This code will open another account to you. Speak\nto the Ilytian banker Prestor Onesto at Varig and Green.”\n“My lord, why are you speaking this way?” She sounded on the verge of\ntears.\n“Please give five thousand of what’s in that account to Karris and five\nthousand to Kip. The rest is for you.” He handed the writ to her. “Memorize\nthat sequence and then burn that; Onesto will release the money to anyone\nwho has that number.”\n“Lord Prism…” She held the papers limply. She looked bereaved.\n“I’ve freed you. You’re supposed to be happy.” Gavin looked away. Of\ncourse it stroked his ego that his slave didn’t seem delighted to be free, but\nperhaps that was simply because she knew to cover her delight for his sake.\nIn case it was a lie, he didn’t want to see through it, so he looked away.\n“This is my fault, isn’t it, my lord?” she said. “I did something wrong,\ndidn’t I? I missed the alarm somehow.”\nHe put his hands on her shoulders. “It’s not your fault. My alarm failed.\nIt was my work. Everything had to go right, for too long. Something\nhappened. But it wasn’t you.”\n“I should have been here for you. That Ana girl… I should never have\nleft. I’m so sorry, my lord.” She was right; if Marissia had been in his bed\nwhere Gavin wanted her, things would have been very different. But he was\nthe master of his own fate. No one had forced him to throw that girl out\nonto his balcony.\nWhat had he been thinking, anyway? Just that he wanted her out of his\nroom? Just that he wanted to frighten her? Or had his rage been murderous\nall along?\nMaybe intent didn’t matter. She was dead. It was all finished.\n“It’s not your fault, Marissia. It’s mine. You have been a good servant, a\ngood companion, a good friend. I want you to go now so you don’t get\nsucked down by the wreckage.”\nHer eyebrows tented in dismay. “My lord, you are a good man. Please\ndon’t—”\nHe snorted. “A good man would have freed you long ago. I was afraid of\nhow you’d use your freedom, so I withheld it from you. I’ve a small and\nmean spirit. The master who fears the choices his people will make enough\nto take those choices away isn’t worth serving. You’ve served me well,\ndespite my shortcomings. Thank you, Marissia. Please take these two\ncloaks down to my secret room. Then go. I may not come back up alone. I\nmay not come back up at all, but someone else will. You oughtn’t be here\nwhen he does.”\nShe turned her hands up, helpless for once. “My lord,” she said\nplaintively.\nHe opened the closet and drafted the board for his feet—out of yellow\nluxin now, since he couldn’t do blue."

Tell Karris… No, I suppose you can’t. Fare thee\nwell, Marissia.” He stepped into the closet and closed the door.\nHe could hear her weeping as soon as the door closed, though she was\ntrying to hold it back.\nGavin slid open the floor, found the rope, and fitted the board onto it. In\nmoments, he was whizzing downward into the darkness.\nWhen he got to the bottom of the shaft, he groped around until he found\nthe lux torches, then pulled one off the wall. He hadn’t been able to use\nthem before because he hadn’t wanted to cast yellow light into any of his\nbrother’s cells. Now that Dazen was in the yellow cell, it didn’t matter\nanymore.\nHe found the controls and pulled the levers to bring the yellow cell up. It\nwould take about five minutes for the cell to lift and rotate into position.\nHe’d built it that way so that his brother would always think that the place\nwhere the window sat was a weakness in the design, when in fact he’d\nhardened that spot above all others.\nThe wait gave him time to think about the spasm of creative genius he’d\nhad in constructing this prison. He’d built the first, blue cell in a month, and\nthen spent the better part of a year constructing all the other cells. He\nwondered how much different the world would be if he’d simply killed his\nbrother and turned his attention immediately to fighting the Spectrum and\nchanging the injustices he saw them committing everywhere. A waste, all\nfor one man.\nNever had the guts to let him go. Never had the guts to murder him in\ncold blood.\nSlowly, slowly, the orb came into view, and then slowly settled. There\nwas a slide to pull back to reveal the window, but Gavin found himself\nlooking blankly at that slide, afraid to pull it open.\nRidiculous. He was here to die. He was here to let his brother out. This\nshould be easy. It was all finished. His heart hammered protests in his chest,\nand he thought it was going to seize up. His throat constricted. He was\nsweating.\nHe pulled back the slide.\nA man charged from the other side and swung a club straight at his face.\nGavin threw himself backward. His brother’s lux torch hit the yellow\nluxin window and shattered in a flash of released yellow brightwater. But\nthe prisoner wasn’t finished. He didn’t laugh with cool resolve at scaring\nGavin. Instead, he attacked with the fury of a rabid wolf, beating the lux\ntorch against the window with great blows until the wood shaft splintered in\nhis hands, broke.\n“You motherfucker!” the prisoner shouted. “I am going to kill you and\neveryone you ever loved. I’m going to rip your fucking head off and\nsodomize you with it.”\nGavin stood, brushed himself off, and put his own lux torch into a\nbracket.\n“You hear me, Gavin?” the prisoner shouted. “You think you’re so"

You know what? You are clever. You always wanted me to\nsay you’re the smarter brother. You know what? You are. You know what\nelse you are? You’re the weaker brother. You ever wonder why I’m father’s\nfavorite? Look at this. This prison. Ingenious. And pathetic. I thought you\nmade this prison to prove you were smarter than me, brother. I know better\nnow. You made it because you can’t kill me. Because you’re afraid.\n“That’s why father loves me. Oh, I’m a disappointment, too. He wishes\nhis son were both smart and ruthless, fearless, but he had to choose one, and\nhe chose me. And he chose right, you spineless, scrofulous sack of shit.\nBecause I can hold a grudge. I can nurse it, feed it, grow it. And I will.\nYou’re going to sit out there, worrying. Just like when you were a kid, huh?\nYou still get the bad dreams, don’t you? You still wake up crying, don’t\nyou? You still piss yourself, Gavin? Now you’ve got a reason to. I’m\ncoming!” The prisoner was so close, his spit flecked the window.\n“You could kill me,” he said, “but you won’t. I bet you think about it\nevery single morning when you send me my bread. I could poison this, you\nthink. I could just not feed him, you think. But you can’t. You don’t have it\nin you. You know, Gavin, you’re right. You don’t. But I do. If our positions\nhad been reversed, I’d have killed you as you lay unconscious at Sundered\nRock. I would have cut off your head and filled your mouth with your own\nfeces and put you on a pike. Because that’s how you win, Gavin. That’s\nhow you show you can’t be crossed. Peace through terror, Gavin. That\nprobably doesn’t even make any sense to you, does it? No, you were always\nlike mother, all sweet manipulations and bullshit. She—”\n“Mother’s dead,” Gavin said. He didn’t want Dazen to slur her in his\nmoment of anger.\n“Fuck her,” Dazen said. “As good a liar as she was, she never even\nbothered to pretend she didn’t love you more.”\nWhat?\n“You killed her?” Dazen asked, seeing a chink in Gavin’s armor in the\nshock on his face. “You shrive her first? What’d she tell you? Do you think\nshe was honest with you, even then? Or was she angling you to do what she\nwanted, even then? She might be dead, but I bet she’s not gone, is she?\nLittle spider bitch.”\n“That’s your mother you’re talking about, you sick bastard,” Gavin said.\n“So what’re you going to do, little brother? Make me stop? You’ll do\nnothing, like always. You’re going to wait for me, and have your\nnightmares. I got out of the other prisons, and I’ll get out of this one. You"

I thought\nthen that there must be seven prisons, one for every color. But there aren’t,\nare there?”\nGavin said nothing.\n“You couldn’t make a cell of superviolet. There’s no way you can make\none of sub-red. I don’t think you could make one out of orange or red either.\nI think this is the last cell. I think I’m a hair’s breadth from ending\neverything you’ve ever built.”\n“You might be surprised,” Gavin said quietly.\n“You’re a failure, little brother. An embarrassment. An empty shell.”\nGavin stood looking at his brother in the pitiless yellow light.\n“Karris never told you about our night together, did she?” the prisoner\nsaid.\n“You’ve regaled me with your sexual prowess before. I’m not\ninterested,” Gavin said. The prisoner wasn’t in his right mind. He’d just\nfallen into the yellow prison in the last twelve hours, doubtless thinking that\nthis time he was really going to escape. The disappointment, the heartbreak\nwould be enough to make anyone lash out. But Gavin didn’t want to hear it.\n“So she didn’t.” Dazen laughed, an edgy, grating laugh unlike any Gavin\nhad ever heard from him. “I used to be kind of ashamed of it, really. But\nI’m past that now. She wasn’t quite so eager as I might have made out\nbefore. We were at dinner, my men and her and her father, and I was telling\nthese outrageous jokes, and even her father laughed along, and I had this\nmoment, Gavin, when I realized just how different I am. How I can do\nwhatever I want. I put my big cock in the world, and the world shuts up and\ntakes it. I talked about fucking Karris all night long and making sure she\nwas up to my standards and that coward laughed along. Can you believe it?\nAnd Karris, little coward Karris, she just got drunk.\n“Sad to say, it was nothing special. She didn’t give me much of a ride\nafter I got mounted. You ever try to finish while the woman’s bawling? And\nI know it wasn’t because I took her maidenhead. You took care of that,\ndidn’t you?”\n“You sick piece of—”\n“I didn’t think I was going to be able to finish. I was drunk and she\nwasn’t doing much for me, with all her tears. But then she said your name,\nand I knew I had to. To show you that you couldn’t take what was mine.\nAnd do you know what’s mine? Anything I want. Anyone. She kept crying\nafterward so I kicked her out. I was kind of embarrassed, to tell you the\ntruth.” He shrugged. “I got over it.” He leered at Gavin, saw how aghast he\nwas. “She never mentioned it, huh?”\nGavin couldn’t speak.\n“You never married her, did you?”\nGavin felt gutted. He’d told his brother a hundred lies about his happy\nlittle life and his happy little wife. “No.”"

You think while she was making the rounds of the\nGuiles she slept with father, too?”\nBegging his brother to stop or commanding him to stop talking about\nKarris would be equally ineffectual. “I thought… I always thought you\nwere the good brother,” Gavin said.\n“Good brother?” the prisoner barked. “Like we’re the good twin and the\nbad twin? We’re not twins, Gavin, and neither one of us is good.”\n“Have you always been like this, or have you gone mad down here?”\nGavin asked.\n“You made me, little brother, just like I made you.” Dazen tossed the\nshattered pieces of the lux torch away. “Now why don’t we end this farce?\nOpen the door. Release me.” He spread his hands wide and leaned against\nthe window, intent on Gavin.\nGavin could see blood trickling down his brother’s chest from a thickly\nscarred wound, torn open in his fall. He could see another trickle of fresh\nblood from the little spikes of hellstone he had rigged to take away all of\nDazen’s luxin when he fell into yellow.\nDazen was thin, ragged, unhealthy. He was furious, as he had every right\nto be. Doubtless he was lying about Karris to hurt Gavin. Or exaggerating at\nthe least. But though Karris had never meant anything to him, their mother\nshould have.\nI was mother’s favorite? Of course I was. Maybe first she’d lavished\nmore attention on me because she saw how much father’s abandonment\nhurt me, how much I needed a parent. But we were kindred souls. She’d\nprobably felt guilty that she loved me more. She’d certainly felt relieved\nwhen she learned Gavin was actually Dazen. He’d seen that in her face,\nsixteen years ago, and tried to deny it since.\nI’m like the dog with a bone who crossed a low bridge in the fable. I see\nanother dog passing beneath me carrying a bone, and I snap to take his bone\n—and drop my own into the water, into my reflection.\nHe looked at the prisoner, who was glancing at one wall of his cell\nrepeatedly, as if in conversation. It might well have been Gavin’s fault that\nhis brother was mad. After all, he was the one who’d kept the man caged,\nalone, for sixteen years. But it wasn’t the kind of transgression he could fix.\nGavin leaned against his own side of the window, hands pressing the\nimmaculate, unbreakable yellow luxin opposite his big brother’s hands.\n“I’m sorry, brother. I’m sorry if I drove you mad, and I’m sorry if you were\nalways like this and I never knew it. But I don’t think I can let you out. Not\nlike you are. My world is falling apart.

His brother deserved to be here. Maybe they didn’t get to simply\nswitch places—maybe Gavin didn’t get to be the good brother in his own\nmind now that he’d determined that the prisoner was the bad brother. But\nhis brother was a bad brother. A bad man. A danger.\nIf the seed of megalomania had already been sprouting when he was\nnineteen years old, what would boundless power have done to him if Gavin\nhad let him walk free all those years ago?\nMaybe he’d even done the right thing, not just the least bad thing.\nMaybe locking his brother up had been just.\nMaybe not. It didn’t matter. He took a deep breath.\n“You started the war on purpose to rally allies around you, didn’t you?\nYou wiped out that village where I’d been hiding and then men flocked to\nme. Just to oppose you. You could have gotten me to surrender. I would\nhave. And after that first clash where my men won, you killed our\nmessenger. Why’d you do that? All you had to do was grant clemency to\nmy men, and you could have had me. Was that father’s idea, or yours?”\nDazen shot a quick sneer over at the wall. “Look, brother, as nice as this\nlittle scam that Lucidonius pulled together is, it doesn’t work for some\nkinds of threats. Take Ilyta. Which satrapies are going to vote to go to war\nto bring Ilyta back into the fold? None. But a promachos could do it. The\nAborneans have been cheating their tributes for decades. The Parians barely\npay attention to the Chromeria. The Ruthgari openly manipulate and\ndominate with their wealth and their lies. The Tyreans—well, I suppose I’m\nnot in much of a place to say what’s happened to Tyrea since the war\nchanged everything. Am I right?”\n“Yes,” Gavin said. His stomach was churning. His joints felt weak.\n“You think the Everdark Gates are going to stay closed forever?”\n“Ah, the amorphous threat from beyond the Everdark Gates,” Gavin\nsaid. “You’re a student of history, at least. Wasn’t it Prism Sayid Talim who\nnearly got himself named promachos to face the ‘armada’ that waited\nbeyond the gates? That was forty-seven years ago. Long time for an armada\nto wait around.”\n“You look around, Gavin, and you tell me if what we have is working.”\nGavin couldn’t even get the Spectrum to declare war even after Tyrea\nhad been lost and Atash invaded. How was that possible? His brother was\nright. Their system was broken, and it would take a man of will to make\nsomething new."

Their system was broken, and it would take a man of will to make\nsomething new.\n“War is the only way to be named promachos,” Dazen said. “You need a\ngreat crisis. You were our perfect opportunity. We could look reluctant\ngoing after you. You were my brother. You were Andross Guile’s son. No\none would think it was a ploy. But you kept trying to end our war before it\ncould really begin.”\nGavin felt sick. “And General Delmarta. Was he your man all along?” It\nhad been the general’s slaughter of the Atashian royal family that not only\nmobilized the satrapies against Gavin but also got rid of one of the families\nthat had opposed Andross Guile.\n“It was fifty-seven people. You killed more than that in the skirmish at\nTanner Creek.”\n“It’s different when it’s in cold blood.”\n“Is it?” the prisoner asked. “Do they end up less dead?” He blinked,\nlooked over at the wall, as if someone was speaking to him.\nGavin didn’t answer.\n“You tell me, brother,” the prisoner said. “Honest question, because I\nhave no way of knowing the answer: how much trouble have you had from\nAtash since our war?”\nIt was a body blow. Before the war, the Atashian royals—last remnant of\nthe orders that had existed before Lucidonius—had caused problems and\nsmall wars constantly. If the royal family had still been around with their\nmoney and influence, their safe havens and their smuggling ships, the Red\nCliff Uprising would have been horrendous. As it was, the uprising had\nfailed almost as soon as it began. The slaughter had worked.\n“Let me out, brother,” Dazen said. “You’re finished, and you know it.\nForgive me for what I said before. Threats and vileness. I didn’t mean it. I\njust fell into this cell hours ago. I’d thought I was out, and you beat me\nagain. You’ve got an excellent mind, little brother. But your time is done. I\ncan see it in your eyes, and not just in the colors that you’ve lost. You have\nthe smarts, but I have the will, and now the world needs will. There is a\nthreat out there, and it is growing, and only I can save the Seven Satrapies.”\n“You were always willing to do what needed to be done,” Gavin said.\n“That was the difference between us, wasn’t it?” His breath escaped in a\nlong sigh. “It’s all coming apart. There’s no way I can save it. Gavin,” he\nsaid, and it was a relief to call his older brother by his real name. “Gavin, I\nwant assurances. Swear to me, swear before Orholam that you won’t take\nany vengeance on Karris. I don’t know how she’ll react, and I know you\nmay have to exile her, but swear to me you’ll see she’s provided for. And\nKip. Same terms.”\nGavin—the real Gavin—squinted, as if considering the terms and the\nimplications they would have on his reign, moving seamlessly from the\nmad prisoner to the earnest emperor. “In the sight of Orholam, I so swear.”"

We’ve unfinished\nbusiness, brother. What do I do with you?” He glanced quickly over at the\nwall again, a quick crinkle of irritation, instantly smoothed away.\nGavin hesitated. His brother really was magnificent. “I figured you’d kill\nme. While I’m alive, I’m a threat, aren’t I?”\n“You’ve only got a year or so left. Killing you isn’t necessary. Father\nowns a little island off Melos that would be perfect for an exile. Used to\nkeep a mistress there.”\n“That is… quite kind,” Gavin said. “I, I’ve missed you, big brother.” He\nraised his hand to the node and dissolved the window between them. Then\nhe drew the dagger-pistols from his belt and pulled both triggers. The roar\nfilled the little space as the lead balls blasted through the prisoner’s body.\nOne punched a perfect hole in his sternum. The other smashed through his\nteeth and blew out the back of his head. The prisoner’s body dropped.\nDidn’t even twitch. The acrid, comforting aroma of gunpowder followed.\nBoth pistols had fired. Ilytian handiwork. Gavin could admire that. The\nIlytians made fine pistols.\nHe looked over at the wall, where the prisoner had been glancing\nrepeatedly, but he saw nothing but the reflection of a dead man.\nChapter 85\nWaiting was part of life for a Blackguard. It was service as much as\nthrowing yourself in front of a musket or magic. But like most of the\nBlackguards, Karris hated waiting. She’d come upstairs and heard nothing,\nthen had been instructed to wait for the White, who’d been gone for hours.\nAnother Blackguard eventually came and told the White’s room guard\nthat there had been an emergency session of the Spectrum called.\nNow, after dawn, the White was finally being wheeled down the long\nhallway from the lift to her own room. Karris’s impatience was quickly\nreplaced by concern for the old woman. She shouldn’t be made to stay up\nall night. The strain of it was evident on her face.\nThe White smiled at Karris as she was wheeled into her own room, but it\nwas a perfunctory smile. The White had more Blackguards today than usual\n—two of the new inductees, and Jin Holvar, a woman who’d entered the\nsame year Karris had, though she was a few years younger than Karris.\nKarris and Jin helped the White relieve herself, having to support almost\nall of her weight. Karris had to help her clean herself.\n“My apologies, child. The body fails,” the White murmured,\nembarrassed.\nThe two young Blackguards, Gill and Gavin Greyling, studiously\navoided looking back. The time would come when the young men would\nhave to help with this. There simply weren’t enough Archers in the\nBlackguard to have two women on every shift.

Karris remembered being young and in awe.\nFelt like a long time ago, now.\n“You can go,” Karris told the young men. “I’ll meet you back in the\nbarracks to talk. Jin and I will—”\n“No, I want them to stay,” the White said wearily. “Jin, you can go.”\nJin left and Karris helped the White into her bedclothes. Karris helped\nthe White totter toward bed, and then helped her sit up. It was, technically,\nnot the Blackguard’s duty, but the White’s room slave was old and frail\nherself. The White didn’t want to buy another slave when she said she had\nso little time left anyway, and didn’t want to get rid of the one she had—\nlittle though the old woman did for her now.\nThe White sighed deeply. “Now,” she said. “Work.”\n“You look exhausted, Mistress,” Karris said. “And I need to interview\nthese men. They were on duty, earlier—”\n“I know where they were. Why do you think I took them with me?” the\nWhite asked.\nKarris furrowed her brow.\n“The Spectrum,” the White said, “has declared war. Tonight we voted on\nthe composition of forces.”\n“Pardon me?” Karris said.\n“Blood Forest and Ruthgar had already mobilized their armies, and\nthey’re almost here. They’ve known this was coming as soon as Atash was\ninvaded. But no one else will be able to get their armies into the fray before\nRu’s fate is decided, I’m afraid. Andross Guile will be in charge of directing\nthe Chromeria’s contribution and managing the Blood Forest and Ruthgari\ngenerals.”\n“So there’s to be no promachos?” Karris asked. “And how is Lord Guile\ngoing to—”\n“It is as it is,” the White said. “It was cleverly done when Gavin couldn’t\nbe reached, so he and his new satrapy had no vote. The proposals were\nmanaged with Andross’s typical skill. He knows his parliamentary\nmaneuvering. It was war on his terms or let Ru fall. He wanted to be named\npromachos, and we had to call it a victory to stop him from that. I suspect\nhe didn’t expect to get it, but there you have it. Mobilization will begin this\nmorning.”\nKarris opened her mouth, but had nothing to say.\n“Now,” the White said, turning to the Greyling brothers, “tell me what\nhappened in the Prism’s chambers last night.”\nGill, the elder brother, cleared his throat and glanced at Karris.\n“Don’t spare her,” the White ordered. “She might as well know the\ntruth.”\n“Yes, High Lady. Um, Gavin and I were selected for guard duty last\nnight. We’ve been short-staffed, and even though we’re new, there were\nmore experienced Blackguards down the hall guarding your room and down\nat the lifts, so it was allowed.

The Prism arrived an hour before midnight.\nHe greeted us and made some jokes with us—”\n“Typical,” Karris said under her breath. “Charm the new blood.”\nGavin Greyling looked away. “I don’t know about that. Anyway, he said\nsomething about… um, having been on a long trip with a woman he wanted\nand couldn’t have.” He licked his lips and studiously didn’t look at Karris.\n“And he asked after his room slave. Gill and I talked about it this morning,\nand we couldn’t remember exactly what he said.”\n“You interpreted that to mean what?” the White asked.\nGavin cleared his throat again and shifted from foot to foot. “That he,\nuh, wouldn’t be averse to some, erm, companionship. So when the girl Ana\nshowed up, we figured he’d sent for her. She certainly acted like he had.\nThe Blackguards at the lift said they got a story from her that you’d sent for\nher, Mistress.”\n“So she lied. It’s not the first time she’s tried,” the White said. “Go on.”\n“We let her in. We thought maybe it was a common—”\n“Not interested in your thoughts on the point,” the White said. “What\nhappened?”\nGavin Greyling shifted again, glancing at Karris. “She hadn’t been in\nthere five minutes when Watch Captain White Oak came up. She said she\nhad important business. We, uh, tried to dissuade her, but she seemed in a\nhurry, like she didn’t want to be seen in the hall…”\n“Tell the whole truth, you bastards,” Karris said. Wooden, but even.\n“She was wearing cosmetics, and perfume. Her hair was done, I don’t\nknow, all beautiful. Like a woman coming for an, an, what’s the—” Gavin\nshot a look at his brother.\n“Assignation,” Gill said.\nGavin Greyling shifted from foot to foot.\n“Back to when you let her in,” the White said.\n“When we opened the door, it was clear that the Prism had… uh, been\nwoken enthusiastically by Ana. And that the watch captain was surprised by\nit. Watch Captain White Oak ran out, and the High Luxlord Prism called\nafter her. He seemed shocked. He ran after the watch captain and went\ndown the lift to follow her before we could join him. We didn’t know what\nto do, so we went back to our station, and he returned a few minutes later.”\nOrholam. Karris had a sick feeling in her stomach.\n“He was absolutely furious with the girl, Ana. We, um, saw her when he\nwent back in, and it was like she thought that they’d pick up where they left\noff. But he was having none of it. He shouted at her—”\n“What did he say?” the White asked.\nGavin Greyling didn’t look at Karris. “He said that Ana had cost him the\nwoman he loved. That he’d thought she was Karris—er, the watch captain\n—and he wouldn’t have touched Ana if he’d known who she was. That she\ndisgusted him. The girl said some, uh, vile things about Watch Captain\nWhite Oak, and the Prism threw her out onto his balcony.”"

Gavin had murdered that stupid girl because\nshe’d insulted Karris? Karris felt like weeping, for Ana, for herself, for\nGavin, for the whole stupid world and shipwrecked love.\n“We saw…” Gavin swallowed and looked over at Gill, who nodded at\nhim to go on.\n“He was shouting and furious, and the girl was so frightened, she\njumped off the balcony.”\nIt sent a bolt through Karris. “She jumped?!” she asked.\n“Yes, Watch Captain,” the young man said. “He… he looked mortified\nimmediately. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the look on his face. He said\nsomething like, ‘Orholam have mercy, I’ve killed her.’ And then he told us\nto go report it, and that he would be there when we got back. He looked so\nstunned that we believed him, Mistress. We didn’t know what to do. One of\nus should have stayed with him. I’m sorry.”\n“Wait. He didn’t kill her?” Karris asked.\n“No, sir. She jumped,” Gill said.\n“And you are both completely certain of this?” the White asked.\n“Yes, High Lady,” they said at the same time.\n“Certain enough to tell this tale to the Spectrum itself?”\nGavin paled, but Gill looked confused. If he was a liar, he was the better\none. “Yes, Mistress. Why would we lie?”\nThe White said, “You would not be the first Blackguards to believe that\ntheir duty to protect the Prism extended beyond the duty to protect his life.”\nGill blinked. “I understand, Mistress. But we barely know Lord Guile.\nWe just started.”\n“And anyone who searches your belongings will not find any large gifts\namong them?”\nHis face hardened. “We’re new to the job, Mistress, not to honor.”\n“Very well,” the White said. “You’re dismissed. Go get some sleep.\nYou’ll likely be wakened rudely for more questions from others, but you\ndeserve what rest you can find.”\nShe dismissed them and they left, grateful.\nKarris turned to the White. “You seemed like you expected that.”\n“Of course I did. I already interviewed them earlier. I wanted to see if\nthey’d changed their story. And… I wanted you to hear that the man you\nlove was somewhat innocent of both crimes.”\nKarris blinked. The man I love? Both crimes? “What? What?!”\n“He’s rebuffed that girl at least twice before. And apparently he had\ngood reason to believe you were coming to his bed last night, seeing as you\ndid.”\nKarris squirmed, but had nothing to say.\n“You know that Blackguards are forbidden to make love with their\ncharges, don’t you, Karris?”\n“Yes, Mistress.” She swallowed. She’d been stupider last night than she\ncould believe. She was normally so rational!\n“Have you spoken with Commander Ironfist about this matter?” the\nWhite asked. “Help me scoot down here, will you?”\nKarris helped the White shift from sitting up in bed to lying down. “Um,"

I—I’m afraid I acted impulsively last night, and before that I\nnever thought it would be a, um, temptation.” She had a sinking feeling in\nthe pit of her stomach.\nThe White lay back. “Well, dear, if you had, Ironfist would have told\nyou that he and I had a discussion about this very matter long ago. And then\nanother much more recently.”\n“You did?” Karris asked.\n“Don’t interrupt, dear. We did. And we agreed that it’s a good rule.\nKeeps lines clearer. Keeps waters from being muddied.”\n“Yes, Mistress,” Karris said. She straightened her shoulders, took a\nbreath. Her head was still a whirl, but this was the life she’d chosen. She\nwas a Blackguard, through and through. It wasn’t easy, but that was why\nshe’d chosen it, because she’d known it was hard. Rules existed for a\nreason.\nThe White said, “And we also agreed that sometimes the exception\nproves the rule. And that you are that exception. If you wish to pursue a\nrelationship with that impossible man, you may.”\nA sound that may have had some faint resemblance to a squeal jumped\nout of Karris’s mouth. She froze, her lips pursed.\nThe White opened her eyes and grinned. “May Orholam have pity on us\nfor whom we love, child. Now go find that incorrigible man, and keep him\nalive. I fear we’re going to have great need of him in the coming days.”\nKarris hugged the old woman tight and ran from the room, pausing only\nto send the other Blackguards in.\nChapter 86\nGavin climbed out of the hell of his own making one foot at a time. The\npulley and counterweights made it so he could go much faster, but the\npulley made noise. From the depths, he couldn’t know if the noise high\nabove would make any difference, so he had to err on the side of caution.\nSome time later, he got to the top. He climbed through the hole, reset the\nfloor as quietly as possible, dissolved the yellow luxin board, and listened at\nthe door. Nothing.\nAfter listening for a full minute, he opened the door a crack. Then more.\nThere was no one in the room except Marissia, kneeling silently on the\nfloor.\n“Marissia,” Gavin said, warmed by the sight of her. “I told you to go,”\nhe said gently.\nShe looked at him then, and he was surprised to see a wash of fresh tears\nrun down her cheeks. “I knew you’d come back. Please, my lord, don’t send\nme away. This is all I know. I—Please don’t reject me.”\nReject? “No, no, no,” he told her. “I’m not sending you away. But…\nMarissia, I’ve given you your freedom.

Orholam knows, your duties have already included everything a\nsecretary does.”\n“And more,” she said quietly.\n“Well, yes, of course. And the more has been accomplished with\naplomb,” he said, giving a little smirk. Then the smirk froze.\nHe’d just killed his brother, and the rest of life went on, not even\npausing to notice.\n“My lord…” she said, as if he was being dense.\n“Yes?” he said.\n“You love Lady White Oak.”\n“Yes, I do.”\n“It is one thing for a lady to tolerate the man she loves enjoying the\ncompanionship of his room slave. It is quite another for him to cheat on her\nwith a free woman. Especially if you had made your favor obvious by\nfreeing me.”\nAh. It was so much easier to free a slave when you thought it wasn’t\ngoing to cost you anything. Damn.\nGood thing I don’t have anything more pressing to deal with than my\nloins.\nGavin rubbed his jaw. Popped his neck right and left. “Marissia, I made\nyou a promise, and I would be a small man to—”\n“I have a solution, my lord!”\n“A solution?”\n“That doesn’t dishonor the gift you’ve given me, but doesn’t make me\ngo.”\nGavin cocked an eyebrow. “You want to stay? I mean, you really want\nto stay? Or are you just afraid of things being different? If you need more\nmoney…”\n“My lord, I’ve already written up the contract. It’s not manumission, but\nit’s a promise that I can buy my manumission for one danar, whenever I\nwant. That way, you’ve still given me the generous gift, and when I want, I\ncan take it, without depriving you or making things difficult between you\nand Lady White Oak.”\nMore difficult, anyway.\n“I still don’t… you’re a room slave, Marissia.

Instead…”\n“What could I do in this life that would have more meaning than serving\nyou, my High Lord Prism?” she asked.\n“How can you say that? You know me. You know what I am.”\n“Yes, my lord, I do. And I—” She closed her mouth, then said instead,\n“Please don’t make me leave.”\n“I’m not going to make you leave,” Gavin said. She was brilliant.

He’d realized everything he’d believed for the last\ntwenty years at least had been a lie. He’d killed his own brother.

Usually she was reactive; there would be a question in her\ninitial touches. Not now.\nGavin stepped back, and she stood smoothly in front of him, shrugging\nher wrap off her shoulders, leaving her sheathed in a pretty chemise. He\nsaid, “Maybe I should—”\nShe kissed his lips, pushed him backward, pulling his trousers down.\nShe guided him to a chair and he sat abruptly as it hit his knees. And then\nshe was on him, her eyes on his, holding him down, possessive. Her\nlovemaking was a whirlwind, hard and aggressive and fast and hot and\nsweaty and overwhelming. She rode him until he finished, light exploding\nin front of his eyes, but she didn’t stop like she normally did. If anything,\nshe bore down on him harder until he was worried the chair would break\nand spill them both on the floor. Her fingers were laced through his hair,\nholding his head in place, demanding he look into her eyes. Then those\nstunning green eyes flared and her hips bucked uncontrollably. Her fingers\ndug into his arm and twisted his hair painfully, and then she collapsed\nagainst him.\nGavin was left breathless and stunned. He stood and carried her to his\nbed. She burrowed into his arms, and gave him up only with a little mew of\nprotest when he released her. He walked over to his own side of the bed and\nsat on the edge in the dim lamplight.\nThough he’d reached his satisfaction, his body was still eager for more.\nMaybe it had just been too long on the trail with Karris. Maybe it had been\nMarissia’s startling, utterly alluring intensity. He thought of taking her again\nand numbing his uneasiness. Tomorrow was going to be hell. He just\nwanted to sleep. For a few hours, he wanted to feel nothing.\nInstead, he felt somehow like he’d done something wrong with Marissia.\nTry as he might, he couldn’t think of what it was.

Marissia was gone. Working, no doubt. He lay in the quiet, idly\npicking up his problems, then setting them down with no particular urgency.\nHe did some of his best work this way. He remembered that Demnos Jorvis\ndidn’t get along with his wife, Arys’s sister Ela. He thought about the rate of\ngrowth of a bane. Balancing had been done manually before, drafters of one\ncolor being instructed to use more luxin for a year, drafters of the color out\nof control instructed to use less. The Chromeria had quite a reach. He\nthought of the High Luxiats, the men who determined doctrine that would\nbe promulgated throughout the satrapies, who would no doubt be itching to\nmeet with him after all the strange reports. They loved and feared him, but\ncould he push through a change to the religion itself? He thought of Karris.\nHe would win her back. It was possible now, he was sure of it.\nAnd he thought of his dead brother. He sat up, and saw that Marissia had\nbrought in the tray with the hard square loaves of special bread he’d\ndropped down the chute five thousand times. He didn’t feel guilty. It was\nlike looking into a mirror and realizing you’re not a child anymore. But this\nday, Gavin could look at himself dispassionately. So this is who I am: Gavin\nGuile, fratricide. The man who’d had the will to kill his brother to save the\nSeven Satrapies. He was now the man everyone had thought he was for\nsixteen years.\nAlmost.\nMarissia slipped in the door.\n“My lord,” she said. “Good, you’re up. Your father wants to meet with\nyou immediately. All Little Jasper is buzzing with news of the young lady’s\ndeath. The Blackguard is being silent while they investigate—waiting for\norders from the White, who’s sleeping, after being up all night. The\nSpectrum had an emergency session last night and voted on the composition\nof the forces heading to Ru. They put your father in charge, but defeated his\nattempt to be named promachos. Grinwoody cornered me, my lord, and\ncommanded me to get you. He refused to believe that I didn’t know where\nyou were.”\nThere were tricks to ruling, tricks to winning and maintaining loyalty\nthrough even the fiercest fire. Gavin sometimes forgot that those were as\neffective on those who knew you well as on strangers. Karris was right:\nGavin too often let those closest to him get the worst of him. So he drew a\nblack line between himself and his worries and focused all his attention on\nthe woman before him. “Marissia,” he said. “That’s no problem. You’re\nmarvelous. Superlative. If I make it through today without going to prison\nor the headsman, buy yourself something really, really nice.”\nShe grinned. “As my lord commands.”\nHer joy lifted him. He was the Prism. He was Gavin Guile. What could\nhe not accomplish in a year?\nChapter 87\n“There are rumors you fought off an assassin last night,” Andross Guile\nsaid."

What could\nhe not accomplish in a year?\nChapter 87\n“There are rumors you fought off an assassin last night,” Andross Guile\nsaid.\n“An assassin?” Gavin asked. He’d barely been able to get down here\nwithout being seen. He’d been tempted to use the shimmercloaks again, but\nhe wasn’t bringing those within a hundred paces of his father. Andross\nwould know, somehow.\nHis father was sitting in the hellstone-dark room, but Gavin remained\nstanding. He didn’t want to be here any longer than necessary.\n“There’s another that you threw her off the balcony because she\nwouldn’t indulge your curious perversions. Oh wait, I started that one.”\nAndross Guile grinned mirthlessly.\n“And who’d you spread that to? The mice? You’re a shut-in.”\n“You think me toothless because I’m old?” Andross Guile asked.\nThat is generally when people lose their teeth. “I think you’re opposing\nme for no good reason other than to show you can. And it infuriates me, as\nit would you, were you in my shoes.”\n“You are a stupid, stupid boy. How long have I been directing you?\nWhen have I done anything for no reason?”\nGavin was silent.\n“You will marry, Gavin. Within the week. I’ve decided that—”\n“Did you send that girl?”\n“Pardon?”\n“Did you send Ana Jorvis to my room last night?”\n“That fool slattern was either trying to seduce you to salvage her\nfamily’s chance at winning the marriage with you—which I’d already told\nthem they’d lost—or…” Andross Guile shrugged. “Or she really was an\nassassin. I heard a rumor that the Order is recruiting young girls. Or perhaps\nshe just thought you would finally succumb to her girlish lusts, which, as I\nheard it, you did, didn’t you?”\n“I thought…” No. Gavin wasn’t going to talk to his father about whom\nhe bedded, or wanted to.\n“Ha! All cats are gray in the dark?” When Gavin didn’t respond, the Red\nsaid, “Tisis Malargos, you’ll marry her. One week. It’s not ideal, but there’s\nwar coming, and everyone who matters is already here. It will save me a\nfortune, anyway. And we need allies badly. Why’d you have to throw that\ngirl over the damned rail, anyway?”\n“It was an accident,” Gavin hissed.\nThe Red sat back in his chair, a look of triumph spreading over his face.\n“So you did throw her.”\nHe said it like it was new information. Gavin cursed. Cursing was safe.\n“How’d you get to the Blackguards? How’d you get them to lie for you?\nI tried to buy off those boys myself—did you already own them?” Andross\nGuile asked.\nThey’d lied for him. Gavin and Gill Greyling had lied for him.\n“Pretty good lie, too: You, furious at being duped, shouting. She panics.\nShe jumps. You blame yourself and flee. It doesn’t defuse the enmity the\nJorvises will feel, but it saves you from impeachment, and there were too\nmany witnesses for you to have them swear she jumped off some lower"

Which brings us back to our need for allies.”\nThe weight of grace was a punch to the face. Totally unexpected, totally\nundeserved. Ana had been a fool, but she didn’t deserve death, and death\nwas what Gavin had given her. Orholam have mercy.\nGavin took a deep breath. He took those feelings, boxed them up, and\nput them aside. I’ll mourn you later, Ana, and make recompense to your\nfamily, you damned harlot. I’m sorry.\nToday would be a test. If he could make it through five more minutes\nwith his father, he might make it through today. If he could make it through\ntoday, he might live another month. If another month, a year was possible.\n“No,” Gavin said.\n“And next time, for Orholam’s sake, how about a little self-control?”\n“Self-control is for those who can’t control others,” Gavin said. Then he\nrealized who’d taught him that: this grimly smiling man. “The answer is\nno.”\nAndross Guile said, “You appear to be laboring under the mistaken\nassumption that I’m giving you a choice.”\n“No mistake: No.” Gavin kept his voice level, civil, firm.\n“If you choose not to obey me, you’re choosing for me to disown you.”\nThe threat literally took Gavin’s breath away.\n“You think I can’t? You think because you’re my only child that I\nwon’t? I’m not too old to have other children, you know. It was your mother\nwho couldn’t, after Sevastian. If you don’t marry Tisis Malargos, I will. It’s\nthat simple. I don’t know if she’d hate being married more to you or to me.\nDoesn’t matter. She’s a loyal girl. Loyal to her family. Practical. She’ll do\nwhat she has to. An example you would do well to follow.”\n“So you don’t need me?” Gavin said. “I’m the Prism. You think getting\nmoney is going to be hard for me? You think I’ll lack for anything? You\nreally want to start a fight with me?”\n“Start it? If you hadn’t been so busy fucking that little girl, I think you’d\nhave noticed we’ve already started.”\n“What have you done?” Gavin asked.\n“I made you, boy. In every way.” Andross Guile sank back into the\ncushions of his chair. “You want to cross me? Look to what you love.”\nChapter 88\n“I heard that the wights are using hellhounds,” Ferkudi said. “In Atash.”\n“And I heard the Eternal Flame in Aslal burned bright blue for two\nmonths straight!” Yugerten said. He was a gangly boy, and ranked low. No\none paid much attention to him.\n“Anyone can make a fire burn blue,” Ferkudi said. “I’m talking\nhellhounds!”\nThe scrubs were walking together as a class to go do another real-world\ntraining. They didn’t know any of the details yet, but after oversleeping,\nKip had barely caught up with them before they got to the really bad\nneighborhoods."

They didn’t know any of the details yet, but after oversleeping,\nKip had barely caught up with them before they got to the really bad\nneighborhoods.\n“Burning dogs, made of luxin?” Teia asked dubiously.\nKip was trying to see who was watching them as they walked through\nincreasingly narrow streets to Overhill.\n“Hellhounds are a myth, Ferk,” Tanner said.\n“The man who told me wouldn’t lie,” Ferkudi said.\n“Think, you moron, you’re a drafter,” Tanner said. “How would you\neven do such a thing? You could make a statue of a dog out of red luxin, but\nit wouldn’t do anything, would it?”\n“Well, I don’t know. I guess not,” Ferkudi said.\n“They’re not made of luxin,” a voice interjected quietly. “But they are\nreal.”\nIt was Trainer Fisk.\nThe boys fell silent, looked at each other.\n“The wights infuse red luxin into the coat and skin of a dog. They do it\nfor practice, before they try it on themselves. It’s a cruel, cruel thing, and\nworse is to set them on fire. But I’ve seen it happen. I saw Commander\nIronfist put one down when we were cleaning up the wights from the False\nPrism’s War.”\nTheir respect for Commander Ironfist jumped up a few more rungs on\nthe ladder to pure worship.\n“But wouldn’t a dog who’d been set on fire be just as likely to kill the\nmen who sent it as that man’s enemies?” Kip asked. “I’d think it would just\ngo crazy.”\nTrainer Fisk spat. “Dammit, Breaker. It would be you, wouldn’t it?”\n“What?” Kip asked. He still wasn’t used to being called Breaker.\nBut the trainer said nothing as they entered a small square and passed\ndirty merchants who stared at them with open hostility. This was a Tyrean\nneighborhood, but the people here didn’t see a Tyrean when they looked at\nKip, they saw only a Blackguard whelp.\nWhen they’d passed out of the square and into the next street, Trainer\nFisk said, “There’s kinds of drafting we don’t talk about much with younger\ndrafters, because we lose enough of you as it is, and everyone thinks she’s\nspecial and tries the things that we tell you not to try. But you all are going\nto be warriors, and maybe sooner than we’d like, so you deserve to know\nwhat’s out there.”\nIf he hadn’t had everyone’s attention before, he did now. The class\nbunched around him, hanging on every word.\n“Breaker’s right. You light a dog on fire, it’ll go crazy. But drafting is\nabout Will. You know that we use Will for everything we draft, that Will\ncan cover over mistakes we make in matching wavelengths. Lots of theories\nas to how it really works, but basically, you can infuse your own Will in\nyour work.”\n“Golems?” someone said.\nTrainer Fisk grimaced. “Are almost impossible.” He looked like he was\nsorry he’d started down this road. He looked at the girl who’d said it.\n“You’re a blue monochrome, Tamerah. If you made a golem, it would just"

If you made a golem, it would just\nsit there in its harmonious blue-ness. A green golem would be totally\nuncontrollable, as has been demonstrated scores of times. They reject rules\nand control to the extent that they kill the foolish drafters who create them.\nSo you have to be at least a bichrome to even attempt a golem, and they\npretty much always go horribly wrong. Point is, for the question at hand,\nyou can cast your will onto a living creature—in this case dogs. Usually\nthose who’ve broken the halo—or plan to do so—will experiment on\nanimals first to see how they might successfully change their own bodies.\nHellhounds are one permutation of that.”\n“Permutation?” someone asked.\n“Version!” Ferkudi said. “And shut up.”\nTrainer Fisk went on, reluctantly. “Infuse a dog with lots of red luxin,\nsend enough Will into it to make it run at your enemies, and light it on fire.\nIt’s a sick and horrible way to die. They howl in pain and rage, impelled to\nattack even when they’re so far consumed by the flames that you can’t\nbelieve they’re still moving. If you ever have to face one, take the legs off\nfirst, and then the head. That usually does it.”\n“Usually?” Ferkudi said, astounded.\n“Enough of that,” Trainer Fisk said. “Today, we’re inviting trouble. As\nbefore, know that some of you may not come back from today’s exercise.\nOf those who do, some of you may come back maimed. You may be\nknocked out of the Blackguard before you even get in, scrubs, and through\nno fault of your own.”\nIt was like being dunked in cold water. The levity and wonder of the\nmoment before was dashed.\n“We can expect that the gangs have heard about the exercise the other\nweek, and we can expect that they’re looking forward to having another\nshot at you. Here’s the setup: the top two teams will be teams of six. Five of\nyou are Blackguards, one of you is a Color. The bottom team will be nine.\nAs always, it is hard to stay on top. Those of you who are Blackguards are\nnot allowed to draft. Your Color is allowed to draft but not allowed to fight.\nThe Color will be carrying a purse with forty danars in it. Enough to attract\nsome serious problems for you, but not enough to start a riot. We hope. The\nolder classes and several full Blackguards will be along the route. If you\nneed help, you call out for it, and they’ll come. If you call for help, you fail\nand everyone in your team drops three places, but being a Blackguard\nmeans knowing when to beat a retreat. You start from here, the test is over\nwhen you cross the Lily’s Stem. Got it?”\nThe scrubs nodded.\n“First up, Teia and Kip, Cruxer and Lucia, Aram and Erato. Kip, you’re\nthe Color.”\n“Why does Kip get to be the Color?” Aram asked. Little bastard.\nTrainer Fisk’s jaw tightened for a fraction of a second, then he said,"

Our current Prism notwithstanding, usually the man\nor woman you guard is older, slower, and a worse fighter than you are. Part\nof what we do is deal with that, and protect them despite their weaknesses.\nThat good enough, Aram, or do I need to explain myself to you further?”\nAram scowled, looking away.\nIt wasn’t a bad team, Kip thought. Out of the twenty-one scrubs still left,\nCruxer was first place, Teia was seventh place, Aram was eleventh but\ndeserved to be in the top five, and Erato was ninth but deserved to be about\nfifteenth. Kip was fifteenth—and deserved to be about twenty-third—but\nthat was neither here nor there. Cruxer’s partner, Lucia, was ranked twenty-\nfirst. She was smart, pretty, and well liked, with short wiry hair and a heart-\nstopping smile, but not much of a fighter. No killer instinct. No matter how\nmuch extra training Cruxer did with her, she was probably going to fail out\nin the final test next week.\n“Kip,” Cruxer said. “You have any advice?”\nKip looked at Cruxer, shocked for a moment. Cruxer was a thousand\ntimes the man Kip was, and he was asking Kip for advice?\n“ ’Course he doesn’t. Just cause he’s Guile’s get doesn’t mean he’s got\nhalf the brain his father does,” Aram said.\n“Head three blocks north and five blocks up, and go from there,” Kip\nsaid quickly, flushing.\nCruxer said, “That’s not exactly a straight route, Kip.”\n“Not straight? It’s about as crooked as it could be,” Erato threw in. “I\ndon’t want to be in these slums any longer than I have to.”\nTrainer Fisk handed Kip the coin purse. “Go when you’re ready,” he\nsaid.\nAll of the approaches to this little wide spot between the houses and the\nwall were dark and narrow. There were men down every way, and no way\nto tell which curious eyes were hostile. Kip didn’t see children, and there\nwere few women. He guessed that meant the people here knew trouble was\ncoming.\n“Let’s go,” Aram said. “Straight south and we can cut to the main streets\nin just a few blocks. Come on!”\n“It’s not the distance that’s the problem,” Kip said.\n“Kip, you gotta give me a better reason than that,” Cruxer said. “We’ve\ngotta move. The longer we wait, the more time we’re giving—”\n“They’re right, Kip,” Teia said. “We only have to run a few blocks.”\n“I’m with Aram,” Cruxer said. “Let’s go! Wedge formation, don’t let\nanyone within arm’s length of Kip!”\nThey pulled Kip into a jog, and then suddenly he stopped.\n“I’m the Color,” he said.\n“No shit,” Aram said. “So stop making yourself an easy target!”"

Two blocks, two!” Cruxer said.\n“We could carry him,” Lucia said.\n“We’d give up two fighters to do that, at least.”\nKip was the Color. They were his guards. They had to protect him. It\nwas that simple. It wasn’t a matter of who was the best, or smartest, or who\nhad the highest rank, it was a matter of who was in control. And that was\nKip. He was not only in control, he was right.\nSo he turned and ran the other direction.\nMore than one oath followed him—words hot enough to blister his ears\n—but he wasn’t listening. In moments, they had surrounded him once more.\nThey jogged past a puzzled-looking Trainer Fisk and the rest of the scrubs.\n“It’s the gangs,” Kip said as they caught up with him. “We’ve got the\nTyrean gangs to worry about first. We cut north three blocks, and we’ll\ncross into Ilytian neighborhoods. Then we cut over into the markets, where\nthe guards don’t care where you’re from, they don’t want big armed gangs\ncoming through regardless. We skip back and forth between gang\nterritories, and they have to worry about each other instead of about us.” He\nhuffed. It was hard to talk while running. “Cruxer, give me your\nspectacles!”\nThe older boy handed him his blue spectacles. Kip held his own green\nspectacles up to his eyes first, and stared at the whitewashed buildings.\nFilling halfway up, he pressed that luxin into his right side, and drew in\nblue luxin and held it in his left arm.\nHe wasn’t prepared for what it did to him. The calming, cool rationality\nof blue hit the wild restlessness of green like cavalry lines crashing together.\n“Cruxer, you lead, you take it,” Kip said. He was blinking rapidly,\nshaking his head. His temples were knotting up, an instant headache\nblossoming, radiating down his neck. With an effort of will, he tried to\nseparate the luxins within him.\nThe alley ahead darkened as five men suddenly appeared, blocking it.\nThey were armed with clubs and chains. The scrubs crowded ahead of Kip,\nblocking his firing lanes.\n“Move or it’s on your own heads!” Cruxer shouted. He didn’t slow. The\nthugs blocking the alley didn’t move.\n“One and two!” Cruxer shouted, calling out his targets.\n“Four!” Lucia said.\n“Three!” Aram said.\n“Five!” Teia said.\nWhich, of course, left Kip doing nothing.\nOne was the biggest, a fat, hairy brute who took up the center of the\nalley. He stood flat-footed, head-on, certain that these children would slow\ndown. He must have weighed at least twice as much as Kip. He raised his\nclub."

He raised his\nclub.\nCruxer sped up at the last second, turning to do a slippery side kick, left\nfoot crossing behind his right, and then his right stabbing out with\nincredible force. It was a hard kick to do quickly when standing still, but its\npower was without equal. Kip had never seen anyone even try it when\nrunning.\nBut the kick was beautiful. It caught the fat man in the center of his\nchest and lifted his entire flabby mass off the ground, blasting him\nbackward as if he’d been hit by a cannon blast of grapeshot. His descending\nclub went spinning harmlessly away, and Cruxer was already uncoiling\nagain. A spinning back kick, effortlessly high, his heel crashing across the\nneck of number two—who went down in a heap, smacking himself with his\nown chain.\nTeia slowed down from her run before reaching her skinny opponent,\nbut she acted almost as quickly, feigning a punch at the man’s face, then\nkicking him in the groin. As he hunched over instinctively from the pain,\nhis face met her rising knee with explosive results.\nLucia tried to engage her own target, but that man was more worried\nabout Cruxer. Cruxer caught the man’s descending club in an X block,\nbrought his hands down to grab the man. But the thug snatched his hands\nback too quickly, barely holding on to the club.\nIt didn’t matter. Cruxer connected one of his shin-strikes across the\nman’s leg. The man went down, howling. Cruxer was on top of him in a\nmoment, standing with one foot trapping the man’s foot, and his other foot\non the man’s knee. He could cripple him in an instant just by shifting his\nweight.\nInstead, Cruxer looked over to the rest of them. Kip hadn’t even seen\nhow Aram had dealt with his opponent, but the man was down. None of the\nothers looked like they were going to put up any more fight.\nCruxer grinned, wild, elated, charming. It was the look of a boy who\ncan’t believe that all of his training actually works. That he is become what\nhe has always hoped to be. It was, Kip knew, an innocent look. He felt a\ngulf open between him and the older boy. Cruxer was a warrior-in-training,\nbut he wasn’t a warrior yet. Cruxer would be an excellent warrior, but he\nwas also a good man. He wouldn’t lose his excellence, but he would lose\nthis joy when he saw heads explode, when he watched friends try to hold in\ntheir life’s blood as it pumped out of their guts, when he listened to his\nenemies whimpering and shivering as they died too slowly.\n“Let’s go!” Cruxer said. “Lucia, you guard the back next time.”\n“Give me shooting lanes next time,” Kip said. “I’ve got luxin.”\nThey ran on. Kip was getting tired, but he realized that just a few\nmonths ago he wouldn’t even have been able to jog this far. Now he was\nkeeping up with the others. He’d still be the first to tire, and the first to quit,"

He’d still be the first to tire, and the first to quit,\nbut he wasn’t quitting yet.\nOn the next block, they caught sight of a group of maybe a dozen men,\ntrying to cut them off, and then stopping and cursing as the squad crossed\ninto the Ilytian neighborhood.\nIncredibly, they crossed through the Ilytian area with no trouble. Kip\ncould only guess that the gangs here hadn’t heard about them yet.\nThey didn’t cross through the market, though. Kip hadn’t realized how\nformidable his own group looked: the guards whom he’d thought would be\nunhappy to see an armed gang were definitely unhappy to see Kip and his\nfriends. So Cruxer turned them south again.\n“Men following,” Lucia said. “Five or six of ’em. Seventy paces back.”\nKip looked, and immediately felt dumb for doing it. Now they knew he\nknew. Stupid!\n“Kip? You know this neighborhood?” Cruxer asked.\n“Sorry.”\n“Anyone?” Cruxer asked. “If so, talk quick. I’m not feeling so great\nabout this.”\n“I’ve been here,” Aram said. “I think I can—Follow me.”\nHe led them for several blessedly uneventful blocks, and Kip started to\nthink they might make it back without any more fights.\nThen they rounded a corner. What had looked like it would lead to an\nopen, wide street was gated and chained. There was only the narrow street\nthey’d entered from, and one alley out of the wide space between houses. In\nthe alley, there had to be twenty men. Aram swore.\n“Anyone feel like dropping three spots?” Kip asked.\nNo one answered. That was a no. Not this close to the final test. They’d\ntake a beating if they had to, but none of them was going to just give up.\nKip stepped forward. He braced his feet.\n“Semicircle,” Cruxer said. “I got point. Kip, you stand on that rock, you\nshould be able to keep drafting while we fight. The rest of us, don’t let\nanyone into the middle of our semicircle.”\nThey formed up as Kip gathered his will. The men in the alley were\njogging forward now, constrained in the tight space. Kip didn’t know what\nhe was going to do until he was already drafting the big green ball into his\nfist. It was stupid. If he’d had the practicum, there would be a hundred\ndifferent things he could do that would work better—but he hadn’t. He\nknew how to do this. Fine. He was the ignorant boy from Tyrea who didn’t\nknow any better. He’d show them.\nThe ball swelled bigger than his head and Kip threw his hands forward\nwith a yell.\nThe green luxin ball shot out at chest level at great speed. For once, Kip\ndidn’t fall on his butt from the recoil. In the confines of the alley, the men\ndidn’t have anywhere to dodge. The ball glanced off a man in the front row\nand then ricocheted back and forth. Five or ten went down as the rest surged\ninto the open space."

He shot little blue balls at the charging men, low,\nat their legs. One man tried to jump the projectile, got tripped in midair and\nlanded on his face. Others took them in the knees, and the balls shattered,\nshooting glassine shrapnel through their clothing.\nIt was too much for simple street thugs. Even as they got into the range\nwhere Kip’s drafting would be useless and their own numbers would give\nthem the victory, the charge faltered. The thugs fled, not even pausing to\nhelp their injured.\nKip hurriedly put on his green spectacles—stupid! He’d forgotten to put\nthem on before the fight!—and drew in more green. He drafted another\ngreen ball into his hands and just held it there, trying to look threatening.\nThe injured pulled themselves to their feet and followed after their\ncomrades, but down the alley in the dark half-light between buildings, Kip\nsaw one thin figure standing alone, lifting something, peering around the\nwounded men staggering through the alley.\n“Kip,” Lucia said, clapping him on the shoulder. She was grinning,\nimpish, delighted. “You were amazing! That was the best—”\nFrom the alley, the briefest flash, a puff of white smoke lit from behind\nas Lucia stepped into Kip’s line of sight.\nSomething warm splashed over Kip’s face, blotted out his vision. He\nlost the green. Lucia fell into him heavily, but even as she hit him—in that\nfraction of a second—he knew something was terribly wrong.\nThey fell together. Kip caught her and she lay in his arms, half of her\nneck torn out by the musket ball, her body not yet aware death was a\nforegone conclusion, pumping blood, blood, blood.\nThey didn’t move. Someone shrieked. For once, even Cruxer didn’t\nknow what to do. Desperately, he pulled Lucia out of Kip’s arms and held\nher himself.\nWithin two minutes, the Blackguards arrived. Then it was orders,\ninvestigation, questions that Kip answered numbly. Blackguards armed with\nthe thinnest description ran to see if they could apprehend the murderer. Kip\nstood, dazed. Someone had given him a towel and rubbed much of the\nblood off his face. He was still holding that bloody towel, limply, standing,\nnot knowing what to do with himself.\nHe looked at Cruxer, still cradling Lucia’s body, weeping, and he knew\nthat the boy had been in love with her.\nOrholam have mercy.\nKip couldn’t stop thinking the stupidest thing: I didn’t even hear the\nshot.

She\nwalked past the practicum rooms, where she heard boys’ voices, cursing as\ntheir drafting failed. She checked his personal training room below the\ntower. Then she headed up to the ground floor. She crossed the Lily’s Stem,\ngoing against the flow of people who came in every morning with the dawn\nto work in the seven towers of the Chromeria, and cut down-island. She\nknew the other Blackguards had already fanned out across both islands,\nlooking for him. With war declared, none of them were happy to have their\nPrism off by himself with no guards. The big idiot.\nStill, Karris felt curiously alive. She felt as if, for the first time in years,\nshe had a future. Life felt possible now. Promising.\nShe made her way toward the east bay. The fishing boats were already\nout, though it was barely light. Men and women were pressing seaweed flat\nto dry in the sun. The tide was just coming in, and she saw several drunken\nsailors staggering back toward their ships, doubtless overindulging to\nfortify themselves for the weeks or months of privation they’d face on the\nsea.\nA gang of galley slaves, chained at their wrists to a long pole, were\nwalking together toward the same ships. They looked gaunt and dirty, with\nlong stringy muscles and no fat. One coughed a deep, unhealthy rattle as\nthey passed.\nA scent in the air arrested Karris, and she couldn’t help but stop at a\nlittle storefront she hadn’t been to in years. They kept slowly simmering\npots of kopi, and at this time of morning it was fresh and beautiful.\nEspecially when you’d been up most of the night.\n“Ah, my favorite Blackguard!” Jalal said. He was a round little\nbutterball of Parian. Karris thought he’d had more teeth the last time she’d\nbeen here. “Watch Captain…” He snapped his fingers.\n“White Oak,” she said, grinning.\n“Ah, yes! But I find redemption here!” He grabbed a cheap clay cup and\na fresh wedge of onion and ladled hot kopi into it. He poured out some of\nthe steaming hot liquid into a clean saucer, swirled it, put it back into the\ncup, and repeated the saucering until the kopi was the perfect temperature.\nThen he fished out the onion wedge and spooned in half a spoonful of\nIlytian sugar.\n“Brilliant,” Karris said. “You remembered.”\n“A kopi man never forgets.” He tapped his forehead with his index\nfinger thrice, thinking. “Ah, ah!” Then he produced the kind of small sweet\nroll that Karris liked. “Yes?”"

Exactly as she’d had\nyears ago, and the kopi was wonderful.\nShe paid, feeling enlivened by the stimulant and the food, and headed\ntoward Ebon’s Hill. There was an estate there that had a gorgeous view of\nthe bay and the rising sun. Dazen had shown it to her when they were first\ncourting.\nHe hadn’t knocked on the door or anything so civil. Instead, he’d shown\nher how to climb up onto the fence, and from there onto the bulbous dome\nroof of a neighbor’s house. It was quiet, peaceful, and for a young teenage\ngirl, it had felt naughty.\nThey’d kissed there for the very first time, after holding hands all night,\ntalking.\nHow was she going to broach the topic, though? “Gavin, you big idiot,\nI’ve known you’re Dazen for months”? No. She’d merely sit down next to\nhim, watch the sun rise, and then say, “I remember our first kiss here.”\nThe thought of throwing Gavin so far off kilter was more than a little\npleasing.\nTruth was, they were going to have to do a lot of work. A lot of the lies\nhe’d told her made sense to her now, but not all of them, and knowing why\nsomeone had lied to you was different than understanding it, different by far\nthan forgiving it.\nBut still, she was eager to start living. Scary as it was. Besides, he’d said\nhe loved her, hadn’t he? It wasn’t like she was going out on a limb.\nShe rounded the last corner and found herself on her ass, sitting on the\nground. It took her a moment to realize she’d been hit in the face. And then\na gang of men gathered around her, hitting, hitting, hitting.\nShe kicked, she swung, she screamed, but her training did little for her.\nThere were a dozen men, all big, and they’d sealed off any form of escape.\nHer speed was no use to her on the ground. Her weapons expertise no good\nwith her weapons torn away.\nHer rage was undercut by humiliation, fear. She was a Blackguard. How\ncould she let herself be taken off guard? How could she be so terrified? She\ntried to punch, tried to kick, but each of her limbs was trapped. She\nthrashed. A foot caught her in the kidney. Black stars exploded in white\nskies. She wasn’t supposed to be afraid; men were supposed to fear her. A\nface leaned close, saying something, and she whipped her head forward,\nshattering his nose, making his blood explode all over her. She twisted an\narm, shattered a man’s elbow. Then her head rebounded off the paving\nstones from a blow she never even saw. And then all emotions faded as she\nlost her grip on consciousness—and still the beating continued, continued,\ncontinued.\nChapter 90\n“Blackguards die. Death is our companion,” Commander Ironfist said,\naddressing the scrubs in one of their little training buildings. “Yesterday,\none of our own was killed. Lucia.”"

Death is our companion,” Commander Ironfist said,\naddressing the scrubs in one of their little training buildings. “Yesterday,\none of our own was killed. Lucia.”\nThe remaining twenty scrubs had been given the night off after Lucia’s\ndeath, but they had been told to be here in formation, first thing in the\nmorning, or be kicked out. All had come.\n“Lucia had little chance of making it into our company.” The\ncommander paused, letting that sink in. “That’s right. In the harsh light of\ndeath, other people lie. Other people lie because they fear death, and fear\nthat when they die, others will speak the truth about them. Our challenge is\nto live in such a way that the truth is no embarrassment. Lucia wasn’t a\ngreat fighter, but she was brave and she was honorable and she didn’t\ndeserve to be murdered by some coward with a musket. We’ll find him.\nWe’re out looking for him now. And when we find him, we’ll kill him. In\nthe meantime, we have work to do. We’re the Blackguard. We always have\nwork to do. Trainer?”\nTrainer Fisk came before the class, but Kip looked over to Cruxer. The\nboy’s face was like iron.\n“War will be your teacher,” Trainer Fisk said. “We’re going to war. As\nsome of you may know, the Spectrum has decided to send us to defend Ru.\nWe’ve seen it coming. Now it’s here. We’d planned to have two more\nweeks of training before we selected the trainees out of your class.\nEspecially after Lucia was killed. But Blackguards don’t stand still. Better\nwe don’t, anyway. The final round of testing is today. I know that some of\nyou might be beat up from fighting yesterday. Sorry. Tough. Your class is\ndown to twenty. Fourteen will become Blackguard trainees.” He paused.\n“Those of you who get cut, you can try again next season. And I hope\nyou will. Despite that we’re taking twice as many initiates as we usually do,\nthis has been an unexpectedly fine class. Your odds to pass next time are\nvery good. You’ll be seeded at the top of that class, above the legacies.” He\nscowled. “Now, all of you, to the grounds, double-time!”\nWhen they arrived, jogging smartly in line, Kip saw that there were\nperhaps two thousand spectators ready to watch them. Of those, maybe only\na third were full Blackguards or Blackguard trainees in the years ahead of\nKip’s class. Kip realized that he wasn’t winded from the jog. He was a long\nway from the physical condition the best students were in, but he was\ngetting stronger. Slowly.\nHe was also glad that Teia had told him today would probably be the\nfinal test. Kip had been able to hide the dagger in the Prism’s training room,\nso he didn’t have to wear it on his ankle. And no one could get in there.\nAs always, they took their places, and Trainer Fisk stood before them to\ngive them the rules. “You pick your colors. No spectacles. No weapons. As\nbefore, you can challenge three places above you. You win their token, you"

We know you want to win, and that\neverything is riding on these fights for some of you, but anyone who maims\nan opponent during testing will be kicked out. Understood?”\n“Yes, sir,” the scrubs said in unison. There was a current in the air, like\nbefore a lightning storm. This test separated scrubs from Blackguards. Even\nif they washed out or got injured before final vows, if they made it through\ntoday, they would forever have that rare badge of honor: Blackguard. Those\nwho were slaves who made it through today’s test would have their\ncontracts put in escrow by the Chromeria itself. Nothing would be allowed\nto interfere with their training until they washed out or stood to take their\nfinal vows and had their price paid by the Chromeria itself. The price they\ncommanded would make their masters wealthy, but the sale itself wasn’t\nvoluntary. They would be instantly in a different class. They would, of\ncourse, still owe their obedience to the Blackguard, and would serve until\nretirement. But even a Blackguard slave was a Blackguard. Internally, there\nwas no difference in duties or in privileges: a woman from a hundred\ngenerations of nobles like Karris White Oak served on exactly the same\nschedule as Pan Harl, whose ancestors had been slaves for eight of the last\nten generations.\nToday was everything.\nAs Kip and the others walked toward the ring they were each handed a\ntoken.\nTrainer Fisk said, “If you make it into the Blackguard, you will keep the\ntoken you win this week. Whichever token you have at final vows, you will\nkeep with you for life.” Trainer Fisk pulled out a necklace he wore and\nshowed them an old gold token with a four inscribed on it. “Those with the\nhighest numbers will be your lieutenants, initially. Now get in line.”\nKip got in line, an older trainee checking each name against the order\nlist, and giving the top fourteen fighters gold tokens, those below that\nbronze. On the front of each coin was a number in Parian script with a verse\nof some ancient text Kip couldn’t read. On the obverse was a fighter, each\ncoin bearing a different etching. But Kip’s coin was bronze, with an etching\nof a woman with a spinning staff on it and a Parian eighteen on the back.\nRaising his voice, Kip said, “Sir, I’m fifteenth place, not eighteenth.”\nThe entire circle got quiet. Not only the scrubs, but all the other\nBlackguards and Blackguard trainees. You didn’t contradict a trainer. And\nindeed, Trainer Fisk’s face darkened.\n“You didn’t check the list? Your cadre didn’t finish yesterday. All of you\nare bumped down three spots.”\n“That’s bullshit!” Kip said. He clapped a hand over his mouth.\nBlackguards guard their tongues.\n“You just lost a color for that, son,” Trainer Fisk said. “If you have\nanything else to say, you’ll forfeit. You want to do that?”\nKip swallowed. Shook his head."

Shook his head.\n“You’re counting our fight yesterday as a loss?” This time, the voice was\nCruxer’s. He came forward. “Did you see how Breaker fought? We made it\nthrough everything because of him. We won. There were only good\nneighborhoods left between where we were and where that bastard\nmurdered Lucia. I’m sorry, sir, but Breaker’s right. That is bullshit. You’re\nmaking it nearly impossible—”\n“Cruxer! You’re still a scrub, and if you don’t remember your place, so\nhelp me, I will bounce your ass out of here right this second,” Trainer Fisk\nsaid. “The mission was to bring the money back to the Chromeria. You\ndidn’t do it. No excuses. You failed.”\nKip had never seen Cruxer angry, much less furious, but the boy was\nnow. For a second, Kip thought Cruxer was going to punch Trainer Fisk. A\ntremor flew through the crowd like a plucked chord on a psantria. Every\nBlackguard here had been trained to anticipate violence, and every one of\nthem saw the same thing. But Kip stepped forward and put a hand on\nCruxer’s arm. “Orholam won’t let injustice long stand, right?” Kip said.\nCruxer was religious. Kip thought using a luxiat’s platitudes might\nredirect his classmate.\n“A fact we all would do well to remember,” Cruxer said. His tone was\nlevel, but his eyes didn’t leave Trainer Fisk’s. Then Cruxer turned.\n“So, who’s first?” Kip asked quickly. Oil on the waters, Kip, oil\nsmoothing troubled waters.\nTrainer Fisk glowered at him, then barked, “Winsen! You’re up! Who do\nyou challenge?”\nWinsen was twentieth among the scrubs. Mountain Parian, but without\ntheir usual tall, thin build. He had a fair amount of baby fat and was one of\nthe younger scrubs. He was an odd one—sometimes brilliant, sometimes\nterribly stupid. Teia thought that next year he’d be formidable. This year,\nthough, his odds of making it were terrible. Not someone to be scared of.\nKip scowled suddenly, realizing he was describing himself, too.\n“Breaker,” the boy said as they walked together toward the hellstone,\n“I’m going to stand still and try to draft. I’ll fail. Just shoot me hard with\none of those green balls of yours, would you? Knock the wind out of me.\nGet the submission.”\n“What?” Kip asked, incredulous.\n“Try to make it look good, would you?”\nThen Trainer Fisk was there. “Colors?” he asked.\n“What?” Kip asked. He felt like he didn’t understand anything.\nTrainer Fisk said, “It’s the final fight. Scrubs get access to all their\ncolors; well, minus one for you. It’s important that scrubs learn to deal with\ngood luck and bad in the previous testings, but we want this to be a fair test\nof your real fighting skill.

I know you drafted red that once, but you’ve\nnever declared it.”\n“Oh, right!” Kip said. In his talks with Teia, they’d agreed that Kip\nshould keep his polychromacy a secret as long as possible. Of course, if he\nkept it secret too long, he’d simply lose a fight that he could have won. Ante\nup and play. “Um, blue and green will be fine. So if I lose one… I’ll keep\ngreen.” It was possible that not everyone remembered him using red weeks\nago in his fight with Ferkudi, or thought it a fluke, and if Kip kept fighting\nwithout other colors, he might confirm that speculation and give himself an\nedge later.\nWinsen and Kip took their places in the dark. They pressed their fingers\nto the hellstone pillar to make sure they were drained of luxin, though\nTrainer Fisk didn’t press their fingers down very hard. Then they stepped\nback, and a few moments later the shutters dropped from the colored\ncrystals overhead and the circle was lit in blue and green spotlights.\nWondering if Winsen was setting him up somehow, Kip nonetheless\ndrafted his trusty green bouncy ball of doom. He really needed to figure out\nmore drafting techniques. He was supposed to be some kind of polychrome,\nand though the little bit he was doing with Teia and Ironfist had hardly\ntaught him anything new, it was making him better at what he already knew,\nbut he wasn’t sure that would be enough. Strange how in becoming a\ndrafter, it seemed like the last thing he had time to do was—\nAcross from him, Winsen had a blue staff forming in his hands. It was\nalmost finished when he lost it. The luxin shimmered and broke apart,\nleaving Winsen stunned for one second.\nThe green ball was ready; Kip shot it straight into Winsen’s gut.\nThe boy was struggling to draft again and Kip’s ball blew through his\nhands, making him lose whatever he’d been drafting. He woofed and fell\ndown, gasping, as if the wind had been knocked out of him.\nKip ran to the boy and put a foot on his neck. A whistle shrieked and a\nscattering of polite applause greeted Kip’s victory.\nKip helped Winsen stand. The boy hung his head. “Thanks,” he said,\nthough, no sorrow in his tone.\n“What the—What was that?” Kip asked.\n“Don’t say anything to the trainer,” the boy said quickly. “I’m a slave,\nBreaker. My owner needs the money he’d get from me making it in. He\nneeds it bad.”\n“And?” Kip said. So you throw the match?\n“And fuck him.”\nThe boy might not get another chance to get into the Blackguard.\n“Do me a favor, would you?” Winsen said. “Get in. If I lost to a guy\nwho eventually got in, it’s not so bad.”\n“Do my best,” Kip promised. “Hey, Winsen? How good are you?”\nWinsen grinned. “On a good day? Top five. Light to you, Breaker.”"

Light to you, Breaker.”\nThey parted, Winsen heading toward an aghast, weeping noble. Kip\nwould have felt sorry for the owner if he didn’t know that for some reason\nWinsen hated the man enough to jeopardize his own future. And Winsen\nseemed like a good person.\nIt was a good reminder. Kip thought he was at the center of everything.\nEverything was about Kip—and there were tragedies and comedies passing\nright before his eyes that he didn’t even see.\nNineteen was up next, and given that she was directly below Kip, he\nfigured he’d get a rest. Nineteen was a girl named Tufayyur, and she was\nranked appropriately, so far as Kip and Teia could guess. So she’d try for\nsixteen and then thirteen. Getting lucky twice was a lot more likely than\ngetting lucky three or four times.\nKip took his place in the numbered line, starting to plot his own line of\nchallenges. He wished that he had gotten to stand next to Teia, so he could\ntalk it over with her. She understood this all better than he did. But then\nTufayyur came to stand in front of him. “I challenge Kip,” she said.\nWhat? Kip looked at her in disbelief and she shrugged. He followed her\neyes to who was above him—Barrel and Balder. A flash of understanding\nilluminated the outlines of something bigger going on, but Kip lost it.\nHe was the sensible challenge, he supposed. Again. He’d been planning\non skipping Barrel and Balder himself. Neither of them should have been\nplaced so low. He thought they should both be in the top fourteen.\nBut he had to go out to the middle of the ring again. If he lost once, he\nwas out. Just like that.\nThe crowd didn’t even fall silent for these early fights. Kip couldn’t\nblame them, watching the worst fighters who won’t even make it in isn’t\nterribly interesting.\nThey went to the hellstone, and then took their place. The spotlights\ncame on, blue and green, but Tufayyur wasn’t interested in drafting. She\ncharged. She aimed a kick at the side of Kip’s head and he saw an opening\nto go for the knee of her other leg with a sharp low kick of his own—but\nthat was a crippling blow. He hesitated. He absorbed her kick instead, his\nhesitation earning him ringing ears.\nShe used the opening to punch him in the face twice, light and fast, but\nenough to stun him.\nKip staggered backward. She hit him in the stomach, kicked for his\ngroin—he barely deflected the latter with a knee but still took the shot in his\nthigh. She punched for his face again, but he ducked into the blow and her\nfist smashed against his forehead.\nShe yelped, but didn’t stop. As he hunched, she threw flurries of blows\nat him. Then she snagged his arm and went for a submission hold.\nKip rushed into her and they both fell, as graceful as mating turtles."

Kip rolled on\ntop of her, angling the whole of his body weight onto her torso. He grabbed\none of her arms with both of his and then simply lay across her face.\nThe girl bucked, kicking her feet up to try to roll Kip off of her, but she\nwasn’t strong enough. With her free hand, she went for Kip’s nuts, but he\npressed his hip down, and she wasn’t strong enough to burrow underneath.\nShe jerked, trying to get her hand away, failing.\nThen she panicked, unable to breathe, flailing—and the whistle shrilled\nagain.\nThere was a smattering of applause and laughter as Kip stood and\noffered her a hand, but she snarled at him and stormed away. “Way to go,\nfatty!” one of the older Blackguard trainees shouted.\nKip walked back to his spot, already tired, and was surprised to see\nCommander Ironfist himself waiting for him at the rail.\nOh, thank Orholam. Now that Gavin was back, the commander was\ngoing to march in and say, “Breaker is a special case. He’s in, regardless,”\nand Kip wouldn’t have to go through the humiliation of getting his ass beat\nby fighters who weren’t even going to be in the Blackguard.\nAs usual, the scrubs leaned in toward him, but the commander gave flat\nlooks to a few and they all melted back. Kip came to stand before him. The\ncommander’s jaw was set and he looked so quietly intense that Kip\nswallowed.\n“You think it’s different because he’s back?” the commander asked,\nclearly referring to Gavin, but not so much as gesturing toward the tower.\nOthers would be watching. “It’s not. You’re still on your own,” Ironfist said.\nThen he left.\nKip licked his lips. “Yes, sir.”\nAnd Kip was up next. He looked at the lineup. Some good luck, anyway,\nright? A tiny bit. He could skip over Barrel and Balder and take on Yugerten\nat fifteenth place. If anything, Yugerten should have been nineteenth or\ntwentieth. Kip had a good chance, right? Sure.\nTaking his challenge token, Kip brought it to Yugerten and set it on the\nrail in front of the boy, who didn’t look surprised at all.\nKip took his time getting out to the circle, trying to catch his breath. He\nsaw Teia scowling, thinking.\n“We got a lot of fights today, Breaker. Get a move on,” Trainer Fisk said.\nYugerten was tall but gangly and awkward, a monochrome blue. The\nboys took their spots, weighing each other. Then the lights went out—and\nback on, blue and green.\nKip drafted green as quickly as he could, and Yugerten seemed content\nto stand back and draft, too. But when Kip shot out a green ball, Yugerten\ndodged and straightened a moment later, having drafted a pair of t-batons."

He stepped and punched for Kip’s stomach. The\nother end of the baton extended beyond his fist, and it stabbed Kip’s\nstomach hard.\nHeaving forward, Kip deflected the follow-up punch and it only grazed\nhis jaw rather than tearing his head off, and Yugerten lost one of the t-\nbatons.\nHe let it go and punched Kip again. Kip tried to keep his balance and\nfailed; he fell and Yugerten was on top of him in a moment, sitting on his\nchest, using his remaining baton to choke him.\nKip got one hand in front of his neck, but Yugerten was using both of his\nhands and all his weight to press down. Kip kept hoping the blue would\nshatter. Blue wasn’t supposed to be good for this, but it didn’t. He punched\nwith his free hand, caught a shoulder. Punched, glanced off Yugerten’s\nforehead. Punched, weaker.\nThe world was turning dark, stars blooming in Kip’s vision. He couldn’t\nbreathe. He was staring into the spotlight—\nHe flooded blue luxin around the entirety of Yugerten’s t-baton. He\nfound the seals on the baton and opened them. The baton dissolved\nsuddenly in a small cloud of chalk and resin.\nWithout the thing he’d been putting all of his weight on, Yugerten\npitched forward, straight into Kip’s forehead, and instantly went limp.\nKip rolled the boy off of him and stood.\nWhen Yugerten was revived, there was applause.

She wasn’t the greatest fighter, but she was an excellent drafter.\nKip hoped she made it in.\nThat meant Kip had to go for number twelve, Erato, one of Aram’s\nfriends. Erato was actually the worst fighter out of Aram’s friends, quick but\nunimaginative, so it was strange that she was the highest-ranked.\nKip paled, looked at the places again. If he and Teia had ranked\neveryone in the class correctly in their conversations, this was all wrong.\n“You going to stand there all day, or are you going to challenge\nsomeone?” Aram asked. “Please pick me.”\nFighting Aram was suicide, even if Kip did want to wipe that smirk off"

No. Kip wasn’t seeing it. He needed a new perspective. The\nlight in between the fights was full-spectrum—and so was Kip, right? He\ntightened his eyes and drafted superviolet. Superviolet was supposed to be\nalien, aloof, apart—and arrogant.\nOh shit. Kip forgot that the first time you draft a color, it exerts a lot\nmore control over you. He walked up to Erato and slapped his challenge\ntoken down. “Trade you my bronze for your gold,” he said.\nErato laughed at him.\n“Colors?” Trainer Fisk asked.\n“Green and yellow,” Erato said.\n“None,” Kip said.\n“What’d you say?” the trainer asked.\n“I don’t need any colors to throw out this trash.”\n“Ooh-hoo!” Erato said, her eyes gleaming.\n“You get a bonus if you’re the one who knocks me out?” Kip asked.\nHer face went blank, stricken, for half a moment. Then she said, “What\nare you talking about?”\n“Do you have any idea how much smarter I am than you?” Kip asked.\nAll emotions but hatred drained out of her face. “I’m going to enjoy this,\nBreaker.”\nThey took their places in the middle of the large circle. It was twenty\npaces across. Stepping out for more than five seconds would result in\ndisqualification. Neither of them had spectacles. They would get pure light\nfrom the great colored crystals above the huge underground chamber.\nTrainer Fisk examined each of them in turn to make sure they hadn’t\nalready drafted, being more careful now that they were in the fights that\nmattered. “Eyes, palms.” Satisfied, he stepped back and gestured that the\ncrystals above be covered. He put their fingers on the hellstone, but didn’t\npress hard enough—as he hadn’t before.\nTaking a deep breath, Kip rolled his shoulders, shook his head,\nloosening up. He took his spot across from her in the darkness.\n“And… go!” Trainer Fisk shouted.\nThe shutters over the crystals dropped open.\nKip charged. He didn’t try to draft the green or the yellow light\nstreaming over him. Instead, he threw one hand forward and shot out the\nsuperviolet luxin he’d already drafted, poking Erato in both eyes.\nShe staggered backward, crying out, holding her eyes, plans blown.\nThen Kip, sprinting, jumped straight at her, spearing her stomach with\nhis head. She went down hard, air whooshing out of her lungs.\nLanding on top of her, Kip scrambled to his feet and picked up the\nprostrate girl by the waist of her trousers and her collar, ran her to the edge\nof the circle, and heaved her out of it.\nKip heard gasps in the crowd, and a few claps. Trainer Fisk counted out\nthe five as Erato struggled to get to her feet and failed, then called it.\n“Breaker wins! Take Erato to the infirmary. Breaker, you have one minute"

Breaker, you have one minute\nuntil your next fight.” He came closer and lowered his voice. “So you can\nuse superviolet now?”\n“A little, sir.”\n“You know you’re not supposed to pack luxin.”\n“Someone taught me to use every advantage and surprise I have.” That\nsomeone, of course, was looking at him.\n“You got it past me, but it won’t happen again, Breaker. Smart not to\ndeclare your polychromacy, but you won’t always get lucky and have\nopponents use your colors. Hope you’ve got other tricks.”\n“Always, sir,” Kip said. Inside, he thought, Me, too. He shook out the\nlast of the superviolet. The arrogance there hadn’t cost him—but it should\nhave. No colors? How stupid was he?\nTrainer Fisk said, “Also, never do that spearing thing again. You’ll break\nyour damn neck.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Breaker, come here,” Cruxer shouted. He stood at the edge of the\ncircle.\nKip came over.\n“You’re not safe yet, you know that, right?”\n“I know. I’ve got to win one more.”\n“You have a plan?” Cruxer asked.\n“Might not be a good one,” Kip said. “I…” He trailed off. He looked\nagain at the placement. He was number twelve now. He had to finish the\nday at fourteen or better to stay in, but after he fought, everyone below him\ngot to fight next. So if he won one more fight, he was safe, but if he lost this\nfight, the next fighter would be Balder. From his spot at eighteenth, he\nwould challenge sixteenth, Yugerten, rather than take on his friend Aram at\nfifteenth. Yugerten had already failed out, so no problem there. Then Balder\nwould take on Tala at fourteen. She was a great drafter, but she wasn’t that\nfast, not yet. He’d take her out easily, clearing the path.\nFrom there, he could either challenge Kip or skip right past him and\nchallenge eleven.\nMaybe he’d even climb higher, but that didn’t matter. The only people\nwho could climb after Balder went were the lower-ranked Aram and Barrel.\nAll of Barrel’s fights could be against people who’d already lost. And\nhe, too, could skip right past Kip.\nThen Aram would go, again only having to fight people who’d already\nlost until he got past Kip.\nIf Erato hadn’t bungled and lost to Kip, all four friends would still make\nit into the Blackguard training.\nThe more Kip looked at it, the more brilliant it seemed. Aram, Balder,\nand Barrel all belonged in the top ten. Even Erato was close. One or two of\nthem might easily get unlucky and come to the final testing lower than they\ndeserved, but all of them?\n“Kip, you look like you just swallowed a lemon,” Cruxer said.\nAnd all of them, despite finishing low, were in places from which they\ncould still make it into the Blackguard—and without ever being pitted"

If they’d made a pact to keep him out and\nhad grouped themselves thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth to make a\nceiling beyond which he couldn’t rise, the collusion would have been\nobvious. But this, this was subtle.\nHell, they’d guaranteed that twentieth and nineteenth places would both\nchallenge Kip, so if he’d been a good boy and lost, they wouldn’t even have\nhad to fight him at all in order to knock him out of contention, and even if\nhe won against nineteen and twenty, he’d be fatigued and easier to beat.\n“It’s a conspiracy,” Kip said quietly. “And they don’t even have to touch\nme.”\n“What?” Cruxer asked.\n“Cruxer, can I win against nine, or eleven?” Teia was at ten; he wasn’t\ngoing to take her on.\n“Anything can happen.”\n“How about against Aram?” Kip asked.\n“No.”\n“What happened to ‘anything can happen’?”\n“Not anything,” Cruxer said.\n“Kip, time’s up,” the trainer said. “Who are you challenging?”\nFor one mad moment, the green in Kip wanted him to challenge Aram—\neven though Aram was two spots below him.\nThat was stupidity. Kip could still be wrong. Or others might lose. It\ndidn’t have to be the way he’d foreseen.\n“Kip, challenge me,” Teia said, her tone flat.\nHe knew instantly what she meant. She’d let him win. He’d get in. It’s\nwho you know, not how good you are. Kip wanted to get in with his whole\nheart. They were going to bury him. But if he got in by cheating, it would\ntaint everything he ever achieved. He would be no better than Aram and his\nfriends.\nAnd if Kip and Teia got caught cheating—which the trainers always\nlooked for when partners sparred—both of them would get bounced. For\nhim, it would be embarrassing. For Teia, it would be a total disaster.\nYet she’d offered. She was a friend. A real friend. Better than he\ndeserved.\nKip stepped forward and challenged number eleven, Rig.\n“Kip!” Teia said.\nHe ignored her, didn’t look toward her at all even after he got into the\nring. He asked for superviolet and blue for his colors. Rig had red and\norange, but Kip knew he was finished. Red and orange weren’t helpful in\nthe kind of training fights the Blackguard did, because there was no safe\nway to light an opponent on fire. The training was naturally biased against\nRig, which meant that he could only be ranked so highly because he was a\ngreat physical fighter.\nIt wasn’t until Kip stepped into the ring that he realized an even worse\nblunder than picking Rig. He should have declared all colors. He had\nnothing to lose now. The whole point of not declaring the colors was so he\ncould use them on his last fight, and in his rash idiocy and false heroism,"

Teia had been trying to tell him—and he’d thought she was\ngoing to praise him for his nobility or something.\nThe whistle blew, and it went just as Kip expected. Rig would dart in\nand disrupt Kip every time Kip tried to draft, and soon he closed and they\ngrappled. Rig slipped behind Kip, keeping his face down and batting aside\nevery attack Kip tried with blue luxin until Kip was empty. Then Kip did\nthe only thing he could think of: he filled Rig’s mouth and nose with\nsuperviolet while imprisoning his hands.\nBut the boy didn’t panic, didn’t move: he snapped the superviolet with\nhis tongue and teeth and choked Kip out.\nAnd just like that, Kip’s future was out of his own hands. He was twelfth\nout of fourteen. Rig helped him stand up. “Nice try there, Breaker. Best of\nluck making it in.”\nBut Kip knew he’d already lost.\nChapter 91\n~The Master~\nTap. Tap.\nHurtled into the pitch blackness of the chamber, Kip still somehow knew\nexactly where everything was.\nI memorized the room. That was it.\nTap. Tap. Tap. And in. Boom.\nKip? Something about Kip? Why did that pass through my mind? I cock\nmy head to the side. Odd. Doubtless, the whelp is asleep on the deck,\nrecovering.\nI take my gloves off and try to suppress the rage that floods me at the\nsight of my hands.\nDamn them. Damn them all.\nThin threads of red luxin glimmer in the darkness, veins of fire through\nthe dross of my skin. I push back my hood.\nWhere is the boy hiding it? I’d had his room searched, hired pickpockets\nto jostle his tubby body. Nothing.\nRage crests and I ball my fists, clamping my eyes shut. I can feel the\nroom growing brighter, hotter. I’m going to make it to Sun Day. To hell\nwith it.\nI’m going to go now and find him. I’ll beat the boy to death, injured as\nhe is, if I have to. Maybe it is madness.\nMy hand is on the door before I remember my gloves and cloak. I pull\non the gloves and snarl at the brief reflection of a man limned in red fire in\nthe mirror. I pull the hood down and step into the hall.\n“Captain!”\nChapter 92\nKip went to stand by Teia and Cruxer. At their prodding, he explained his\nconspiracy theory, and then, together, they watched it play out, exactly as\nhe’d foreseen. Balder fought and beat Yugurten, then he fought and beat\nTala, and for a moment Kip thought the boy would challenge him—and\ngive him another chance—but instead, sneering, the boy challenged eleven\nand won.\nThat eleventh fight took a lot out of Balder, though, and he got smashed\nagainst nine. They reordered, and with Balder now at eleventh, Kip was\nmoved down to thirteenth place."

He fought as Kip had expected, too, skipping Aram\nand taking on fighters who were already out, and then skipping Kip, who\nspat at his feet. Barrel made it to twelfth, and lost to ninth.\nKip shuffled down to fourteenth. Aram challenged three up from\nhimself, fifteenth, which was Erato. She was already out no matter what, so\nshe conceded without fighting.\nAll Aram had to do was win one more fight, and if he did, Kip was out.\nHe came up to the bar and looked over the prospects, standing almost\ndirectly in front of Kip.\n“You coward,” Kip said. “You’re not smart enough to figure this out.\nWho did it? How much did they pay you to do this?”\nA flash of fury came over Aram’s face, quickly smoothed away.\n“You cheater,” Kip said. “What did you think, that you’re some modern-\nday Ayrad? Ayrad didn’t take money for what he did. He didn’t use a team.\nYou’re shit compared to him. You’re going to skip me. Me. The one you\nwere hired to block.

He strode off into the middle of the circle.\nCruxer was at Kip’s side an instant later. “Brilliant, now, Kip, after the\nback kick, Aram likes to throw a roundhouse punch, either stomach or face.\nHe gets a lot of power into that thing, but if you can sidestep and come in,\nhe’ll be wide open.”\n“I’ve seen it,” Kip said. “I’m just not fast enough to take advantage of\nit.”\n“Time!” Trainer Fisk announced. “Come forward.”\n“Anything else?” Kip asked Cruxer. “Please.”\n“He’s a fast drafter, too,” Cruxer said weakly. “Watch out for that…\nYou’re lucky, though, right, Breaker?”\n“Very.”\n“Breaker, forward or out!” the trainer shouted.\n“That’s something then,” Cruxer said.\n“I didn’t say it was good luck.”\nKip turned to walk into the center of the circle.

A ripple of recognition passed through the assembled\nBlackguards and trainees as someone came to the front rows to watch.\nGavin. Gavin was here. Prism Gavin Guile himself had come to see his son\ntest.\nAnd Kip was about to fail.\nOf course he’d come now. Of course he couldn’t have come early\nenough to see Kip win the earlier fights. To see Kip do clever things. No, he\ncame now, when Kip was out of ideas and out of luck. Just in time for Kip\nto shame him.\n“Are you ill, Breaker?” Trainer Fisk asked.\nOh, and of course the Prism sat next to Commander Ironfist. Might as\nwell let everyone down at once. Beautiful.\n“I’m envisioning a great victory,” Kip said.\n“You arrogant little shit,” Aram said, sneering.\n“I didn’t say it was mine,” Kip said.\n“Huh?”\n“Not my… victory. Look, jokes don’t work when you have to explain\nthe—Forget it.”\n“Are you calling me stupid?” Aram asked.\nUm, no, but shoe fits.\n“I am going to punish you, Kip.” Aram said it in such a way that he\nclearly intended using Kip’s birth name to be offensive. Which it wasn’t.\n“I think we really don’t understand each other at all,” Kip said.\n“Enough!” Trainer Fisk said. “Colors?”\n“Green and yellow,” Aram said.\n“All colors,” Kip said. No reason to hold back now.\n“You’re claiming to be a full-spectrum polychrome, Breaker?” Trainer\nFisk asked.\nThere was a right answer here. “Um. Yes?” Kip asked.\n“Bad time to announce that,” Trainer Fisk said.\n“What?” Kip asked. He’d thought it was the perfect time to announce it.\n“Full-spectrum polychromes have such advantages over normal drafters\nthat the Blackguards long ago established that to test their actual ability to\nbe a Blackguard, they must be limited to share whatever colors their\nopponent chooses, plus one.”\n“What?” Kip said. “So by my saying I could draft more colors, you give\nme less?”\n“Precisely.”\n“Well that’s bull—” Kip stopped, barely.\nTrainer Fisk arched an eyebrow.\nKip scowled. “That’s very hard to take,” he said. He cleared his throat.\n“And I don’t think it’s fair.”\n“I don’t think it’s fair, the Prism’s bastard says. You little bitch,” Aram\nsaid. “You shouldn’t even be here.”\n“Aram, I don’t know who bought you off, but I’m going to crush your\nface,” Kip said. “You’re going to beat me today. No doubt. But I’ll be\nback.”\n“I’m going to hurt you, Kip. I’m going to make you blubber like the fat\nlittle piggy you are.”\n“Fuck you,” Kip said.\n“Breaker,” Trainer Fisk said, “you are right on the line. Say one more\nword and you lose your extra color.”\n“Word,” Kip said."

You lose your extra color.\nYou know, boy, you have a choice: are you going to be Kip the Lip, the\nloser who always has the last word, or are you going to be Breaker? I think\nyou’ve made your choice for today. Maybe when you come back in six\nmonths you’ll be grown up enough to choose differently.” Trainer Fisk was\nseething. He turned to the crowd. Why was he so angry? Why was he so\nhostile suddenly?\nKip the Lip. He’d said Kip the Lip. Where—\nAndross Guile. That would also explain why Trainer Fisk was so angry.\nHe wasn’t angry at Kip; he was angry about Kip. Andross Guile was forcing\nTrainer Fisk to make it as hard as possible for Kip to pass—forcing Trainer\nFisk to betray his oaths. It didn’t matter how. What mattered was that Kip\nwas making what Andross Guile had asked Trainer Fisk to do all too easy.\nThe trainer didn’t even look at Kip now, as he announced, “Kip Guile has\nclaimed to be a full-spectrum polychrome. There hasn’t been one of those\nin the Blackguard for seventy years. There are rules. We’ve consulted them.\nBecause of their innate advantages, full-spectrum polychromes get to\nchoose only one color in addition to what their opponent chooses. For foul\nlanguage, Breaker loses that choice. The colors for this bout will be green\nand yellow.”\nIronfist’s gaze was like a millstone. Kip looked away, and found his\nfather’s. Gavin Guile looked disappointed already.\nDamn me. Damn me. Kip the Lip. I played right into his hands. Kip\nAlmost.\nThat’s who I am. Almost. I almost beat the Threshing, but I gave up. I\nwas almost a hero, but I chose cowardice instead. I almost saved my\nvillage. I almost saved Isa. I almost saved Sanson. But I didn’t even almost\nsave my mother. Hell, almost is generous. I haven’t almost avenged her. I\nswore I would. I took some little steps, telling myself I had to make it to the\nBlackguard to get access to the records in the library, but really, I’ve been\nhappy to forget her. Some son. Some loyalty.\nThey might have conspired to keep me out of the top fourteen, but could\nI have really made it on my own? Probably not. Would I have made the top\nseven? Definitely not. The only good things in my life are the things that\nhave been given to me. No wonder they hate me. I haven’t earned anything.\n“Why little Kip the Lip, are you crying?” Aram said.\n“I’m going to kill you, you motherfucker,” Kip said.\nA backhand cracked across Kip’s jaw, staggering him.

He didn’t even spit out the blood in his\nmouth, lest Trainer Fisk misinterpret it.\n“Trainer,” Aram said. “I’d like to withdraw one of my colors. I only\nneed green.”\nThe trainer nodded and gave the order. Then he said, “Hands.”\nEach boy in turn let his finger be pressed firmly on the hellstone and\nthen took their places, illuminated only in white light.\nThen the lights were shuttered.\n“And…” Trainer Fisk said. Kip started running forward. He thought he\nhad the timing just about perfect—“Go!”\nKip was already airborne as the lights came blazing on. Flying side kick.\nAnd miraculously, Aram was still standing right in line.\nThe boy’s eyes went wide and Kip’s foot slammed into his shoulder and\nchest. It launched Aram backward.\nKip fell, but popped back up to his feet in a moment. Aram had been\nshot all the way out of the circle. He rolled over, coughed, and for one\nmoment Kip thought he’d knocked the wind out of his opponent. If Aram\nwasn’t able to breathe for five seconds, Kip would win, just like that.\n“One!” Trainer Fisk shouted, starting the count.\nAram jumped back to his feet and rushed back into the circle. Kip met\nhim at the edge, determined to keep him out.\n“Two!”\nBack kick. It was fast. So fast Kip was lucky to jump backward out of\nits reach, which also meant he was safe from the follow-up punch, which\nalso meant Aram got into the circle with no problem.\nAnd there goes my chance.\nAram was still in pain, though, Kip could tell. Unless he was faking it to\nlure Kip into some kind of trap. On the other hand, why would he need to\nlure Kip into a trap? He had his color, speed, strength, and a lot more\ntraining.\nAs Kip moved in closer, Aram lashed out. A lightning-fast pop to Kip’s\nnose. Too fast to stop. It wasn’t hard, but it stunned Kip. Then Aram was on\ntop of him. Kip didn’t see the move that cut his feet out from under him, but\nhe fell on his side, hard.\nKip had gotten halfway up when Aram hit him with a green luxin baton\nacross the back.\n“Come on, Breaker!” someone shouted.\nKip struggled up to his knees again. And grunted as another baton\ncracked across his back. But he didn’t go down.\nHe saw the thought cross Aram’s mind: he could crack that baton across\nKip’s head and put him out. But a shot to the head might leave Kip an idiot,\nand that would get Aram barred from the Blackguard forever.\nFor once, the rules were helping Kip.\nNot knowing what else to do, Aram slammed the baton into Kip’s back\nagain. Harder."

Aram\nkneed Kip hard in the gut, but that only meant the older boy was off balance\nas Kip locked a foot behind his.\nKip landed on top of the boy, but lost him almost immediately.

Then\nsomething cracked and the green crystal overhead shattered, plunging them\ninto darkness and showering them with crystal rain. Kip had not only\nshattered the green filter, but also the mirror behind it that turned the light\ntoward the practice field. Cries of alarm went up from the crowd.\nKip was ready for the darkness—and Aram wasn’t. He lost his grip on\nthe open green luxin he’d been using as Kip’s manacles. The manacles\nbroke open and Kip slipped out of Aram’s grip and swung an elbow toward\nthe boy’s head that struck a glancing blow.\nThen Kip was on his feet. He relaxed his eyes into sub-red, and he could\nsee. Aram was on his feet, staring this way and that.\nKip slugged him in the stomach and stepped back quickly. Aram turned,\nrecovered, grunting. Kip slid to the left and punched the boy’s kidney.\nThen, too soon, someone in the crowd cracked open a mag torch. No!\nSomeone threw up a yellow flare. Kip tightened his eyes back to normal\nvision, and thought, Yellow, I can draft that if I’m—\nBut Aram’s first thought was martial rather than magical. He hit Kip in\nthe nuts and tripped him.\nKip’s face bounced off the dirt, and then he was crushed by Aram’s\nweight as the boy jumped on top of him.\nAram pummeled both of Kip’s legs, hard punches right in the sweet spot\nin the middle of the thigh, rendering them useless.\nPain is nothing, pain is nothing, pain is nothing."

And he’d failed them, but they gave him\nthis.\nHe took a towel, ostensibly to wipe up his blood. He covered his head.\nSomeone put an arm around him, and Kip saw his father.\n“Father,” Kip said. “I… if they hadn’t blown the whistle… I almost…”\n“The boy panicked, Kip. That grip he was going for is a neck-breaker.\nAnd I think he got it. If they hadn’t blown the whistle, when you hit the\nground, you’d have been dead.”\nAram had gotten the grip. Kip had felt Aram’s arms locking into place.\nIf Aram had killed him, Aram would have been kicked out of the\nBlackguard. Not that it would have done Kip any good at that point.\n“I failed,” Kip said, not quite daring to look out from under the towel\nover his head.\n“Yes,” Gavin said. “He’s better than you. It happens. Smart work with\nthe crystal there. It almost worked. Now come on, let’s go watch. It’s good\nto learn from those who are better than you are. Looks like your nose is\nbroken. Best to set it quick.”\nKip touched his nose gingerly. Oh, that was not the right shape for a\nnose. “Is that the thing where it makes that sound and I scream?”\n“Try not to,” Gavin said. Heedless of Kip’s sweaty hair, he reached\nbehind Kip’s head, holding him in place, and grabbed his nose, pulling on\nit.\nKip gasped, gasped, breathed. Orholam have mercy!\nBut he didn’t scream.\nSure, that’s the one thing I don’t fail today.\nHe followed Gavin to the bleachers, but the only part of what his father\nhad said that stuck with him was “almost” and “He’s better than you.”\nA green drafter chirurgeon brought superviolet-infused bandages and"

        "text": "had said that stuck with him was “almost” and “He’s better than you.”\nA green drafter chirurgeon brought superviolet-infused bandages and\ntended to Kip’s cuts as they watched the remaining fights. With tiny needles\nand thread of green luxin, the man stitched up Kip’s right cheek and left\neyebrow, then smeared stinging unguents on those and several other cuts.\nThen he gave him what Kip thought was far too modest a dose of poppy\ntea. Kip was glad he was sitting, because he didn’t think his legs were going\nto let him stand.\nAll in all, watching the fights was absolutely no good in teaching Kip\nanything because he couldn’t pay enough attention to learn. It was,\nhowever, a good distraction. Teia defeated a challenge, and then won two\nfights against boys who looked stunned at how fast she was. She ended up\nat seventh. Kip was proud of her. He could tell from her quiet grin that she\nwas proud of herself, too.\nThey watched until the end. Watching Cruxer fight was art. He’d been\nbumped down to fourth by their “loss” in the real-world testing, too. He\nchallenged third, second, and first—and won. Kip saw his father look over\nat Commander Ironfist, impressed. “He a legacy?” Gavin asked.\n“Third generation. Inana’s and Holdfast’s son.”\n“Should have guessed. They still alive?”\n“Inana is. She’s been holding on. For this.”\n“He’s amazing,” Gavin said. “He might even be better than you were.”\nIronfist raised an eyebrow.\nGavin grinned.\nIronfist grunted. It might have been assent. “If he lives long enough.”\n“I should go see Inana,” Gavin said. “She was a gem.”\nThe scrubs began lining up for the little ceremony that would see them\nbecome trainees. Kip’s stomach turned. “Can we go now?” he asked.\nGavin said, “This is your friends’ moment of triumph. Think about\nsomeone other than yourself. You turn your back on them now, and they’ll\nremember it forever.”\nKip blinked. Blinked. I’m a self-centered brat.\n“Yes, sir,” he said.\nCommander Ironfist got up and went forward. All the scrubs were lined\nup according to their placement in the top fourteen. Except for Cruxer, who\nwas down on both knees in the training circle, head bowed, one hand to his\neyes and forehead in the sign of the three and the one, praying.\n“Cruxer!” Trainer Fisk barked. He was standing in front of Aram at the\nbottom of the line, ready to pin the Blackguard pin to each scrub’s lapel.\n“Time to pray later.”\nThe scrubs were smirking, triumphant, accustomed to and amused by\nCruxer’s quirks. They all stood proudly, hands folded behind their backs,\nstances wide, chests out. All around the training ground, the older trainees\nand the full Blackguards were standing up, coming to attention themselves.\nStanding the same way.\n“Yes, sir.” Cruxer jumped to his feet and came toward the line. He was\nsmiling, but Kip thought it was a tense smile."

        "text": "Standing the same way.\n“Yes, sir.” Cruxer jumped to his feet and came toward the line. He was\nsmiling, but Kip thought it was a tense smile.\nAs everyone was standing proud, Kip felt the gulf between him and\nthem intensely. Outsider, loner, alien. They were all he would never be.\n“Sir?” Cruxer asked, coming to stand in front of the trainer. He glanced\ncoolly at Aram, who wouldn’t meet his eyes.\n“Yes, first?” Trainer Fisk said.\n“A Blackguard’s training is never done, but is the testing over for\ntoday?” Cruxer asked.\nTrainer Fisk said, “Yes, of course, now get to your place—”\nCruxer said nothing, but he struck like a serpent, yelling his kiyah and\ngiving his body the sharp countertwist that made his kicks so blindingly fast\nand powerful. Even Kip, who was looking straight at him, barely saw the\nstrike. Cruxer’s shin, gnarled and calcified by years of kicking against posts,\ncrushed against Aram’s knee. Crushed it backward.\nThe crunching squish of a joint being obliterated split the sudden\nsilence.\nAram crumpled to the ground, gawping, gasping, eyes agape.\nCruxer dropped his hands instantly and stood in a narrow,\nnonthreatening stance. Given that he was surrounded by hundreds of men\nand women attuned to violence and accustomed to stopping it by the most\nefficient means necessary, that was wise. “Training accident,” Cruxer said\nloudly, coolly.\nFor a moment, even Trainer Fisk seemed as baffled as Kip. Finally he\nrecovered. “What have you done?!” he shouted at Cruxer.\nCruxer’s voice was cool, mechanical. “Permanent injuries inflicted\nduring testing result in expulsion. Injuries during training do not.”\n“My knee! My knee!” Aram started blubbering. From the sound of his\nvoice, he knew, like Kip knew, like everyone here knew—he would never\nfight again. He’d be lucky if he ever walked again. Knee injuries like that\ndidn’t heal. Aram was crippled.\nCruxer spoke loudly, clearly, and unapologetically. “I’ve wanted to be a\nBlackguard since I could walk. I value this brotherhood too highly to let in\na man who destroys unity rather than builds it, a man who takes money to\ndestroy one of his own. If the cost to remove him from the Blackguard is\nthat I, too, am expelled, so be it.” Emotion edged his voice for a moment,\nbut he mastered it.\n“What?!” Trainer Fisk demanded. “What are you talking about?”\n“Aram’s the second best fighter in our class,” Cruxer said. “He took\nmoney to finish low. He took money to keep Breaker out.”\n“He’s Tyrean!” Aram shouted. “He’s a bastard! I would have done it for\nfree! He’s not one of us!”\n“You would have done it for free? So you did do it for money,” Trainer\nFisk said, aggrieved, disbelieving. He shot a look over at Commander\nIronfist. A straight admission of guilt. How stupid was Aram?"

How stupid was Aram?\n“He’s not one of us!” Aram shouted.\n“You mean, one of you,” Commander Ironfist said, low and dangerous,\nstepping forward. “Because you’ll never be one of us, Aram. Unlike\nBreaker.”\nThe last word sent a shock through Kip.\n“Breaker!” Trainer Fisk barked. “You heard the man. We got room for\nfourteen, and I only see thirteen up here. Get in line! Double time! Someone\nget this trash out of here.”\n“No! Noo!!” Aram shouted. But the chirurgeons were there instantly and\nthey carried him away, blubbering.\nKip limped over to the line, not even close to double time, but he felt\nlike he was floating all the way. How much poppy had that chirurgeon given\nhim?\nNo, this wasn’t the poppy.\nCommander Ironfist stood in front of Kip. He took Kip’s gold fight\ntoken and snapped it into a pendant. The front of the pendant was a black\nflame. “This is the Flame of Erebos. It symbolizes service and sacrifice. As\na candle takes on flame and is consumed to give light and heat, so is a man\nwho takes on duty. Day by day, we give our lives to serve Orholam and his\nPrism. Will you take this sacred duty, Kip Guile, Breaker?”\n“I will.” Kip felt little shivers.\n“And will you forswear other loyalties, and have loyalty first to this\nbody, to Orholam, and to his Prism?”\n“I will.”\n“Then I declare you, Breaker, a trainee in the Blackguard.”\n“Break-er! Break-er!” the crowd chanted.\nIronfist let them go on for a few more seconds, then quieted them and\nworked his way down the line.\nThe rest of the ceremony passed like a dream. Each scrub was sworn in,\nand then the older trainees and the full Blackguards gathered around them\nto congratulate them.\nThey eventually decided to go to a tavern that the Blackguards preferred\n—all drinks on the new trainees, of course. Before he let himself be swept\nout into the evening, Kip looked for his father.\nGavin Guile was standing where Kip had left him, ignoring for the\nmoment a messenger who’d come to him with something or other. He had\neyes only for Kip. The Prism wore a bemused smirk, but maybe it was more\nthan bemused. Maybe it was a little proud.\nChapter 93\nKarris was dimly aware of the men leaving. She laid her face on the paving\nstones, praying they wouldn’t come back, hoping for unconsciousness. It\ndidn’t come. She lifted her face and saw a pool of blood where her mouth\nhad been. Her left eye was rapidly swelling shut, and the right doing the\nsame, more slowly.\nShe felt sick from the blow to her head. There was a foul taste in her\nmouth along with the flat metal taste of blood. She realized they’d rolled\nher onto her side so she wouldn’t drown on her own vomit."

She realized they’d rolled\nher onto her side so she wouldn’t drown on her own vomit.\nMessily, she vomited again. She got it all over herself, but the spasms in\nher stomach kept her curled into a ball. She was heaving just to breathe, and\nheaving her guts up.\nThe spasms passed slowly, but her head still felt barely connected to her\nbody, moving at its own pace, sloshing. She rolled onto her stomach again\nand somehow started crawling.\nShe could crawl. Good. Part of her noted that she hadn’t broken either\nher arms or legs. Good, good. Her hands were slick with blood and worse,\nand the paving stones cut her knees. Her ribs ached every time she took a\nbreath, but if any ribs were broken, they were merely cracked. She’d had\nbroken ribs before, and that hurt worse than this.\nUnless, of course, her body was masking the pain. Bodies did that.\nDamned things. Something caught in her throat and she spat up blood.\nStill had her teeth, but she’d bit the hell out of her tongue. Something\nwas burning around her neck. She was afraid to touch it, though. Couldn’t,\nand still crawl.\nShe reached the intersection five or ten minutes, or a year, later.\nWhat street was this? She’d just come down it, but she couldn’t\nremember. Couldn’t remember what part of town she was in. Not a busy\nstreet, though.\nBut she couldn’t go any farther. Her right eye was completely shut now.\nShe realized her butt hurt. They’d kicked the hell out of her butt. And her\nlegs were starting to cramp up.\nShe retched again. Dry-heaved.\nWhen she opened her one good eye, she saw someone walking toward\nher down the street.\nThe man turned aside and walked wide around her.\nOthers passed. Men, and women. A man with a cart. None stopped.\nOrholam, why didn’t any of them stop?\nHelpless. She might as well be naked out here. She couldn’t do\nanything. At the mercy of anyone who passed. Anyone who wanted to take\nadvantage.\nShe started crying, and hated herself for it. Everything just hurt so bad.\n“Come now, sweetie,” a man said over her. “Everything’s going to be\nfine. Such a brave girl you are.” Sounded Ilytian, by the accent. Karris\nhadn’t had good luck with Ilytians. Didn’t think much of them. “Dressed as\na Blackguard, but white as a sail. You’re Karris White Oak.”\nShe couldn’t answer. Stopping crying was all she could manage.\nNodding her head was a victory.\n“I’m going to pick you up. I want you to think about everywhere you\nhurt so we can tell the chirurgeons when we get to the Chromeria.\nAcceptable?”\n“Y-yes.” Something about him seemed familiar. But no, she was certain\n—\nHe picked her up, and she promptly passed out.\nWhen she woke, she was in a bed. She could tell she’d been dosed with\npoppy, because she felt far too good.

She heaved her head left, saw the\nworld swim, and then heaved it right.\nGavin’s room! Ha! She’d been here before. And oh-ho! There was the\nman himself, the Light of the Tower, the Star of Stars, the Moon’s Right\nHand. He was awfully handsome, standing there, that one wave of his hair\nfalling in front of his eyes.\n“Karris?” Gavin asked. He looked terribly concerned. “Can you hear\nme?”\n“Mmm,” she said. She smiled at him. She remembered seeing him\nwithout his shirt on at Seers Island. Mmm. “I want to see you naked,” she\nsaid.\nOh dear! Had she really just said that? She laughed.\nGavin turned to a little man Karris hadn’t noticed before. A chirurgeon\nin slave’s robes. “I think we can ease up on the poppy,” he said.\n“Always trying to tell me…” Karris lost the thought. And consciousness.\nChapter 94\nTell her. You have to tell her.\nGavin rolled the little brown ball of opium between his finger and\nthumb. Karris was still asleep, and the people were scurrying every which\nway in the hall outside, preparing for war.\nWhen the messenger had come to him at Kip’s testing, Gavin had at first\nrefused to understand the man’s words, then nearly panicked. That Karris\nhad been beaten had affected him far more than he would have expected.\n“Look to what you love,” his father had said.\nThey’d sail at high tide tomorrow. The mobilization was unbelievably\nfast because everyone had known that when the permission came, they\nwould have to move fast. What was transpiring now was simply the last-\nminute orders. Still, there were a thousand decisions to be made. And\nthough Gavin wasn’t technically part of them, he still knew more than\nanyone here how to successfully put together an armada and an army.\nBut for now, he sat at Karris’s bedside. When he’d first seen her, caked\nwith blood, he’d thought she would be crippled by her injuries. Then, after\nthe chirurgeons had tended to her and reported, he’d thought it was a\nmiracle she wasn’t hurt worse. Now he realized she’d been beaten expertly\nand exactly how much whoever did it had intended. She’d been meant to\nlook awful—without incapacitating her permanently. It had been intended\nas a warning to Gavin, not a declaration of war.\nHis father had no idea.\nHe didn’t have any proof it had been his father, of course. There were\nany number of possible suspects, but with this timing, this care, this\nprecision? Gavin didn’t need proof.\nSeeing her on the bed, wrapped in bandages, unconscious, Gavin was\nmade aware of how small she was. When she was awake, talking, her\npersonality was so big you forgot. But here, she looked so vulnerable, a\ndelicate flower, bruised.\n“I’m going to rip their damn arms off. I swear it,” Gavin said quietly.\n“You talking to yourself, or am I that bad of a faker?” Karris asked,\ncracking one eye. The other opened a bare slit through the swollen\nblackness."

        "text": "“You talking to yourself, or am I that bad of a faker?” Karris asked,\ncracking one eye. The other opened a bare slit through the swollen\nblackness.\n“You’re back,” Gavin said. His relief was like a crushing weight lifting.\n“Did I… say something…” She trailed off.\n“Something embarrassing while you were mudged on poppy? Like\nabout seeing me naked? No.”\nShe closed her eyes. “You’re lucky it hurts to move, or I’d beat you\nbloody, Gavin Guile.”\n“Dazen,” Gavin said quietly. That one word was the whole reason he’d\ncome here. The whole reason he’d waited until Karris was lucid, but after\nall the buildup, he was still surprised to hear the word.\nA bruised and swollen face and two black eyes and a split lip were not\nthe easiest canvas on which to read emotions, and Gavin saw nothing.\nKarris’s eyes were closed. Like she hadn’t heard him. Maybe she hadn’t.\nMaybe she’d passed out again.\nA solitary tear leaked from the corner of one closed eye and tracked\ndown her cheek.\nThe door’s open. Nothing for it but to charge through now. Gavin said,\n“Corvan Danavis and I came up with the plan a month before the Battle of\nSundered Rock. We’d made so many bargains with so many devils that\neven though I thought my original cause was just, I knew a victory would\nbe disastrous for the Seven Satrapies. Corvan gave me a scar to match\nGavin’s, and a spy gave us the details of his battle dress.” Gavin heaved a\nbreath. “My mother knew it was me instantly, of course, but she didn’t want\nto lose her last son so she coached me how to be Gavin. I thought if I could\nkeep my disguise for even a few months that I would be able to stop most\nof the damage to the Seven Satrapies. I didn’t realize how hard it would be\nwith you. I didn’t know how to even talk with you. I thought you loved\nGavin. Marrying you—as him?—it was one betrayal too many, Karris. I\ncouldn’t. I just couldn’t. But maybe what I did was worse.”\nThe broken betrothal hadn’t turned out so well. She’d disappeared,\nhumiliated, financially ruined, and he’d thought he would never see her\nagain. Part of him had been glad, the part that wanted to live. Surely Karris\nwould be the one to see through his masquerade. The year she’d been gone\nhad given him time to solidify his mask, to become Gavin Guile.\n“Tell me,” she said. She wouldn’t look him in the eye, and she made no\nmotion to clear away her tears. “Tell me everything.”\nHer tone gave him nothing. It was cold, flat, lifeless.\nShe already knew enough to get him killed, so he didn’t know why it\nshould be hard. In for a den, in for a danar, right? But the sick feeling in the\npit of his stomach wasn’t about life and death. Somehow, those were paltry\nthings. This was about disgusting a woman who meant more to him than\nanything he’d ever known.\nHe drew a deep breath. Leaned back in his chair, leaned forward. Seven\nyears, seven impossible goals.

He’d failed at this goal every year for the\npast sixteen. If she killed him for this, at least he would have done\nsomething right.\nSo he talked. He told her about the fire at her family’s house, how he’d\nfound he could split light that night, and how he’d been wild with rage,\nthinking she’d betrayed him. He told of fleeing in shame. Of being pursued.\nOf having an army coalesce around him he wasn’t even sure he wanted to\nhave. And then of Gavin rebuffing his offers to surrender. He told her how\nhe’d finally started fighting with his whole heart. Of putting Corvan\nDanavis in charge of his armies. Of fighting across the length of Atash, of\npromises from several Parian clans. Of how they’d needed those Parian\nreinforcements so badly they’d fled to meet them all the way into Tyrea—\nwhere they finally found out they’d been betrayed. The Parian clans weren’t\ncoming.\nHe said little about the final battle. He’d killed a lot of men that day,\nsome of them brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of men and women\nhe’d come to admire since.\nThen he talked about the years since. How he’d faced the challenges of\nlearning to be Gavin, and how he’d tried to right the wrongs that so few of\nthe other members of the Spectrum cared to try to redress.\nHe spoke for more than an hour. And as he spoke, he could feel her\nsoftening, warming toward him, her expression opening. And finally, he’d\nreached the Battle of Garriston and its aftermath and how she’d slapped him\nand said she knew his secret, and how he was afraid she’d known the full\ntruth. Quietly, he shared how he’d had to decide whether he should tell her\nthe truth, or kill her.\nAny warmth that had been gathering was dissipated like he’d thrown his\nwindows open in winter. He saw the muscle in her jaw twitch. You were\ngoing to kill me, you asshole? it said.\n“You wanted the truth,” Gavin said. “Telling you means you could kill\nme.”\n“It makes sense, you bastard, just don’t expect it to warm the cockles of\nmy heart.”\nHe had nothing to say. He realized he’d ground the little brown grain of\nopium to dust between his fingers.\n“I am who I am, Karris,” he said. Then he realized how ridiculous\nsaying that was right now. “I mean, I am the Prism, so…”\n“I know what you meant. So. Is that it?”\nHe hesitated. “No. That’s not it, Karris. I killed Gavin last night.”\n“You mean metaphorically?” she asked.\nSo he told her. Then he backed up and told her about Ana, and he told\nher the truth.\n“But the Blackguards… they said she jumped.”\n“They lied to save me, Karris. I didn’t ask them to. I swear. Ana said\nsome pretty foul things about you, and I knew I’d lost you forever.

So I went down to let Gavin out, to let him kill\nme.” He couldn’t look at her. Even with her battered face, he could read\nhorror easily enough.\nFinally, after telling her about Gavin, he said, “I didn’t know what he\ndid to you, back then. How he… humbled you. I should have figured it out,\nbut I’ve been so worried about myself that I couldn’t see even the most\nobvious things about those around me. I’m sorry, Karris, and I know I\nhaven’t acted like it, but I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life\nwith you, if you can ever forgive me.”\nThe silence was deep enough to drown in.\n“Infuriating. Incorrigible. Inelegant. Inefficient. Incredible in both\nsenses. But not, in the end, insincere, are you, Dazen Guile?”\n“Huh?”\n“Kiss me,” Karris said.\n“Pardon?”\n“It wasn’t a request.”\nHe stood up from his chair and sat on the edge of her bed. She grunted\nwith pain as his movement jostled her.\n“Sorry,” he mumbled. “Maybe—”\n“Not a request.”\n“But your lips are cracked and—”\n“Not a request.”\n“Ah.”\nHe kissed her with the gentleness of a man kissing an invalid.\nShe pulled back, peering at him through swollenness-slitted eyes,\ndisapproving. “That was horrible, Dazen Guile. That was not the kiss I’ve\nbeen waiting sixteen years for.”\n“Second chance?” he asked.\nShe looked unconvinced. “Hm. You don’t deserve it.”\n“I don’t,” he said seriously.\n“You don’t,” she said gravely, “but then, if you and I aren’t about second\nchances, I don’t know who is.” She grinned a bit, though.\nHe kissed her again, tenderly, but drawing her in. But what began as a\ngift for her benefit, a smooth, strong seduction soon morphed. He folded her\nsmall form into his, wrapping protective arms around her. As they kissed, he\ncould feel a tension loosening in him, a tension that had been knotted for so\nlong he’d come to think of that pain as part of the pain of being alive.\nShe pulled back, and instantly back on guard, fearing rejection, Gavin\npulled back, too.\nBut Karris murmured, “I’m afraid you’ve left me breathless, Lord Guile\n—”\n“Well thank you.” Relief beneath his grin.\n“—because I can’t breathe through my nose right now.”\nShe laughed and he joined her ruefully. “You are so beautiful,” he said.\nHe felt as if his heart had swollen too large for his chest.\nA dubious look. “I might be part blind right now, but you shouldn’t be. I\ngot beat up, what’s your excuse?”\nHe chuckled. “I didn’t mean particularly, precisely at this moment—You\nknow what? I think my lips can make a more convincing case without\nwords.

The world ceased. No\nworries, no cares. That knot Gavin hadn’t known he carried eased and\nopened and disappeared, and he felt suddenly stronger than he had been in\nhis entire life. Free. The power of the secret broken, chains shattered.\n“Orholam have mercy, how I want to make love with you,” she said.\n“I can be persuaded,” Gavin said quickly.\nShe made a little sound of frustration. “If only my body were so\namenable.”\n“I could be… gentle,” he offered, giving a roguish grin.\nShe pulled him close and whispered in his ear, “After sixteen years of\nmissing you, Dazen Guile, the last thing I want from you is gentle.”\nHe swallowed. Speechless. “Will you marry me, Karris White Oak?”\nDamn. He could have done better than that. Such questions should have\nsome eloquence.\nThen again with his history with Karris, perhaps a simple truth was\nbetter than an artful one.\n“Karris, why are you crying?”\n“Because it’s past time for my pain medicine, you big idiot.”\nThere was a knock on Gavin’s door. “Oh, you have got to be joking,”\nGavin said, looking at the door like he could kill it with his eyes. He turned\nback to her. “Does that mean yes?”\n“You’ve worn me down and taken advantage of my incapacitated state,\nso…”\n“So that means yes?”\nAnother knock on the door.\n“You stupid, stupid man, of course it does.”\n“I love you, Karris White Oak.”\nShe smiled mischievously. “You ought to.”\nThe door opened, and a Blackguard wheeled the White in. Gavin\ncouldn’t keep the huge grin off his face.\n“Oh dear, have I interrupted something?” the White asked.\n“No,” Gavin said. At the same time Karris said, “Yes.”\n“I see.”\n“You were just the person I was hoping to see,” Gavin said. “High\nMistress White, would you be so good as to marry us?”\nThe White inclined her head, looking over the corrective spectacles she\nwas wearing. “Well, Gavin Guile, it certainly took you long enough. And\nKarris White Oak! Slowest seduction in history! A woman with your\ncharms.” The White sniffed.\n“Is that a yes?” Gavin asked.\n“Of course it is,” Karris answered for her. She was grinning from ear to\near.\n“I imagine that Gavin’s heading straight off to war, and that you’ll want\nthis done as soon as he gets back?” the White said.\n“No,” Gavin said. “Right now.”\n“Right now?” Karris said. “Don’t you want to give this some thought?\nWe have no idea what we’re getting into.”\n“And when will we? Some things you can’t know until you’re in them.\nI’ll be in it with you. That’s more than enough for me.” Gavin turned to the"

That’s more than enough for me.” Gavin turned to the\nWhite. “Right now.”\nThe White grumbled. “Figures.” But she smiled. “Gavin, you’re willing\nto have your father disown you over this?”\n“I’m feeling invincible right now,” Gavin said. “How’d you know about\nthat, Orea?”\n“Disowned?” Karris asked.\n“I’ll explain. Later,” Gavin said.\n“Me, too,” the White said. “Karris, you know what this may mean for\nyour tenure?”\n“Yes,” Karris said.\n“Rules are made to bend for the right people,” Gavin said.\n“Promise me a big wedding when you get back,” Karris said.\n“Huge.”\nAnd so they were wed. The vows were simple. In the discharge of his\nnormal duties as Prism, Gavin had prompted brides and grooms through the\nvows himself, but today he forgot them. And as soon as they were out of his\nmouth, they became a blur. He was barely aware even of the White, he had\neyes only for Karris. He was filled with an inexplicable tenderness for this\nwild, frustrating, beautiful, stubborn, amazing woman.\nHe kissed Karris again, and she grimaced under her smile.\n“Time for more medicine?” he asked.\nShe nodded, apologetic.\nHe found the tincture and poured her the dose. She accepted it gratefully\nand lay back on her pillows. “Come back to me, my lord. Come back soon,\nyou hear me?”\n“Yes, my lady,” he said. He couldn’t stop grinning.\nShe was asleep in less than a minute.\nFinally, Gavin turned to the White. “Well done, Lord Prism,” she said.\n“Perhaps I was right about you after all.”\n“I do my best.”\n“I hope your best is enough to save us.”\nAnd with the quiet moment, he remembered why he had worked so hard\nnot to have quiet moments with the White. She would ask that they go to\nthe roof and that he balance. She had all sorts of reasons. She would have\nheard all the stories that Marissia had told him. She would know what they\nmeant.\n“Do you know,” she said, “I was on the roof the other day. And do you\nknow what I saw? Cranes. Thousands of them, migrating. Have you ever\nseen them?”\n“Not that I remember.”\n“They fly in Vs. Something about it makes it easier.”\nIt was an odd thing to say. Like you’d explain to a child. Gavin had, of\ncourse, seen migrating birds before.\n“This year, they weren’t flying in a V. They were flying in a single line.\nThousands of them. So odd. Cranes never fly over water for long when they\nmigrate. I could see they were struggling. Without the efficiencies of their\nnormal formation, birds were dropping out, falling, dying. They flew\nstraight toward me. And then, suddenly, as they reached Little Jasper, that\nodd line broke apart. The cranes rested that day on the Jaspers, as they have\nnot for many years. And when they left, they flew normally.” She didn’t"

And when they left, they flew normally.” She didn’t\nreally finish her story, she simply stopped talking. “Regardless, they were\nsaved.”\nHe’d broken the bane—and saved some cranes. Orholam’s nipple.\n“That’s marvelous,” Gavin said.\n“Have you had a chance to go up to the roof yet?” she asked.\n“Yes, yes I have.” Face bland.\nShe studied him. Did she buy it? Surely, this was her telling him she\nknew. Unless—unless it was the ramblings of an old woman. Maybe\nsenility came like this on a woman as bright as Orea. Maybe she had the\npieces, and some part of her was desperately trying to put it all together by\ntalking it out, out loud.\nOr she was warning him, because of their friendship. Their friendship?\nWere they friends, after all? But she was utterly dedicated to the Chromeria,\nto her duties, to the Seven Satrapies. Her next words—he knew her next\nwords were going to be: “Gavin, we need to talk about how to ease you into\nretirement.”\n“Gavin,” she said, “the generals are in my room, planning the invasion. I\nthink they could use your expertise.”\nGavin took a deep breath. That meant his father would be there. Frying\npan, fire. He stood, bent over to kiss Karris’s forehead, and popped his neck\nright and left. “Very well, Orea, let’s save the world.”\nChapter 95\nGavin walked into Orea’s room to find the generals and their aides gathered\naround a table on which a number of maps of different scales were laid out.\n“So you’ve got spies with the Color Prince’s army,” Gavin said.\n“More than a dozen,” a bearded, balding Parian general said. Caul\nAzmith was the Parian satrapah’s younger brother. He was affable, polite,\nand not terribly bright.\n“Projection or actual data?” Gavin asked. He wanted to know if he was\nstaring at the positions the prince’s army had been in eight or ten days ago,\nor if these were estimates of the current positions.\n“Projection, on excellent data,” the Blood Forest general said. He was\nalso bald, though he was a young man, freckled and foolish. A political\nweasel who had no business leading a hunting expedition, much less an\narmy.\n“How old is this?” Gavin asked.\nGeneral Azmith said, “Ten days. Takes my handler two days to get to the\nsmuggler who’s carrying the letters. The smuggler had good wind. Earned\nhimself a bonus for getting it here in seven days. It arrived last night.”\n“You using that smuggler for the return trip?”\nGeneral Azmith shook his head.\nWhich to Gavin meant that the smuggler had probably lied about how\nfast he’d made the trip in order to get his bonus. Most of the smugglers on\nthe Atashian coast still used galleys so they couldn’t become becalmed,\nwith the low displacement that allowed the long wide ships to traverse bays\nthat the pirate hunters couldn’t. This time of year, the winds would rarely\nmake it possible for a galley to come from Atash in seven days. Probably"

Maybe ten.\nIf Gavin had been here, things could have been different. If Gavin were\npromachos, things still could be. But that was out of reach for now. His\nfather had done that, and his father wasn’t going to give it back for nothing.\nGavin’s own personal defiance, his own happiness in marrying Karris, was\ngoing to cost men their lives.\nBut that wasn’t his fault. Gavin wasn’t going to accept the blame for\nthat. He would have, not so long ago. No, these generals had no business\nbeing generals, and they’d all been put into position by people who ought to\nhave known better. There were plenty of veterans from the last war who\ncould have been put in charge. Gavin had done the best he could by the\npeople of Garriston. He couldn’t make the right decisions for everyone else.\n“How fast is your turnaround?” he asked.\nThe idiot Blood Forester spoke. “We’re not actually going to start\nstrategizing until your luxlord father arrives. He should be here any minute,\nLord Prism.”\n“It doesn’t matter,” Gavin said.\n“Lord Prism?”\n“When you arrive in Ru, I think you’ll find that the army is here.” Gavin\npointed to a little town called Voril, two days from Ru. “You’ll find that the\ncorregidor has maybe half the working guns he’s told you, and less than\nhalf the powder, because he’s always been more worried about his ego than\nabout defense. So rather than look like a fool to you who are trying to save\nhim, he’ll act like one and lie to you, which you won’t find out until it’s too\nlate. And I’ve marched through this country. If you’re not being harassed\nand being made to pay for letting your wagons get spread out, this section is\neasy. I covered it in three weeks, but my brother had saboteurs and raiders\nwho made us paranoid at every step. If they’ve been allowed to just march\nthrough here, they’ll be on top of Ru before you know it.\n“Your spies have been cataloguing the wrong things. What’s important\nisn’t the exact number of horsemen or who’s a freed slave versus a\nvolunteer. Those are good to know, but what you needed to know was how\nmany anvils do they have, how many skilled blacksmiths, how much scrap\niron? Have veterans from the False Prism’s War been put in positions of\nleadership, or have those slots gone to the Color Prince’s favorites who\ndon’t know anything? How long are their supply lines, and how much food\nare they delivering every time? It’s too late for a lot of those questions to be\nanswered now. Too late for you to have raiders intercept the supply wagons,\nor to destroy the anvils or murder the blacksmiths and sabotage the wagons’\nwheels before they hit the Little Sisters’ Pass.

You’re going to ask those men to die,\nand not for good reason. The fact is, no matter what you do, you won’t save\nRu. It’s already over. If you were wise, you’d send messages to tell them to\nevacuate the city and regroup at the neck of Ruic Head, and to take out of\nthe city whatever supplies the Color Prince’s army needs most. But you\nwon’t do that, because you’re looking to win a battle instead of win a war.\nI’ve got my own fights, gentlemen. Fights that I can still win, and that will\nhelp you in ways you don’t know. So good day, and I’ll see you on the\nfield.”\nChapter 96\nGavin headed down to his own room. He spied his father coming up the lift\njust as he stepped into his room. Good thing the old bastard was blind.\nGrinwoody was with him, but the old slave had his back turned, helping the\nold man out of the lift.\nKarris lay on his bed, asleep. In a chair beside the bed, Commander\nIronfist sat. He rubbed his temples, and then his bald head as Gavin came\nin.\n“Commander,” Gavin said.\n“Lord Prism.” There was something oddly distant in the big man’s\nvoice.\n“Is something the matter?” Gavin asked.\nIronfist looked at him levelly. “I almost lost one of my watch captains,\none of my friends, in what appears to be a targeted attack. And someone\nmurdered one of my students yesterday. A couple of the scrubs swear that\nthe man was aiming at Kip and the girl stepped into the line of fire on\naccident. Do you have any comment, Lord Prism?”\n“Can I trust you enough to bare my throat to you, Ironfist?”\nIronfist hesitated, as well he should.\n“Well then,” Gavin said.\nIronfist heaved a sigh and looked down at his hands. “We’re doomed,\naren’t we?”\nGavin didn’t follow. They were doomed because they didn’t trust each\nother?\n“The Chromeria is a lightning-struck tree. Still standing, but dead on the\ninside. That’s why we’re going to lose, I think,” Ironfist said. “We have all\nthe power in the world, but our faith is dead. If we don’t believe in what\nwe’re doing for its own sake, we’re just doing it to maintain power. And I\nthink some of us are too good to continue throwing lives into the trough\nsimply to feed the beast.”\n“Are we?” Gavin asked very quietly.\n“When Ru falls, this will become a real war. And once it’s a real war,\nand not simply an uprising of a few disgruntled madmen, then the questions\nbegin. At some point, every one of us will have to ask if we’re on the right\nside. If we’ve already decided our own side is wrong—that there’s no\nOrholam, that the Chromeria is simply making the best of a bad situation—\nthen where do men looking for certainty turn?”"

If we’ve already decided our own side is wrong—that there’s no\nOrholam, that the Chromeria is simply making the best of a bad situation—\nthen where do men looking for certainty turn?”\n“Maybe men shouldn’t look for certainty,” Gavin said.\n“Should. Shouldn’t. Doesn’t matter. They do.”\nHe was right. Of course he was.\nGavin quirked an eyebrow. “Why Ironfist, are you asking me to come\nback to religion?”\nIronfist met his levity with a flat stare. “My own faith is dead, Lord\nPrism. Not least because of you. I’d not ask you to embrace a lie, but I want\nmy people to have a reason to die. I won’t lie either. I can’t tell them what\nwe do matters. If that’s beside the point, if you want us to die because it’s\nour duty to die, I can accept that. That can be enough for me. That will be\nenough for the Blackguard. It won’t be enough for everyone else.”\n“Does the Blackguard love me so much?” Gavin asked grimly.\nIronfist looked startled Gavin should ask. “We don’t die for you. We die\nfor each other, for our brothers and sisters. We die for the Blackguard.”\nThen he grinned. “Looks the same from your side though, I suppose.”\nIronfist stood, looked at Karris, swallowed, then turned back to Gavin. “You\nshould give her a ring, you know. Especially if you’re going off to your\ndeath.”\nOf course. And he should make sure she was provided for, should he die.\nDamn.\nIronfist left, and Gavin followed him. Gavin got off at the level of his\nfather’s and mother’s apartments, nodding amiably to the discipulae who\npassed him in the lift, on their way to do chores. He went into his mother’s\napartments.\nHe’d thought he’d accepted his mother’s death, but going into her room\nand smelling the familiar, comforting smells of the place made him pause,\nbarely inside the door. There was the wood polish, the waft of lavender, the\nstargazer lilies he’d always hated, a bit of orange, and spices he could never\nplace. All that was missing was the smell of her perfume. A lump grew in\nhis throat, threatening to choke him, making it hard to breathe.\n“Oh, mother, I finally did it. I finally did the right thing with Karris. I\nwish you could see it.”\n“My lord?” a timorous voice intruded. “I’m so sorry, my lord. Should I\nwithdraw?”\nIt was his mother’s room slave. Gavin didn’t even know the young girl’s\nname. Different girl than last time. No wonder the room was immaculately\nclean, without even dust on the mantelpiece.\n“Caleen,” Gavin said. “You’ve done well. It’s beautiful. It reminds me\npowerfully of her.”\n“I’m so sorry, my lord.” She buried her face.\nGavin shook his head. The girl was young. His mother had always\ntrained her help exquisitely, and had chosen only intelligent slaves,\npreferring that over physical beauty, unlike other leading families. But there\nare some situations you don’t get around to training a fourteen-year-old girl\nfor."

But there\nare some situations you don’t get around to training a fourteen-year-old girl\nfor.\n“Did my mother leave no instructions for you?” Gavin asked. Usually,\nlike himself, his mother had kept at least half a dozen slaves in her\nhousehold. She’d trimmed back in recent years, mostly manumitting those\nwho’d provided long years of good service. Now Gavin knew why.\n“She told me…” The girl blanched, then bulled forward. “She told me\nshe was giving orders for my manumission to Grinwoody, seeing as how a\nslave can’t deliver her own manumission to the records keepers. I hain’t—\nyour pardon, my lord—I haven’t heard anything since then.”\n“You old bastard,” Gavin whispered to himself. His father was still\ndenying that his wife was dead, so he’d simply ignored the girl. The girl had\nbeen stuck here for four months, with nothing to do but dust the room and\nget fresh flowers and hope. “Did she leave you a letter?” Gavin asked.\n“Yes, my lord,” the girl said, her voice was barely a whisper, obviously\npicking up on Gavin’s pique. “Believe Grinwoody put it in the lord’s\nchamber.”\n“Of course he did.” And they wouldn’t appreciate Gavin breaking into\nhis room.\nBut you know what? To the everlasting night with them. Gavin was\nmore than half convinced that his father had orchestrated Karris’s beating.\nThe attempted murder of Kip seemed too heavy-handed, but at this point he\nwasn’t going to excuse his father preemptively for anything.\nLook to what you love indeed.\nGavin headed across the hall, drafted red luxin into the lock, jimmied it\nuntil he felt tumblers loosen, and then injected yellow luxin, steeled his\nwill, and twisted. The lock clicked open.\nHe might be half dead, but he wasn’t neutered yet, thanks. He set a light\nto burning, casting a pale yellow glare through the Red’s rooms. He went to\nthe desk, rifled through the papers. Andross Guile was upstairs, and a\ncouncil of war would surely take hours, even for a man as ignorant of war\nas his own father. Andross seemed to think that being brilliant meant being\ngood at everything, and his generals would have to fill in the gaps in his\nknowledge carefully and slowly, lest they infuriate the old man.\nConsidering how ignorant they themselves were, it ought to take a while.\nIt was almost comical how much excellent intelligence his father had\nleft in the open. Gavin wished he’d come in merely to poke around.\nAndross was simply here so often that he clearly never thought about the\ndanger of someone coming into his rooms while he was gone. He was never\ngone.\nGavin found the note about the slave girl quickly. His mother’s\nhandwriting was on the outside, a beautiful looping script that she hadn’t\nlost even as age advanced on her.\nWe drafters are robbed of life before age can rob us of our faculties.\nGavin didn’t know if it was the greatest cruelty of all, or a small kindness.\nHe glanced at the letter.

It was as the girl had said, a simple, straightforward\nmanumission, and a grant of four hundred danars. The girl would leave\nslavery with more in her hand than she would have earned at a servant’s\nwages in two years. It was a fortune for a young girl. Enough for a dowry in\nthose rural areas of the few satrapies where such things were still\ncustomary. The only unusual bit was the instruction that the girl be given an\narmed guard from the Cloven Shield mercenary company to take her home\n—Felia Guile had doubtless thought through the fact that sending a very\nyoung and attractive girl home with a fortune in hand would put her in\ngrave peril. Of course, sending a guard from the Cloven Shield would cost\nmore than two hundred danars, but they had a sterling reputation.\nLike many socially conscious women, Felia Guile had always had deep\nreservations about slavery. Are we all not brothers and sisters under the\nlight? she would ask. He could almost hear her voice as she talked through\nit: From Orholam’s perch, what difference is a man’s garment? And like so\nmany others, she’d still had slaves. Impossible to think of a world without\nthem. Men wouldn’t volunteer for the galleys, or the silver mines, or the\nsewers, would they? And what does one do with the widows and orphans\nwhen a country is conquered? Simply let them die at the first winter? Leave\nthem as prey for slavers with less scruples than the civilized satrapies had?\nStill, she’d say, it was dehumanizing. The beatings, the fathering of\nbastards, the jealousies and insecurities of the slaveholders themselves.\nFelia had never liked it. This manumission was generous, to say the least.\nBut not uncommon to those owners who feared their dear slaves would be\npassed on to cruel mistresses or depraved masters, or to enemy families\nwho might force them to reveal shameful secrets about their previous\nowners, or even to good families that might fall on hard times and have to\nrent their slaves out to work the mines or the brothels.\nGavin tucked away the letter. He looked around the room, wondering if\nthere was anything else he should steal. Money? Gems? Should he try to\nread his father’s correspondence? He opened the desk and found a box. He\nexamined it briefly, then gave up trying to open that. Andross Guile lived\nand died by his correspondence. The box would yield to nothing less than a\nchisel and a smith’s hammer. If that.\nWith a sigh, Gavin set it back into its place. It had felt heavy, too. In\nfact, some of the former contents of the box had been emptied out to make\nmore room. Several jewels the size of songbird’s eggs sat carelessly in the\ndrawer among the feather pens and the cunning Ilytian ink-reservoir pen his\nfather liked so much.\nGavin felt a perverse urge to steal something. He was going to get\ndisowned anyway, so he probably ought to do something to earn it.\nHis eyes fell on the side table with its piles of Nine Kings cards.\nApparently his father had been playing recently.

It was one of the few\nthings that gave the old man joy. Gavin had played him countless times in\nthe past. The old man almost always won. He was a better player than\nGavin, and he wasn’t above cheating either, if he thought he could get away\nwith it, though he’d been mortified the one time Gavin had caught him\ndoing it, and had never cheated again so far as Gavin knew.\nInstead of grabbing one of the decks on the table, though, Gavin headed\nfor a cabinet. His father had once pulled an amazing deck out of the cabinet\nafter Gavin had won three games in a row. There was a lock on the cabinet,\nbut it was nothing serious. Gavin rummaged through old papers and his\nfather’s favorite books, and found an old jeweled deck box. He pulled it out,\ncracked it open. The cards were exquisite, but they didn’t have the blind\nman’s marks on them. Must have been his father’s favorites from before he\nwent into seclusion.\nGavin dropped the deck box into a pocket and headed back to his\nmother’s room. The slave girl was standing there, wringing her hands. He\nhanded her the letter and went to his mother’s safe, a chunky Parian design\nthat was hard to tell was arranged into numbers at all. He tried his own birth\ndate. It didn’t open.\nAh. He’d tried Gavin’s birth date. Good: he was sinking back into the\ndisguise.\nDazen’s birth date worked. Thank you, mother. He grabbed some purses\nof gold, and her wedding ring, and some coin sticks. He gave the slave girl\none of them, then a second. Her eyes went wide.\n“Take this note to the west docks, the Bakers’ Street, you know it? Blue\ndome building, houses the mercenary company the Cloven Shield. You ask\nto speak with One-Eye or Taya Vin. I’d advise One-Eye, he’s kinder to\nyoung girls. You tell them Lady Felia Guile sent you. You can pay them up\nto three hundred danars to get you home, including all their expenses—any\nless that you can negotiate with them, you get to keep. Then book passage\nhome—where are you from?”\n“Wiwurgh, my lord.”\n“Paria? You don’t look Parian.”\n“First generation, my lord. Parents fled the Blood War. It’s not so bad.\nLots of us in Wiwurgh.”\n“Very well. It’s a long trip, you should pay forty danars for a stateroom.\nCheaper to bunk below, but don’t. Make your guard bunk with you. Man or\nwoman doesn’t matter, the Cloven Shield is safe. You can ask for a woman\nif you prefer, though. Also, take this note to a tailor. By nightfall tonight,\nyou shouldn’t be wearing a slave’s garb. Understood?” Gavin scribbled a\nnote. “You need to get on a ship tonight, though.

He dripped\nred luxin on it, pressed it with his will to make it stand in the shape of his\nseal, and then sealed it with luxin, barely even looking at it. “This tells\nanyone who might accost you that the Prism is going to check in on you,\nand if anything ill has happened to you, I will wreak vengeance on them. It\nmay not be true. I don’t know that I’ll ever get to Wiwurgh, but if I live\nlong enough, I’ll try.

Then he went down the tower and hid his\nfather’s deck and Kip’s deck in a spot he was certain his father would never\ncheck. He came back up to his own room.\nKarris was asleep. Gavin slipped his mother’s huge ruby ring on Karris’s\nfinger. She still didn’t wake. Strangely, the ring fit perfectly. Gavin could\nhave sworn his mother’s fingers were wider than Karris’s delicate digits. He\nlooked at the ring.\nHis mother had resized it to Karris’s ring size. Gavin smiled. Thank you,\nmother. He could just imagine her mischievous grin, knowing he would\nfigure it out. He hadn’t gotten all of his smarts from his father, she’d say.\nStill smiling as tears gathered in his eyes, he kissed Karris’s forehead. He\nheld his wife’s hand and sat with her. His wife’s hand. His wife.\nAfter all they’d been through together. The fights with each other,\nagainst wights. The darkness and despair. He tucked a wisp of her hair\nbehind her ear. Touched her face gently. Memorized her. He took a breath,\nand it was pure.\nIn a world where every danger was growing and his own strength was\nfailing, Karris had his back. She’d always had his back. And somehow,\ndying though he was, power fractured, doom looming, he felt more whole\nthan ever.\nThe yoke of responsibility lay hanging off the bedpost. Gavin kissed his\nsleeping wife’s forehead, cracked his neck, rolled his shoulders, and picked\nthe damn thing back up. Slipped it on. It felt good. It felt like it was made\nfor him.\nMarissia was waiting at the door. Her face was carefully composed,\nhands folded, ready to serve. Gavin handed her the note for the tower\nregister to record his mother freeing her slave. Marissia took it silently, but\nthere was a touch of hesitancy in her stance.\n“Marissia,” Gavin said quietly. “I… if you’re gone when I get back, I\nunderstand, but you will always have a place here.”"

She practically fled the room. Gavin rubbed the bridge of his nose and\nstepped into the hallway, doing his best not to look after her. Commander\nIronfist was there, waiting silently.\n“Commander,” Gavin said. “How do you feel about doing a little\nskimming? Flirt-with-death dangerous.”\nIronfist said nothing, but his mouth quirked up in a little grin.\nChapter 97\nThough much is taken, much abides, Gevison had once said.\nGavin hated poets. He and Ironfist had gathered food and weapons and\ntaken a scull out into open waters.\n“You going to suit up?” Gavin asked, pulling on armor.\n“I’ve skimmed with you before,” Ironfist said.\n“And?”\n“I prefer not to strap on weights when I may have to swim.”\nAh yes, not everyone could swim in full armor. Benefit of being me.\n“Rough weather today,” Ironfist said.\nThat was all he said, but Gavin could tell he wasn’t looking forward to\ngoing at extremely high speed over large waves. No wonder he didn’t want\nhis armor.\nBut in another minute, they were off across the waves. As before,\nIronfist made an excellent partner on the skimmer, and their combined\neffort made them move quickly enough that Gavin was able to use the foils\nto lift the skimmer mostly free of the water. That was good, because the\nchop was rough today, up to two paces high. With the skimmer’s foils just\nright, Gavin was able to keep the boat mostly level. If they’d been right on\nthe surface, it would have been a horrendous trip, impossible, really.\nAfter a few hours, though, they escaped the poor weather.\nThey found the Atashian coast, and Gavin skimmed west until he saw a\nbay that he recognized. Between the incredible speed at which they’d\ntraveled and the impossibility of taking accurate navigational readings\nwhile in the middle of the chop, they’d ended up thirty leagues off course.\nThat much error for a normal ship could mean an extra day at sea. Not for\nthem.\nThey’d overshot the Color Prince’s army, going too far south. Ironfist\ndrafted a binocle, and they saw several Ilytian ships. Traders, supplying the\narmy. Civilians, but civilians possibly carrying guns and powder that would\nwreak havoc on the peaceful innocents of Ru.\nGavin looked at Ironfist. Ironfist shook his head.\nHe was right. Scout first. Fight later.\nThey skimmed through the emerald waters off Idoss, giving it a wide\nberth. People in towers with spyglasses with fine lenses would see them\nlong before they could gather any intelligence. They passed more ships,\nalmost all of them heading west, supplying the army, too, no doubt.\nIt wasn’t good. A few Ilytian ships could simply be enterprising traders\nwho knew they could make a quick profit. But seeing dozens of galleys"

But seeing dozens of galleys\nfrom Idoss, coccas from Ruthgar (meaningless because many merchants\nowned those), and caravels from Garriston meant that whatever government\nthe advancing army had left behind was actually doing its best to support\nthe invasion. That meant reasonably good governance. As Gavin knew, the\nfirst sign of trouble is when those cities you’ve subdued stop sending you\nsupplies. If Garriston had been turned into a city that could export goods in\nonly a few months, that meant that the Color Prince was doing a better job\ngoverning it when he wasn’t there than the rapacious Ruthgari governor had\ndone when he was there. Not good news.\nThey spent the rest of the day scouting, not daring to head too near Ruic\nHead, where the fort would doubtless have good spotters, but taking note of\nexactly how many ships they passed, and the places where they might have\nmissed ships. The biggest thing they learned simply from the positions of\nthe ships was that Gavin had been right. The army was perhaps six days’\nmarch from Ru. That meant the ships coming to help from the Chromeria\nwould arrive only a day before the Color Prince’s army. If the weather\ncooperated.\nNot enough time. It took men time to move barrels of powder into place\nin a city under siege. It took them time to figure where the best shooting\nangles were, and to train to remember the angles in the heat and panic of\nbattle. It took time for men to establish infirmaries and barracks in the most\nlogical places, and to determine which units would work with which, and\nfor officers to figure out which of their ally’s officers were morons.\nCoordination, logistics, backup plans, strongpoints, which places must be\ndefended at all costs and which could be yielded and retaken at grievous\ncost to the enemy—all these took time. It wasn’t enough to put a few\nthousand men in a city, and that was what Gavin was afraid his father was\ngoing to do.\nAndross Guile, for all his intelligence, was a politician and a drafter, not\na general. Gavin couldn’t hate him for it. It was how he saw himself, too.\nMen like Corvan Danavis had different strengths, and Gavin had learned to\ntrust him more than himself. At the Battle of Ivor’s Ridge, he’d seen a\nplatoon, cut down to half strength, isolated and hard pressed on his army’s\nleft flank. If they’d crumpled, the line would have shattered, and they’d\nbeen outnumbered at least three to one.\nDazen had called off the charge he’d been planning, in order to go\nreinforce them.\nGeneral Danavis had stopped him. “I know those men,” he’d said.\n“They’ll hold. Now go.”\nDazen did, and had won the battle. Without his charge into the center,\nthe center would have broken. He hadn’t even seen it, hadn’t known how\nbad the center was until he arrived there with two hundred horse and fifty\nmounted drafters. Corvan had, and he’d been right about the platoon on the\nflank, too. If Dazen had done what he thought instead, they’d have lost. He"

He\nmight have escaped after that battle, but his army would have been\ndestroyed.\nAndross Guile, on the other hand, would never trust anyone more than\nhimself.\nGavin and Ironfist returned after sunset, sculling the last leagues to hide\nthe skimmer. They didn’t return to the Chromeria, though. Instead, they met\nthe first ships of the invasion force.\nIronfist went off to check where his Blackguards were berthed, while\nGavin went to find the generals. He briefed them on everything he’d found\nand ignored their questions about how he’d learned the exact locations of\nenemy ships, in real time, halfway across the sea.\nWorse, he could tell that the fools didn’t believe him.\nGavin made sure a secretary wrote it all down. “Just keep two sets of\nplans,” Gavin said. “In one, do whatever you were already planning to do\nwith what limited intelligence you have.” Gavin meant it both ways, of\ncourse. “In the other, plan as if everything I say is true. Soon enough, you’ll\nknow which to use.”\nHe left them then, and went to the cabin some noble had been evicted\nfrom as soon as the men on the ship saw Gavin arrive. Tomorrow, he would\ngo back out and sink as many ships as possible. It was a damned thing, war.\nHe didn’t like killing merchants, and he liked killing the slaves forced to\nrow their ships even less, but that which strengthens your enemy must be\ndenied him.\nOrholam, if you existed, if you walked the earth as a man, what would\nyou do?\nThere was a knock at the door. Orholam was fast some days.\nIt was Kip. “Kip?” Gavin said, surprised.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“I didn’t mean I’d forgotten who you were,” Gavin said.\n“Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir. Of course not.”\nGavin smiled, though he was exhausted, and beckoned the boy in.\n“I’m sorry to disturb you, sir,” Kip said. “The runts—I mean the\nBlackguard inductees—”\n“I know what they call inductees, Kip,” Gavin said. He smiled. It took a\nlong time to gain respect among the Blackguard. Scrubs, runts, wobs, nunks\n—they had plenty of derogatory names that didn’t stop until the last vows.\nEven then, the first year for a full Blackguard was usually hell.\n“Yes, sir, of course.” Kip blushed. “The commander said war’s coming,\nand there’s no way to prepare for war like being close enough to smell its\nbreath, sir. We’re to help move supplies and civilians. We’ll be off the front\nlines, but not quite safe, he said.”\nHe said it with such an adult tone and assurance that Gavin looked at his\nbrother’s bastard son with new eyes. Four months had changed the boy. He\nwas still chunky—maybe always would be—but as only young men can do,\nhe’d dropped at least a seven already. It was like watching a man emerge\nfrom himself.

The fat that had rounded and softened his features was\nreceding. The strong line of his jaw and brow was all Guile. He was broad-\nshouldered, and his arms, though still shapeless, were huge. His confidence\nwas soaring today, of course, his having just gotten into the Blackguard. It\nwould crumple again—a dozen times. Boys, especially athletes, can look\nlike a man in a day—but it takes them longer to reconcile themselves to\nthemselves. But this Kip, this was a glimpse of the Kip who could be.\nAnd Gavin liked that Kip.\nIt takes some of us a great deal longer to reconcile ourselves to\nourselves, does it?\nLooking at his brother’s son, Gavin was pierced with sorrow. He would\nnever have his own son. Not even if he achieved his impossible goal, and\nthat was looking less and less likely with every passing day.\nAware that he had paused too long, Gavin said, “It’s a good plan. Tell\nthe rest of the runts that we’re going to lose this city, so they shouldn’t get\nany heroic ideas in their heads. Heroism is a fine thing, but heroism wasted\nmeans you can’t be there to help on the day you can make a difference.”\n“Yes, sir. Trainer Fisk has been saying the same thing to us. Except the\npart about losing.” Kip frowned. “But thank you. For telling me the truth.”\nThank you for telling me the truth. Now, if there wasn’t some bitter\nirony in that statement, Gavin was a marsh mug.\n“I want to go with you tomorrow,” Kip said.\n“And what makes you think I’m going anywhere tomorrow—other than\nthe fact that all of us are already traveling, so you’ll be going with me by\ndefault?”\n“You’re the promachos, sir. Whether they call you that or not. I want to\nfight with you.”\nSo ready to fight. But was I any different? How many men did I kill\nbefore I really understood what it meant to kill? Gavin rubbed the bridge of\nhis nose.\n“I’m going to kill men tomorrow, Kip. Men who don’t precisely deserve\nkilling. It’s one thing to kill a wight, or a murderer, or pirates, or a man\ninvading your city or your home, ready to rape and murder and steal. It’s\nanother to kill a merchant whose goods will bring death, but who is himself\nsimply trying to make a living. A man like that has children back home, a\nwife you’re making a widow, and a destitute one at that.”\n“We all pick sides,” Kip said.\n“Simple as that?” Gavin asked.\nKip shifted from foot to foot, but nodded.\n“We’ve heard from four different spies that Liv Danavis is with the\nColor Prince now. Part of his army. So tell me, Kip, if we see Liv Danavis\non the deck of one of those ships, about to toss a grenado at us, you’ll kill\nher? Without hesitation, before she can kill us?”\nKip swallowed. “Orholam’s… beard, sir. I… I hope he would defend me\nfrom having to make such a choice.”"

Literal, real, flesh\nand luxin monsters.”\n“Idealists mature badly. If they can’t outgrow their idealism, they\nbecome hypocrites or blind. Liv has chosen blindness, fixating so much on\nthe Chromeria’s flaws that she believes those who oppose us must be\nparagons. That we’re not perfect says nothing about our enemies, Kip.\nNothing. As it turns out, they’re mostly bad. Bad enough that their rule\nwould be a cataclysm, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have some good\npoints about us. It doesn’t mean that every fool who works for them is evil.\nIt simply means they have to be stopped. By killing them, if necessary.\nThat’s the life you’re stepping into here, Kip. I leave tomorrow at dawn. I’ll\nget permission from your commander for you to join me, but if you can’t\nkill Liv if you need to, don’t show up. I won’t hold it against you as a man,\nbut as a soldier, I won’t want you covering my back either.”\nKip didn’t answer immediately, and Gavin respected him the more for it.\n“Thank you, sir,” Kip said eventually. “I don’t like it, but I appreciate\nyour honesty.”\nHonesty? When I tell the truth about this and lie about all else?\nAppreciate something else, boy. I’m a liar to the core.\nChapter 98\nDawn found Kip on the deck, waiting for his father. It was cold and the seas\nwere choppy, but his Blackguard’s runt clothes were warm enough. At least\nwhen combined with his fat. He pulled the gray cloak around himself,\nstamping his feet. He hadn’t gotten much sleep. The idea of killing Liv—or\nof being killed by her—had kept him from that.\nBut Liv had made her choices. She’d believed the lies she wanted to\nbelieve. She’d gone over to the side of madmen. How could she be so\nstupid?\nMaybe Kip hadn’t known her at all.\nThe thought made him sick to his stomach. He thought of her smile. Her\nlaugh when she’d made him think the walkway between the towers was\nsnapping, the fine curves of her body as she’d walked in front of him.\nThe knot in his stomach eased when he saw his father come out of his\nroom onto the deck, already speaking with Commander Ironfist.\nThe commander was in the lead, speaking over his shoulder. “Do you\nknow what your wife will do to me if I let anything happen to you?” he\nasked.\n“Wife?” Kip asked.\nCommander Ironfist scowled quickly. “My apologies, my lord, I didn’t\n—”\n“It’s not a secret, Commander,” Gavin said smoothly. “I married Karris\nbefore we left, Kip.”\n“You wha—Oh, oh,” Kip said.

Which had\nincluded curses and slapping and jumping off a boat rather than be near\nGavin. Kip closed his mouth, then realized not saying anything might look\nlike he was passing judgment. He couldn’t help but feel left out. That he\nhadn’t deserved to hear about it right away, that his father was still holding\nout on him. “Uh, congratulations, sir?”\n“Why thank you, Kip. And I’m very glad to see you this morning. I’ve\nasked you to fight not as a boy, but as a man, and you’ve responded. And I\ncan tell you haven’t slept, so you’ve responded appropriately. Well done,\nson.”\nWell done, son. The words were what Kip had ached to hear for his\nwhole life, and doubly so since learning Gavin Guile was his father. But\nthey were delivered perfunctorily, as if Gavin were checking items off a list,\nwithout emotion, without attention.\n“Now, as we go this morning,” Gavin said, “I want you to tell me about\nthe assassination attempt.”\nKip hadn’t really thought of what happened in the alley that way, but\nGavin said it so blithely that Kip knew he had to be right. Lucia had died\nbecause of Kip. Had stepped into the line of fire. It was, oddly, exactly what\nBlackguards were supposed to do, but she’d done it on accident. Kip wasn’t\nsure if that made it better, or worse.\nThey walked to the stern and Kip saw that they weren’t going alone. At\nthe bottom of a pair of rope ladders, a dozen Blackguards stood on a\nskimmer the likes of which Kip had never seen. It was, of course, bigger so\nthat it could hold seventeen of them, but it was also shaped differently, like\na large flying wing, with eight scoops. Every Blackguard was armed with a\nbow and a large quiver and bandoliers of grenadoes. Some had spare\nspectacles. From there, each was armed according to his fancy and\nexpertise. A couple had bucklers. One carried a notched sword-breaker.\nMost had a pistol. One had a bich’hwa like Karris often carried. And others\nhad the forward-bent ataghans or the sweeping scimitars. The skimmer\nitself had grapnels and ropes aplenty.\nPlus, every Blackguard was himself a considerable weapon.\nKip’s awe and hesitancy must have shown on his face, because Gavin\nsaid, “Kip, you can’t become who you need to be if I’m not willing to risk\nlosing you. You still want to come?”\nCruxer was down there. Cruxer was coming! He saw Kip and lifted his\nchin in greeting. He looked pretty excited that he was being allowed to\ncome.\nIt pained Kip to say it, but he said, “I don’t bring much to the table, sir.”\n“Not yet. But you’re about to learn from the best.”\nThey climbed down the ladder and onto the huge skimmer. Gavin began\ngiving the Blackguards instructions. “Biggest risk is you’ll tear your arms"

        "text": "“Not yet. But you’re about to learn from the best.”\nThey climbed down the ladder and onto the huge skimmer. Gavin began\ngiving the Blackguards instructions. “Biggest risk is you’ll tear your arms\noff. You can’t go from a standstill to full speed in a breath. If you have the\nskill, you can narrow the pipes at first. The luxin needn’t be focused. This is\none place you can be sloppy, whatever is the easiest band for you to draft\nwill work.” He continued, while Kip settled into his place.\nThey released the ropes holding the skimmer to the galleon and Gavin\nand Ironfist manned the pipes on the main platform, and soon Kip heard the\nfamiliar whoop, whoop, whoop. Soon, half of the other Blackguards joined\nin, while Gavin and Ironfist gave instructions, and thenceforth the men and\nwomen spoke back and forth to each other, giving tips and hints.\nGavin taught them how to do turns and showed how sharply they could\ndo it. And Kip saw the same look of delight steal over the Blackguards’\nfaces that had crept over his own the first time he’d experienced the wind\nand waves and the sheer, unbelievable speed.\nThen, when things settled down, Kip told his father the whole story of\nthe assassination attempt as they sped across the waves. This skimmer was\nmodified to enclose the front, so the wind didn’t obliterate their\nconversations.\n“This… this is different than the skimmer before,” Kip said. “Didn’t you\njust make this up a little while ago?”\nGavin shrugged. “War always moves forward, and if you’re not at the\nleading edge of what’s possible, you might not live long enough to regret\nit.”\nThey saw many ships, but didn’t close with any of them until after noon.\nGavin stopped, motioning to Ironfist to do the same, and peered at the\nhorizon. He brought out a large glass binocle, which was odd. The last time\nhe’d needed to see into the distance, he’d simply drafted disks of perfect\nblue luxin. Maybe the clarity of this glass was better.\n“It’s flying their flag,” Gavin said. “Broken chains on a black\nbackground.” He handed the binocle to Ironfist.\nIronfist was quiet. “That isn’t just a big ship,” he said.\n“It’s a great ship,” Gavin said.\n“I can’t even count how many guns it has. They’re not just on one\ndeck,” Commander Ironfist said.\nGavin said, “Forty-three heavy guns, one hundred and forty-one light\nguns, fifty-two paces long, holds up to seven hundred men.”\n“Are you joking?” Commander Ironfist asked. “You couldn’t possibly\nhave counted…”\n“It’s Pash Vecchio’s flagship,” Gavin said. “If he’s brought his flagship\nhere, he’s thrown in with the Color Prince. He wouldn’t have hired out that\nship.”\nKip understood that this was Not Good. “Pash Vecchio?” he asked.\n“The pirate king,” Commander Ironfist said.\n“One of four,” Gavin said. As if that made it less impressive.\n“The most powerful of the four,” Commander Ironfist said dryly.\n“Could have sworn that ship was going down the last time,” Gavin said."

He was a\npirate king, too,” Gavin said pointedly. “Good news: we won’t be killing\ninnocents.”\n“Great,” Kip said, trying to muster some enthusiasm. “Did you say one\nhundred and eighty-four guns?”\n“Relax, there’s only eighteen on the stern,” Gavin said.\nComforting.\n“What do you think they’re bringing?” Ironfist asked.\n“Guns, or men, or just coming to blockade our ships from getting into\nRuic Bay. Regardless, big obstacle. Needs removing.”\n“You always did love a simple impossible challenge, didn’t you?”\nIronfist said. He didn’t sound like he thought he had a chance of dissuading\nGavin.\nWhich, Kip knew, he didn’t.\n“Why do you think I let you bring so many Blackguards?” Gavin asked.\n“Thought that was too easy,” Ironfist grumbled.\nGavin turned to the Blackguards. “Ready to see what you can do?” he\nasked.\nHe got grins in return. The Blackguards were like children with a new\ntoy.\n“I should have given you more time to train with the… what are we\ncalling them, Commander?” Gavin asked.\n“Sea chariots.”\nGavin nodded acquiescence. “Lots of guns, and let’s guess that there’ll\nbe drafters on board, maybe numerous. Maybe wights. They’ll have tricks\nyou’ve never seen. Expect the guns to be loaded already, though we may\nget lucky with how fast we’ll be on top of them. Staggered approach, try to\ncut their lines and set fire to the sails early. We circle sunwise so we don’t\nhave collisions. Sinking the great ship is the primary target. If any other\nships join the fight, they’re targets of opportunity, not worth dying for.\nSpeed is your best defense, but expect to miss your first few shots. It’s hard\nto adjust your aim to this much speed at first. You figure it out. If you slow\ntoo much, you’ve given away your advantage and you’ve become one\ndrafter against a ship full of musketeers for all we know. There are\nblindages on every deck, so until those are set afire or removed, don’t\nexpect to toss grenadoes up top and have much effect. Four crow’s nests big\nenough to hold multiple archers or drafters. Eight large guns pointed to\nstern, including two that can aim down far enough to hit close targets. Ten\nsmaller gunport doors that won’t open until they’re ready to fire. Oh, and\nher name’s the Gargantua. Questions?”\n“Where and when do we regroup?” a skinny woman with hard eyes and\ndreadlocks asked.\n“Roughly, here, in one hour. If more ships rush in, one league east of the\neastmost ship.

Asif?”\nA young man with a shaven head said, “Sir, I assume that every drafter\nwe see is a target of opportunity as well? To keep knowledge of the sea\nchariots out of their hands?”\nThere was a pause, and Kip realized what the young man was asking.\nDid they specially set out to kill every drafter, because there was no way to\ntake them prisoner—you couldn’t disarm a drafter.\n“Just seeing the chariots won’t be enough for them to mimic them easily.\nDon’t put yourselves at risk. Low priority, but yes. Each of you is more\nvaluable to me alive than having fifty of them dead. Got it?”\nThey understood. They weren’t primarily elite warriors, they were elite\nguards whose ranks had been decimated by the battle at Garriston. The\nBlackguard itself needed them alive.\n“Then let’s go sink some pirates.”\nThe Blackguards gave a cheer, only Cruxer forgetting to join in, looking\nwide-eyed and tight-strung.\nGavin drew his priceless dagger-pistols and turned to Kip. “Would you\nhold these for me?”\nKip scowled, remembering how he’d nearly dropped them into the sea\nlast time.\n“Joking, Kip. Joking.”\nKip grinned.\n“This is for you.” Gavin handed Kip a bundle.\nUnwrapping it, Kip found it was a belt with a pouch meant to be worn\nacross one hip, like a holster. In the pouch were seven spectacles, in spectral\norder, each in its own velvet-lined half-pocket. There were little runes in\nsilver sticking out next to each pocket so that you could tell by feel which\nspectacles you were about to draw.\nKip looked up at his father, wide-eyed. The spectacles alone were worth\na fortune, but this looked old.\n“Do your best not to lose the sub-red and the superviolet. We don’t\nknow how to make spectacles like those anymore,” Gavin said.\nDrawing the sub-red and putting them on, Kip gasped as he saw what\nGavin meant. Usually you had to relax your eyes and let them lose focus to\nsee the heat of things. With these glasses, Kip could see in the sub-red\nspectrum and the visible spectrum at the same time.\n“You’ll still have to relax your eyes to draft sub-red, but it makes finding\ngood sources much easier.” Gavin buckled the belt onto Kip and showed\nhim how he could draw a pair of spectacles quickly, flick his wrist to snap\nthe earpieces open, and put them on. Then he flicked the spectacles to one\nside, which snapped one earpiece closed, and then hooked the other in,\nletting the pouch close the other and hold it firmly.\nGavin gave Kip the binocle and said, “You can draft when we get into\nthe fight, but I want you to keep an eye out. It’s easy to get tunnel vision."

Wait for it!”\nChapter 99\nAs usual, Liv woke next to Zymun. It was early, and the young man’s\nbreath was even, regular. He was a heavy sleeper. Their tent wasn’t large,\nbarely tall enough to stand in, and they slept on piles of furs and blankets on\nthe ground. Liv rolled over, careful not to disturb Zymun. He insisted she\nsleep naked, and sometimes he liked to start his day the way he liked to end\nit. It was flattering to be desired so much, but sometimes she thought she\nsimply happened to be the most convenient way to sate his hungers.\nShe blinked, aware of some change in the atmosphere, a freer brush of\nthe wind than a closed tent should allow.\nThe Color Prince stood outlined against the morning light in front of the\nopen tent flap. He held up a finger so she didn’t speak and wake Zymun. He\nmotioned that she was to come with him.\nA wave of shame went through her. She felt like a whore, caught by her\nfather with a boy she didn’t even love. The feelings crested, and she quickly\ndrafted superviolet. It was like the first puff of ratweed in the morning,\nexcept the luxin made her think more clearly. The feelings were the vestiges\nof small-town religiosity. Besides, the Color Prince believed in freedom,\nfree choices. She was young. She could do whatever she wanted. There was\nno need to feel shame here.\nShe stood, briefly forgetting in the superviolet rush that she was naked.\nKoios White Oak looked at her frankly, and she soaked up his regard as\nboldly as if it were light itself. She waited a long second until she saw the\ntwinge of regret hit him, and moved as soon as she saw it, gathering up her\nshift and pulling on her dress so that he might think she hadn’t seen it.\nThere were other kinds of power than magic and the sword. But some\npower works best in silence.\nIn silence, she dressed in her most practical dress and held her long dark\nhair out of the way. The Color Prince buttoned the last buttons for her, then\nshe followed him out into the camp.\nAs the Blood Robes had marched on, rolling over town after town, their"

The Color Prince buttoned the last buttons for her, then\nshe followed him out into the camp.\nAs the Blood Robes had marched on, rolling over town after town, their\nranks had swollen. Liv was never sure how many of those who joined them\nbelieved in their cause, or if they merely believed in victory and plunder.\nShe wanted to despise those who joined out of convenience, but she was\nusing superviolet too much to be more than coolly amused most of the time.\nBesides, men believe in power, and what is victory but the demonstration of\npower?\nParts of her still mourned it, but everywhere she looked, she saw that the\nColor Prince was right. Power. All human interactions came down to power.\nThe Color Prince gave sermons every day, and he had disciples now,\nboth drafters and munds, who wrote down every word and did their best to\nmake a coherent system of it all. He talked about Dazen coming back and\nchampioning their cause. He talked about freedom. He talked about the\ntributes they all paid to the Chromeria. Though his words melded politics\nand religion and history and civics and science, Liv thought she discerned\nless of an incredibly nuanced system underneath his rhetoric, and more of a\nbelief created simply by the strength of his believers’ faith that it must be\nrational, or their great leader wouldn’t profess it. She couldn’t tell how\nmuch of it the Omnichrome believed, but she knew that if he was going to\naccomplish his great purposes, he needed loyal followers. And those\nfollowers needed something to believe in, to unify them.\nHe didn’t preach to the mob about power, just as he didn’t allow them to\ncall him Koios. Familiarity and knowledge both were for the privileged.\nSometimes Liv thought the Color Prince probably didn’t give a damn what\nall the people believed, that he tapped the heresies he tapped because he\nfigured he might as well exploit every resentment against the Chromeria.\n“Have you figured out your great purpose yet, Aliviana?” the prince\nasked. He nodded to a group of green wights who barely stirred at his\npresence. Greens weren’t much good at veneration either.\n“Aside from bait for my father?”\n“I told you from the beginning you were that, and no, I haven’t given up\nall hope for Corvan. But a hostage needn’t be given privileges or the\nfreedom you have. Surely you’ve gone past that.”\n“I’m the best superviolet you’ve got. It has something to do with that,”\nLiv said.\n“A broad guess,” the prince said. “But not long ago you would have said\n‘one of the best.’ ” He seemed amused.\n“I’ve changed,” she said. She was more confident now; she had cut\naway the Chromeria’s false humility. “And I’m right.”\n“Mmm.”\nThe Red Cliffs loomed above the whole camp. There were spidery trails\neverywhere up those cliffs, but the prince had opted to send almost\neveryone along the coastal road. Only his cavalry had traveled along the\nhigh road, foraging and ready to put down any armed resistance.\nThe army was big enough now that some days there were skirmishes\nthat Liv didn’t even find out about until after dark.

The Atashian army had\nprobed the Blood Robes for weakness, but with the number of drafters the\nprince had, they hadn’t found much. Zymun had speculated, though, that\nthey were going to find out how much steel was in the Atashians’ spines\nsoon. The army was to reach the narrowest pass between sheer cliffs and the\nocean tomorrow.\n“Are they going to crush us at the Gates of Sand?” Liv asked.\n“No,” the prince said.\n“Really? Zymun thought that was the best chance they had of stopping\nus before we get to the grasslands around Ru.”\n“It was. But you need naval support to hold the Gates, and our Ilytian\nallies crushed the Atashian navy five days ago.”\nLiv hadn’t even heard a whisper of that. “Ilytian allies? But the Ilytians\ndon’t believe in anything.”\n“They believe in gold.” The Color Prince gave a grim smile. Together,\nthey climbed up an exposed rock promontory. The soldiers standing there\nsnapped salutes. The prince reached the top and did something with his\neyes. He expelled a disappointed breath. “Not yet. Maybe tomorrow.”\n“My lord?”\n“Close your eyes, Liv. Can you feel it?”\nShe closed her eyes and tried to feel. She felt the coolness of the\nmorning, smelled the latrines, the campfires, the cooking meat, her own\nbody. She felt the hummingbird weight of light on her skin, light as a wind,\npassing in soft billows from the rising sun. She heard the sergeants calling\nout to training men, the clash of sticks on armor, the neighing of horses, the\nlaugh of a woman, the tread of feet. She heard the faintly unnatural hiss of\nthe Color Prince’s breath.\nOpening her eyes, she looked over to the man who was shaking the\nworld to its foundations. Shook her head, disappointed in herself.\n“Tomorrow. Tomorrow maybe you’ll see it. Go now, and send up\nDervani Malargos and Jerrosh Green.”\nThey were the two best green drafters the Blood Robes had, the teachers\nfor every green who hadn’t yet broken the halo. Liv went down and called\nfor them. They seemed to be waiting, and the two of them went up on the\npromontory.\nLiv watched them as the prince spoke to them, wondering if they would\nsee or feel what she had not, wondering if she was failing in some way.\n“Good morning, beautiful. Always with the tests and mysteries, huh?”\nZymun said, coming up beside her. He put a possessive arm around her.\nSometimes that annoyed her, but she’d been worried yesterday that Zymun\nwas already losing interest in her, so she said nothing.\n“I suppose,” she said. “It’s not capricious, though.”\n“You think,” Zymun said. He was the only person Liv knew who dared\nto speak derisively of anything the Color Prince did. At first she’d wondered\nat that, but a little yellow and superviolet meditation had made it plain:"

He felt threatened, less of a man around the most\npowerful man in all the world.\nThat was the mystery to her.\n“So what was it today?” Zymun asked.\n“Asked me if I saw something. I didn’t.”\n“Looks like they didn’t either,” Zymun said, nodding toward Dervani\nand Jerrosh. “Those two hate each other, and both want to lead the greens.\nAs if the greens can be led. Idiots and fools.”\nThe men were bickering, faces turning red, furious. Liv could almost\nmake out the words from here. But she watched the Color Prince instead.\nFrom the set of his overlarge shoulders, she could tell he was furious\nhimself, though nothing else betrayed it. He raised one hand, as the people\nin the camp around seemed torn between watching and not being caught\nwatching.\nThe two greens stopped abruptly. The Color Prince said something else,\nand they both dropped to their knees, apologizing. Odd to see a green on its\nknees.\nIts. She’d thought its knees, not his knees. Wasn’t that curious? Another\nremnant of my childish beliefs, that a person ceases to be a person when he\nbreaks the halo. Our very language has been corrupted to make the murder\nof drafters palatable.\nThe Color Prince drew a pistol and shot Jerrosh Green between the eyes.\nA spray of blood, atomized, drifted to the ground slower than the chunks\nof red-gray brain matter liberated from their bony home via lead. Jerrosh\nGreen’s body dropped backward and tumbled down the bare rock of the\npromontory. The camp was suddenly silent. Pistol still smoking, the prince\nbound a slender choker with a black jewel on it on Dervani’s neck. He\ngestured for Dervani to stand.\nThe drafter stood and left without a word.\n“Funny thing is,” Zymun said, “I still can’t tell which of those two is\nmore brainless.”\nShe looked at Zymun from deep within the grip of superviolet—she\nhadn’t even noticed drafting it again, but now it was like a friend to her—\nand realized that the boy wasn’t hard and callous. At least he wasn’t only\nthose. He was terrified. He was imagining his own brain painting the rocks.\nHe looked at her, and she saw in his eyes that he feared her, too. He was\ntiring of her, but not out of boredom or for her lack of enthusiasm under the\nblankets. He didn’t want an equal; he wanted to be worshipped. Zymun was\nfar more dangerous than she had realized. She would need to be rid of him,\nbut carefully, cleverly, so he thought it was his own idea.\n“I don’t know how you do it,” she said. She dropped the superviolet. He\ncould sometimes tell by her voice when she was drafting it. “I don’t know\nhow you can see that and not be afraid.” The shudder she let through wasn’t\nwholly feigned.

She turned her eyes to his and moistened her lips and said softly, “Take\nme back to our tent. Right now.”\nChapter 100\nThe big guns on the Gargantua’s top deck belched flame and smoke, the\nsight of hell’s bounty outracing its sound. Two jets of water, fifty paces\nahead of the skimmer, announced the miss an instant before the roar of the\ncannon revealed it had even been fired.\nOne of the guns on the second deck went off next, and Gavin shouted,\n“Now!”\nAround the skimmer, Kip saw that the Blackguards were grouped into\npairs, one at the reeds and one archer. Each team’s archer had a rope in\nhand, and starting at the outside teams, they pulled.\nBefore Kip realized what was happening, the skimmer split, each team\nsuddenly freed, one driver and one archer, the sea chariots breaking off\nfrom the skimmer smoothly and multiplying their force instantly. Two, four,\nsix, and eight split off, leaving only Gavin and Ironfist and Kip on the now\nmuch smaller skimmer in the center.\nThe water behind them cratered and jetted as Kip heard the roar of the\ncannon again. Then it seemed the world turned to cannon fire. The\nGargantua loomed larger and larger and the eight skimmers cut the waves\nwith perfect grace, none so close to the others that a single cannon shell\ncould hit two of them.\nThe seas were rough today, so Kip was glad that his father had made\nsupports, both up behind his back so he wouldn’t tumble off the stern and\nalso handles so he could brace himself. Kip saw that the deck of the\nGargantua was actually open, contrary to what Gavin had expected, but\nthen, even in the few seconds that Kip was watching, the great wooden\nscreens that were the blindages were brought down by scrambling sailors.\nSeen in sub-red through Kip’s spectacles, the men glowed as if lit from\nwithin, still clearly visible despite the screen.\nThe skimmer cut hard to port and Kip barely caught himself. He didn’t\nsee any danger, but he decided that even as he was scanning the big ship\nand trying to keep an eye out for more distant dangers, he should copy his\nfather’s and Ironfist’s stance. Each man had his legs set wide and knees\nbent, keeping his weight low.\nThe great rudder of the Gargantua turned hard, and the lumbering great\nship, sails full, began to turn. Along the broadside, Kip could see gunports\nsnapping open, on at least three different levels. Not all at once, but as each\ncrew was ready.\nThere were a lot of guns.\nFrom the nearest crow’s nest, a ball of luxin the size of a cat arced out.\n“Drafter! First crow’s nest!” Kip called out.\nThe luxin ball split in midair and ignited. It landed on the water only a\ndozen feet from the starboard side in a curtain of flame—and floated, flames\ntwo feet high.\nThe first sea chariot cut hard to port, nearly plastering itself against the"

The next must not have seen the fire in the swelling of the\nwaves, but those same swells saved it as the swells and the Gargantua’s\nwake made a ramp that flung the chariot into the air and neatly over the fire.\nGavin and Ironfist cut wide around the burning slick and then cut close\nto the ship.\n“Musketeer! Third—fourth crow’s nest!” Kip shouted. He couldn’t even\nyell his warnings right.\nThere were half a dozen men along the high castle manning swivel guns.\nThey had to aim between the bars of the blindage, but they didn’t seem to\nbe having much trouble. Kip threw sub-red at them, had no idea if he’d hit\nanything, and then hit the deck as one of the big cannons went off mere feet\nfrom his head as the skimmer pulled even to the ship. The world\ndisappeared as cannons roared and great billowing clouds of black smoke\nand cordite gushed from their throats.\nSeen through the sub-red lenses, the world was delineated into great\nflashes of exploding guns, the sharp tongues of spitting muskets, the muted\nbursts of the grenadoes, and the ghostly shadows of men.\nThen they were out of the smoke. They immediately cut hard to port,\npassing in the very shadow of the beakhead. Gavin and Ironfist both hurled\ngrenadoes into that deck overhead. Gavin’s was wrapped in red luxin, and\nstuck; Ironfist’s was spiked, and stuck. Twin explosions and showers of\nwood and flame announced their success. None of the cannons on the port\nside of the Garguntua had been fired, so Kip was able to see clearly once\nmore.\nFlames sprang up on the mainsail—and were immediately extinguished\nin sprays of orange luxin. A few of the lines had been successfully cut, but\nthose that had been merely set aflame were also saved.\n“Brace!” Gavin shouted.\nThe skimmer curved to starboard to get some separation, and just as\nthey rose out of a trough, Gavin shot a huge ball of flaming red luxin at the\nfirst crow’s nest. The drafter saw it coming and tried to blast it aside, but the\nball merely shattered and drenched him and the crow’s nest in flame.\nBut Kip barely saw that, because the concussion of Gavin throwing\nsomething so massive just as they went airborne threw the skimmer hard to\nthe side, and had they not hit the crest of another wave, they probably\nwould have capsized.\nInstead, they simply slowed to a crawl as Ironfist and Gavin were\nthrown off the reeds for a moment, and the skimmer turned the wrong way,\nbobbing in the waves. Kip saw two men training swivel guns on them even\nas a man engulfed in flames pitched out of the crow’s nest, tangling in the\nlines as he fell, shrieking.\nThen the gunners disappeared in a wash of flame and exploding yellow\nlight as four of the sea chariots closed around the Prism.\nThe port-side cannons began firing, and Kip saw one of the archers on"

The blindage was afire, and Kip\nsaw the sailors and soldiers above them struggling to throw it over the side.\nOne of the Blackguards had painted a line of red luxin down the entire\nlength of the Gargantua’s hull, and as the cannons roared, it lit.\nWithin seconds, Gavin and Ironfist had the skimmer back up to speed.\nMusket balls whistled past them, dimpling the water. Several of the archers\nwere firing now at great speed. And Kip could tell that the soldiers were\nonly beginning to make it to the deck.\n“Birds!” Kip shouted as a flock of pigeons exploded from the deck of\nthe Gargantua. Pigeons?\n“Ironbeaks!” one of the Blackguard shouted.\nKip lost sight of the birds and the ship itself as the skimmer dodged in\nand out. In the sudden lurching, he thought he was going to be sick.\nI’m going to be seasick? In the middle of a battle?\nHe looked to the horizon to try to steady his stomach. Two of the sea\nchariot drivers who’d both lost their archers had gone out the range of the\nguns and abandoned one chariot, pulling another cord that made the luxin\nfall apart at the seams. Gavin hadn’t wanted the secret of how to make the\nchariots falling into enemy hands. But beyond them, Kip saw a galley\ncoming, its triple oar decks moving the small ship quickly.\n“Got a galley coming,” Kip shouted. He pulled up the binocle and\nalmost puked as the magnified vision seemed to magnify the swaying. “No\nflag.”\nGavin shot a look up. “Probably pirates looking for an easy kill, not\nVecchio’s. Keep an eye on it.”\nThen they were back into the fight. They came out from under the stern\ngalley onto the starboard side and saw an explosion blow one of the\ncannons on the lowest gun deck completely out the side into the water in a\nspray of wood and fire and smoke. One of the Blackguards—Kip though it\nwas Cruxer—whooped.\nAn instant later, Kip saw one of the pigeons dive at Cruxer. It hit his\nchest, stuck.\nCruxer slapped the bird off his chest. It splashed into the water and less\nthan a second later exploded.\nThen Kip understood. Like the hellhounds Trainer Fisk had told them\nabout, these birds were natural birds, but they’d been infused with a\ndrafter’s will to do one thing—attack the Blackguards. And in this case,\nthey’d also been equipped with small grenadoes.\nWhich meant several dozen small flying bombs were circling the great\nship—small, intelligent bombs.\nAs intelligent as pigeons, anyway.\nAnd if that wasn’t quite terrifying, seeing half a dozen of them hit a\nBlackguard team that had slowed to throw a grenado into a gunport was. A\nsecond later, both driver and archer were ripped apart by the explosions."

A\nsecond later, both driver and archer were ripped apart by the explosions.\nThe grenado the woman had thrown bounced harmlessly off the blindage—\nwhich hadn’t been pulled off on this side of the ship—and exploded in the\nwater, barely so much as scoring the wood of the hull.\nThe Gargantua was a floating castle. The fires weren’t spreading. It was\ninvincible.\n“Reeds,” Gavin said to Ironfist.\nThe big man seemed to know what he meant instantly, because he took\nGavin’s reed and began propelling the skimmer by himself.\n“Kip, hold my feet down. All your weight.”\nGavin was already weaving something between his hands. Kip\npractically dove onto his feet. Instant obedience. Then he followed Gavin’s\neyes.\nThe entire flock of the remaining ironbeaks was headed straight at them.\nWith only Ironfist on the reeds, the birds were catching up.\nGavin didn’t finish until the first bird was practically within arm’s reach.\nThen he threw both hands out and a net of yellow luxin spun out from him.\nIt engulfed all of the birds. Then Gavin yanked his arms down and was\nnearly pulled from Kip’s grasp. But the pressure lasted only a second.\nThere was no such thing as action at a distance with luxin. To throw\nsomething, you had to throw it; to slap something down onto a deck, you\nhad to yank it down. Gavin had made the luxin a lever, and he’d cast the\nentire net of the birds onto the deck of the Gargantua.\nWhere they exploded. Kip saw half a man and a helmet flying off the\ndeck.\nNot an empty helmet.\nGavin scrambled back into place, and Kip saw an orange drafter peek\nover the deck and spray luxin down on the burning hull, extinguishing the\nflames.\nIronfist saw him, too, and put a blue spike in his skull. The man tumbled\ninto the sea.\n“They’re organizing into musket teams,” Ironfist said. And the effect\nwas almost immediate. The men on the decks must have started putting the\nbest marksmen in front, while those farther back reloaded and gave them\nfresh muskets, because both the rate and the accuracy of fire increased.\nA sea chariot driver just behind them crumpled, turning the pipes wildly\nto one side. Her chariot flipped, flinging her archer into the sea.\n“Guard overboard!” Kip cried.\nIronfist’s and Gavin’s reaction was immediate. Catching a peak, they\nshot hard to starboard. The skimmer flipped completely backward before\nthey hit the next wave.\nAll of them were nearly torn off the skimmer from the sudden change in\ndirection, but neither Gavin nor Ironfist slowed. Kip thought he was going\nto tear the post behind him right off, but it held. Both men pulled grenadoes\nfrom their bandoliers and tossed them in high arcs. Then another.\n“Sub-red on any muskets you see, Kip!” Gavin shouted.\nThey sped toward the swimming young man.\n“I got the reeds,” Gavin said.

Kip thought he was going too close, but as he popped over\nthe last wave, Gavin turned slightly and they splashed barely a hand’s\nbreadth from the Blackguard. Ironfist reached down and between Ironfist’s\nstrength and the Blackguard’s, the man popped out of the water in barely a\nsecond.\nKip hadn’t seen what effect the grenadoes had on the deck, but the\nmusket fire had slowed. Then he saw one of the swivel guns on a lower\ndeck being turned toward them.\nThe other Blackguards on their sea chariots had rallied around them, and\nthey were spraying red luxin everywhere, the yellows casting flashbombs to\ndazzle and distract, but the sheer number of them congregating in one sector\nwas enough to encourage the cannoneers to turn the big guns.\nThe screams of the furious and the shouts of anger and the moans of the\ninjured and the cries of urgent orders and the crackling of fireballs and the\nsnapping of distant muskets and booms of cannons and the whistle of the\nbig mortars and the snap of sails and the wash of the waves and hissing of\nthe wind and the moans of the dying and the shrieks of the wights faded,\ngrew distant, hushed. Kip could hear only the deep, slow whoosh of his\nown heartbeat, ludicrously slow, and around and beneath that a sighing, like\nthe beach when the tide goes out. For a moment, he had a wild notion that\nhe was hearing the sunlight hit the waves.\nHe saw one of the Blackguard archers drawing an arrow back. The\nstring touched her lips and the arrow leapt out at the very moment a musket\nball tore her jaw off.\nWhoosh. The world looked beyond real. Kip realized he was seeing the\nwhole spectrum at once. He could see dozens of guns. The skimmer was\ndirectly broadside to the Gargantua. And he could see the glow of men, the\nglow of matches and slow fuses. He could see the gleam of metal on the\npowder barrels through the open gunports, could see straight through the\nsmoke.\nHe swept a hand out and fanned superviolet strands like spiderwebs out\nto every gun and barrel he could see. The superviolet was so fast and light,\nit hit its targets almost the instant he chose them. Then he swept his hand\nback, releasing little bursts of firecrystals so hot they burned his hand even\nas he shot them out at unbelievable speed.\nSatisfaction swept through him even before the next big whoosh of his\nheartbeat rolled through his ears.\nStruck by the firecrystals, every loaded musket and cannon on the\nstarboard side of the Gargantua went off at once. Cannons that were in the\nmiddle of being loaded went off, muskets that men were standing over with\nramrod in hand went off. Loaded muskets being handed up to marksmen\nwent off. Some of the cannons hadn’t been charged yet, and Kip felt vexed.\nOthers, though, had been fully loaded but not yet pushed back into place,\nand they blew holes out of the sides of the gun decks."

Flames\nand smoke and wood and cannons and men and parts of men blasted fresh\nholes in every deck.\nThe roar ripped over the Blackguards and Kip blinked. Time was back.\nHe was back.\nMen were screaming. Terrible, terrible screams. He could see men on\nfire, skin blackened and sloughing off, running to jump into the sea. Fires\nleapt out of all three gun decks.\nThe skimmer shuddered and Gavin and Ironfist threw their will into\ngetting back up to speed.\n“Four ships coming in, half a league,” Kip said. He felt empty, stunned.\n“Under the beakhead,” Gavin said.\n“Not so sure that’s a good—” Ironfist said.\n“Under the beak! The wights will be up on deck any second. We’ve got\none chance at this!”\nIronfist acquiesced instantly and they sped in front of the ship, hardly\nany muskets barking now. They came under the front of the still-moving\nship, and Ironfist took the reeds, maneuvering them so that the ship didn’t\nplow right over them. The wooden beakhead loomed just above their heads,\nclose enough that when the waves lifted them, it almost smashed Kip’s\nhead. Gavin wrapped one fist in fire and punched into the hull overhead.\nWhen the wave receded, Gavin was yanked into the air, his fist still\nstuck into the wood. Kip lunged, but missed him.\n“Leave him!” Ironfist shouted. “You see anyone, you light ’em up!”\nKip could see then that Gavin was drafting still, heedless of his body\nhanging by one arm.\nI don’t think I even could hold myself up by one arm.\nGavin was doing it and drafting—and drafting something horrendously\ncomplicated, if it was taking him this much time. Then he was done. When\nthe skimmer rose on the next wave, Gavin touched down on the deck as\ngracefully as a dancer.\n“Two minutes,” he said. “We need to keep the drafters busy.”\nAnd so they circled again, Commander Ironfist giving hand signals to\nthe three remaining sea chariots. They concentrated on hurling luxin and\nexhausted their grenadoes, some of them successfully tossing them into the\nhuge holes Kip’s explosions had created. Somewhere in the fighting, one of\nthe teams had successfully cut all the rigging to the foremast, and another\nhad set fire to the lateen sails, but the mainsail and mainmast were still\nwhole.\nThe great ship seemed invincible.\nGavin swooped in and destroyed the capsized sea chariot, and then after\nperhaps thirty seconds they circled wider, out more than a hundred paces.\nWith so many of the big guns silenced for the moment, it was close enough\nto still be a threat, but far enough away to be safer from all but the luckiest\nmusket shot.\nThe Prism and one beefy female Blackguard were the only ones who"

Everyone had gone through all their grenadoes. The\narchers had used up most of their arrows, and the four ships Kip had seen\nearlier—two small galleons and two caravels—were bearing down on them.\nGavin gave a quiet oath. “If it doesn’t happen in the next—”\nA deep whoomping explosion drowned out his words. It seemed to\nshake the sea itself in its bed.\nKip shot a look at Gavin. His father looked oddly bereaved. “Their\npowder room was below the waterline. Makes it a lot harder for a stray shell\nto hit it, but… poor bastards.”\nWhen the smoke began to clear, Kip saw that both sides of the hull had\nbeen blown out right in the middle of the ship. With wood creaking and\nsnapping, the mainmast plunged off to one side like a man jumping\noverboard, throwing men from both of its crow’s nests and slashing through\nthe weakened deck at the ship’s waist.\nSome few men were leaping from the decks, and fire was everywhere.\nSmaller explosions sounded like popping corn. Then the waist collapsed\nand the ship folded in on itself. The front half of the great ship went down\nalmost instantly, far faster than Kip would have believed something made\nentirely of wood should sink. The stern rolled over on its side, open decks\ngaping like open wounds, swallowing the seas in great burbling gulps.\nDeck by burning deck, the great ship plunged into the sea, hissing and\nspitting and vomiting up flotsam and broken men.\nBefore it even slipped under the waves, Ironfist asked, “Mop up the\nswimmers?”\nGavin looked toward the coming ships.\nMop up? Commander Ironfist meant, Should we kill the men who\nsurvived?\n“You see any wights make it out?” Gavin asked.\n“Didn’t see any. Doesn’t mean there weren’t some,” Ironfist said.\n“I didn’t see any either,” the Blackguard they’d pulled out of the waves\nearlier said.\nKip watched the last of the Gargantua slip beneath the waves. There\nwas a lot of junk afloat in the waves, but not many men. Gavin had said\nthere were seven hundred men on board.\nOrholam have mercy.\nBecause your Prism won’t.\n“No,” Gavin said. “I’d rather be a mystery and a wild tale. We don’t\nhave it in us to sink four more. Let’s go home.”\nThey headed out two leagues to regroup, and the sea chariots came\nalongside and with difficulty in the heaving waves, they reformed the big\nskimmer. They’d lost seven Blackguards. Another had taken a ball in the\nelbow. She would be crippled. The rest had minor injuries: burns and little\ncuts and pulled muscles from maneuvering their chariots too sharply. One\nhad a musket-ball burn in a streak along his neck that was going to leave a\nscar. He looked perversely pleased about it. A breath more to the left and it"

A breath more to the left and it\nwould have cut his carotid. Cruxer was wide-eyed, blinking a lot, but\nunhurt.\n“Breaker,” Cruxer said, “did you do what I think you did back there?”\nHe looked at the Blackguards. “Am I the only one who saw him blow up\nhalf the ship?”\n“I saw,” one said. Others nodded, though not all of them.\n“We saw,” Ironfist said. “Well done, Breaker.”\n“Well done? It was fucking awesome!” Cruxer said.\nThe Blackguards laughed, and even Ironfist grinned and didn’t reprove\nCruxer for cursing.\n“Did you blow up the whole ship, too?” Cruxer asked.\n“No, that was him,” Kip said. He’d been looking at his father already.\nGavin was staring at him with a strange intensity that wasn’t wholly\napproving. Kip thought he would be proud of him, but again, there it was,\nthat sense that under everything, Gavin was holding out on Kip. Avoiding\nembracing him fully.\n“How’d you do it?” a Blackguard asked Gavin. Kip thought his name\nwas Norl.\nGavin looked displeased. For a moment, Kip thought he wasn’t going to\nanswer. But then Gavin’s eyes passed over the rest of the Blackguards.\nThey’d lost almost half their number today.\n“I made a golem of a rat, and willed it to go to the powder keg to\nexplode,” Gavin said quietly. “It’s the kind of thing a wight would think of,\nso there would have been one posted in the hall to stop any such thing. I\nfigured the explosion gave me an opening. Figured right.”\n“But making golems is forbidden,” Kip said. He knew it was stupid the\nsecond he said it. It had worked. It had probably saved their lives. It had\ndefinitely won the fight.\n“I’ll decide what’s forbidden,” Gavin said. But his voice wasn’t strident;\nit was weary. “We’ll eat here, dress the wounds we can, then head home.”\nThey ate silently, everyone aware of the places that were empty. They’d\nwon. They’d killed seven hundred men or more, at the cost of seven. By\nany measure, it wasn’t only a victory, it was a great victory. And yet the\nBlackguards were silent, eating like automatons, not hungry but disciplined\nenough to know that their bodies needed the sustenance after a hard fight.\n“You do this all the time,” Ironfist said, “don’t you?” They were sitting\non the deck, munching hard biscuits and sausage.\n“Sink ships?” Gavin asked. It sounded like he was making an effort to\nregain his levity. He was Prism; he needed to set an example. Ironfist\nrefused to take the bait. “That ship could have sunk half our navy before we\narrived in Atash, but we didn’t even know it was here. The threat’s gone, so\nto those idiot generals it will be like this never happened. We’ll tell the story\nof what we did today, and some won’t believe us. Most will believe we’re"

Most will believe we’re\nexaggerating to make ourselves look good. But even those who do believe\nus won’t know what we went through to do it. They won’t understand what\nwe faced here.”\nGavin gave a little shrug.\n“You do this all the time. You’ve been doing this since the war. You save\npeople, without them even knowing. You’ve stopped wars, you’ve sunk\npirates, you’ve put down wights, you’ve killed brigand companies single-\nhanded. All without bragging or even asking for thanks. You are He Who\nFights Before Us indeed,” Ironfist said. “Promachos.”\nGavin said nothing for a time. “Today we were promachoi together.”\n“The Spectrum granted you that title long ago, and then they took it\naway. They can take your title, my lord, but they can’t take your name. We\nBlackguards know about secret names. We know about naming a thing what\nit is. You, Lord Prism, are Promachos.”\n“Promachos,” the other Blackguards said quietly.\n“Promachos,” Ironfist said, sealing the name. “Thank you, Promachos.\nFor all you’ve done that I don’t know. For the prices you’ve paid that I can’t\nunderstand. For doing what others couldn’t, or wouldn’t. Thank you. And\nknow this, the Blackguard was created with twin purposes: to watch for and\nto watch the Prism. You’ve always distrusted us because of the latter, as\nwell you should. But I tell you this day that the Blackguard will never turn\nagainst you so long as I draw breath. It is an honor to serve you,\nPromachos, and serve we shall, blood and bone.”\n“Blood and bone,” said the Blackguards.\n“Blood and bone,” Ironfist said, sealing them to him.\nGavin couldn’t meet their eyes. “I’m not the man you think I am,” he\nsaid very quietly.\n“Are you the man I’ve served these past ten years?” Ironfist asked.\n“I am.”\n“Then perhaps, my lord, you’re not the man you think you are.”\nGavin flashed a grin and seemed abruptly himself once more. “You’ve\ngot a stubborn streak a league wide, don’t you?”\n“And two leagues deep,” Commander Ironfist said. “And don’t you\nforget it.” He stood up and turned to the Blackguards. “All right, you\nlaggards, ready up! Let’s go home. Tomorrow we do it again.”\nChapter 101\n“Your intelligence is abysmal,” Gavin told the generals around the cabin.\n“Their plan—their first plan, at least—is simple. They stop our ships before\nwe can get there. Without our troops and supplies, Ru will fall in days. You\ndidn’t come prepared for a sea battle. We’ve got a dozen warships; they\nhave fifty.”\n“You’ve invented some new means of travel,” Andross Guile said. He\nwas the reason this room was bathed in blue light. “That’s how you’re\nscouting.

He woke\nbefore dawn, and started laughing quietly. He dressed in the darkness and\nbound his hair back. A knock jostled the door in its loose hinges.\n“Commander,” Gavin said. They walked out onto the deck together\nwhere the Blackguards were checking their gear, some quietly joking, some\ndoing the morning ka, whatever it took to soothe the pre-battle nerves.\nThey’d taken down the biggest ship in the Color Prince’s navy yesterday,\nbut they were professionals; they knew they weren’t invincible. A musket\nball didn’t care if it had been fired by a man on a great ship or an idiot in a\ndory. Anyone could die, anytime.\nKip was standing with them, looking like he was wound tight enough to\nthrum.\n“I’m not going with you today,” Gavin told Ironfist. He didn’t bother\nlowering his voice. Let the Blackguards overhear. He was asking them to\nrisk their lives. “I’ve other work to do that may give us some slim chance\nfor victory. Probably not, but it’s worth trying.”\n“Can I send anyone with you?” Ironfist asked.\n“Not for this. I won’t be in danger, though. Not physical danger\nanyway.”\n“Kip?” Ironfist asked.\nGavin turned and looked at the boy, who was eavesdropping and making\na small attempt at pretending not to be. “Kip, you can’t come with me. Not\nfor this. You can make up your own mind about whether you want to go\nwith the Blackguards to sink ships.”\n“I’ll fight, sir.”\nYes, you will.\n“High Lord Prism?” a thick Blackguard asked. He was an orange/yellow\nbichrome named Little Piper. Gavin nodded for him to continue. “Will you\nlook at a design we’ve put together?”\nGavin followed them over to a pile of munitions. Someone had designed\ngreat disks, bigger than a shield, with a grenado’s trigger mechanism. Gavin\ndidn’t understand.\nLittle Piper pushed a tiny woman forward. “It’s Nerra’s design,” Little\nPiper said.\nShe wasn’t even one of the Blackguards who’d gone with them\nyesterday. She had to clear her throat twice before she was able to speak.\n“From hearing the stories, I figure the best advantage we have is that we can\nclose quickly.” She showed how the disk had teeth and red luxin on the\nbottom. “The driver brings the sea chariot right next to the ship, and the\narcher slaps this onto the hull.”\nGavin took a breath. It was brilliant in its simplicity. But the design\nwasn’t right. The disk could be hardened at the back so that most of the\nexplosive force went into the hull. And there was no way you’d want such a\nshort fuse on an explosive this powerful. And it needed shrapnel. And the\nred on the back side needed to be covered with a thin layer of yellow that\ncould be stripped off just prior to placement so the red didn’t lose its\nstickiness and so the disks could be stacked. Then the sea chariots would\nneed to be—He was getting ahead of himself."

Then the sea chariots would\nneed to be—He was getting ahead of himself.\nHe started calling out for the items he needed, and the Blackguards\ndelivered them promptly. Then Gavin made two different designs, one\nlighter and one heavier. He hefted both. The heavier one packed more\nexplosive power, but power was no good if you couldn’t get it where it was\nneeded. He handed them around.\n“The heavier,” the Blackguards agreed.\nGavin gave them instructions then and they made a line, the\nBlackguards copying the backplate and filling the reservoir half full with\nnails and musket balls and forming the hooks. Gavin made the fuses and the\nyellow and red luxin mixture to fill the reservoir. A couple of reds applied\nthe right amount of sticky red luxin to the backs, another drafter put a tiny\nlayer of lubricative orange on top of that, and Gavin covered it with a thin\nplate of yellow.\n“Hullwrecker,” Gavin said, barely pausing as he checked that the fuses\non every one were drafted correctly. Then he climbed down the rope ladder\nto the sea chariots and drafted a place for the hullwreckers to be stacked,\nand an extra support to keep whichever Blackguard placed the explosive\nfrom tumbling off the back of his own chariot. He’d replaced the sea\nchariots that had been destroyed yesterday, and even drafted extras. Today,\nfifty Blackguards would be able to head out at once.\n“Well done, Nerra,” Gavin said. She looked embarrassed. “You’ve saved\na lot of lives today.”\n“But my lord, you made it a hundred times better.”\n“So I saved lives, too,” Gavin said. “We’re a team, right?” He smiled at\nher and she blushed.\nGavin moved to get onto his own sea chariot. It was slightly modified\nfrom the earlier versions. Another experiment. He was always\nexperimenting. A young Blackguard was standing there to hold the boat\nsteady when Gavin pulled it loose of the rest. It was Gavin Greyling.\nIt felt like a sledge hit the center of Gavin’s chest. He met the eyes of the\nyoung man who’d lied to save his life. “I’ll try to be worthy of it,” Gavin\nsaid quietly.\nThe young Blackguard said nothing. His face showed nothing.\nGavin got on his sea chariot. He wanted to give more orders and advice\nto Commander Ironfist, but the man knew what he was doing. He would do\nthe maximum damage with the minimum loss of life possible. He didn’t\nneed Gavin to tell him how to do that. So Gavin left.\nHe sped across the seas, which today were a great deal calmer than they\nhad been yesterday. That fact alone would probably save more of the\nBlackguards than Nerra’s and Gavin’s invention.\nFor Gavin, it didn’t mean much except that his trip was somewhat\nsmoother and faster than it would have been.\nThe sun was past its zenith when Gavin turned the skimmer into the bay\nat Seers Island. He could see that his seawall was still in excellent order,\nand there were dozens of fishing dories out in the bay. People waved at him,"

        "text": "at Seers Island. He could see that his seawall was still in excellent order,\nand there were dozens of fishing dories out in the bay. People waved at him,\ngreeting him like a returning hero. There was a town on the shore now, the\njungle had been pushed back, and alongside temporary shacks, more\npermanent buildings were under construction. There were even farms.\nThe change was profound. Gavin wasn’t sure why he was surprised, but\nhe was. He hadn’t even been gone very long, but he’d helped establish the\nfundamentals. They’d warehoused the tens of thousands of yellow bricks\nhe’d made, and they’d obviously been putting them to good use. Fifty\nthousand people with purpose, good leadership, and all the tools they\nneeded could do a lot of work in a short time. What didn’t surprise him was\nthat the Third Eye was waiting for him on the beach.\nBeing a Seer must be terribly handy.\nWhich was why he was here. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t thought of it\nsooner. He was going into battle and he’d spent—perhaps wasted was more\naccurate—several days scouting out their positions. While he knew a Seer.\nA True Seer who didn’t couch what she saw in mystical jargon and vague\npronouncements.\nGavin beached the skimmer and jumped lightly onto the sand. The Third\nEye was dressed in a simple white dress, belted with a golden sash. She’d\nonce said that she was usually modest. It was, he’d come to see, actually\ntrue. She held a hand out, and Gavin kissed it. She smiled, delighted, and\nGavin thought there was something softer about her this time.\n“My apologies about last time,” she said.\n“My lady?”\n“If I spoiled your marriage for you, the last time you washed up on my\nbeach. I try to not ruin futures for people, but I was under some stress. I\nmake mistakes.”\nGavin looked at her radiant face and was glad she had reminded him he\nwas a married man. He was terribly in love with Karris, but this woman\ntugged at him on several layers beneath the rational. “Me, too,” he said. He\nknuckled his forehead. “Just exactly how much do you…”\n“Hold on, Corvan is right down on the pier. I think he’s been so busy he\nmay not have seen you come in.”\nShe offered her arm and he took it, escorting her through the crowds.\nThe people noticed, and they stared, and many of them bobbed their heads\nto both of them, but Gavin knew this kind of deference. It was the kind of\nrespect men on campaign give to their general. The protocol peeled back to\nits bare, necessary layers. These people were hard at work, and they had\nworked alongside the Third Eye for months. They adored and respected her,\nmaybe loved her, but they had work to do.\nAnd she had no bodyguards now. That spoke either to an unprecedented\nlevel of peace here or perhaps to her prescience. Hard to kill a Seer, one\nwould guess.\nThey walked together out to the pier, where Corvan Danavis was\nspeaking to three men who were gesturing to what appeared to be plans for\na shipyard.\nHe turned and looked shocked. He ran—literally ran—over to Gavin and"

Gavin loved him for that. He embraced his one true friend\nhard, and then released him. “Corvan, you old dog, you look well.”\nCorvan was growing out his mustache again, though it wasn’t yet long\nenough to dangle beads in. He looked ten years younger. “Do you know\nhow hard it is to negotiate with people who can see the future, Lord Prism?\nI can’t believe you did this to me. But yes, I suppose that working twenty\nhours a day agrees with me. Or perhaps it’s the company I get to keep\nduring the other four.” He grinned.\nGavin had no idea what he was talking about. Then he saw the ring on\nCorvan’s finger a moment before the man stepped over to the Third Eye and\nkissed her, picked her up, and spun her in a quick circle.\nGavin laughed. “No disaster?” he asked the Third Eye.\nShe smiled mischievously. “It was… a political necessity,” she said with\nmock gravity, teasing Corvan.\n“A duty. A burden,” Corvan said gravely.\nGavin couldn’t believe he hadn’t seen it. Of course it probably had been\na political necessity. Corvan the leader of the invaders; the Third Eye not\nquite the leader but the most respected among the island’s inhabitants. Both\nsingle, both desperately needing to bind their people together. It had been a\nduty. But sometimes fate is kind, and that which is your duty is also exactly\nwhat you were made for.\nIt also would have made things incredibly awkward if Gavin had bedded\nthe woman his best friend ended up marrying. A disaster.\n“Are you going to tell him?” the Third Eye asked.\n“Tell him?”\n“Men!” she said. “You went to the Spectrum and…”\n“You know?” Gavin asked. “Oh, of course. Orholam, that’s unnerving.\nYou haven’t told him?”\n“I hate spoiling the future. Besides, you’re the one who paid the price\nfor it. It’s only right you should get to tell him.”\n“Tell me what?” Corvan asked.\n“You’re a full satrap, High Lord Danavis,” Gavin said.\n“I’m a—What? What?” Corvan said.\n“Full satrap, full responsibilities, full privileges. You get to name your\nown Color. A small flotilla of ships carrying supplies and diplomats is\nalready on its way here.”\n“Three weeks out,” the Third Eye said, “and bringing along more than a\nfew problems, along with their lifesaving goods and medicines.”\n“You knew about this?” Corvan asked.\n“You didn’t think I’d marry some mere washed-up general, do you?” the\nThird Eye asked.\nGavin could tell it was an inside joke. Corvan smiled fondly and shook\nhis head. “A satrap? You said it would be honorary at best. That getting\nvotes would be the work of future generations.”\n“Meh.” Gavin shrugged. “They stabbed me in the back. I replied in kind.\nBy the way, you voted for war.”\n“Did I have good reason?”\n“Mmm.”\n“Color Prince?”\n“None other.”"

Do you know how hard it\nis to be married to a woman who knows everything?”\n“Almost as hard as it is to be married to a man who exaggerates,” the\nThird Eye said.\nThey were deeply in love. Smitten. At their age. Sad.\n“I hear you finally came to your senses,” Corvan said to Gavin.\n“She told you about Karris?” Gavin asked.\n“Orholam is kind,” Corvan said.\nOrholam? I thought you barely believed in him. “Corvan, I’d love to\nspend the next six months here, but I need to speak with your wife. The\nwar’s moving on, and I need to leave within two hours to make it back\nbefore I run out of light.”\nThey went to a tavern nearby and sat outside—“Absolute necessity for\ncivilization,” Corvan had said when Gavin commented sardonically—and\ntook seats in the back. Gavin filled them in on everything that had\nhappened. Everything, from destroying the blue island to throwing that girl\noff the balcony. He was glad to see that the Third Eye hadn’t known all of\nit.\nThen he asked her, “Can we save Ru?”\n“The real question is if we can save the Seven Satrapies.”\n“Can we save Ru?” he insisted.\n“One time in a thousand,” she said. “Your father would have to think\nthat he was the brilliant mind coming up with half a dozen strategies that\nyou simply aren’t in a good place to feed to him.” She touched Gavin’s\nhand, and the yellow luxin eye tattooed into her forehead glowed. She took\na deep breath, continued to hold his hand, and the glow brightened,\nbrightened until it was blinding.\nShe threw Gavin’s hand away from her like it was a serpent. She stood\nabruptly and went out. Gavin stood, bewildered, but Corvan was faster.\n“Stay,” he said. “I’ll take care of this.”\nHe was gone for five minutes. Gavin tried some of the ale that a very\nnervous woman handed him. It was surprisingly good. If he hadn’t known\nthat the Third Eye was the real thing, he would have been suspicious. The\nskeptic in him was stirring even now. This seemed perfectly orchestrated to\nparalyze or terrorize him.\nThe Third Eye came back in unsteadily. She avoided looking Gavin in\nthe eye as she sat across from him.\n“You want to know the disposition of forces at Ru. I can tell you that.”\n“Are you trying to scare the hell out of me?” Gavin asked.\n“Gavin, listen to your mother.”\n“Now that, that is the kind of thing I expect from a charlatan,” Gavin\nsaid. “I thought you weren’t big on parlor tricks.”\n“You remember Koios White Oak?”\n“I remember seeing a wall fall on him sixteen years ago.”\n“He’s the Color Prince.”\n“I saw a wall fall on him. A burning wall.”\n“He’s the Color Prince.”\n“I saw a wall—”\n“I’m not the moron in this conversation, Guile. Please don’t speak to me\nas if I am. How many times have you escaped certain death?

You think your\nenemies might never have the same good fortune?”\nGavin’s mouth went suddenly dry. “What—but I—does Karris know\nthis?” Koios. That night when Karris had wept about her dead brothers,\nshe’d said his name. She’d been trying to work up the nerve to tell him. But\neven telling him would have felt like betraying her brother.\n“Have you told Karris all your secrets?”\nFair question. He’d told her most of them, but no, not all.\n“You’re wasting time,” the Third Eye said. She was suddenly hard and\ncold, like it was all she could do to get herself through this. “You need to go\nback to the Chromeria and get Karris.”\n“She’s injured.”\n“Stop interrupting. She’ll be well enough to fight. The men your father\nsent to beat her were very careful, very professional. They were told to\ninflict pain, not injury.”\n“It was my father? That piece of—”\n“That part isn’t important right now. If you don’t get her… just get her.”\n“Tell me,” Gavin demanded.\n“Telling you changes things,” she said tensely. Her golden eye was\nglowing.\n“Tell me!”\n“If you don’t get her, you’ll die. A musket ball tomorrow or a green\nwight the next day. If you do… the old gods waken, Gavin.”\n“The old gods waken?! That’s all you tell me?”\n“You’ve lost green. You know what happens. This battle to save Ru, it’s\nnoble, but it’s the wrong battle. You already know that.”\n“There’s a green bane, like the blue?”\n“You can’t stop them all, Gavin. It’s impossible.”\n“Where is it?” he insisted.\n“If I tell you, you’ll be in the wrong place.”\n“Tell me.”\n“If I tell you, you’ll die, you damned fool,” she said, temper flaring.\n“Ask the right questions!”\n“Am I going to—” He balled his fists. “What do I need to do?”\n“Mercy isn’t weakness, and love carries a heavy price.”\n“I think I’m more the kind of a man who—”\n“If you don’t figure out exactly what kind of man you are, there’s no\nhope for you at all.”\n“If you were going for ominous, that was pretty good.”\n“I do omens for a living. You want better? Then go now and bed your\nwife. Bruised and broken as you are, it may be your last chance.”\n“Now that, that was ominous.” Gavin stood with a bravado he didn’t\nfeel. He’d learned things, but not the way he’d wanted to.\n“Gavin,” the Third Eye said, “you came to ask where their forces are.\nThey’ve taken the fort on Ruic Head, though they haven’t put up their own\nflag. They hope to sink your fleet at the neck. And Ru has several hundred\ntraitors already in the city, including the mercenaries the Atashians hired to\nprotect them.

Walked together down to the beach.\nThe Third Eye followed them. People had gathered, realizing who Gavin\nwas. They watched from a distance. They knelt. It was like they didn’t\nknow how to tell Gavin what he meant to them. It was just as well, because\nhe didn’t know how to take it. He waved to them, nodded.\n“You said before that you were sometimes wrong, right?” he asked\nCorvan’s beautiful wife.\n“Sometimes,” she said sadly.\nOne in a thousand. He’d faced worse.\n“Dazen,” Corvan said quietly. He swallowed, looking out to sea, looking\nat nothing. “My lord, she tells me if I go with you, I can only make it worse.\nOtherwise, I’d… My lord, it’s been an honor.”\nAnd then, as Gavin got onto the skimmer and Corvan pushed the boat\nout into the gentle surf, The Third Eye said, “Orholam guide you back, Lord\nPrism.”\nHe was sure that she didn’t mean back to the island.\nChapter 102\n“I’m going to kill him, someday. But he’s good at what he does. I’ll give\nhim that,” Zymun said, rising from their bed in the predawn darkness. Liv\nwas already up and dressed, almost finished fighting her hair into some\norder. “I’ll let him do the work of uniting the satrapies, and then take it from\nhim. Unless he threatens to botch it, of course.”\n“What are you going to do? Once you become king, I mean.” She slid\nthe hairpins in place, adjusted the bit that was falling in front.\n“Emperor,” Zymun said, correcting her. “And whatever do you mean?\nWhat will I do? You’re not very smart, are you?”\nNot smart enough to avoid you in the first place, clearly. She froze. His\ncharm had been slipping more and more frequently. He was a lizard beneath\nit. There was something wrong with him. Something thin, an essential\nshallowness. How had she not noticed before? When he touched her now,\nher flesh grew cold. Her body had known. She’d told herself that she was\nextricating herself carefully, but she wasn’t: she was afraid. Afraid to be a\nwoman alone in an armed camp. Such fear didn’t befit a drafter. Such fear\ndidn’t befit a woman. He wanted to treat her like she was nothing? Hatred"

Hatred\ncoiled in her breast.\nIt took all of her self-control, but she turned and looked at him with a\nmask of cool condescension. “Zymun, Zymun, Zymun. Emperor? Please.\nThere is no trace of greatness in you.”\nShe slipped out of the tent deftly. She was shaking. What about your big\nplan to make him tire of you? To escape his clutches and make him think it\nwas his idea?\nAll in pieces now. Shit.\nKnowing the smart thing to do and having the makeup to do it were two\ndifferent things. To hell with him.\nLiv went directly to the Color Prince’s tent. He was gone. She found\nhim instead on the outskirts of the camp, greeting new drafters who’d\nabandoned Ru or other Atashian towns. At least half of them were on their\nlast year or two of life. Cowards, Liv thought.\nBut armies are composed of those who join for bad reasons as well as\ngood, and the prince despised no one who helped him. Liv approached him,\nbowed deeply, and said, “Magnificence, may I have a private word with\nyou?”\nThe prince measured her, then excused himself.\n“Zymun is planning to betray you,” she said without preamble.\n“Thank you. Will you teach this class of recruits for me?”\n“What?” she asked. “ ‘Thank you?’ That’s all?”\nHe looked at her sharply.\n“My apologies, my prince. I didn’t mean to raise my voice.”\nHe favored her with an indulgent smile. “When did you find this out?”\n“I’d suspected he had an… overlarge opinion of himself, but he didn’t\nsay anything treasonous until this morning.”\n“And you came straight to me.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nA retainer emerged from the ranks and started coming toward the prince.\nHe lifted a hand, telling the man to wait.\n“You knew,” Liv said.\n“I knew.”\n“So… Did you send me to spy on him?”\n“You tell me,” he said. Another servant looked ready to come forward,\nand again he motioned to the woman not to interrupt. Running an army\nmeant making decisions from dawn until dusk and beyond.\n“You weren’t testing him. You were testing me,” Liv said.\n“Oh?”\n“You knew he’d betray you; you didn’t know if I would. So I passed.\nWas Zymun in on this?” If he had been, that would mean that he was still\nfavored by the Color Prince, and the way Liv had left him wasn’t simply\nover her loyalty to the prince. She might have just made a powerful enemy,\nwithout at the same time making a more powerful friend.\n“Do you know what happens to an egg, when you keep it warm?” the\nprince asked.\n“It hatches?” Liv said.\n“And when you make it hot?”\n“I’m not sure I—”\n“It cooks.” He smiled, indulgent, magnanimous. “Everything has a\nproper time and season.

This is why so\nmany of the Chromeria’s wights go mad and become dangerous, not\nbecause wights are innately so, but because their drafters get to the end of\ntheir human span and then panic. Panicked people do shoddy work. If\ninstead they worked deliberately, over a course of years, to prepare\nthemselves for the transition, their odds of success increase dramatically. If\nthey had people to teach them what to do, just imagine what we might\naccomplish.”\n“That’s—that’s… wise. And that’s what you’re doing with Zymun?”\n“Zymun is incredibly gifted, and very, very dangerous. There is no\nhuman warmth in him. Only a fool would trust a man like that, but by using\nhim? I’ve found that I can trust you. Now, did he know you were coming\nhere?”\n“I’m—I’m afraid he might. I’ve made a terrible enemy of him, my lord.”\n“Forgive me for this, but raise your voice now and swear that Zymun’s a\ntraitor, that you wouldn’t lie to me, and so forth.” The prince’s face twisted.\n“Do it. Now.”\n“My lord! I swear it to you! Zymun is a traitor—I would never lie to\nyou! You have to believe me!” Liv threw herself at the Color Prince’s\nknees.\nHe backhanded her across the cheek hard enough it rattled her teeth, and\nshe fell to the ground, weeping.\nTwo guards lifted Liv and pulled her away, just around a tent, out of\nsight, but still close enough that she could hear a little of what was said. She\nheard Zymun speaking, his voice oily slick as usual, totally unafraid. His\nback must have been toward her, because she couldn’t make out his voice.\n“Zymun,” the Color Prince said, “I’m giving you a small force, drafters\nand soldiers, whatever composition you want, but only twenty men, and\nmake sure you bring along gunners in that number. I want you to cross the\nneck at midnight, climb the cliffs, and take Ruic Head. There may or may\nnot be ropes waiting for you. We have spies, but they’re criminals and prone\nto hysteria. Not trustworthy. Regardless, take Ruic Head and keep flying the\nAtashian flag. The Chromeria’s fleet is two days out. Let the scout ships\nthrough unaccosted, only open up when the main fleet first starts through\nthe neck. I expect you to sink at least a dozen ships. At least. Oh, and take\nno greens with you. Take blues. The bane will be disorienting until Atirat is\ncome.”\nZymun said something.\n“No. Absolutely not. I have need of her.”\nSomething else. Liv cursed to herself for not being able to hear, but she\ncouldn’t without exposing herself.\n“Zymun,” the Color Prince said, raising his voice as if the young man\nwas farther away. “I trusted you with a vital mission once and you failed.\nYou lost a magic worth more than ten of you. It was my mistake to trust you\nwith that, so I didn’t punish you for it. I had hoped to abort this war before"

Understood?”\nChapter 103\nCommander Ironfist had Kip and Cruxer join him on the central skimmer.\nInstead of heading directly for Ruic Bay as Gavin had, Commander Ironfist\nhad them work their way up the Blood Forest coast.\nThough they had only been skimming for two hours, Kip was feeling\nantsy. He didn’t like being trapped on a boat. He tried to enjoy the salt spray\nand the speed and the small towns they passed. The sea today was much\ncalmer, and the sky was blindingly blue. The sea itself changed color with\nevery bay and shallow.\nThey came upon the scout ship so fast they barely had time to split the\nsea chariots off. They rounded a point, and there it was, approaching the\npoint from the opposite side, flying its broken-chain flag. Commander\nIronfist was shouting orders and two of the sea chariots darted off in front of\nthe rest of them.\nThe cocca was a small ship. Twenty-five paces long, with a crew of\nperhaps twenty and lateen sails, and six medium guns per side, balanced on\nthe gunwales the old way instead of outfitted with gunports. It didn’t get a\nsingle shot off. A single sailor was manning the swivel gun on the front,\ntrying to load it, when the two sea chariots passed on either side. One set its\nhullwrecker near the prow, the other on the opposite side near the stern.\nThen they broke away.\nKip could hear men shouting, and for what seemed forever, he thought\nthat the explosives had failed.\nThen they went off at the same moment. Muffled thumps blew all the\nway through the cocca’s hull and out the opposite side as well. There was\nfire, but it was quenched quickly as the ship went down.\nWith four wide holes in the hull, it didn’t take long. At Commander\nIronfist’s piercing whistle, the sea chariots regrouped and sealed their\nindividual boats back into place. By the time they were finished, the cocca\nwas underwater. A dozen men and women were paddling in the water or\nclinging to debris.\n“Commander, should we take captives for interrogation?” Watch\nCaptain Beryl asked.\nIronfist looked at the people in the water and judged how far they were\nfrom shore. It wasn’t far. Leaving them wouldn’t be a death sentence, but\nKip knew that they didn’t have the space to take captives and still continue\nto sink ships. “Our mission’s elsewhere,” the commander said. “By the time\nthey could bring word back to their generals, our battles will be finished, I\nthink.”\nThey left and hadn’t gone half an hour farther up the coast before a\nputrid smell rolled over the skimmer. It was death.\n“There’s a village a league or two from here,” one of the Blackguards"

It was death.\n“There’s a village a league or two from here,” one of the Blackguards\nsaid. “Weedling, it’s called. I grew up just a few bays down.”\nThe skimmer cruised slowly into Weedling Bay and Kip was relieved to\nsee that the village wasn’t burned to the ground. But there were hundreds of\ngray shapes crowded onto the beach so thickly that there was hardly any\nsand visible. Perhaps a dozen locals were walking across the backs of the\nshapes, carrying machetes and buckets.\n“Are those beached whales?” Cruxer asked.\n“Orholam have mercy,” someone said.\nThe wind brought a blast of putrefying flesh and blood to the skimmer\nand Kip almost gagged. He felt funny. Not just sick or disgusted, but\ntrapped. He wanted to jump into the waves and swim. He wasn’t even sure\nwhere. It was a crazed, caged animal feeling.\n“Commander,” one of the Blackguards said, “I don’t feel so good.”\n“It’s just dead fish,” Ironfist said. “Kalif and Presser, draft us some\noars.”\nThey drafted oars and oar locks and the Blackguards rowed the ship in.\nWhen they got within forty paces, the villagers finally noticed them. Some\nfled outright, while the others merely watched them with hooded eyes.\nA tall older man with some kind of long-bladed spear that he had been\nusing to cut into the thick whaleskin stood on a half-butchered whale with\none hand on his hip. “Well, the sea she brings us all sorts of insanity, don’t\nshe?” he said.\n“Are you the conn here?” Commander Ironfist asked.\n“Such as we have,” the man said.\n“I’m Commander Ironfist of the Chromeria Blackguard.”\n“Ironfist? Aye, we’ve heard that name here. Curious boat you have. I’m\nConn Mossbeard.”\nHe didn’t, so far as Kip could tell, actually have moss in his beard, but it\nwas dyed a pale lichen green.\n“What happened here?” Ironfist asked.\n“Something’s been building for a couple weeks, though it’s not near so\nstrong today,” the conn said. “Livestock acting like there were coyotes in\nthe yard, but none were, you know what I mean? Plowhorses and oxen\nshying from their harnesses. Horses spooked. Pigs attacking like all the\nsudden they thought they were javelinas. We had people injured by the\nscore, by beasts they’d known their whole lives. We’re farmers and\nfishermen here, we knew something wasn’t right. Still don’t know what,\nthough. They say great powers clash, small folk suffer, I don’t know.” He\nspat.\nIronfist didn’t interrupt, gestured for the restive Blackguards not to\nspeak either. If the stench of the decaying whales hadn’t been so\noverpowering, Kip would have jumped off the boat.\nWhat’s gotten into me?\n“Whales beached yesterday. Heard of it before.

Handy placement if they’re going to do\nit, I thought at first. We could get enough meat and oil to last us years,\nbut…” He pulled his tunic up and Kip saw that he had a bandage around his\nside. It was bloody. “I started giving orders, like I done a thousand times.\nPeople here know you got to work together for big jobs like this. But they\nattacked me instead. Men and women I’ve known my whole life. Attacked\nme and run off. The animals are gone, too. It’s like a madness came. ’Cept\nit didn’t hit us all. The steadiest men and women, we’re all still here.

Don’t know what to do but butcher what we can and hope this\nall blows over like a squall.”\n“Did any of the people act… um, oddly before they went?” a\nBlackguard named Pots asked. He turned to Commander Ironfist. “Your\npardon, Commander.”\n“We’re good people here,” the conn said. “Decent. Devout.”\n“People do strange things when they’re not in their right mind. Things\nthat aren’t truly their fault,” Pots said.\nThe conn grimaced. Spat again. “Seemed like folk lost all sense of\ndec… of decoration, if you take my meaning. I saw… I saw.” He spat\nagain. Avoided eye contact. “Folks were rutting like animals. Folks walking\nabout nekked. Folks grunting and howling and barking. Barking. You heard\npeople called barking mad? I thought it was jus’ something people say. I\nsaw men I’ve known forty years barking at each other. Scared me half to\ndeath. Like they was made animals in all but body.”\n“Whatever it is, it’s driving the animals mad, too,” Commander Ironfist\nsaid.\n“You feel it?” Pots asked.\nMost of the Blackguards mumbled agreement.\n“I think we better leave,” Commander Ironfist said.\n“Kip, you feel it?” Pots asked.\n“Absolutely,” Kip said.\n“Nerra, you?” Pots asked.\n“No.”\n“Commander?” Pots asked.\n“Maybe a little.”\n“Wil, you?” Pots asked.\nWil swallowed. “I feel half mad, to tell you the truth.”\n“It’s the greens,” Pots said to Commander Ironfist. “It’s something\nwrong in green. Lust, loss of self-control, rebellion against authority. The\nColor Prince has poisoned green.”\n“Atirat,” someone mumbled ominously.\n“Whatever it is, it’s not only affecting drafters; it’s hitting munds and\neven animals,” Pots said.\n“Mossbeard!” Commander Ironfist called out. “We’re doing what we"

I caught my\nwife with another man, and when she saw me, she just laughed and kept on.\nI looked into her eyes and couldn’t tell if it was madness plain and simple\nor if the madness was letting her do what she’d always wanted.”\nIronfist said nothing.\n“Go play at your wars. Go visit your plagues on someone else. It’s\nalways the little man as pays the piper. I killed my wife, sir, the woman who\nstayed with me through drought and blight and fire and the death of four\ndaughters for twenty-four years. There’s no restoration here.”\nThey rowed away and Mossbeard went right back to slaughtering the\nwhale he stood on without giving them another look.\n“Greens,” Commander Ironfist said without looking at any of them,\n“you tell me if it gets too bad. If you feel like you’re going to turn on us,\ntell us. I’m not going to lose anyone today, through madness or death.\nUnderstood?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kip said with the rest of them.\nThey went all the way up the Atashian coast that day, almost as far as\nRuic Head, and they sank half a dozen ships. On many of them, the sailors\nwere in disarray, unwilling or unable to follow orders and act as coherent\nunits. It made them easy targets, and they sank them without any trouble.\nIt was, frankly, frightening how easy it was. With the combination of\ntheir speed and the explosive power of the hullwreckers and the fact that the\nships they were preying on were distracted and had never seen anything like\nthe sea chariots—much less prepared for them—they sank ship after ship.\nBut their feeling of invincibility was broken when Pots took a ball in the\nshoulder. They bound him up, and made it all the way to Ruic Head, where\na fort towered on top of the red cliffs there, bristling with artillery that could\nreach far out into the narrow neck of the Ruic Bay. They approached only\nclose enough to look at the fort’s flags—it was still flying the Atashian\ncolors.\nCommander Ironfist turned them back toward the fleet, and they made it\nback an hour before dusk, which was a good thing, because it took them\nanother hour of consulting the sextant and compass and skimming and\nguessing and consulting the sextant and compass again to find the fleet,\nwhich was making good progress toward Ruic Head. Three days out now.\nKip and the other greens were relieved to get away from the Atashian coast,\nthough, and he could feel the madness receding as they got farther away.\nThey talked, and they couldn’t be certain, because measuring feelings of\ngrowing dread wasn’t exactly as simple as sliding beads, but they thought\nthat whatever was causing the madness had to be coming from the Color\nPrince’s camp itself.

Or from one of his ships nearby. No one seemed to\nwant to talk about the prospect of fighting a battle when men were as likely\nto jump off their ships as they were to obey an order. It seemed an invitation\nto chaos and slaughter.\nGavin didn’t come back that night. Kip wondered if he’d died\nsomewhere, far away and alone.\nThe next morning, Commander Ironfist headed out again, but this time\nhe wouldn’t let anyone who could draft green come with him. Kip was left\nalone. He waved to Cruxer and grimaced at his own ill fortune. When he\nturned to go inside, he found himself staring at Grinwoody.\n“Young master,” the slave said. “Luxlord Guile finds himself with a\nspare hour. He wishes to play Nine Kings with you. Attend me, please.”\nIt wasn’t, of course, a request.\n“And if I won’t come?” Kip asked.\nGrinwoody smiled his unpleasant smile. “Long swim home.”\nChapter 104\nGavin barely made it to the Chromeria before nightfall, the skimmer going\nslower and slower as his eyes strained for light. At least the waters were still\nenough that he was able to land directly on the back side of Little Jasper,\nwhere there was a tiny dock, rather than having to draft an entire dory by\nstarlight and row in to Big Jasper and walk.\nStepping onto the creaking wood, he disintegrated the yellow skimmer.\nHe rubbed his arms and shoulders, hoping they didn’t cramp. The muscles\nwere trembling and weak from his journey even though the last two hours\nhad been slow going. He was starting to feel a sick foreboding that yellow\nwas getting harder to draft. He hoped it was simply the gathering night, and\nnot that he would wake tomorrow unable to draft yellow at all. If so, he was\ngoing to have a hard time getting back to the fleet before the battle was\nover.\nHe tried to smile over the rising terror. At least he was going to spend\ntonight in Karris’s arms. To the evernight with everything else. What had\nthe Third Eye said? “Bruised and broken as you are, it might be your only\nchance”? Gavin was sore and fatigued, but he was neither bruised nor\nbroken, so either she had meant the “you” to mean Karris or she was simply\nwrong. Regardless, he wasn’t going to solve the mysteries of prophecy and\nhe didn’t care to. He just wanted to see his wife. His wife. How odd that\nphrase seemed. And yet how he’d missed her. He felt it keenly now, now\nthat she was so close and his mind wasn’t crowded with fighting, plotting,\ndoing, doing, doing. Some part of him thought that she was going to be\nsnatched away if he didn’t hurry. He opened the lock on the stout oak door.\nThe hinges were rusty. Pulling the door open made him aware again of how\ntired his arms were.

Gavin touched his\nhand to one of the ingenious sub-red switches, and from the heat of his\nhand, it triggered a reaction that opened panels of yellow down the length\nof the tunnel. Sometimes it was the simple, elegant things that could be\ndone with magic that impressed him far more than his own brute-force\nbehemoths.\nFive minutes down the tunnel deposited him at an iron gate with a\ndifferent lock. He opened that and took a narrow staircase up into the front\nyard of the Chromeria. By the time he reached the lifts, two Blackguards\nhad fallen in step beside him. He grinned at them. “Gentlemen.”\n“Lord Prism,” they said.\nHe took the lift up, and then the second lift to his own floor, walked past\nthe Blackguards, who didn’t look surprised in the least to see him—how did\nthey do that, anyway? He walked to his own door, then, thinking he heard\nsomething, he looked down the hall. The White’s door was closing, very\nslowly.\nShe must be asleep. Her guards are being careful not to wake her.\nBut still Gavin hesitated. You should go check that out. For a second he\nwas aware of himself, poised between going in to a beautiful woman and\ngoing to an old crone. What kind of an idiot even thinks that’s a choice?\nCursing himself for a fool, he left his door and strode quickly down the\nhall. It was rude to enter anyone’s room filled with luxin; it was treated like\ncoming in with a pistol leveled at your host’s head, and if Gavin could get\naway with many things, that wasn’t one of them. Not with the White. So he\ndrew in superviolet. What they couldn’t see couldn’t be rude, could it?\nHe opened her door as stealthily as it had just been shut. A crack, and\nthen more. Bodies wearing Blackguard garb lay on the floor and a figure\nwas treading slowly toward the White’s bed, clad all in black.\nThe light streaming in from the well-lit hallway betrayed Gavin. The\nfigure spun, drawing a pistol from his belt in a smooth, fast motion.\nGavin blasted the door open with his shoulder and dove into the White’s\nroom, shouting, “Assassin!”\nThe pistol roared. Its ball shattered wood and whined, ricocheting off the\nstone behind it.\nA gray ball nearly two feet across shot out of the man’s hands, catching\nGavin’s first Blackguard as he was jumping into the room and drawing his\npistol. It knocked him horizontal and back into the other Blackguard.\nThe assassin had dropped his first pistol and drew another, turning to kill\nthe White, who was awake and scrambling to get off her bed.\nFrom the floor, Gavin shot the tiniest spotlight beam of superviolet out,\nand as the assassin turned, Gavin’s superviolet played over the man’s hand.\nThen Gavin shot the rest of his superviolet.\nSuperviolet is delicate. All the superviolet Gavin held probably weighed\nonly as much as a hairpin, and it wasn’t strong, but even a hairpin flung at\ngreat speed can have some effect.

The superviolet burned the air and\nslammed into the back of the assassin’s hand, cracking bones and flinging\nthe pistol out of the man’s grip.\nGray-white light flooded the chamber from a dozen sources. Gavin\npopped up off the floor, instinctively drawing in light to hurl blue spears at\nthe assassin.\nHe was all the way up and throwing his body forward to ready itself for\nthe massive recoil of the magic he was about to throw when he realized he\nhadn’t drafted anything.\nThe assassin’s counter of another ball of gray light caught Gavin full in\nthe chest. It launched him backward and he slammed into a wall, the impact\ndriving his breath from him.\nGreen, his brain told him helpfully. He’s not drafting gray, that’s green. I\njust can’t see it anymore.\nThe assassin pulled out another pistol and leveled it at Gavin. From this\nrange, with Gavin still trying to suck in his first breath, the man couldn’t\nmiss.\nA sunburst of white-gray light lit the man, and Gavin saw the White\nstanding in her bedrobe, a cloud of tiny glowing particles floating in front of\nher, like motes of dust. Her hands snapped forward, and so did the entire\ncloud. The sound of the tiny flechettes hitting the assassin was like the\nsound of Blackguards at archery practice, when an entire volley studded the\ntargets.\nThe assassin froze, and a moment later, tiny droplets of blood formed on\nhis skin, everywhere. His back had been turned to the White, and the tiny\nglassine flechettes had gone all the way through him. The assassin blinked\nbloody eyes, confused, knowing only that something was terribly wrong,\nand then he collapsed on the floor and began convulsing.\nThe world didn’t stop. Even as the man was falling, Blackguards were\nbursting into the room, whistles were shrilling. A sword descended on the\nassassin’s convulsing wrist, separating his still-loaded gun and gun hand\nfrom his body.\nThe sudden press of bodies was almost a relief. The Blackguards had\ntheir priorities. Subdue the threat, secure the area, check the health of the\nguarded, check the health of the downed guards, notify the chain of\ncommand, and so forth. Gavin let it roll over him. He’d taken a good shot,\nand he’d be lucky if it turned out he hadn’t cracked a rib, but he was alive,\nand so was the White.\nOddly enough, it seemed that both of the Blackguards who’d been\nguarding Orea Pullawr were alive, too. One was still unconscious, and the\nother could only remember being grabbed from behind and having a foul-\nsmelling rag pressed over his face. Apparently whoever had sent the\nassassin was trying to make some point about the vulnerability of the entire\nChromeria by making the assassination as clean as possible. The guns and\nmagic had only come out when the assassination was threatened with\nfailure.\nThey found the White’s balcony door cracked open, and climbing ropes\nhanging past it. The ropes were hanging from the roof. The assassin must\nhave tied the rope above and, finding the White’s balcony deadbolted,\ndecided to go to the roof and enter through the door. It was a bold plan that\nwould allow the assassin to escape after the murder by opening the balcony"

It was a bold plan that\nwould allow the assassin to escape after the murder by opening the balcony\ndoor from the inside and sliding down the rope without alerting anyone. It\nwould have given the assassin valuable minutes to escape alive. This had\nbeen no suicide mission. The Blackguard immediately began going down\nthe tower to check every room that had a window or balcony on the north\nside, looking for accomplices.\nGavin was shaken. A few months ago, he would have killed that assassin\nby himself. This time, his color-blindness had almost gotten both him and\nthe White killed. He looked at the gray lights burning everywhere in the\nroom. They weren’t gray; they were blue and green. The White had been a\nblue/green bichrome, so she’d obviously put in colored lux torches so that if\nsomething like this happened, she could immediately have light available to\ndraft in a heartbeat. With a lesser assassin, the sudden flood of light itself\nmight have bought her a few seconds. Not this one. But regardless, between\nGavin and the Blackguards interrupting, it had worked.\nHe wondered if the White was well. She hadn’t drafted in years, and she\nwasn’t in particularly good health to begin with.\nGavin stood with the Blackguards’ help just in time for Karris to come\nin the door and crash into him. She grabbed him so fiercely, it almost\nknocked him off his feet. Then he recovered his senses and hugged her\nback.\n“I heard there was an assassination attempt and you were involved and\n—and you scared me half to death, Gavin Guile!”\n“You changed your hair,” he said stupidly. She’d bleached to blonde\nfrom its previous dark Tyrean hue. He liked it blonde.\n“You like it blonde,” she said.\n“He saved my life,” the White said. She walked over. Walked, instead of\nbeing wheeled over. Gavin couldn’t see the halo in her gray eyes, but he\ncould see that her eyes were no longer washed out, desaturated. Now they\nlooked like a drafter’s eyes again. And there was fine red color in her\ncheeks. She looked stronger, younger, and yet her halos were still intact.\nMercifully. “They say he spoke before he died. He said, ‘Light cannot be\nchained.’ Do you know what that means, Gavin?”\n“It means we have a problem,” Gavin said quietly.\n“It means the Order of the Broken Eye exists and is choosing to reveal\nitself. And that means we have a problem. The Order has risen. They mean\nwar. Now go, I know you’ve other things in mind for tonight, and I’ll be up\nuntil all hours telling my story and giving orders and taking questions. I’ll\nhandle all this. You…” She waved him toward Karris. “You handle all that.”\nAnd then she winked.\n“Thank you,” Gavin said. He might have blushed a little.\n“No, Gavin, thank you,” the White said. “Thank you.”\nOf course, it wasn’t as easy as simply going back to his room. The room\nhad to be searched—and Gavin held his breath when they searched the\ncloset—and then guards had to be posted. Marissia sat on her little slave’s\nstool by the door, looking like she was trying to be invisible to Karris, but"

Marissia sat on her little slave’s\nstool by the door, looking like she was trying to be invisible to Karris, but\ndidn’t want to leave without being dismissed in case Gavin needed\nanything. Gavin absolutely refused to have a Blackguard in the room with\nhim. “Karris is here. She’s a Blackguard.” While he argued, he gave\nMarissia a glance and a tiny wave. She looked grateful, and slipped out the\ndoor silently.\n“Mmm, we’re assuming she might be… preoccupied, Lord Prism,”\nWatch Captain Blademan said dryly. What, did Ironfist offer a class in that\nattitude? “Someone attacked the White by climbing up to her balcony;\nwe’re not leaving you in danger.”\nIn the end, they posted two Blackguards out on the balcony and pulled a\ncurtain. The men were both given heavy wool cloaks and hats and told not\nto come inside until Gavin rapped on the glass—if he rapped on the glass.\nOther guards were posted outside the definitely-not-soundproof doors.\nBeing worth killing was a real pain in the ass.\n“How are you?” Karris asked as she closed the door.\nHe barely heard her. He was taking the chance to look at her, really look\nat her for the first time. It seemed he’d been gone forever. He hadn’t noticed\nearlier, but she still moved gingerly. The blackness and swelling had faded,\nthough not completely. Karris healed fast. “Your eyes are healing well,\nhow’s the rest of you?” he asked.\n“My eyes? I look like a raccoon!” She scrunched her face up like a\nrodent and made little chirping sounds that Gavin supposed were supposed\nto be a raccoon.\n“Do that again,” he said.\nShe laughed, embarrassed, and he laughed with her.\n“You’re the prettiest damn raccoon I ever saw.”\n“Oh, Gavin Goldentongue,” she teased. “With that kind of eloquence,\nyou’re going to charm my—Oh, look at that.” By some feminine magic,\nwithout apparently using her hands, her undergarments slid down her legs.\nShe kicked them aside with a hmm, and grinned a self-satisfied grin at him.\nShe looked positively devilish.\nGavin’s mouth went dry. She opened her robe and let it slide down her\nshoulders and then pool on the floor and she walked toward him. Her\nchemise was a silk confection, clinging to her lean curves, barely coming\ndown to her hips.\n“Are you well enough for me to have my way with you, my lord?” she\nasked.\n“A bit bruised and broken,” he said. He suddenly smiled. Damn Seers.\n“And a lot pungent. I’ve crossed the seas entire today. And I see that—” No,\nno don’t mention Marissia. “I see that there’s a bath drawn. I could—”\n“You come back and find me half-naked and you want to take a bath?”\nshe asked. But she was teasing.\nInstead of matching wit for wit, Gavin looked straight into her eyes and\nsaid, “I want this to be perfect for you.”\n“I don’t want perfection. I want you, Dazen Guile.”\nThere was a right answer to that. Gavin cupped her cheek with a hand"

Gavin cupped her cheek with a hand\nand pulled her lips to his. She was all that was warm and soft and safe in all\nthe world. He pulled her into his arms and she pulled into him, glorying in\nthe muscles of his shoulders and arms, his sheer size in comparison to hers.\nHe obliged her by enfolding her completely in his arms. Then she squeaked.\n“Ow, ribs, ribs,” she said, breaking their kiss. Bruises. Right.\nShe used the interruption to grab his shirt and pull it over his head. He\ngasped. “Shoulder, shoulder,” he grunted. She freed the shirt more gently,\nand they grinned at each other.\n“Whew,” she said. “You are stinky.”\n“Hey, I—”\n“Teasing!” she said.\n“Oh shut up and get back here,” he said.\nShe grabbed his belt, tugging it loose, but he grabbed her and kissed her\nagain. He slid his hands over the silk, gently, back to waist to hips to ass,\nand then up to cup her ass beneath the nightgown. He made a sound low in\nhis throat and suddenly picked her up and carried her to their bed.\nKarris held him as they made love. Held him with her lean muscular\nlegs, pulling him into her, into her. Held him with her sex, writhing against\nhim. Held him with her arms, glorying in his muscles and in him, digging\nher fingers into his back and subtly guiding him to what pleased her most.\nAnd she held him with her eyes, the intensity of her hunger startling him,\nthe intensity of her desire for him inflaming him, and the intensity of the\nconnection almost too much for him to bear. But when he looked away, she\ngrabbed his chin, pulled him back, kissed him, and then nipped his lip in\npunishment. She held him, and held him tight as he climaxed, and held him\nin place afterward, running her fingers through his hair, playing with his ear.\nHe’d never felt so known and accepted in all his life.\nWhen the capacity for reason came back to him, he propped himself up\non an elbow and caressed her body. Her skin was aglow in the golden\nlamplight and she made no effort to cover herself, instead enjoying his gaze.\nThere were a million ways he wanted to praise her beauty, but none of his\nwords seemed adequate to the task. How could words tell her how she\nfascinated him, inflamed him, awed him? He remembered an old Blood\nForest wedding vow. “With my body, I thee worship,” he said. He leaned\nover and kissed her neck, her breasts, her lips.\nThey made love again wordlessly, and he gave his all to please her,\ninterpreting every sigh and stretch and curled toe to guide him. And he took\nhis reward. Repeatedly. She only shook her head and laughed when she saw\nhis familiar pleased-with-himself grin. They lost themselves in each other\nfor hours, talking, holding each other, crying, talking, making love again,\nfinally bathing together when they were sure they could make love no more,\nand then just holding each other, skin to skin, her back to his stomach,"

Then forget it,” Gavin said.\nHer elbow into his ribs would have been a gentle nudge if he hadn’t\nbeen flung into a wall last night.\n“Ouch!” he said.\n“Serves you right,” she said.\n“So what’s the first rule of running away?” Gavin asked. The dawn was\nred, magnificent, and he had a beautiful woman in his arms. This seemed to\nbe the best place in the whole world.\n“You can’t bring logic or practicality into running away. Everyone\nknows that.”\n“Ah. So we can go naked?”\n“You’re impossible.”\n“True, but on the other hand, you can’t say you didn’t know what you\nwere getting yourself into.”\n“No. That’s true.” She said nothing for a while, and Gavin thought she\nmight have drifted off to sleep. What was the saying about a red sky in the\nmorning? Something about storms coming? Thanks, Nature, I appreciate\nsome omens with breakfast.\n“I…” She sounded tentative. “I know that you’ve been trying, with Kip I\nmean. I heard you went to his testing.”\n“While I should have been with you. Protecting you.”\n“Protecting me? Don’t make me hurt you.” She rolled over, braced her\nhead on an elbow. “You were exactly where you should have been.”\nHe said nothing.\n“So… how’s it going?” she asked.\n“He’s a good boy. Smart. My plan is working perfectly, so far. He has no\nidea how talented he is. I put him with the best young fighters in the world,\nand he’s hanging in there. By his fingernails, but hanging in.”\n“He’s not that good of a fighter, is he?” Karris asked. “Without previous\ntraining?”\n“No, he’s not. But he’s made the right friends, and he’s got the respect of\nthe right people. They’ve made it possible for him to stay in—which is as\nmuch a success in my eyes as if he’d been the best fighter there. The point\nof him being in the Blackguard wasn’t to teach him to fight; it was\nmisdirection; it was so he would measure himself against the best people\nrather than against the best whisperers and the best drafters.”\n“You’re brilliant, and your plans always work, my lord husband, but that\nwasn’t what I was asking about and you know it. Misdirection indeed.”\nHe was glad she could catch him, glad to be known that much by this\namazing woman—but not glad to be caught. His face fell. How’s it going?\n“He’s a good boy…”\nShe waited for the but. He could tell she knew it was coming."

Even your father used to charm\n—”\n“I killed Kip’s father, Karris. The boy is so desperate not to be an orphan\nhe’s latched on to me. So desperate to please he’ll do anything I ask. What\nwill he do if he ever finds out the truth? If he came after me, tried to kill me,\nwho could call him the betrayer? I’m raising him and making him\nformidable, and the more he loves me, the more he’ll hate me when he finds\nout I’ve deceived him from the beginning. Through no fault of his own, he’s\na viper, Karris. And the tighter I hold him to me, the more likely he is to\nbite me.”\nKarris studied him quietly. “All true. All beside the point. You kept a\nsecret for sixteen years from me. Keeping it from a boy who hasn’t known\nyou and will never know your brother? Child’s play. What’s really going\non?”\n“Look, this soul-searching is deeply meaningful and everything, but\nwhat I did before, I’d do again. Karris, if you were falling off a cliff, and I\ncould save only you or me, I’d save you. No question. Because even though\nI know that I can do things for the world that you can’t, I don’t care. I knew\nI should kill you, that you were the person most likely to destroy me. I\nknew that this… this was incredibly unlikely. But I love you, so I didn’t\ncare. When I look at Kip? I’d make the rational choice. And I feel bad about\nthat, but I feel bad when I send soldiers into war. I like Kip; I wouldn’t want\nto lose him. I want to get to know him more. But I don’t love Kip, and\nthere’s nothing I can do about that.”\nSomeone pounded on the door. “Lord Prism.”\n“One minute!” Gavin called.\nKarris had an odd intensity in her eyes. “My lord, I was never helplessly\nin love with you—well, maybe when we were children I was. But in the\nyears since, my feelings for you have come and gone. But my admiration\nfor the man I saw you to be never changed. You twisted me in knots\nbecause the good man I felt you were—my Dazen—and the man I thought I\nknew you to be—Gavin—were so different. But I saw that you were the\nkind of man who was worthy of my love. I knew the man I would marry\nwould be good and strong and gentle and honorable and smart and stubborn\nenough to handle me and… Hold on, I know there must be some other\nvirtue,” she teased.\n“Charming? Never forget charming.”\n“Sometimes I could do with less of that,” she said. She got serious. “I\nchose you.”\n“Ah, you couldn’t resist me.”\n“Yes, yes I could,” she said flatly. “I chose you.”"

He was reminded of her\naffinity for the blue virtues, despite being a red and a green, for thinking\nthings through, for making the columns add up.\n“I love you body, soul, and breath. Is that unromantic? Love is not a\nwhim. Love is not a flower that fades with a few fleeting years. Love is a\nchoice wedded to action, my husband, and I chose you, and I will choose\nyou every day for the rest of my life.”\nThere was another knock on the door. “Lord Prism! The Spectrum is\nmeeting right now, and they wish to speak with you. Lord Prism?”\n“Dazen,” Karris said suddenly, “no matter what happens, I love you.”\nSomething about her voice was raw, as if she were right on the edge.\nGavin had a sudden intuition. “Karris, what are you talking about?\nWhat’s going on?”\n“I just—”\n“What did the Third Eye tell you?”\nSilence. He’d hit it; he could tell.\nKarris moved to get up, but Gavin grabbed her hand. “Karris, please…”\nShe looked back at him, then looked away. “I’ll tell you, but I’m not\ntelling you anything else no matter what you say, understood?”\n“Understood,” Gavin said. He grimaced, but he knew Karris when she\ngot stubborn.\n“She hedged, of course, said she doesn’t see everything perfectly…”\n“The Third Eye, with less than helpful help? Yes, I’m familiar with—”\n“She told me when you’re going to die,” Karris said in a rush. Then she\nstood and threw a robe around her shoulders. “Now get up, lazybones,\nwe’ve got a long day ahead of us.” She smiled, but it didn’t touch her eyes.\nChapter 105\n“I lured you here under false pretenses,” Andross Guile said as Kip came\ninto his dark cabin. The Red had of course taken the captain’s cabin, and\nthough he’d put curtains on the windows, it wasn’t nearly as pitch dark as\nhis own apartments back at the Chromeria. Kip had forgotten to soak up\nsuperviolet light before coming in, so he was at the mercy of the dim light\nand his ears. But Luxlord Guile seemed to be in unusually good spirits, and\nthat put Kip on his guard. “I don’t want to play a game with you. I want to\napologize,” Andross said.\nKip remembered the glasses he carried, and put the sub-red on. It didn’t\nhelp that much. “For what?” he asked. He could think of a dozen things for\nwhich the old monster should apologize, but he couldn’t imagine the man\napologizing for any of them.\n“For trying to have you killed.”\n“I’m sorry, what?” Kip asked.\n“Believe me, I thought you did owe me an apology for refusing to die.\nBut this is me apologizing to you.”\n“You’re going to have to do better than that,” Kip said.\nOutlined against the thin light coming beneath one curtain and glowing\nin sub-red, Kip saw Andross Guile tense, his fists ball. “Remember what"

If you’d cracked under the\npressure and jumped to your death, it would have been a very brief scandal,\nbrought up idly, revived some six months later when I had new evidence\n‘found’ that the woman who’d claimed to be your mother confessed to\nlying, having taken money from a rival family to smear Gavin. Then it\nwould have been forgotten. You would have just been another attack on a\nfamily that has endured a thousand, an anecdote of an attempted smear on a\ngreat house.”\n“Mistress Helel? You sent that fat woman who tried to throw me out of\nthe tower?” Kip asked. Andross kept talking, but Kip was still struggling to\ncome to grips with what he’d said first.\n“Was that her name? Oh, and while I’m clearing the air… I paid those\nidiots in your Blackguard training class to block you. No harm done, right?\nRegardless, I’m sorry.”\n“You’re sorry?” Kip asked, incredulous. Like that was enough?\nKip saw an eyebrow rise above one of the big lenses, as if the man was\nwondering how stupid this fat boy was. Andross Guile raised his index\nfinger. “I want you to know, Kip, I haven’t apologized to anyone in twenty\nyears.”\n“I’m honored,” Kip said.\nThe old man chose to ignore the sarcasm. “Well, if that’s behind us,\nperhaps you would like to play some Nine Kings?”\n“What? What? No! You tried to kill me! You can’t—you can’t just try to\nkill people because they’re inconvenient.”\nAndross Guile’s head tilted like a dog’s, trying to understand this odd,\nodd boy. “Reality begs to differ.”\nBut Kip felt the world going gray. “This is all a screen. A distraction.\nYou killed Lucia,” he said. Kip saw her again, stepping into the line of fire.\nHe saw her face bloody, neck torn open by a musket ball, pumping blood,\nblood, blood. Kip shivered.\n“Who?” Andross asked.\n“The girl in my Blackguard class who took the bullet you meant for\nme!”\n“What are you talking about?” Andross asked.\nKip’s rising rage wavered. “Someone tried to shoot me, during training.\nThey killed her instead.”\nThe old man shook his head, like Kip was a moron. “Why would I go to\nthe trouble and expense to block you from the Blackguard if I intended to\nkill you before you get could get in? I meant you to be a failure, not a\ncorpse.”\n“Maybe you were making doubly sure you stopped me.”\n“It’s nice that you have such a high opinion of yourself, but use that\npuny brain of yours.

You think I’d\nleave my seal where it could be seen like that? You think I would fail twice\nthe same way? No, boy, believe me, if I wanted you dead, you would be.”\nAs insulting as it was, Kip thought it was probably true. In fact, he\nthought it was more likely true because Andross Guile had been insulting\nhim when he said it. “So why’d you try to block me from the Blackguard?”\n“To foil my son. He has plans for you, and he was defying me. He\nneeded to be punished, and reminded of certain… verities.”\n“So why tell me now? What do you want?” Kip had no doubt that the\nloathsome old man did have a plan. He wanted something from Kip. “I\ncould go tell…”\n“Tell whom? Please.” Andross Guile waved it away, and Kip realized\nthat the man could confess with impunity. He was right. No one was going\nto take Kip’s word, especially not with an utter lack of evidence. “Kip, I\nhave to tell you something, and I don’t expect you’ll believe me, but maybe\nyou will someday. I owe you my life, boy. Oh, not in any melodramatic\nsense, of course. My wife—your grandmother—left me and committed\nsuicide. Albeit the suicide of the Freeing. I loved her. I lived for her. And\nshe rejected me, preferring to die rather than spend another day in my\ncompany. Have you ever faced a rejection so profound?”\nKip thought of his mother, choosing to blast her brain on haze or any\nother intoxicant she could get until she was able to forget him, committing a\nslower, less noble suicide day by day. But Andross Guile wasn’t looking for\ncommiseration.\n“I wanted to die. I considered following her and laying open my veins in\nthe bath. And do you know what saved me?”\n“Me?” Kip asked dubiously.\n“Ha! Don’t flatter yourself. Nine Kings. Distractions saved me. Even\nthis old heart takes time to muddle through grief, but those distractions kept\nme alive long enough to do it. My petty tortures of you kept my mind\noccupied, gave me something to look forward to. Would Kip fail here?\nWhat could I come up with to take away from him when he lost our game\ntomorrow? How else could I test the boy, in ways that strained you but gave\nyou some chance for victory?”\n“You did not let me win. Don’t even pretend you—”\n“Bah! You think your wits are a match for mine? Well, I’ll let you\nwonder. Now shut your mouth, I’m trying to thank you.”\nKip fell into sullen silence, feeling abruptly like a child again. Robbed\nof his rage, he felt powerless in Andross’s august presence.\nAndross sighed. “Well, there. Thank you. That is all.”\n“That’s it?” Kip asked.\nThe man sank down lower in his chair.

Perhaps I am to blame for some\nshred of that. But you, Kip, you have proved you are a Guile. I will hinder\nyou no more.” He turned away and gestured Kip to go.\nKip walked to the door slowly, bewildered.\n“Perhaps,” the lonely old man said in the darkness, not turning, “perhaps\nsomeday we could play that last game you owe me.”\nKip left the cabin and closed the door under Grinwoody’s disapproving\neyes.\nChapter 106\nGavin knocked on the door out to the balcony and let two very cold\nBlackguards back in. They didn’t make eye contact, but they did grin at the\nfloor. “Well done, sir,” one said beneath his breath. “Woman’s got some\nlungs,” the other said to the first, clearly intending to be overheard.\nThe first winked, not at all stealthily, at Karris, who covered her face and\nlaughed ruefully. They were like her brothers. Gavin wasn’t going to get in\nthe middle of that. That relationship would change now that she was his\nwife. But Gavin didn’t want to kill her joy. Let things change in their proper\nseason. He rang the slaves’ bell.\nMarissia and another slave, a skinny old woman with Ruthgari skin\ntanned so leathery she looked Atashian came in and began laying out their\nclothing at Karris’s direction.\n“I didn’t even realize you’d moved all your things in,” Gavin said.\n“I wanted to wait for you; it seemed presumptuous to invade without\nbeing asked, but my kin in the Blackguard kicked me out.”\nGavin laughed. He noticed as Marissia dressed him that Karris was\nwatching him closely, watching how he looked at Marissia. Hiding it well,\nbut jealous. For her part, Marissia was a cipher. Professional, calm, more\nrumpled this morning than usual, but that was because she’d probably slept\nin the hallway, rather than in her closet-sized room off Gavin’s quarters,\nwhere she slept when she didn’t share Gavin’s bed.\nIn his years as Prism, Gavin had grown used to having very little\nprivacy, at least not from the Blackguard or from Marissia, but what had\nseemed amusing when the Blackguards had teased him about overhearing\nhim and Karris making love all night, sometimes loudly, seemed less\nhumorous when he saw Marissia’s carefully blank face and deeply\nshadowed eyes."

He stopped only to\nsay, “Twenty minutes, meet me at the back door, packed and ready for war.”\nKarris nodded grimly. It was almost daylight, and they couldn’t afford to\nburn too much of that.\nFacing the Spectrum was almost a relief. Gavin thought it was definitely\nbetter than being stuck between two jealous women who both had good\ncause to be angry at him. It was a fight that Marissia couldn’t have, of\ncourse, because it was a fight she would lose spectacularly, but that didn’t\nmean she couldn’t feel, or that she was wrong to. Orholam have mercy.\nFour Blackguards accompanied him. It was understandable, given the\nassassination attempt last night, but it still made Gavin feel like a prisoner.\n“You have me for ten minutes,” Gavin said.\n“Pardon?” Delara Orange asked.\n“There’s going to be a battle for Ru in two days, and I need to be there.”\n“And how are you going to do that? We thought you were with the\nfleet,” the Blue said.\nSo Gavin explained, concisely. He could travel across the sea in a day.\nThere was already a map on the table with the disposition of forces that\nthey had guessed. Gavin moved and added and subtracted forces until it was\naccurate.\n“How do you know all this?” Delara asked.\n“I’m the Prism,” Gavin said. “Five minutes.”\n“You can’t treat us like this. We aren’t slaves to take your orders. What\nwill you do if we don’t let you go?” Klytos Blue asked.\nTurning cold eyes on the little man, Gavin said, “I’ll kill you and piss on\nyour corpse.” He meant it.\nKlytos Blue’s mouth dropped open. His wasn’t the only one.\n“I came here as a courtesy,” Gavin said. “But thousands of people are\ngoing to die if I don’t leave, so tell me, is there anything wrong—anything\nat all—in valuing thousands of warriors over one spineless worm?”\nKlytos spluttered, “Are you… are you calling me a worm?”\n“That’s the kindest thing I have to call you right now.”\nKlytos opened his mouth, and Gavin pointed a hand at him and\nshrouded it in flame. “Try me,” he said. “ ’Cause I really need to piss.”\nThe White intervened. “Gavin, Lord Prism, what do you intend to do?”\nSo he told them. Delara Orange looked distraught that he was already\nconsidering Ru lost, but he told her if things went well, they might be able\nto save the city after all. He didn’t believe it, but it placated her. And then\nhe left.\nNo one tried to stop him.\nKarris was at the back dock. Together, with four more Blackguards, they\ncrossed the seas. The ships of the fleet had anchored less than five leagues\nfrom Ruic Bay."

The ships of the fleet had anchored less than five leagues\nfrom Ruic Bay.\nThe battle would begin tomorrow.\nChapter 107\nIt was still night when Kip was summoned to the deck. He dressed quickly,\npulling on his trainee’s garb. He strapped the dagger sheath to his calf, and\nchecked that the slit he’d cut in his trouser leg allowed him to grab it. It was\nmore obvious than he would have liked, but people probably wouldn’t be\nlooking at his leg today. He put the lenses pouch on his right hip. He ran a\nhand through his unruly hair and stumbled up to the deck.\nThe Wanderer was under way, though only the foresails and mizzen\nwere raised. The sailors worked silently, apparently aiming to get the ship\ninto a different position before dawn. The Blackguards were gathered on\ndeck around Commander Ironfist.\n“How well did you study those black cards, Kip?” Commander Ironfist\nasked.\n“Sir?” Commander Ironfist had seen the new cards, but how did he\nknow about the black cards?\n“Not many secrets on Little Jasper, Kip.”\n“Uh, pretty well, sir.”\n“You see any of the apotheosis cards?”\n“I have no idea what that means, sir.”\n“Maybe they’re just a rumor, then. Never seen any of them myself.”\nThe commander moved to address everyone, but Kip interjected, “Sir?\nUm, I know that after we were inducted, there wasn’t really time to file\npapers and everything. I wanted to—I’m technically, or was technically, I\nguess? Teia’s owner, anyway.”\n“Are you worried about your payout? Now?”\n“No, sir! I mean, if I die, sir, I want Teia to get it all. I didn’t even really\nrealize until we were fighting the Gargantua that if I died she wouldn’t get\nanything. She needs it more than the Guiles do, sir.” Kip was suddenly\nembarrassed, and he wasn’t completely sure why.\nThe commander looked at Kip for a long moment, then nodded. It would\nbe taken care of. He turned to the Blackguards. “All right, form up.” He\nbarely raised his voice, but everyone moved smoothly into rows. They put\nthe trainees like Kip up front. Commander Ironfist picked up a bowl where\na fistful of shiny black berries had been crushed. “Trainees,” he said. “I\nexpect some of you have full pupil control, but if you don’t, dab a finger in\nthis and touch the corner of each eye. One dab will serve for both eyes. It’s\nbelladonna. It’ll dilate your pupils for you. It should wear off by full\nsunrise, but you’ll be extremely sensitive to light until then. More isn’t\nbetter. This stuff’ll make you go blind.” He handed the bowl around, and\nalmost everyone but Kip dabbed a finger in. Kip drew out his sub-red\nspectacles instead.\nCruxer goggled at him. “You have Night Eyes?” he asked. “Can I see\nthem?”\nKip handed over his sub-red spectacles. Night Eyes? Cruxer put them"

He cursed aloud. It was only the second time Kip had ever heard the\nboy swear. “What?” Kip said.\n“Orholam’s beard, Kip, there’s only like ten pairs of these in the world.\nSome people say Lucidonius himself made every pair. This is amazing. I\ncan see everything!”\nThe rest of the trainees drifted out of the lines and even quite a few full\nBlackguards were craning their necks. Commander Ironfist snapped his\nfingers and glowered at Kip, and Cruxer, who very quickly took them off\nand handed them back to Kip, resuming his at-attention posture. “Sorry,\nCommander,” he said quietly.\nKip put his glasses on.\n“I’m afraid that’s not the only wonder we’re going to see today,”\nCommander Ironfist said. “I can’t leave any of you greens behind, but I’d\nlike to. Truth is, you might be more of a danger to your fellows back here.”\nHe let that sink in, and Kip didn’t like it. Nor did any of the other greens\nhe could see. For that matter, the Blackguards who weren’t greens didn’t\nseem particularly enamored of the thought either.\n“You’ve all felt it. Even I can feel it now, and I’m no green. Our\nscouting tells us that there’s a bane somewhere, probably in the crook of the\ncoast. Those of you who haven’t heard of that may have heard it called a\nlightbane. It’s a temple to the false gods, loci damnata, in this case Atirat. A\nbane corrupts light itself, and drafters more strongly than most. The good\nnews is that if the power is wild like this, it means there’s no false god in\nplace yet. Questions? I know you’ve got ’em, so make it quick.”\nOne of the full Blackguards, a broad-shouldered, lean warrior with wild\nhair, coal skin, and intense blue eyes named Tempus said, “The luxiats says\nLucidonius made it so there wouldn’t be bane anymore. It shouldn’t be\npossible.”\nIronfist nodded to him. “We have no idea what the heretics have done to\nmake it possible. Today we may find out, Orholam help us.”\n“Effects on drafting?” an Ilytian who barely came up to Kip’s shoulder\nasked.\n“Green should be much easier to draft large amounts of, but may be\nmuch harder to control. It may be different closer in. In addition, none of us\nhave dealt with color wights on the scale we will today. There are stories\nabout the bane perfecting wights. Don’t know if it’s true, but if I’ve heard it,\nso will have a lot of green wights. You’re going to see things you’ve never\nseen, things that you think are impossible. These wights have had time to\nwork together, to learn from each other. No wights have done that for\nhundreds of years. Remember, whatever shape they’re trying to take,"

Remember, whatever shape they’re trying to take,\nthey’re still men underneath, and you’re doing them a favor by putting them\ndown. Orholam have mercy on them, because we can’t. Greens, if you find\nyourselves losing control or believing that you don’t need to obey my\norders, I won’t hold it against you. Of your own volition and in your own\nminds, decide right now that you want to put an end to this menace. If you\ncome up with your own way to fight this, you’re welcome to it. Sink their\nships, kill their wights, save our men. The Blackguard has made every one\nof you elite warriors, so fight as you know best. Follow my orders as long\nas you can bear it. I don’t question your loyalty, but I know I can’t trust you\nto obey orders. I’m putting you all in second squad under Watch Captain\nTempus. First squad, take the center. Second squad, you’re with them. Third\nsquad, the Prism says that the fort on Ruic Head is held by the rebels. The\ngenerals don’t believe him. The fort’s guns can reach halfway across the\nneck. If it is held by rebels, we need to silence those guns before they can\nwipe out our fleet. If he’s wrong, we make sure that the rebels don’t take it,\nand then come out and assist. If the bane is in range of the big guns, we’ll\ndo our best to kill it, sink it, whatever. Everyone got it? Go.”\nThe third squad with Teia and Commander Ironfist headed out. Kip\nnodded to her as she went, wondering if he’d see either of them again. As\nthey did, the Prism came skimming in on one of the sea chariots with\nKarris. They saluted the departing squad. The Prism’s face looked haggard,\nand there were dark circles under his eyes. He brought his chariot into place\nwith the skimmer and handed it off to a Blackguard to seal it to the greater\nship.\nGavin started immediately: “Squad one, squad two, our mission is to\ndestroy the bane. We do that, sanity returns. Destroying the bane will\nweaken our greens, but it will weaken their wights much more. Its loss will\nincapacitate any green wight for a few minutes at least. We can expect the\ntemple to be swarming with greens. In the center, there will likely be twelve\ngreens standing inside luxin pillars. If we can get past them without waking\nthem, that would be best. Unlikely, though. And though we can’t see it from\nhere, there may be a central spire. We climb the spire, we kill Atirat’s avatar\n—hopefully before he or she wakes—and it all disappears. So if you can’t\nswim, find something that floats quick.”\nThe Blackguards were looking at him oddly.\n“What?” Gavin asked.\n“Lord Prism, how do you know this?” Tempus asked.\n“Because I killed the blue bane by myself a couple months ago.”\nTempus rubbed his temples. Other Blackguards shuffled their feet. Kip"

Kip\nheard a few mutter “Promachos” as if it were a quiet curse. At first Kip\nthought it was because they didn’t believe Gavin, then he realized it was\nbecause they did.\nMy father’s a giant, a god among men.\n“Promachos,” Tempus asked. He hesitated. “If we’re too late, and the\navatar wakes…”\nGavin pursed his lips. “Whoever it is, they won’t know much more\nabout it than we do. It will certainly be a drafter of incredible power,\nseemingly able to draft infinite amounts from the smallest amount of light.\nIt may be able to control the green drafters in its vicinity. Your bodies, at\nleast. It can control the green luxin that’s become part of your body over\nyour years of drafting. Maybe your minds, eventually. But if we get to it\ntoday, it shouldn’t have time to learn the full extent of its power. Best if we\nkill it before it wakes and keep this all theoretical, eh?” Gavin quirked a\nsmile. “Light’s rising,” he said. “Let’s take it to them. We cut through the\nlines first and find the temple. Greens won’t be at strength until full light.”\nThey took to three skimmers. Gavin took the center of one with Karris\nand Kip with him, Watch Captain Tempus took the center of a skimmer\ndominated by green drafters, and Watch Captain Blademan took the last.\nIronfist hadn’t let any of the greens be drivers, even in Tempus’s group.\nThey’d be archers on each of the sea chariots when they split.\nWith the light barely gray in the east, the skimmers set out in a wide\nformation. The light was so weak that not all of the drafters could help\npropel the skimmer, even with their eyes dilated, so their progress wasn’t as\nfast as usual. Gavin’s skimmer, even with fifteen people on it, was easily the\nfastest, and he didn’t wait for the others.\nThey cut across the sedate waves, barely making any noise. Up ahead,\nKip saw their ships looming larger. It wasn’t yet dawn, but to Kip the\ndisposition of the ships seemed odd. They knew that the Color Prince’s\narmy had seized the battery across from Ruic Head, of course. Between\nthose cannons and the cannons in the fort on Ruic Head, the Atashians’ field\nof fire covered almost the entire entrance to Ruic Bay. Of course, the Color\nPrince held the fort on Ruic Head now—and he didn’t know that Gavin\nknew that. But if he had seized the fort, it would seem better strategy to\nbeef up the middle of the neck here, to force the Chromeria’s ships to head\nalong either coast, where it would be easier to shoot them.\nThey hadn’t done that. Instead, the center of the prince’s line was weak.\nThere were a number of ships, but they were caravels and coccas and naos,\nsmall vessels. Quicker, more agile, sure, but not with many guns.

Was the\nprince simply trying to bait the trap and not reveal that he did hold the fort\non the north side?\nThat had to be it. Once they saw the Chromeria’s forces commit to going\nalong the northern shore, the prince’s line would be reinforced and crush\nthem against the fort’s guns.\nWhatever corrupting power the green had, it didn’t seem to be exerting\nit yet. Kip supposed it must have something to do with there being no\nambient light. After dawn, it would surely become more and more intense.\nThey passed the first ships and heard alarum bells ringing only after they\npassed. A luxin flare shot out over the sea, illuminating them. There was a\nrattle of muskets and a couple swivel guns, but at the speed they were\ntraveling, none came close. Kip saw one of the superviolets on the skimmer\ntracking the flare. It took her several seconds with the bouncing of the\nskimmer over the waves, but finally the beam of superviolet she was\nshooting out caught the flare and encapsulated it, extinguished it, plunging\nthem back into darkness. The other two skimmers came through in\ndarkness, unseen.\nAs the light rose in the east, they traveled faster, and they passed more\nships, too quickly for them to get off credible shots. As the sun peered over\nthe horizon, Kip caught his first glimpse of Ru’s Great Pyramid, rising red\nand green in the morning.\nBut there was no sign of any rising green spire. The skimmers spread\nout as they went deep into the bay. The distant sounds of the battle starting\nrolled over the leagues behind them. And still no temple, no spire, and Kip\nwas only beginning to feel the restless energies of green pulling at him.\nThey came fully in sight of the city. Kip could see the towns outside the\nwalls still smoking, having been burned down the day before. The base of\nthe great stepped pyramid was only blocks from the waterfront. Though\nconstructed of the local reddish stone, the pyramid was whitewashed aside\nfrom the great red stripes painted in zigzags up each of its four sides, and\ncovered with greenery. At the top rested a giant curved mirror. Clearly, the\nmakers of the Chromeria’s Thousand Stars had stolen the idea from the\nGreat Pyramid. Behind the city, the Red Cliffs loomed a thousand feet over\nthe city. Smoke rose from whatever towns had once rested up there, and Kip\nsaw a single trebuchet bombarding the city from on high.\nIt must have been difficult to get the catapults up to the top of the cliffs,\nor to find materials to build them up there, but there was no way to stop\nthem once they made it there. And if the Blood Robes brought one up,\nsurely they would now bring more. There was no defense against that.\nThe trebuchet loosed another shot. It looked to Kip like it was nearly\nrandom. It was such a long distance that it might take them days to breach\nthe walls—but days of raining death into a city were days of terror for those\ninside.\nThe walls of the city still looked whole, though the entire waterfront was"

They pulled in\na broad arc, seeing that the army had entirely encircled the city and seized\nall the towns around it.\n“Greens, anyone got a feel yet?” Gavin asked. The sun had fully cleared\nthe horizon now. Musket shots were crackling from the shore, aiming at\nthem, but they were three hundred paces out.\n“If anything, it feels weaker here than out—” one of the men started.\n“Shit!” Gavin said before he could even finish. “Of course! ‘Most of the\ntimes,’ she tells me! Most of the times.” He turned the skimmer sharply\nback out to sea. Karris made hand signals to the other skimmer.\n“What is it? What is it?” Kip asked, and he could tell he was speaking\nfor some of the others, too.\n“The bane’s huge. If it’s nearby, but it isn’t here, where is it?” Karris\nsaid.\nKip still didn’t understand. Up ahead, he saw the guns of the fort on\nRuic Head open up, pillars of black smoke blowing out with every shot. It\nhad to be home to the biggest guns Kip had ever seen. Below, the\nChromeria’s fleet had taken a tentative course. They weren’t hugging the\nnorth coast closest to the fort, but neither had they gone straight for the\nmiddle.\nNow, as the guns opened up, cratering the waters around their fleet, the\nChromeria’s ships were reacting quickly, tacking to the middle. But instead\nof the Color Prince shoring up the middle to keep the Chromeria’s ships in\nrange of his guns, they were melting away instead. One Chromeria ship was\nafire and had lost its mainmast, but the rest were fleeing.\nSure of salvation, the Chromeria’s ships were heading straight for the\ngap, amazed at their own escape.\nThe fort’s big guns set half a dozen of the smaller ships aflame, though.\nMen were screaming, and Kip saw shapes moving through the water faster\nthan they should have been able to, jumping out and hurling luxin. Birds—\nironbeaks, no doubt—crowded the air.\nBut when Kip took his eyes away from the individual stories unfolding\nbefore his eyes—the men dying, the fires started, the amazing shots hit, the\nluxin bent into shapes he’d never seen—he saw that the Color Prince wasn’t\neven trying to hold the center. No ships were rushing to shore up the\ndefenses there.\nAnd Kip was feeling wild. What the hell?\nIt was getting harder to think strategically. Kip wanted to kill, he wanted\nto run, he wanted to move—and though he was flying at greater speeds than\nmost men know in their whole lives, it wasn’t enough. He wanted to move\nlike this as his own master, under only his own control.\nWhat had Karris said? “If it isn’t here”?\nIt is here.\n“The bane float,” Gavin said. “Most of the times!”"

Gavin had turned the skimmer toward the middle of\nthe strait. There, lost among the fires coming from each shore, were a dozen\nrowboats—boats filled with the Color Prince’s drafters and wights.\n“Split!” Gavin said. “Kill them before they can finish!”\nFinish what?\nThe skimmer split into its component parts—six sea chariots and the\ncentral skimmer, leaving Kip with Gavin and Karris, who were each\nmanning one of the reeds. Kip took off his sub-red spectacles with one hand\nand tucked them into their case, but the skipping of the skimmer was so\njarring that instead of drawing another pair to ready himself for the fight, he\nhad to use both hands to grip the railing.\nThe snap of muskets firing sounded in Kip’s ears and a torrent of every\ncolor of luxin flew between the sea chariots and rowboats. Half the drafters\nin the boats seemed to be there solely to defend the others, and Kip saw\nmassive shields of green luxin springing up around every one of them, far\nmore powerful than the drafters should have been able to make. Fire and\nluxin and even musket balls were absorbed easily. The other men on the\nboats were heaving at great green chains that disappeared into the depths\nbelow them, and even as Kip watched, something seemed to give. First one\ncrewman fell down and the tight chains suddenly went slack, and then\nanother and another.\nThe sea chariots and the skimmer closed on all of them.\nSomething enormous moved beneath the waves and Kip saw a tangled,\ncoiled mass rising toward the surface with terrible speed.\nAnd then the entire sea exploded into the sky.\nChapter 108\nTeia’s skimmer hissed across the water in the darkness. Her right hand was\nclamped to the railing in a death grip as the boat skipped from wave to\nwave at great speed. She felt blind for several minutes, too tense to relax\nher eyes into sub-red and paryl. Terror was sufficient to dilate the pupils,\nbut apparently mere crippling anxiety did not suffice. She looked around\nand saw that not a few of the others also had white-knuckled grips on the\nrail, but among the more dour expressions, not a few of the Blackguards\nwere grinning eagerly, some at the amazing speed and the wind whipping\ntheir ears, others no doubt at the prospect of putting their training to the test.\nMost of the Blackguard runts had been kept back, just as Trainer Fisk had\npromised, but at the last moment, Commander Ironfist had decided that\nTeia’s gifts might serve a purpose.\nNow she had to prove herself, and she wasn’t ready. She knew she\nwasn’t ready.\nGradually, she relaxed marginally.

She’d do something today to disgrace\nherself, and the Blackguard would change its mind and reject her. She\nunclenched her fist and let the vial go.\nThere wasn’t much to see except misty waves and the rock looming ever\nhigher in front of them. People were going to die here today, and Teia\ncouldn’t help but have the premonition that she was going to be one of\nthem.\nThey were approaching Ruic Head directly. The Head was five hundred\nfeet tall, with only narrow goat tracks up the bare face of the cliffs on this\nside. They would be guarded, and a single alarm would be enough to doom\nthe entire attack.\nBut Commander Ironfist seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He\nturned them north and approached the coast, then came back south, mere\nfeet from the rocks. Then he brought them up against a rock. He squatted\nand the others came close. “There’s a dock two hundred paces from here\naround the corner. It’ll be guarded. I’m going to bring us to a spot forty\npaces from it. Tlatig, Tugertent, Buskin, you’re the best archers. String your\nbows.” The two Archers and the man did so immediately as the commander\ncontinued, “You’ll get up on the rock and take your shot from there. Teia,\ncan you spot if the guards are wearing mail beneath their cloaks from forty\npaces?”\nShe nodded. “I could, but I don’t have enough paryl right now to…”\n“Over there.” He pointed.\nHe continued giving orders to the others while a Blackguard showed\nTeia a tiny white mag torch. The woman beckoned Teia to sit cross-legged\non the deck of the rocking skimmer. She draped several cloaks over her\nhead.\n“It’ll burn for ten seconds. If you need a second torch to fill up, let me\nknow,” the woman said.\nIt felt odd to put on dark spectacles and then use a mag torch, but Teia\nknew even from her brief time with Magister Martaens that she couldn’t\nlook directly at a mag torch without risking blindness, so she huddled down\nand snapped the tiny torch. It burned brilliantly, white-hot. She filled herself\nwith paryl easily in a few seconds and had to wait while the tiny torch\nburned itself out. She knew such a thing must have cost a small fortune, and\nit seemed a waste. If she relaxed, even at night she could fill herself with\nparyl within a few minutes.\nThen she realized that fifteen lives depended on that little torch, and that\ntime was of the essence. Maybe not a waste after all.\nWhen the tiny torch sputtered out, Teia came out. Having stared into the\nwhite-hot magnesium flame even indirectly, she was, she realized,\ncompletely night-blind now. She thought of forcing her eyes to relax, but\nmaybe overcoming her body’s defenses wasn’t always best.

The\nwaves, even on this calm morning, were such that the Blackguards had\ntrouble keeping the boat in place. With the waves and the height of the good\ngrips, Teia had to be helped up onto the top of the rock. The three archers\nwere taller, even Buskin, who’d gained his nickname for wearing heeled\nshoes to compensate for his diminutive stature. They all came up nimbly.\nTeia crawled forward to the top of the rock—and with the barest tread of\nleather to warn her, found herself staring at a boot less than a hand’s breadth\naway as a man stepped out from behind the rock outcropping.

He drew a knife and drove it into the guard’s neck\nat the base of the skull. The twitching stopped immediately. Buskin turned\nexpressionless eyes on Teia and motioned for her to get to work. Still\nshocked, she returned to the spot and peered south. There were three\nsoldiers standing on the dock, chatting with each other and enjoying the\nrising dawn. All three had bows, but all were unstrung, as if they expected\nto have warning.\nThey’re dead and they don’t even know it yet.\nThe dock was barely fifteen paces long, and had two small rowboats tied\nto it, bobbing in the waves and creaking as they rubbed and bumped against\nthe wood of the dock.\nShooting out a beam of paryl light, Teia could see that all three men\nwere wearing full mail and helmets. She wasn’t going to be much help. “All\nof them have full—”\nA bowstring thrummed above her. She rolled over and saw Tlatig\ndrawing another arrow smoothly from her quiver. She’d been looking\nfarther to the right. Teia had been so focused on the dock, she hadn’t even\nnoticed that there was a little shack for the guards. And two men there were\ndown—in full sight of the men on the docks.\nTlatig was already turning toward the docks.\n“Three,” Tugertent said. It wasn’t a count of the guards; it was a\ncountdown, and moments later, three arrows jumped into the air as Teia\nwatched.\nThe guard farthest left took an arrow through the side of his neck. It\nmust have cloven his spine, because he fell instantly, limply, straight into\nthe water. A second guard grabbed the side of his neck, which was spurting\nblood like a fountain.

A dim whine sounded as the third man turned, his\nhelmet deflecting the arrow intended for his neck. It spun his helmet in front\nof his eyes and he slapped at it, already moving. The archers all loosed\nanother volley. Teia couldn’t see if they’d hit the man or not, but when he\ndove into the water, his dive looked purposeful.\n“Go!” Buskin hissed. The three archers ran down the trail, arrows fitted\nto their bows.\nTeia drew her knife and followed them, not knowing what else to do.\nShe turned the beam of paryl onto the little hut. The paryl light cut through\nthe leather flaps over the windows. She saw a man in mail moving toward\nthe door.\n“Hut!” she whispered. “Front door!”\nTlatig was already headed toward the hut, and as the front door opened,\nTeia saw her loose an arrow from five paces into the darkness beyond. In\nthe paryl light—the leather window flap dimming her vision only as much\nas silken gauze would—she saw him fall to the floor.\nBuskin and Tugertent were out on the dock, searching the water. It was\nstill dark enough that the sun didn’t help them at all. Teia ran out to join\nthem. The archers were moving up and down the length of the dock,\npeering into the depths as well as they could.\nTeia’s paryl beam cut through the water, scattering, but much better than\nvisible-spectrum light.\n“There!” She pointed. “Swimming!” The man was swimming—\nunderwater—twenty paces distant. Heading for the shore to the north.\n“Balls,” Tugertent said. “Swimming in full mail. Didn’t think you could\neven do that.” She drew an arrow. “I got this one.” From where she was,\nstanding right next to Tugertent, Teia thought she saw a tiny shimmer\naround the fletching of her arrow.\nThe swimming soldier reached the shore seventy paces distant or more\nand surfaced slowly, silently. Tugertent’s arrow met his bare head, and he\nslumped back into the water. Teia swore that the arrow had curved slightly\nin the air. What the hell?\n“Brave,” Tugertent said. “And crazy strong.” She cursed in appreciation.\n“Double-check he’s dead,” Commander Ironfist said.\nTugertent saw Teia looking at her, the question obvious in her eyes. She\nput a finger to her lips. Quiet. Teia let it go. There were more important\nthings.\nTlatig gave a signal from the cabin that Teia thought was the all-clear,\nand Buskin motioned something back to her. Buskin trotted back down the\nline.\n“You can see through walls and water?” he asked. He was old for a\nBlackguard, one of the ebon-skinned, blue-eyed Parians who usually only\ncame from noble families, but he was almost painfully thin where\nCommander Ironfist was thick. His halos were red, and streaked out in lines\nthrough his irises.\n“Only if they’re close enough, and thin enough,” Teia said. “I saw\nthrough the leather at the windows.”"

Look\nfor men and traps. Tugertent will be with you in thirty seconds. Their relief\nmight be coming down at any time. I want to be up before they start coming\ndown.”\nThe Blackguards were already carrying the bodies toward the dock to\nthrow in the water.\nTeia stopped them, found the smallest man, and stripped off his sword\nbelt, floppy hat, and jacket. She pulled the jacket on over her own clothes,\nstrapped on the sword, and pulled the hat over her hair. There was blood on\nthe jacket. She put it out of her mind.\nThe Blackguards looked at her oddly, but she ignored them. She refilled\nher hand with imbalanced paryl to make a torch. Her mouth was dry and it\nwas hard to swallow, but all she had to do was jog and look. She could do\nthat. She moved to the head of the trail, and when Tugertent joined her, she\nfelt overwhelmingly grateful.\n“Let me go around corners first,” she said.\nThe rest of the Blackguards gathered behind them. She took the lead and\nthe three archers followed thirty paces behind her. The rest were ten paces\nbehind them. The path itself soon changed from a goat track winding\naround trees and bushes to one cut into the rock of the head itself. It was\nbarely three feet wide, and Teia saw that some of the men behind her had to\nturn their shoulders sideways to slide along the wall. The wall itself was\nworn smooth from decades or centuries of other soldiers doing the same.\nThey ascended sharply in long switchbacks, back and forth across the face\nof bare rock wall.\nTeia kept her paryl beam cutting left and right, expanding her pupils to\nsee, searching for booby traps or alarm wires, then tightening them back to\nthe visible spectrum. Magister Martaens had said that her mistress’s master\nhad navigated completely by paryl light? There was so much noise in that\nspectrum, Teia could barely believe it. But she found no traps.\nShe stayed half a switchback ahead of the Blackguards, and when they\nwere all about halfway up the cliffs, Teia heard voices above them.\n“—says, ‘She would of if I were rocking her boat!’ ”\nAt least four men laughed, including the speaker.\nTeia glanced back. In contrast to her own panic, the Blackguards behind\nher looked calm. But the soldiers were behind and above them, and coming\ndown, as if racing them for the corner of the switchback. The archers didn’t\nhave any angle to shoot them, and if they waited until the soldiers rounded\nthe corner, the soldiers would certainly have time to sound an alarm.\nRetreating back around the corner, out of sight, Teia looked back for\norders.\n“Get a count,” Buskin mouthed to her.\nBoth parties were walking toward the same switchback corner, a\nhundred paces away, and the two trails got closer and closer as they neared\neach other. In another forty paces, if the descending soldiers looked down,\nthey’d be able to see the ascending Blackguards."

In another forty paces, if the descending soldiers looked down,\nthey’d be able to see the ascending Blackguards.\nTeia held up four fingers, five fingers, shrugged. Commander Ironfist\nwas already coming forward, his tall, muscular body somehow weaving\naround the other Blackguards on the trail as if certain death wasn’t\nbeckoning at the slightest wrong step. He came to the center of the line. In\nhis hand, he held a long green luxin rope. Behind him, struggling more to\nmake it around the Blackguards because she was shorter, came the smallest\nof their number, a woman named Fell.\nOminous name right now, Teia thought. Ironfist helped Fell wrap the\nrope tightly around her waist, then threw the ends of the rope down the rest\nof the line. Everyone grabbed the rope except for the two Blackguards\nimmediately beside Ironfist, who grabbed on to his belt. It was as if they\nwere able to communicate volumes without speaking a word.\nCommander Ironfist looked at Teia. “Exact count. Signal when they’re\ndirectly above us.”\nTeia squared her shoulders, pulled the hat down in front of her eyes, and\ntried to remember the dead soldier’s gait. She rounded the corner, walking\nquickly, but making sure her feet were wider apart than usual to minimize\nthe motion of her hips. She kept her head down, held her shoulders tight, as\nif they were bigger and more muscular than her own, and kept glancing out\nto sea to make it believable that she didn’t see the soldiers coming toward\nher.\n“Arvad!” one of the men called out. “What are you doing coming up\nearly?”\nTeia bobbed her head up toward them. Trick with faking a man’s voice\nwas not to try to become a bass—go for an easy tenor, and keep it short.\n“Rogue wave! Was knocked off the dock! He’s hurt!” She pointed a hand\ndown toward the dock, standing close enough to the edge that the\nBlackguards could see her hand. With her fingers and thumb outstretched:\nfive. Then she brought the other fingers in to point with her index finger\nalone. Plus one. Six.\nShe gestured for the soldiers to follow her before they could ask more,\nand turned her back. She got to the corner and pointed again to the dock,\nher arm outstretched. Then as the soldiers came directly above the\nBlackguards, Teia dropped her arm.\nThe descending soldiers weren’t fifteen feet away from the Blackguards.\nIronfist turned his back to the wall, his feet pointing out, and Fell stood in\nfront of him, in almost a hug, facing his big chest. His big hands wrapped\naround her hips.\nAfter a quick count, Ironfist flung Fell up into the air and she landed\nwith her feet in his hands at shoulder level, then he pressed straight above\nhis head. Blue luxin blazed out from her hands, blasting her back against\nthe green rope out over the abyss, but still she shot out more.

It nudged them\noff. With nothing to hold on to, it didn’t take much.\nAs one, six men tumbled off the trail above the Blackguards. Only one\ngave so much as a squawk of surprise as he plunged to his death. But that\nnearest man hit the green luxin rope as he fell. The man flipped and\ncontinued his fall, but Fell was yanked hard to the side. At the same time,\nshe stopped shooting out blue luxin, so she rebounded toward the wall.\nIronfist leaned crazily over to one side, but couldn’t run to the right because\nthe Blackguards were crowded thick on the ledge. Instead, he pivoted, put\nboth of her feet in one hand, and extended that hand along the side of the\nledge as both of the Blackguards on either side of him had to let go of his\nbelt lest it throw both them and him off the ledge.\nIronfist set Fell down gently, the motion costing him his own balance—\nand fell off the ledge.\nHis big fingers slapped on the lip, slipped, and then held. The\nBlackguards pulled Fell in among them, and before Teia could blink,\nnumerous luxin ropes were already around the commander. With their help,\nhe levered himself up and stood. He didn’t seem fazed in the slightest.\n“They’re all dead,” he said. “But we need to hurry.”\nHe’d been calmly inspecting their work while he was dangling off the\nledge? Bloody flux!\nThe sun rose to full light as they jogged up the path. When they neared\nthe top of the path, Teia scouted ahead and saw that around the last bend,\nthere was a stout wooden gate, ten feet tall, with sharpened spikes at the\ntop. In the paryl light, through small gaps, she could see that it was\nreinforced with iron, and there were four men behind it. The drop-off beside\nthe gate wasn’t sheer like the rest of the cliff they’d just traversed, but it\nwas too steep to climb while armed men were above you. She thought she\ncould make out the shapes of spears and muskets among the men stationed\nthere, too.\nShe had barely reported back when the cannons above began firing out\non the water. During the whole climb, Teia had been so focused on merely\nstaying on the path and watching for booby traps or pitfalls or approaching\nsoldiers that she’d barely looked out to sea. Their view was astounding.\nGorgeous: the sun barely up, the bay blue and deeper blue-green, the sails\nof the ships unfurled, and now thick clouds of smoke rolling out from the\nbroadsides as the Chromerian fleet tried to enter the bay. There were only a\nfew small ships holding the center of the Color Prince’s lines. They fired\nback a volley.\n“Lem,” Commander Ironfist said. “Up front.”"

He\nglanced at her nonexistent chest, up to her eyes, away. “Name’s Lem. True\nname Will. You know, Will to Willum, to Lum to Lem.”\n“Sure,” Teia said. I guess.\n“Thing that’s special about Lem isn’t that he’s crazy,” Lem said. “We’re\nall all sorts of crazy. But Lem is crazy in one particularly valuable way.”\n“And you’re going to tell me what it is,” Teia said as he glanced at her\nchest again. She couldn’t tell if he was being creepy or if he just never\nlooked at people’s eyes.\n“Lem here believes he can do anything in the service of the Blackguard.\nLem here believes rock is like butter, in front of him. He’s a bit slow, which\nis good, because otherwise he’d probably be dangerous as all hell. That’s\nwhat the trainers said. See, Lem can punch grips in the rock for us, no\nproblem. Got a will that’d make Andross Guile weep like a little boy. True\nname Will, you see.”\n“Right,” Teia said.\nLem filled himself with blue luxin, then leaned over conspiratorially to\nTeia. “There’s something in the water,” he said.\nHow did this freak get into the Blackguard?\nHe’s a valuable freak. Like me.\nLem extended a hand and waited. He was chanting numbers under his\nbreath. “Forty-one, fifty-three, forty-seven, fifty-nine, no, fifty-three, fifty-\nnine, sixty-one, seventy-one, no…”\nA hammer of blue luxin shot from his hand and pierced the stone. It\nstuck, a horizontal bar connected to a spike sunk deep into the stone. The\nbar would make a good hand- or foothold. He checked it, pulling on it to\nmake sure there was no play, then took a deep breath. He swept a hand\ndown and eight more of the spikes leapt from his hands in order. It would\nmake an admirable ladder.\nBlue luxin—shot into rock. Holy hells. Just when Teia thought she\ncouldn’t get any more impressed with the Blackguards.\nLem smiled at Teia; then, as if noticing he was making eye contact, he\nlooked away. “True name Will, you see.”\nTeia saw.\nAt Commander Ironfist’s gesture, Teia climbed the makeshift ladder. She\nwas almost to the top when she heard the scrape of iron over rock and\nsomeone inside barking orders. The window was an open slot above her\nhead. Then she saw a cannon poke out of the window. She clamped her\nhands over her ears an instant before the cannon fired.\nThe pressure wave nearly blew her off the makeshift ladder. And that\nshot was followed by half a dozen others, all around the semicircle of the\nfort.

There was enough space for the cannons\nto be rolled forward and poke through the bars but not enough for the\nBlackguards to climb in. Maybe, maybe after a shot, a person could crawl\nthrough the wide area in the bars that the cannon occupied when it was\nforward.\nSo, crawl in front of a cannon and hope there was enough space, and\nattack armed men who would all be looking your way.\nTeia felt rather than heard another set of handholds shiver into the rock\nnext to her, going around the great windows up to the top of the fort.\nLooking down, she waved to Commander Ironfist that they wouldn’t be\nable to get in through the windows. Lem was already firing out another\nladder to bracket the other side of the windows.\nAbove the rock, the fort continued in several floors of wooden towers.\nTeia was glad she wasn’t afraid of heights, because it was getting dizzying.\nThere was a flat spot wide enough for three people to stand where rock and\nwood met. The heavy timbers of the fort’s wooden walls were sunk in deep\nholes drilled directly into the red rock. Teia used her paryl to look through\nthe walls. She couldn’t see through the wood itself, but in the spaces where\nbark pressed against bark, she could catch glimpses. Even then it was\ncloudy—but she couldn’t see anyone on the other side.\nA Blackguard joined her, and she saw that others were clambering up\nthe ladder on the other side. Teia looked down and saw the soldiers still\nstanding by the little gate below them, looking out at the sea. If those men\nturned around to watch their guns fire—and it was quite a sight, so it was\nentirely possible—they would see the Blackguards in full view. But for a\nmoment as the fort’s guns pounded, Teia looked at what the soldiers were\nwatching unfold on the waves. Ships were afire—mostly the Chromeria’s\nships that had sailed too close to the fort.\nThe rest of the fleet was heading for a gap at the middle of the neck. The\nColor Prince’s small ships—Teia didn’t know enough about ships to\nidentify them—were fleeing from that area. But most of the Chromerian\nfleet wasn’t going to make it. Teia had seen how far the fort’s guns reached,\nand with some of the fleet only turning now, they’d be in range of the guns\nfor ten or fifteen more minutes. The fort would manage hundreds of shots in\nthat time. Orholam have mercy. Teia turned away and, far to the west,\nthought she could see the whisper of two skimmers crossing the waves,\ncoming back to join the battle. Had they not found the green bane?\n“How many soldiers?” the Blackguard asked Teia. He meant inside. She\nshook herself. She could do nothing about the crises and stupidity out there\nexcept help stop the guns up here.\n“I don’t see any,” she whispered.\n“Maybe we have a chance then.” The man gestured over to the other\nteam, and Teia saw that there were eight people lined up on that ladder, and\nsix more below her.

The Blackguard—Teia didn’t know his name—was\ndrafting a charge against the wooden wall, placed off to the side as far as he\ndared.\nThe other team was drafting another ladder, this one merely propped\nagainst the wood like a traditional ladder. They climbed it rapidly and\nCommander Ironfist gave the go-ahead.\nPushing Teia to the side, the Blackguard ignited the charge. It blew, and\nfor a moment, Teia was surprised that no one cried out in alarm from within\nthe fort.\nOf course. They’re firing cannons of every size. An explosion wouldn’t\nalarm them.\nWith prybars of luxin, the Blackguards quickly tore out the remaining\nwood and poured into the fort. There were dead bodies everywhere.\nAtashians, mainly, but also scruffy men with no uniforms at all, and\ndrafters, even a few color wights. There’d been a battle here yesterday.\nThe fort was huge, covering Ruic Head in a spiky wooden crown and\nsunk deep into the rock. But there was hardly anyone in sight. There were\ntwo men standing watch at the gate, looking out the opposite side of the\nfort. Blackguard archers killed them, arrows punching through their mailed\nbacks. The Blackguards who’d climbed the other side found a cannon crew\non top of the fence and killed them in seconds.\nTeia ran with them, going down a staircase into the fort proper, down a\nwide hallway to a wooden doorway. It was dark and smoky, but Teia had no\ntrouble seeing in sub-red.\n“Four on the left, five on the right. Looks like a wight giving orders in\nthe middle,” she whispered. Then she ran down the hallway on tiptoe even\nas the cannons roared to where another team stood outside the door to\nanother battery. “Three right, six left.”\nIronfist gestured that she should stay where she was. He quietly drew a\nlong, gorgeous scimitar that she’d never seen before. The grip was inlaid\nwith turquoise and abalone, and there was something that looked like\nburned wood inset along the spine of the blade. Ironfist didn’t look at the\nblade, as if he couldn’t stand the sight of it, but he presented it to Buskin,\nwho reached a hand out from his spot in the stack and touched the wood on\nboth sides of the scimitar.\nAs the atasifusta wood burst into flame, both teams burst into action.\nThe Blackguards stormed the rooms simultaneously, Ironfist visible through\nthe thick gunsmoke as a giant wielding a bar of flame. Teia heard shouts,\nanger, terror—and pistol fire. Her own pistol was drawn in her sweaty hand,\ncocked and ready.\nA door opened on the opposite side of the hall, and a drafter poked his\nhead out into the hallway, looking confused. He saw Teia.\nThe pistol rose of its own volition, the flint snapping down, sparks\nflaring, the shockingly hard kick and the hot smoke. Teia blinked and saw\nthe drafter on the ground at her feet, his left eye and a quarter of his skull\nblown off.\nHe wasn’t dead.\n“Reload,” Commander Ironfist said in her ear. Somehow back already."

The commander\npeeked into the room from which the drafter had come, then, finding no\none, jabbed his flaming scimitar down into the man’s back, into his heart,\npulled it out, and jogged down the hall.\nShe ran after him, barely having charged her musket, but suddenly not\nwanting to be left behind. They stumbled straight into ten enemy drafters.\nTeia lurched to a stop, but Commander Ironfist was already flowing through\nthe steps that looked like the yeshan ka, scimitar in one hand, luxin in the\nother, killing men left and right. The other Blackguards joined him a\nmoment later, blasts of light painting the walls.\nTeia waded in at the same time as the Blackguard who’d blown open the\nfence for them. Zero. His name was Zero, she remembered now. They faced\ntwo drafters who were already gathering light. “You take the green, I got the\nred!” Zero shouted. He moved before Teia could say anything.\nTeia attacked the drafter on her side—the same man Zero attacked. The\ndrafter on the other side shot a blade of luxin into Zero’s torso. He stumbled\nand fell and looked at Teia as if he couldn’t believe she’d been so stupid.\nI’m color-blind, damn it!\nZero fell, but then both enemy drafters were down, killed by the other\nBlackguards.\nA snarling red wight lit himself on fire, and Commander Ironfist roared,\nshouting for Teia to go after—someone—she couldn’t understand the words\nover the shouting and the fires.\nThen she saw a young man running away, and she went after him. He\nwas dressed in a white shirt and cloak, both with thick bands of many colors\non it: one of the Color Prince’s polychromes. He ran down the halls and\ndisappeared. Teia followed as fast as she could.\nRounding a corner, she ran right across his extended foot and into his\nshoulder and went flying. Ambushed! She slid across the smooth stone floor\nand saw that he had her pistol in his hand. She thought he’d broken her\nfinger from tearing it out of the trigger guard. The boy was perhaps\nseventeen years old, his face bloody where his spectacles had been\nshattered, the glass cutting his cheeks and his hawkish nose. He pointed the\npistol at her, and she froze.\nOn her knees, she watched as a dozen soldiers armed with muskets ran\nup to join the young man. They must have been on some other gun\nemplacement or in the barracks. He tucked her pistol away. He grinned at\nher and said, “Kill her, then go reinforce the men inside.”\nTeia didn’t want to die.

It whispered: Like this.\nShe could suddenly hear Magister Martaens saying, “You’ll burn to\ndeath.” But Teia felt serene. No fear. Her hands came up, fingers spread.\nRapid pulses of open color streamed out of her—something beyond paryl,\nor paryl in a way she’d never considered trying to draft it.\nIt felt like she’d dipped her hands in fire. The soldiers screamed, ducked,\ndropped their weapons. Two fled. Several fell and curled into balls.\nTeia heard the steps of running men coming up behind her and she\nsnapped a hand out toward them, ready to kill.\nThey were Blackguards. She stopped, her eyes instantly tightening back\nto the visible spectrum. She looked at her hands. They were untouched,\nunburned but still tingling. She turned back to the soldiers she’d\nincapacitated, expecting them to be charred husks. They were unharmed,\ndazed, then scrambling for their weapons as the Blackguards fell on them.\nTeia jumped to her feet. The boy in charge was one of the ones who’d\nfled, shielded from her blast by the bodies of the men in front of him. She\nran after him.\nShe got to the yard in time to see him slipping out of a gap in the gate.\nDamn. She wasn’t going to go after him.\nAnd just like that the fight seemed to be over. Teia went down to the\nbattery, rubbing her tingling palms. The Blackguards weren’t taking any\ntime to celebrate their victory, they were already loading the cannons under\nthe watchful eye of one of the men who’d worked with big guns before.\nTeia said, “Commander, is Zero going to—”\n“Dead,” Commander Ironfist said. He’d extinguished his sword, but\nthere was smoke and soot and blood and bloody hair on the blade. “The\nboy? The polychrome?”\n“I didn’t—He was able to get—”\nCommander Ironfist held up a finger and walked toward the window.\n“Am I seeing things?” he asked.\nA line of Blackguards joined him. Vanzer, a green, said, “Oh no. I can\nfeel it.”\nThe battle on the sea was still going strong. The Chromeria’s fleet didn’t\nseem to have even noticed that the fire from the fort had ceased. Every ship\nwas still under way, heading for the center. And the Color Prince’s fleet had\nyielded the center completely.\nBut the Blackguards were looking at the sea itself. It was a different\ncolor in a vast circle, at least a league across, directly under the center.\n“They’ve lured us right to the middle of the neck,” Ironfist said. Right\ninto the center of that great dark circle.\nA spire as wide across as a tower shot up out of the water, causing huge\nwaves that battered the ships around it. Then smaller towers shot up\nhundreds of paces away, in a circle. One of them pierced right through the\nhull of a galleon and lifted it entirely out of the water until its hull split and\nrained men and matériel into the sea."

The waters jumped, and then crashed down,\nswamping entire ships, crushing others—and then the waters went racing\noff the sides of the newly surfaced island in vast torrents in every direction.\nIt looked like some of the ships fortunate enough to be turned in the\nright direction would race right off the island, but vines as thick as tree\ntrunks lashed out as the island surfaced. A forest of vines, living, grabbing\nlike the tentacles of a kraken, whipped out—not in one single place, but in\nhundreds. The bane was a living, writhing carpet.\nThough Teia’s eyes couldn’t tell her, she had no doubt what color this\nwas. The wildness of green, undampened by the seas, now hit the drafters\nlike a slap in the face.\nThe ships that weren’t crushed were beached on the green island,\nleaning over crazily, immobilized.\nIn one minute, the Chromeria’s fleet was simply gone. The defense of\nRu aborted. Thousands killed. The battle lost.\nFrom the island itself, Teia saw hundreds of men—small as burrowing\ninsects from up here—emerge. They pointed their hands at the sky, and\nlight shot up from hundreds of green color wights. A tiny group in the\ncenter of that burgeoning army was fighting them, hurling every other color\naround them.\n“Those are Blackguards,” someone said. “The Prism’s down there.\nFighting. Against all that.”\nOrholam have mercy. They didn’t stand a chance.\nChapter 109\n“Five minutes until sunrise,” the orange drafter announced. He was\nnervously, noisily sucking his spit back and forth across the khat he had\ntucked under his lip.\nA dozen orange and yellow drafters were gathered at the base of Ru’s\nsouthern wall, waiting for dawn, nervously commanding Liv and her team\nto be quiet. Liv’s team was made of four drafters and four soldiers. With\nher, they made the holy number of nine. Liv would have preferred to make\nthe holy number of ninety-nine. She would have preferred to have fighters\nwho could draft and drafters who could fight, but the Blood Robes were\nyears away from having anything remotely as good as the Blackguard.\nThe Blood Robes’ army was awake and armed, but the closest of them\nwere four and five hundred paces back from the wall. The Atashians surely\nhad guns that could reach that far, but they’d decided to conserve their\npowder. Liv could only guess that their situation was nearly as dire as the\nBlood Robes’. The Color Prince’s battery on the south side of the neck had\nonly enough powder for one shot from each gun. His hope was that the\nChromeria’s fleet would avoid that shore altogether and instead hug the\nopposite coast, which they believed their Atashian allies still held.\nLiv wouldn’t know how that turned out until it was all over, if ever.

        "text": "own mission was the next thing to a suicide mission. Her soldiers were\ndressed in scored and scarred leather armor and faded blue cloaks of the\nBlue Bastards, a mercenary company that had been hired by Ru. Mercenary\ncompanies rarely took bids volunteering to endure sieges, so Ru must have\npaid them a fortune.\nAnd as might be expected of men whose primary loyalty was to their\npurse, they’d been willing to come to an understanding with the Color\nPrince. They had refused to fight for him, fearing that a reputation as\nturncloaks would interfere with future contracts. But they did agree to\ngrease the skids for Liv’s team in return for leniency when the Blood Robes\ntook the city.\nLike every leader, the Color Prince hated mercenaries and still had to\nuse them. He was convinced that the pirate lord Pash Vecchio had betrayed\nhim. The weedy pirate had sworn that his great ship would hold the south\nshore, herding the Chromeria’s fleet straight into their trap. They’d had\nword that his ship had been seen, so maybe he’d show up at the last\nmoment. More likely, he was waiting at the outskirts like some of the other\npirates, hoping to swoop in on the wounded ships after the battle and take\nslaves and plunder.\nThe sound of distant guns, rumbling over the sea, came before dawn did.\nLiv wondered if people she knew were dying out there. She turned back to\nlook at the wall, watching the sunlight creep down its face.\n“I thought this was impossible,” she said to the orange-eyed khat\nchewer.\n“Chromeria trained, aren’t ya? Chromeria lies, princess.”\nOf all the colors, only the Color Prince’s orange drafters were better than\nthe Chromeria’s. Their illusions crafted into the depths of other luxins were\nas good as Chromeria students’, but they also did something that Liv had\nheard rumors about, but that the Chromeria denied was possible: they cast\nfeelings. You had to see the object on which they’d cast the hex, and you\nhad to be susceptible to such things—the more emotional you were, the\nmore powerfully you would experience the hex. But this wall was their\nmasterpiece in two parts. First, the Color Prince’s men inside the city had\ncast hexes on every building and street and on the wall itself for several\nblocks around here. The hexes could be cast thin enough that the eye\nwouldn’t even pick them out, especially against backgrounds with lots of\ncolors or patterns. But the effect remained—going right past the mind,\nstraight to the guts, blanching the liver, putting water in the stomach. In one\nsmall neighborhood on the opposite side of this wall, everyone felt dread.\nIt wasn’t an alien feeling for someone to experience in a city under\nsiege, and it accomplished what it had been intended to—people avoided\nthis area. That meant they studied the wall less closely than they would,\nwhich meant the illusion held.\nLiv asked how they did it. They said they cast their will into the\ncreation, the same way golems were made. It made the magic alive in some\nsense. Forbidden by the Chromeria, of course. The luxiats thought that\ntearing part of your will off to make magic tore part of your soul off, and\nthat such lost parts of your soul were never regained.\nThe Blood Robes knew better. So they said."

So they said.\nThe trebuchet on the Red Cliffs above threw its great stones on every\nquarter hour, and it threw stones close to this neighborhood. The oranges\nhad reached the wall, and when they set their charges, they timed them to\ngo off when the trebuchet’s stones rocked the earth.\nOne Atashian captain had been assassinated, and another bought off,\nguaranteed safety for himself and his family when the city fell. They’d\nburrowed a hole in the wall, then covered it with an illusion. Blue luxin,\noverlaid with red and yellow and orange, twisted into illusions that looked\nnearly the same as the wall itself. It would fool a quick glimpse from twenty\nor thirty paces, but not a close inspection.\nThe drafters and sappers had worked through every night, with thick\nwool blankets draped over them to hide the light of the mag torches,\nemerging exhausted and coated in sweat every morning. But in mere days\nthey’d made an unseen gate, with supports drafted to hold up the wall above\nthem, wide enough for five men to pass abreast.\nIt wouldn’t be wide enough to let in the entire army, and it was too short\nfor horses to pass, but that wasn’t the strategy. An hour after Liv’s team\nentered the city, the Color Prince would send five hundred of his best\ndrafters and warriors through this tunnel, with instructions to open the city’s\nsouth gate and let his armies in.\nUltimately, Liv didn’t see how it could fail. The Color Prince hadn’t\nbeen so sure. He’d wanted to deal with the Chromeria’s fleets on one day\nand Ru the next in case the fleet landed ashore and attacked him from the\nrear instead of trying to bring supplies directly in to Ru. But he’d made his\ngamble: to spring his trap, he needed to do both things today.\nIf things didn’t work out, Liv was going to find herself very, very alone\nin a hostile city.\n“Time!” the orange barked. As the sun drenched them, he and a blue and\na yellow all touched the wall in slightly different places, reaching the\ncontrol nodes that they’d left on the surface. They pulled back the illusion\nlike a curtain.\n“Remember what our prince has said,” Liv said. “What we do today, we\ndo for mercy. The price of freedom is always paid in blood. And if the price\nmust be paid, better that it be paid by few. Let us be swift and implacable.”\nIt wasn’t much of a speech, but Liv had never done this before. Her men\nnodded, then they went into the wall first. She was second to last. If she\ndied, their entire mission would fail, so they would protect her above all.\nThe price and privilege of being a superviolet.\nShe ducked in behind them. The wall was eighteen paces thick at its\nbase. Immense. This was the reason they hadn’t bombarded the wall\nstraight on with the trebuchets—it would have taken them months to break\nthrough.

But\nwhoever had told the Color Prince that five men could pass abreast had\nbeen lying. The space was so short that Liv had to stoop deeply to get\nthrough, and five men abreast? She could reach each wall with her\noutstretched fingers. It was enough for their purposes, and Liv was\nmomentarily glad that she was going into the city first, rather than in the\nmiddle of five hundred men straining to get through this tiny hole while\nunder fire and magic.\nGrateful to be going alone into an enemy city. I’m mad.\nAnd then they were out. Some of the men were dusty. One, a seven-\nfooter named Phyros, was dabbing his head, which was bleeding freely\nfrom smacking it on the roof of the tunnel. They slapped off the dust from\ntheir faded blue shirts—the closest thing to a uniform the Blue Bastards had\n—and bound a bandage quickly around Phyros’s head.\n“Follow me,” Phips Navid said. He was a cousin of Payam Navid, the\ngorgeous magister Liv and every other girl at the Chromeria had half loved.\nPhips had grown up in Ru, though his father and older brothers and uncles\nhad all been hanged after the Prisms’ War. He’d been twelve years old, and\nnarrowly avoided the noose himself.\nThey jogged through the streets. Near the wall, because of the dread hex,\nthere was no one at all out. But soon they jogged past some soldiers, who\nmerely nodded at them. They swung one block wide to avoid a troop of the\nBlue Bastards—only the top few commanders of the mercenaries knew\ntheir plan. Any underlings who saw them would ask what they were doing.\nMost of the city was untouched as yet by the war. The Color Prince\nwanted a new power base for his war, not another drain on his resources, so\nhe’d had the trebuchets on the Red Cliffs concentrate their stones on a few\nneighborhoods, and the artillery batteries. There were whole markets and\npalaces that remained untouched. The buildings were whitewashed adobe\nwith flat roofs that served as extra rooms, especially on hot nights, just as\nthey did in Tyrea. But here there were far more palaces built around central\ncourtyard gardens. Whatever damage had been inflicted on Ru during the\nPrisms’ War had long ago been scrubbed away by their wealth.\nBut the people on the streets didn’t look like they felt fortunate. They\nlooked like dread hexes had been painted on every wall. As she passed\nbeneath three- and four-story-tall palaces, Liv spied men with long lenses\non not a few of those palaces, peering out toward the sea. The sound of\ncannons was barely audible down in the maze of streets, though.\nThey passed unmolested all the way to the temple district. The Great\nPyramid of Ru suddenly towered above them. Liv instantly saw both its\nkinship and its rivalry with the ziggurats of Idoss. The Idossians had gone\nfor height, and their great ziggurat was taller and steeper than the Great\nPyramid, but for sheer mass and grandeur, it couldn’t compare to this:"

Every season, the facings of all four sides were\nchanged—though this year, with the army approaching, they hadn’t gone to\nthe expense to change to the autumn trappings. Every summer, the pyramid\nwas made a garden, a veritable mountain of flowers, the design given over\nto a new director every year, with a noble family underwriting the costs.\nThis late in the year, the flowers should have been withered and dying,\nthe full splendor long passed. Instead, every plant was still in bloom, an\neffect of the green bane, the Color Prince had said. This year, the gardens\nhad been designed to evoke a sun resting on the pinnacle of the Great\nPyramid, in the jagged, runic old Atashian art style. Lilies and gardenias\nand white irises and white hydrangeas yielded to daisies and buttercups and\nmarigolds. In zigzag steps, orange roses and lilies and tulips represented the\nrays of the sun, stabbing through a sky of hyacinth and bluebells. A forest of\nvibrant greens took up the middle, and the base was a maze of\nrhododendrons, camellias, and roses of every color. Streams came down\nevery side, even passing over the great steps in whimsical aqueducts.\nFountains spat water from heights to land in pools a dozen paces below.\nAnd all of this was temporary, to be switched out next season for something\nequally lavish. The noble families did this to compete with each other.\nThe sheer scale of the wealth necessary for such a display\nsimultaneously enthralled and sickened Liv. This city was wealthy, but\nthey’d passed their share of beggars and slatterns and cripples and orphans,\neven in half an hour.\n“Staring,” Phips Navid said gently.\nLiv pulled her eyes away. No one seemed to have seen her gawking.\nIdiot. Gawking was a sure way to break their disguise.\nBut everyone else seemed busy, concerned with their own business and\nkeeping their heads down. In another two minutes, Liv and her men were at\nthe base of the great steps. One of the commanders of the Blue Bastards\nwas there, a bent-nosed blue-eyed old goat with no front teeth named Paz\nCavair, talking with one of the city captains who was guarding the base of\nthe pyramid with six men.\n“Liv!” Paz shouted. “Was hoping I might see you. Come here.”\nLiv scowled and jogged over with her men. “Sir,” she said, “I was\nheaded over to check how much powder—”\n“Never mind that. I got a message I want you to take up to Lord Aravind\nup top.”\nGrimacing, playing dumb, Liv said, “Can I send one of my men?”"

Besides, how are you going to keep that\nlittle ass of yours so tight if you don’t sweat a bit?”\nThe captain laughed with Paz, and Liv’s men snickered quietly, as if\ntrying to suppress it.\nLiv looked at her men. “I don’t know what you boys are laughing about.\nIf I gotta go up, you’re coming, too.”\nThat shut them up.\nThe captain laughed, but then looked uncomfortable. “I’m afraid I can\nonly let two of you up there. We could take the message for you if you\nwant, but I can’t let armed parties up the Great Pyramid.”\n“We’re in the middle of a war. You’re joking, right?” Paz Cavair said.\n“I hate to be a stickler, but orders and all,” the captain said. He was a\nyoung man. Dark-haired, beautiful blue eyes, beaded beard. “You know\nhow it is.”\n“I do,” Paz Cavair said. “Jump.”\n“Huh?” the captain asked.\nIt was the code. Paz Cavair’s one guard and all of Liv’s attacked the\nAtashian soldiers, drawing knives and stabbing them through mail, breaking\nnecks and savagely hacking into the flesh of the captain and all his men. It\nwas over so fast, and the bodies carried away so swiftly, that there was no\nimmediate outcry.\nThe murder done, Paz Cavair flipped his cloak around. He had the eagle\nsigil of Ru stitched on the other side and he took up position as if he was a\nsoldier himself. Liv and all her men flipped their cloaks around as well. Paz\nCavair’s bodyguards stripped the cloaks off the other guards, and they piled\nseveral others on top of each other and hid them as well as they could.\n“Five minutes to reach the top if you run. You need to get there before the\nguard’s changed.”\n“This was supposed to be the new guards,” Liv said.\n“Their relief is late. Nothing we can do about it now. Go!”\nSo they ran, straight up the steps. It would only be a matter of time\nbefore Lord Aravind’s men saw them. If they were lucky, their cloaks\nwould buy them peace until they reached the top—most of the city’s\nsoldiers had little official insignia, but only elite soldiers were supposed to\napproach Lord Aravind en masse. But it was war, and the old way of doing\nthings always breaks down in war.\nLiv ran.\nCannons went off to the south, and she could see part of the Color\nPrince’s army massing, charging toward the gates. It was mostly a\ndistraction—for her.\n“Liv,” the Color Prince had said last night. “I’ve been testing you. To see\nif I can trust you with something.”\n“I know. I’d say, of course you can trust me, but I suppose I would say\nthat regardless.”\nHe smirked. It was a little gruesome with his burn scars, but she barely\neven saw those anymore. “Not testing your loyalty, not now.” The sun was\nsetting early, lighting up the Red Cliffs, making the shadows of the"

It’s a test that I’m forced\nto give you because I have so few superviolet drafters, and I need a good\none for this. The best one. I’d like to keep you safe, but instead, I need to\nrisk you so that we might be victorious. If you succeed, I will reward you\nmore highly than you can imagine.”\n“What do I need to do?” Liv asked.\nAnd here she was, sweating, heaving, feeling like she was going to\nthrow up. She stopped for a moment and looked out to sea, feeling\nsomething, thinking she’d heard something.\nA vast green island had risen from the depths of the sea and now floated\nin the middle of the neck. Ships, small specks, were crashing and capsizing.\nHuge waves were rolling out from it. An enormous spire rose out of the\ncenter of the island. Her heart soared and she swore she felt suddenly wild\nand strong. The green bane.\nTo the south, she could hear the sounds of battle. Cannons and muskets\nwere being fired from the wall, shaking the city. The soldiers at the top of\nthe pyramid hadn’t seen the bane or Liv’s team yet, their vision narrowed to\nthe battle playing out in front of the walls.\nBut despite feeling wild and strong, sprinting up the steps was\nexhausting. Liv slowed and the men on either side of her each grabbed one\nof her arms and helped her up the rest of the way. They didn’t harass her for\nit. They were fighters and their bodies were trained for this. She wasn’t. It\nmade her feel weak and helpless—and some small part of her felt trapped\nand wanted to wrench free. But she suppressed the urge.\nThey slowed as they came close to the top of the pyramid. Almost\ninvisible from below, there was a square patio at the pyramid’s penultimate\nlevel, where lords could gather and religious rituals be carried out. It was\nfrom here that the men and women of Ru’s royal family had been\nslaughtered and thrown down the steps. Fuschias hung from baskets and\npools of water and fountains kept the nobles cool, slaves brought fruit and\nwine from within the pyramid itself.\nThe drafters in Liv’s team had all pulled on their spectacles, and she did\nthe same. She drafted a shell of superviolet and filled it with liquid yellow,\nas Gavin Guile himself had shown her. It felt like so long ago now.\n“Who are you?” a voice asked from above. A soldier, challenging them.\nA spear of blue shot through the man’s nose and into his face, and blood\nexploded from his eyes. Liv’s team charged.\nThere were more people on the top of the pyramid than Liv had guessed,\nbut no drafters. She shot her flashbomb into the middle of the crowd and it\nburst, blinding the half of the men who were looking their way. Liv’s men\nwere ferocious—easily some of the best drafters and fighters she’d ever\nseen.

Phips\nNavid charged Lord Aravind, shouting vengeance, and was cut down by the\nnoble’s bodyguards.\nLiv stood back and shot flashbombs, feeling vaguely cowardly, but\nknowing that she was irreplaceable, and her flashbombs did their work. She\nonly had to draw her pistol once, when a crazed slave had rushed her with a\nflowerpot. The woman had dropped at Liv’s feet, powder burns around the\nbloody hole in the center of her chest.\nThen, abruptly, it was done. Men and women were moaning, but there\nwas no fight. Liv’s team was down to five, somehow, and each of them was\nchecking bodies, dispatching wounded enemies who were scrambling to\nhide or to find weapons.\n“Got ten soldiers coming up the outer steps,” Phyros said. “I’ll hold the\ninside steps.”\nPhips Navid was whimpering over by the throne. Liv walked over to\nhim. His left eye was crushed, and there was a spear all the way through his\nstomach and coming out his back, and his knee was bent the wrong way.\n“We get him?” Phips asked. “That swine Aravind? We get him?”\n“Yes,” Liv said. “Looks like he took a spike in the groin. Phyros just\nopened his throat.”\nPhips barked a laugh, but it ended in a whimper. “Good, good. Fourteen\nyears I been hunting that bastard. Wish I could have done it myself. Wish…\nwish I hadn’t needed to. You believe in heaven?”\n“I believe in hell,” Liv said.\nHe looked like he tried to laugh, but his face twisted in pain. “Do me the\nfavor, will you? I’ll go find out for both of us.” He grinned again fiercely\nand held that grin stubbornly against his pain and fear. She told herself it\nwas mercy, but she couldn’t move until she drafted superviolet once more.\nIt had to be done.\nShe did it, blade slicing neatly through carotid and jugular. She stepped\nback on shaky legs. Turned away before she could watch what she’d done.\n“Ladder’s back here,” Phyros called.\nLiv hurried back to him and climbed up the ladder. There was a small\nledge beneath the great polished mirror. But as soon as Liv approached it,\nshe knew it was no ordinary mirror. Not only was this mirror massive—\nfifteen paces across at least—it was spotlessly clean. There was no dust, no\nscratches on its face. There were old, old runes carved into the iron frame,\nblack with age.\nFrom the top of the pyramid, Liv could see the battle unfolding at the\nwalls. The Prince’s five hundred, decimated, had made it through the bloody\nsmoky hell of that tunnel, and were pushing against soldiers in every street\nin that neighborhood. The black smoke of muskets rattling and the sound of\nmen screaming rose even to here. But the Blood Robes were pushing in,\ngaining ground.

After that, Liv couldn’t\nimagine it would be long before they would reach the gate. But the fight\nwasn’t over yet, and it seemed that the Atashians on the top of the wall had\na limitless supply of loaded muskets, pulling them out, shooting, being\nhanded new ones, shooting, shooting, raining ceaseless death on the\nattackers.\nLiv tore her eyes away. Her fight was here. She tightened her eyes to\nslits. The mirror seemed to hum in her vision. Strange. She looked down at\nthe base and saw a black panel. She probed it with fingers of superviolet\nand felt the mirror shudder. It felt like there were little invisible levers\ninside it.\nWhat am I doing? She looked at the soldiers coming up the pyramid.\nThis was her last test. This was what she was made for. If she did this, the\nColor Prince would give her more than she’d ever dreamed. She’d never\nagain be inconsequential. She could never again be ignored, despised,\npowerless.\nThey were going to win the battle for the city, but out there, somehow,\nthe battle for the sea would turn on what she did here. This was her chance\nto pay back the Chromeria for every sneer, for using her against her father,\nfor making her break her oaths, for defiling everything.\nThe tendrils of her superviolet luxin sank into the black box, found\nlevers within, pulled—and the mirror swung, almost taking her head off.\nShe let go of the luxin, and the mirror stopped abruptly. She drafted again\nand pulled another and the mirror tilted. She pulled another, and the mirror\nshimmered and turned blue.\n“Quickly, my lady, they’re almost upon us!” one of the men cried.\n“Working!” she shouted.\nWith the superviolet controls, Liv pulled another lever, and a green filter\nbubbled to the mirror’s surface. From there, it was a simple matter of\npushing and pulling the first two levers. She caught the sun’s rising light in\nthe huge mirror and shot it out over the bay. She turned it left and right and\nup and down, wondering if she would have any idea when she finally got it\nright, or if she was already getting it right. She felt something when the\nbeam was aimed far out to sea, over Ruic Head, but that must have been her\ntrying too hard. That wasn’t even remotely the right direction. She turned it\nover the bay, up and down, searching.\nThen something vibrated—she lost it. She reached again and turned the\nbeam back, the tiniest bit. It caught, and hummed. In a moment, the mirror\nwent from a mirror to something else entirely.\nThe mirror collected all the sun and was sending a vibrant emerald beam\nout to the bane. It was visible in the very air, burning bright green. That\nwasn’t right; it wasn’t even possible. Mirrors never shone so bright that you\ncould see the beam during the day.

For she saw\nKip, and Karris, and Gavin Guile himself on the bane, and she knew that if\nshe obeyed the Color Prince, she would doom them all.\nIf she was to have the power to change the world, if she was to save ten\nthousand naïve young women in the future from the sharks and sea demons,\nshe must let her friends die. She had begged the Color Prince to save Kip\nand Karris before—had traded Blood Robes’ lives for theirs in Garriston.\nNot half a year ago, her friends had been worth her oath and the lives of a\nfew strangers. Was saving them now worth the dream of a new, changed,\npure world?\n“Do you know what Atirat needs, Aliviana?” the Color Prince had asked\nher last night.\n“Sacrifices?” she hazarded.\n“Light. Every god is birthed in light.”\nAnd, weeping, light she brought.\nChapter 110\nThe first great wave came from behind the skimmer.\nGavin shouted something, but it was lost in the roar of water falling and\ncrushing and sweeping over the back of the skimmer. His body language\nwas unmistakable, though. He threw himself at the reeds and threw luxin\ndown them as hard as he could. The Blackguards followed his example, and\nthe skimmer jumped forward.\nBut they weren’t as fast as the great swell that swept Kip off his feet. He\ngrabbed on to the rail with both hands, and as it flipped him around, he saw\nthe spire rising out of the sea behind them. Already, it was hundreds of feet\nhigh. It was the origin of the great wave and the pounding water falling\nfrom the sky both.\nThen Kip was crushed down against the deck. He heard the sound of\nluxin snapping and ripping loose and he saw Gavin flying off the front of\nthe skimmer. He’d shot luxin so hard, he’d torn the reeds off. They were all\nsuddenly airborne. Kip lost the railing—or maybe it disintegrated. He could\nsee nothing except water. Whatever had hurled the sea upward had stopped,\nand now the seas dropped again with all the chaos of a waterfall. Kip fell\nand fell and fought for one deep breath. When he landed in the water, it was\ninto a current that blasted him sideways. He hit something, scraped\nsomething else. It was no use trying to fight, he was being tumbled head\nover heels. He had no idea which way was up.\nFeeling something beneath him, he grabbed it, missed, slipped.

He grabbed again, catching what felt like a tree branch, and\nwalked himself hand over hand toward the weaker current. His lungs were\nburning, and the water was so fouled that he couldn’t see anything but\ngreen. He fought down his panic, fought down the wildness. Hand over\nhand, Kip. He grabbed root after root and kept going, going.\nMoments later, he felt the temperature change on his back. Air. Wedging\nhis feet in among the roots, he lifted his head and breathed.\nThe current almost pulled him into the depths and he staggered, but\ncaught himself. He was standing on a new island, and everywhere, water\nwas sluicing off in great rivers back into the sea. The land, if land it was,\nwasn’t uniform. In some places the water had no way to seek lower ground,\nand it stood in ponds and lakes.\nGreen. Every possible shade from the slate green of lichen to the red-\ntinged green of a ruby leaf. Radiant emerald greens that glowed from within\nand the dull, earthen greens of roots; spruce and sage and seaweed and olive\nand sea foam and mint green. The entire island was an amalgam of living\nvegetation and green luxin. Kip was standing on roots pulsing with life. He\nsaw an entire galleon, mysteriously unbroken, wedged between the\nbranches of what looked like a fallen tree, fifty feet in the air. But even as\nKip stared in wonder, he saw branches climbing up the galleon’s hull like\nan ivy shoot. They wrapped over the galleon’s waist, thickened, and crushed\nthe decks, spilling sailors everywhere.\nThe entire island was living vegetation, and it was waking.\nSearching for the Blackguards, Kip saw the black-garbed figures rising,\nspread over five hundred paces. He only saw eight of them, but there were\nmore in the water, swimming, fighting. Gavin stood a hundred paces away,\nwaving, and pointing toward the spire. He looked urgent.\nKip ran toward him.\nComing to a channel of swiftly flowing water that was too wide to jump\nacross, Kip threw green luxin down at his feet, making a plank to run on\nlike he’d seen Commander Ironfist do before. It was easier than any drafting\nhe’d ever done. The green light seemed to press itself physically into his\neyes; he barely had to open the tap, and it flowed out just as easily. He felt\nthe wild joy and freedom of green, a joy without terror, a joy without\nanchor—\nKip didn’t think it was his own joy he was feeling.\nGavin wasn’t waiting for Kip; he was sprinting for the spire. That he\ndidn’t wait first hurt Kip’s feelings, then terrified him. Gavin would wait, if\nhe could. If there wasn’t some absolutely desperate need, if seconds weren’t\nabsolutely crucial, he would gather up his forces. Not only Kip, but\neveryone. Gavin would want to have his whole team together for both\nhumane and tactical reasons. That he thought there was no time for either—\nA sound like a thousand sighs swept across the bane—air being released,\nthe hollow echo of bubbles opening. Kip ran straight over a rising cocoon"

        "text": "A sound like a thousand sighs swept across the bane—air being released,\nthe hollow echo of bubbles opening. Kip ran straight over a rising cocoon\nyawning open, its membrane tearing as a jade green hand clawed the air.\nCommander Ironfist had been right. Green wights had flocked here by the\nhundreds or thousands to be perfected by the bane itself. And now they\nwere rising. Kip hurdled over the color wight rising from its gooey cocoon\nand ran faster than he’d run in his entire life.\n“Load the cannons,” Commander Ironfist said. He was looking out over the\nbay at the new island through the mounted long lens that the battery’s\ngunners had used to sight targets. His face was as hard as Teia had ever\nseen. “Hezik! You have some experience?”\nA Blackguard with shoulders like a buffalo stepped forward. He had\nonly one ear, a thick scar down the left half of his face testimony to a sword\nstroke. “Yessir, mother commanded a pirate hunter in the Narrows.”\n“Recommendations. Time’s short.”\n“Don’t load all the guns. Only these two can hit that damn thing at all,\nand only this one with any sort of accuracy.” He gestured to the big bronze\nculverin. “Six thousand paces, but from this height, and with this powder,\nnice big grains rather than fine, wrap the first shot in sacking to help me get\nthe range…”\n“Your command, Hezik. Take out the big tower.”\nHezik was silent for a second, thinking, then he began pointing to men.\n“Inventory. I want to know how much of this grain of powder we have, and\nwhat shot. Do we have any shells? You, weigh that ball on the scales over\nthere, then measure out four-fifths of that weight. You, there should be some\ngunners’ notes somewhere. Find ’em!”\nGavin had set fire to the huge yellow sword he’d drafted and was throwing\nflames with his left hand and slashing green wights with his right, still\nrunning toward the spire. Karris was hard on his heels, her ataghan cutting\nnecks and stomachs as wights’ eyes were drawn by Gavin’s figure in front\nof her. As always, Kip brought up the rear, short of breath, but able to do\nanything with green empowering him.\nBefore they could reach the spire, dozens of wights rose up. They’d\nbeen kneeling, worshipping before the spire, but seeing these interlopers,\nthey ran to intercept them. The spire was still growing, twisting higher\ntoward the heavens. The wights themselves were growing, too. The green\nbane was making all of them stronger. Every one of them used the power\ndifferently. Some went green golem, wrapping themselves in green armor\nthat made them three times as wide. Others looked like saplings, stripped of\nbark, a thin green skin replacing their own skin, green over red, skeletal and\nall the more alien for being so close to human. Others made themselves\nhugely tall. Others drafted huge claws or great, springy frogs’ legs. Others,\nless imaginative, drafted thick shields and cudgels and helms.\nKip felt a thump reverberate dimly through the ground at his feet and a"

A dim trail of smoke from a crater\nmore than a hundred paces away pointed back toward the battery up on\nRuic Head, where a much larger plume of black smoke was blowing away.\n“To me, to me!” Gavin shouted.\nAfter a moment of resistance at being ordered to do something, the\ngreen in him rebelling, Kip realized it was what he wanted to do anyway. In\nseconds, he and five Blackguards joined Gavin.\n“They’re making a god. We kill it,” Gavin said. He drafted another\nyellow sword, handed it to a Blackguard who had lost her weapons. “No\nmatter what. No matter how. Got it?” He made another yellow sword, and\nanother, tossed one to a Blackguard and one to Kip. Then he started running\ntoward the wights. His hands were surrounded with glowing knots of\nyellows and reds.\nAs the first green spear came shooting toward Gavin, he dropped under\nit and rolled on the ground, came up to his knees and threw his hands\nforward. A fan of yellow missiles blasted out from him, each trailing chains\nof flame. The missiles stabbed dozens of the wights and the chains whipped\naround them, wrapping some in flame and scoring the wights behind.\nBut Gavin barely slowed. He popped back up to his feet and kept\nrunning.\nA frog wight Kip hadn’t even seen descended, huge claws raking\ndownward. Karris dodged to the side and swept her ataghan under its\narmpit.\nThen, still fifty paces from the base of the spire, they ran into a veritable\nwall of green wights. Gavin crashed through a few, killing, spinning, killing\n—and almost got separated from the Blackguards. A Blackguard named\nMilk had his entire arm and shoulder ripped off by a big claw. A woman\nnamed Tisa was knocked aside as she drafted a stream of fire and\naccidentally shot a gush of pyrejelly down her own stomach and leg. It\nflamed and she screamed.\nBut she didn’t forget herself. As a green golem eight feet tall settled\nbetween Gavin and the rest of them to cut him off, Tisa hurled herself onto\nthe golem’s back, taking both of them down in a sudden intense wash of\nfire.\nKip slashed back and forth, trying to keep up with the others. Something\ntwisted his yellow luxin sword and he lost it.\nThe three remaining Blackguards reunited with Gavin, who fought with\nthe flaming sword in one hand and luxin of alternating colors in the other.\nThey were stuck, surrounded by dozens of wights, stopped.\nA shell rocked the ground, exploding with a deafening roar. Kip felt the\npressure wave and almost fell. A smoking hole cratered the green island,\nthirty paces away. The wights around it had been vaporized, those farther\nout torn to pieces.\nThe Blackguards and Gavin recovered first. The crater and the hole in\nthe wights’ lines wasn’t directly between the Blackguards and the tower, but\nit offered movement. Freedom.\nEven then, they never would have made if it the greens could tolerate\norder—if they’d organized their defenses. But with the help of the chaos,"

But with the help of the chaos,\nGavin and his people cut through the staggered creatures and ran into the\ngap created by the shell, stepping on bodies and slipping on released green\nluxin that was evaporating as the once-men holding it died. Kip almost\ntripped over a woman’s bare torso—nothing else of her remained. Red and\ngreen ran in rivers next to each other, filling the crater with blood soup.\nCrashing into the still-recovering lines on the opposite side of the crater\nwith Karris, Gavin, and the remaining three Blackguards, Kip remembered\nhis knife, still strapped to his calf, and pulled it out, stumbling. He lashed\nout at a big wight who was holding his bleeding eyes, weeping. Kip’s knife\ncut through the wight’s shell and kidneys with ease.\nHe felt instantly, stupidly guilty. The man hadn’t been able to defend\nhimself, and Kip had cut him like a—\n“Incoming!” Gavin shouted. He knocked Kip down.\nThey heard the thump and the explosion, but it was a good seventy\npaces away this time—no good to them, but no danger either.\nBy the time they stood, a man with a green bull’s head on his shoulders\nwas charging them. Gavin leapt aside and cut the man’s back as he passed.\nThe wight went down, but his horn caught Karris, who hadn’t jumped far\nenough. It spun her hard and slammed her into the ground.\nKip jumped on the bull and stabbed in through the top of its head,\ntwisting his dagger in its brain and ripping it out. He grabbed Karris and\npulled her to her feet. There was blood on her arm and chest, but instead of\nskewering her, the horn had passed under her armpit. She was winded,\ngasping for air, but not wounded. Lucky.\nGavin threw his sword into the chest of a woman who had the form of a\nharpy and spun, pulling his dagger-pistols from his belt. The guns spun in\nhis hands as he pointed at Kip. Both pistols cracked and Kip ran on, certain\nthat two wights behind him and Karris were dead.\nA Blackguard was hamstringing two giants at the base of the stairs when\none caught him with a war hammer in the shoulder. He staggered sideways,\ntrying to catch himself, and met the other’s battle axe. It cut all the way\nthrough his chest.\nGavin shot yellow spears into their brains, one-two-three, in rapid\nsuccession, but it was too late for the Blackguard.\n“Up,” Gavin shouted, “up!”\nThey ran up the stairs as if hell was on their heels. Kip was at the back.\nThe tower was growing even as they mounted the stairs, twisting higher like\na growing tree.\n“What was that?” Gavin asked.\nWhat? Kip hadn’t seen anything. He was exhausted, and they were only\nhalfway up the tower. He looked down and saw that the wights had decided\nto follow them. He didn’t slow.\nA clash of arms up ahead told Kip that they had encountered defense. It\nwas all that allowed him to catch up. But Gavin had barely slowed. Kip"

Kip\nheard screams descending, and when he passed the same spot of the\nwinding stair, he saw wights far below, their bodies broken.\nA great beam of green light hit the top of the tower, and the whole thing\nbucked and shivered. It nearly hurled them off the stairs.\n“What the hell is that?” Commander Ironfist asked.\nNo one answered. No one knew. The green itself felt different suddenly,\nnot affecting all of them so much as being gathered elsewhere. Teia was\nholding a pair of binocles. Through them, she could see more than most.\n“It’s coming from the Great Pyramid,” she said. “Or going to it, I can’t tell.”\n“Is it a weapon?”\n“I don’t know!”\nMen were scrambling around the room, the gunners swabbing out the\nsmoking hot bronze barrel, cooling it and making sure no bits of burning\npowder remained in the breech that would ignite the charge. Others were\nweighing the powder for the next shot. The Blackguards who were tasked\nwith muscling the great thing back into place were taking a well-deserved\nrest. Though the carriage was wheeled, the culverin was still massive. Hezik\nwas staring alternately at a list of numbers he’d scribbled on a piece of\nparchment someone had passed him and down at the green island, lips\nmoving silently, doing mental sums.\nEverything was chaos, happening all at once.\n“There’s a green man on top of the tower,” the spotter on the long lens\ncalled out.\nWhatever was happening between the Great Pyramid and the bane was\ndefinitely helping the invaders. The tower was getting more massive by the\nsecond. “Why would the Atashians be helping the bane?” Teia asked.\n“Sir,” the spotter said, “if I didn’t know better—Sir, that thing is Atirat.”\n“Because the city has fallen,” Commander Ironfist said grimly. He\nwalked over to the spotter, who moved aside for him.\n“What?!” Hezik shouted to a Blackguard reporting to him. Not asking\nabout the city.\n“We didn’t see it before. It was at the bottom of the pile.” The\nBlackguard turned one of the shells over. The side was stove in, spilling all\nits powder out, and making it as effective in flight as a one-winged bird.\n“Commander,” Hezik said. “We’ve only got two shots left. One shell,\nand one ball. Which do you want us to load?”\nThey’d been shooting the shells, and Hezik had honed his accuracy\nthrough practice. He was now hitting within forty paces of where he aimed,\nand he had done much better than that twice. But Gavin and the others were\nalmost to the top of the tower. An exploding shell, that close? It would kill\nall of them.\nOn the other hand, the balls weighed more and flew differently. They’d\nshot a few of those earlier to get range before they started shooting the\nshells into the wights, but they hadn’t had as much practice.\nCommander Ironfist said, “Use the ball.”"

It’s not a matter of skill at this distance, sir. We’d have to get very\nlucky.”\nTeia had seen him shoot. He was being wildly optimistic.\nCommander Ironfist’s face didn’t shift. “I trust you. Use the ball. Kill\nthat god.”\nBy the time Kip reached the top of the tower, wheezing and so exhausted he\nthought he was going to vomit, the others were already fighting. The top of\nthe green spire was something between a tower and a tree. Twelve smaller\ntowers ringed it, like merlons on a crenellated wall. From each of those\nmerlons, a giant was emerging. Four of them were already out, fighting\nGavin, Karris, and the last Blackguard, Baya Niel.\nThe others were waking. Kip felt a shiver in the merlon next to him. The\ngiants within the merlons were still men, but men who’d descended so deep\ninto green that they’d rebuilt themselves, and the blasting green light from\nRu seemed to be helping. Even as Kip looked, he saw green skin covered\nwith tiny scales shimmer over the giant’s naked muscle on his arms. His\nchest was thickening, legs elongating.\nIn a paroxysm of revulsion, Kip stabbed his dagger into the creature.\nThe dagger punched through the cocoon like it was wet paper. The giant’s\ngreen, green eyes shot open, its mouth opened on the other side of the glass,\nand then it slumped and its eyes dimmed.\nSix of the giants were now out, fighting Gavin and Karris. One died as\nKip watched, its head wrapped in flames by Gavin and then taken off by\nBaya Niel. But the others were still emerging. It seemed that those who\nwere full in the green light from Ru had already awakened, but those who\nwere shaded from it by their merlons were slower.\nFor one second, Kip considered joining the fight in the middle. Gavin\nand Karris were doing their best to get to the middle of the tower, where the\ngreen light was focused and reflecting so brightly it hurt Kip’s eyes. The\nother giants were blocking Gavin and Karris from getting there. Gavin and\nKarris had their hands full. Kip would barely be a help to them—but he\ncould keep them from facing even worse odds.\nSo he ran around the edge of the tower instead, circling to the great\ncocoons. He rammed his dagger into another giant’s chest. As before, its\neyes opened, bulged, dimmed. Kip ran on. He stabbed a third. This one\npunched its fist through the cocoon and groped for Kip, but Kip pulled the\ndagger out and ducked. The giant crumpled, tearing through the cocoon and\nfalling on the ground in a splash of goo.\nThe next three cocoons were already empty, and as Kip ran toward the\nnext, his eyes lifted to the fort on Ruic Head, where he saw a flash of light"

One thousand one. One thousand two…\nKip didn’t have time to worry about it. As he ran toward one of the\nawakening giants, another came from the side to intercept him. More than\neight feet tall, this one had drafted a sword for his right arm. Green luxin\nshouldn’t hold an edge, but either different rules applied to the giants or it\nwouldn’t matter because getting hit with all the force in the giant’s massive\narm would tear Kip to pieces regardless, edge or no edge.\nFumbling with his lenses at his hip, Kip put the red spectacles on his\nface, intending to wreathe the big bastard in flames—but he’d put the wrong\nglasses on his face. Orange splattered harmlessly across the giant’s chest\nand it drew back its huge sword arm and roared, charging at full speed.\nKip threw orange at the ground and leapt hard to the side. He felt\nsomething whistle past his ear. The giant stomped right next to him, his foot\nsplattering in the slick orange luxin as he tried to change direction. His\nnonsword arm wheeled crazily and, slipping, he shot right off the edge of\nthe tower.\nKip watched him spin into space with grim satisfaction. Fat kids know\nhow hard it is to stop once you get up to a sprint.\nThe nearest merlon was empty.\nWithout warning, the empty merlon exploded in scraps and shrapnel of\ngreen luxin that hit the side of Kip’s face and his left arm like a swarm of\nhornets as the cannonball struck it.\nOne thousand six, I guess.\nStill standing, stunned, bewildered, and bleeding, Kip heard the delayed,\ndistant roar of the cannon. Those bastards up there really were trying to kill\nthem. If he had been two steps closer, he’d be dead.\nBut there was no time. Gavin was bleeding from a slash down his chest,\nand Karris was literally smoking as if she’d recently been on fire. Baya\nNiel’s nose was streaming blood. Several giants were dead on the ground\nbehind them, and the light at the center of the tower was dimming,\nrevealing a figure. That should be a good thing. Kip didn’t think it was. He\nran to the next merlon, stabbed the fully formed giant there, and ran on to\nthe last one.\nThis giant was awake, pulling herself out of the merlon, getting her\nbearings.\nKip leapt at her, slashing.\nThe giantess brought up her forearm and blocked the slash, her arm\ncatching Kip’s forearm. Kip’s momentum carried him forward into his own\nhands, his doubled fists smacking into his face.\nHe dropped at her feet, stunned, blood pouring into his eyes. He saw\ndeath in the giantess’s twisted visage.\n“A miss!” the spotter cried. “Fifteen paces long, twenty paces left. Tore off\na tower on the southeast. Nearly killed Breaker.”\nCurses went up, but there were no recriminations. Everyone knew that"

Everyone knew that\nmerely hitting the top of the tower from five thousand paces was an\nincredible feat. There was skill, and there was art, and there was simple\nluck. They were operating at the uttermost of the first two. The last couldn’t\nbe counted on.\nBut the crews didn’t slow. Men were already swabbing out the culverin.\nThe powder was already measured.\n“We’re certain that there’s no more shot?” Commander Ironfist asked.\n“Triple-checked, sir,” Hezik said. “Just the one explosive shell. If by\nsome miracle I hit the tower, it’ll kill all our people, too.”\nCommander Ironfist’s face was grim. A second passed. Everyone looked\nat him.\n“Load it.”\nA cannonball right about now would be nice, Kip thought, looking up at\nDeath.\nBut there was no shot. No rescue. Even if they fired a ball right now, it\nwould be six seconds before it saved Kip—and in six seconds, he’d be\ndead.\nHe flailed, slashed. His dagger punched into the giantess’s calf muscle.\nHe thought it was over then. He’d hurt her, but not badly, and now she\nwould kill him. But the giantess didn’t do anything. She stood as if locked\nin ice. Through the blood in one eye, Kip blinked up at her. She was\nblanching—literally desaturating from the head down as if he’d poked a\nstraw into her and was sucking out all the color. The green luxin that\ncovered her features was unraveling. Her green hair fell off, the green mask\nof perfection over her face drooped, sloughing off, dissipated in a smoke\nredolent of fresh cedar. Her jade eyes sank, her body shrank, deflating. In\nmoments, a woman with the rags of a dress torn by her recent huge size and\nnow draped over emaciated limbs stood over Kip. The broken green spars\nof her halos shimmered in the whites of her eyes and disappeared. The\ngreen in her irises shimmered and disappeared. Her skin was bleached to its\nnatural Ruthgari-pale hue.\nLimp, she fell across Kip, her motion tearing the dagger out of her\nbleeding calf.\nHe pushed himself up to his knees. She raised her hand as if to draft.\nKip slashed her throat, and she sighed. Her eyes rolled back in her head\nand she relaxed into death.\nShe’d raised her hand to draft, to kill Kip. He’d had to do it. Or had she\nraised her hand in supplication?\nThe green light from Ru went out.\n“Enough,” a voice said. It wasn’t loud, but it seemed to cut through\neverything. It shook Kip to his bones.\nThe dead woman forgotten, Kip looked to the center of the tower, where\na new god stood.\nAtirat, the queen of lasciviousness, the green goddess, the consort of\nheaven, the lady of moonlight, was supposed to be many things, some of\nthem contradictory.

Everywhere, luxin knit so thin it could be\nsilken cloth formed his skin. Long, intertwined figures were incised atop the\nvast hempen ropes of his muscles, seeming to copulate with every motion\nof his arms or legs. His hair, worn long, was a tapestry of vines and\nserpents. A gold choker around his throat held a single black jewel. As he\nmoved, his muscles split and slid past each other, revealing seams of scarlet\nthat might have been the bark of the red birch, or simply veins unprotected\nby his luxin skin. He was bare-chested, living vines forming a kilt. Moss\ncurled on his chest as hair, and leaves and grass bloomed and withered\nspontaneously on every surface.\nIt was so good, even Gavin couldn’t tell if it was real or illusion.\nThe god’s eyes were chips of flint, and he seemed lit from within, with\npower, with light, with magic, with life. Gavin supposed it all would have\nbeen far more impressive if he could see green. But something about the\nway he moved was familiar. Oh, Orholam have mercy. The spies had been\nright.\n“Dervani Malargos,” Gavin said. “Never thought I’d see you wearing a\ndress. I’d ask what you’ve been up to since the war, but I suppose I can\nprobably hazard a guess.” A cockroach emerged from the god’s armpit and\ndisappeared into his arm. “Nice beetle. Be careful of termites.”\nInside, Gavin’s heart was lead. He’d fought beside Dervani Malargos.\nHe, Dazen, not he Gavin. His mother had confessed to sending an assassin\nafter the man. Apparently the assassin had lied about his success. Dervani\nwas Tisis’s father. Either way, Dervani had no reason to love Gavin—nor,\ntruth be told, Dazen.\nDervani had been worth killing because he had known Dazen. He’d\nbeen there, right at the end at Sundered Rock. He might have seen\neverything. If Felia Guile had been right, he might unmask—\nBut then perhaps I should be more worried about him killing me now\nthan ruining my life in some hypothetical future.\nAtirat raised his hands and Gavin felt the giants behind him lifted and\npushed backward.\n“Gavin,” Karris said. “Gavin!” She was reloading her pistol, already\nfitting the lead ball in wadding and ramming it home. Though he couldn’t\nsee green, Gavin could see the darker thread of luxin from her eyes down to\nher hands. “Gavin,” she said, “I’m not doing this. Run!”\n“You won’t shoot me,” Gavin said.\n“Damn you! It’s not me!”\n“You’ll stay,” Atirat said in a voice like stones rolling together. Atirat\npointed a finger at Gavin and a spidery thread of luxin crawled up from the\nvery ground at his feet. Gavin batted it away. “What’s this?” Atirat laughed."

Gavin batted it away. “What’s this?” Atirat laughed.\n“So that’s how we’ve succeeded. You’ve lost green. You are a broken\nPrism, and yet you’ve held your office. I suppose I should thank you for\nyour stubborn pride, Guile. Thank you, and goodbye.”\nKarris raised her pistol like a marionette and fired at Gavin’s head.\nHe slapped her hand aside at the last moment. The bullet burned a crease\nalong his neck. Vines shot up his legs and he slashed at them with his\nsword, freeing himself. A cudgel the size of a tree limb blasted him off his\nfeet. Gavin rolled, stood, and found himself right at the edge of the tower.\nHe whirled his arms in circles.\nThe tower grew saplings with spear points at the edge. They stabbed at\nGavin. He dodged one, took another into the meat of his shoulder, and\ngrabbed another. When it pulled back, it pulled Gavin back, too.\nHe rolled on the ground, slashed the spears off near the ground, and ran.\nKarris was still rooted in her spot, reloading her pistol. The last\nBlackguard, Baya Niel, was similarly rooted to his spot—he, too, was\ngreen, and thereby susceptible to Atirat’s control, though mercifully he’d\nlost his pistols. The tower was trying to grab Gavin, even anticipating where\nhe was going to run and sprouting thorns. The remaining three giants were\nall standing sentinel, content to watch until ordered otherwise. Across the\ntower, Kip was staring wide-eyed by a dead woman. Gavin could only pray\nthat the boy had the sense to play dead. Kip could draft green, too.\nAnother tree trunk swept toward Gavin’s feet and he leapt over it. He\nthrew streams of fire toward Atirat, but couldn’t see whether they’d had any\neffect. He landed, jumped as two more thorn-spears tried to impale him. He\ntried to remember anything useful about Dervani Malargos.\nThere was no hint that Gavin’s fire had done anything. A throne was\nrising behind Dervani, and his hands were raised. Gavin slashed at the thorn\nspears, burned the vines that tried to entangle him. Rolled, dove, staggered\nleft and stutter-stepped right, throwing missiles and fire and blasts of pure\nheat, trying ever to work his way toward the god.\nThen the god cheated. The floor disappeared. The green luxin holding\nGavin up simply disappeared at his next step, and then reformed on every\nside of him. It pulled him back to the surface, locking every limb in an iron\nembrace.\nBut Gavin wasn’t helpless. Most drafters grew accustomed to drafting\nfrom their hands, the outlets forming at their wrists or fingertips. But you\ndidn’t have to do things the way drafters usually did.\nGavin split the skin all along his shoulders and arms and threw reds and\nsub-reds into the luxin holding him captive. It hissed and smoked and\nburned and for one second he pulled free, and then the green reformed.\nGavin threw everything into it, screaming and splitting skin along his arms,\ndown the sides of his chest, down his legs, and poured fire into his bonds."

He threw all the vast power of his will—into\nnothing.\nHe stared down at his hands. No luxin. What the hell?\nNo yellow.\nThe green shot up his legs and imprisoned him in a moment. Only then\ndid Gavin see his mistake. Atirat had drafted a bubble all the way around\nthe top of the tower. A thin, green, translucent bubble. A lens that blocked\nout every color Gavin could use.\nBut no lens was perfect, and Gavin wasn’t about to give up and die. He\ndrew in sub-red, but that only made the green around his hands smoke, and\nthe luxin grew back as fast as he could burn it. Drafting through that lens\nwas like breathing through a reed that was too long, too thin.\nGavin was too weak.\n“How does it feel, Gavin Guile? To be mortal, I mean. Surrounded by\nlight, and yet helpless?”\nGavin Guile. Not that it mattered now, but Dervani didn’t recognize\nhim. Felia Guile had tried to murder a man who actually wasn’t a threat—\nand because she had failed, he now actually was a threat.\nGavin’s wry smirk seemed to irritate the new god. “I thought you died,”\nGavin said. He’d seen Kip back there. Maybe the boy could make\nsomething happen if Gavin kept Atirat’s attention.\n“I very nearly did. There was a small conclave of us. Drafters who\nsurvived the war but were so damaged that you would force us to suicide.\nYou’d taken enough from us. We weren’t willing to die on your command.\nSo some of us learned to remake ourselves with light. The burned, the\nscarred, the amputees. We became new. Because light cannot be chained,\nGavin Guile.”\n“How did you—” Gavin started to ask. Kip was creeping on his hands\nand knees directly behind the throne that had blossomed for Atirat.\n“There is only one question, Gavin Guile,” Atirat said. “Do you want to\nbe killed by the woman, or the boy?”\nKip froze. “Father,” he said. “I can’t move.”\n“Gavin,” Karris said. Her teeth were gritted and there were tears in her\neyes as she fought the green luxin that suffused her body. “I can’t—I\ncan’t…”\n“I can make the shot,” Hezik said, tense, eager.\n“Making the shot means killing them all, you idiot!” Buskin shouted.\nHezik said, “We can’t save them! This is our only chance. It’s a god!”\nCommander Ironfist ignored both; words he thought he’d forgotten came\nunbidden to his lips: “Mighty Orholam, giver of light, see me now, hear my\ncry. In the hour of my darkness, I approach your throne.” The commander\nwatched himself say the words as if he were a bystander.

Ironfist took the smoking linstock and lit the fuse himself.\nThe roar filled the battery, and Ironfist swore every man counted the\nseconds.\n“I wish you could know what it’s like, Gavin,” the god said. “I can feel\nevery living, growing thing in the world. And my senses are only\nexpanding, second by second.”\nAtirat sounded drunk, but regardless, Kip couldn’t move. His muscles\nflexed and tightened at his command, but his bones themselves were locked\nin place. He’d almost made it. He’d almost saved them all. Kip Almost.\nGavin said something, but Kip couldn’t hear it. He saw Atirat tense,\nwarned by some sixth sense. He turned, and Kip saw the blast of smoke\nfrom the cannon from the fort on Ruic Head.\nOne thousand one.\nAtirat rolled his shoulders. Laughed. “Friends of yours?” he asked.\n“Don’t they know cannonballs are more likely to kill you than me? I should\nalmost let it land, just to see.” He raised his hands, aiming, as if he could\ntrack a ball through the air itself.\nOne thousand five.\n“Almost,” he said. Something shot out of Atirat’s hands and intercepted\nthe ball in midair, not twenty paces above them.\nHe hadn’t expected a shell.\nThe shell exploded with a thunderous roar and concussion that shook the\ntower. The green bubble covering the tower shattered. The giants were\nthrown off their feet. Kip was bowled over.\nKip scrambled as he landed on his face, reaching for the dagger.\nEveryone else reacted instantly. Kip heard the snap of Karris’s pistol going\noff, saw Gavin throw yellow spikes into each of the giants and straight at\nAtirat. Flames billowed off Gavin’s hands—\n—and were quenched.\nEven as his giants died, Atirat batted aside the attacks directed at him as\nif they were smoke. Hands left, right.

Kip heard\nbodies falling: the giants, robbed of form and life.\nKarris laughed and Kip realized how suddenly quiet it had grown up\nhere. He tucked the dagger away, stood.\n“Orholam’s beard, Kip,” Gavin said. “Well done.” At their feet lay a\nman—or some hideous thing that had been a man. Without the green luxin\nthat he had woven into every part of his body, Dervani Malargos was a\nskinless, hairless tangle of meat, brains, and blood oozing out of his\ndestroyed skull.\nThe tower shook and sank five paces suddenly, almost throwing them all\ninto the sea.\n“Does that mean that the entire island is about to collapse?” Karris\nasked.\n“Afraid so,” Gavin said.\n“I would think that’s really great,” Karris said. “If I weren’t about to fall\nto my death.”\nGavin laughed. “I can help with that. Get over here.”\nAnd the lovely, lovely sound of Gavin drafting filled Kip’s ears.\n“We did it!” Hizek shouted. “We saved them! I told you I could make that\nshot!”\nThe Blackguards were cheering, watching the great tower slump into the\nsea with no fear. Gavin Guile had stopped a god; they had no doubt he\nwould be able to escape a mere collapsing tower.\nBut Teia couldn’t take her eyes off Commander Ironfist, who stood stock\nstill. And then he dropped to his knees like a ton of bricks.\nTeia had never seen a man quite as big and frightening as Commander\nIronfist. She’d certainly never seen a man his size weep.\n“Elrahee, elishama, eliada, eliphalet,” he said, over and over, clearly\nsome Parian prayer. He fell on his knees and, seeing Teia’s bewildered look,\nsaid, “He sees me. He hears.

He knew\nhow to dry them with sub-red now, but after how much he’d drafted today,\nhe didn’t even want to see luxin, much less draft it. He was going to be\nlightsick tomorrow, he had no doubt. Gavin had been given new clothes and\nbandages for all his cuts immediately, of course. But then, that’s what being\nthe Prism gets you.\nThey sat on the deck for a long time in companionable silence. Gavin\ndismissed his exhausted Blackguards. The men who were guarding him\nnow had helped take the fort on Ruic Head and after fighting for hours had\nthen assisted the rescue efforts all day; they deserved the rest. From time to\ntime, men would come up to the Prism and congratulate him. Some even\ncongratulated Kip. Kip Godslayer, one called him. Kip didn’t appreciate it.\nHe was Godslayer only in the most technical sense. He’d delivered the final\nblow only because he’d been the least threat, only because he’d been\nbeneath notice.\nGavin simply said, “You do what you have to do, Kip. Let people call\nyou what they will. You can’t change it. People want heroes, and if every\nonce in a while that title sticks to you, just make sure you don’t believe in it\ntoo much yourself.” He shook his head, as if the words weren’t coming out\nright. “You were brave today, Kip. You lived up to the highest ideals of the\nBlackguard, and I’m proud of you.” He handed Kip the mulled wine.\nKip grimaced, taking it. It hadn’t been him. It had been the knife. He\nstill hadn’t told his father about the knife. He needed to. He’d been trying to\nwork up to it all afternoon.\nKarris came up to their brazier. She sat beside Gavin and put her hand\non his thigh. She smiled over at Kip. “Hey there, Godslayer,” she said. She\nwas teasing, but she meant it in a good way. Somehow, when she said it, it\nseemed nice. Kip mumbled evasions below his breath.\n“I really need to teach you to knife fight, though,” she said. “Sloppy\ntechnique, sloppy.” Again, kidding. But Kip grinned. It was the kind of\nribbing that told him she wanted to spend more time with him in the future.\nIt was about the nicest thing he could ask for.\n“I’m exhausted,” she said to Gavin. “I’m going to go below. You going\nto be an hour or so?”\n“Andross asked to speak with me, and the generals always have\nbusiness. We have to see if we can keep these bane from recurring,” Gavin\nsaid glumly. “At least an hour.”\n“I’m proud of you,” she said. “For this.”\nGavin seemed to know what she was talking about, but Kip didn’t. For\nsitting at a brazier with Kip?\n“Someone told me something about love once,” Gavin said. “Still\nsounds silly to me, but I’m giving it a shot.” He was teasing.\nKarris’s smile lit the deck. “I love you,” she said, her voice warmer and"

She had it bad.\n“Is there an action wedded to that choice?” Gavin asked.\n“I’m going to go below and sleep for a while,” she said. “But, uh, wake\nme.” She didn’t try very hard to hide her wink, and Kip blushed.\n“Mmm,” Gavin said appreciatively as she got up and left. He watched\nher go. “Kip,” he said. “If you ever find a woman like that… don’t be an\nidiot like your father.”\n“Yes, sir.” Kip grinned. “So… what happens now?”\n“You mean with the satrapies?”\nKip nodded.\n“We’ve lost two satrapies. Tyrea didn’t matter to the other satrapies, but\nAtash?” He shook his head. “I’m afraid we were so eager to avoid war,\nwe’ve made it all but certain.”\nHe said “we.” Even though Kip knew his father had fought for all he\nwas worth to get the Chromeria to move before it was too late, he still\nshared responsibility for the failure. His father, he decided again, was a\ngreat man.\nKip hadn’t had much time to think today, but he’d had enough. The\ndagger was important, as in Important. It had sucked the luxin right out of\nthat giant. Kip should have told his father about the knife immediately. But\nvolunteering to have his father mad at him seemed impossible.\nEvery time, just when things are going well, you open your big mouth,\nKip.\nBut at least usually it was an accident. This time he had to do it on\npurpose.\nHe was within a breath—or maybe a minute or two—of speaking when\na greasy voice said, “Sirs?” Grinwoody. “Luxlord Guile awaits your\npleasure. He heard you were topside and climbed up, with considerable\neffort to his person.”\n“Then where is he?” Kip asked. Oops. Kip the Lip. Maybe it was all this\nKip the Godslayer talk. Or maybe it was the mulled wine warming him.\n“On the stern castle, sirs. He only demanded the Lord Prism’s presence,\nhowever.”\n“You can come if you want to, Kip. But it won’t be pleasant,” Gavin\nsaid. “Father and I have some hard words to exchange.”\nGrinwoody’s mouth thinned to a tight line, but he said nothing.\n“I’d rather stay with you, sir,” Kip said.\nGavin and Kip climbed down, Kip having to take extra care on the steps.\nApparently he’d had more wine than he’d thought. They crossed the ship’s\nwaist and climbed up the steps to the stern castle.\nSomething about the scene tickled Kip’s memory. Andross Guile was\nturned away from them. There were only dim slivers of light from the\nmoon, penetrating the scattered clouds. Andross was wearing a cowl and\ndark-lensed spectacles. It hit Kip like a millstone.

The “-os” he’d been writing to could only be Koios White Oak,\nthe Color Prince, addressed by his first name. As one would address a\nfriend. Conspiring about Dagnu. The Red, conspiring about being made the\nred god. Andross Guile had made common cause with their enemy. And\nthere was more.\n“You’re a red wight,” Kip said quietly, almost to himself.\n“Gavin,” Andross said, either not noticing or not caring to notice what\nKip had said. “You’ve disobeyed me for the last time. I’ve started the\nprocess to strip you of your office. You should know I have the votes.\nYou’ve bullied the Spectrum for the last time.”\n“You’re a red wight,” Kip said again.\n“Kip,” Gavin said. “I think you’ve had too much wine. Why don’t you\n—”\n“You traitor!” Kip shouted at Andross. “You monster!”\n“Grinwoody, get the young drunkard out of here,” Andross said. “Now!”\nHe was a red wight. How couldn’t everyone see it? So maybe reds\nusually went insane in more conspicuous ways, but how could it have\ngotten past them? Did they just not dare to ask? Were they all too afraid,\nhoping someone else would take the risk first? Surely there should be ways\nto deal with old drafters who hid themselves away.\nBut the rules didn’t apply to Andross Guile. The rules never had. He was\nthe man whose mansion that he never even visited was taller than mansions\nwere allowed to be. He was the man who’d raised two sons who had\nbecome Prisms, who’d held on to a seat on the Spectrum without even\nbothering to go to the meetings. But he was no man; he was a monster.\nGrinwoody seized Kip by the front of his tunic and hauled him away.\nKip didn’t know what came over him. He broke Grinwoody’s hold, just as\nhe’d learned in his training, and stabbed his fingers for the man’s eyes.\nGrinwoody brought his hands up, palms forward. Kip snagged two of the\nman’s fingers with each hand and yanked down in a fingerlock.\nThe wiry old man dropped to his knees, surprised, and Kip kicked him\nin the chest, sending him flying, tumbling down the steep stairs to the ship’s\nwaist.\nKip charged Andross Guile to tear off his hood and spectacles, to show\nGavin what Kip was certain of.

Kip swept it aside and crunched into the old man and into\nGavin, who’d stepped in to intervene.\nKip tore the old man’s hood back and felt the knife cut along his ribs.\nAndross Guile was spitting fury, deep in the grip of red, attacking as fast as\nhe could, determined to kill.

Kip landed a punch on Andross’s\nface, then couldn’t reach him as Gavin wedged his shoulder in front of\nKip’s right arm. Another stab got through, piercing Kip’s left arm.\nAndross Guile’s spectacles, knocked askew by Kip’s punch, now fell off\nas the fury raged through him. He attacked like a madman. Gavin drove him\nback until all three hit the railing.\nA whistle was screeching, sailors were screaming, the muffled\npercussion of Blackguards’ boots coming up steps from the cabins\nbelowdecks. They’d never make it in time. Kip only saw Andross Guile’s\neyes—the halos broken, red throughout. A red wight.\nKip didn’t even remember drawing his own knife. Didn’t know how it\nhad gotten into his hand. Letting Gavin get between himself and Andross\nGuile, he swung his right hand out behind and around his father and stabbed\nthe old bastard. He caught him in the meat of the shoulder.\nThe old man’s eyes lit up. He screamed.\nSomething cracked across the back of Kip’s head and the weight of\nanother body joining the fray crushed them all against the railing. When\nKip turned, he saw it was Grinwoody. Grinwoody, old but Blackguard\ntrained. Two bare knives were in the middle of the circle between eight\ngrasping hands. The tangle of limbs became a momentary deadlock.\nKip’s knife was the longer by far, and while he was trying to keep\nAndross from stabbing him with the smaller knife, both Grinwoody and\nGavin looked to the longer blade at the same time. It was in a bad position.\nKip was straining it toward Andross, but if someone pushed it up and\ntwisted instead—Kip had no leverage to stop from impaling himself.\nIn a split second, Gavin’s eyes flicked up to Kip’s.

Peace.\nA flurry of motion as both Grinwoody and Gavin released their holds at\nthe same time.

The dagger slammed all the way to the hilt in his son’s\nchest.\nGavin’s mouth opened in a silent scream and even Andross drew back,\naghast. Gavin sagged against the railing. Then his eyes widened, and\nwidened again, as if something new was hurting him. And so it was. The\ndagger was growing.\nAndross Guile didn’t see it. He was pulling his cowl back over his face\nand picking up his spectacles. When he turned and saw a full-length sword\nthrough his son, he merely said, “The Blinder’s Knife. Excellent.\nGrinwoody, retrieve it.” Whatever momentary humanity had afflicted him,\nit was gone now.\nGavin’s face was a study of pain and betrayal. He was dying, and his\nown father was only worried about a knife.\nKip was rooted in place. His father had saved him, had sacrificed\nhimself—for Kip. It was so fast, he didn’t know whether to attack Andross\nagain or go to his father. It wouldn’t make any difference now, anyway.\nGavin pushed himself up on the railing that had been supporting him,\ntried to speak, but couldn’t. He glanced at Kip as if in apology, in farewell,\nthen pushed himself over the edge.\nHe splashed into the water in the darkness and was lost. The ship was\nstill under sail, a firm breeze helping them speed along steadily. The first\nyoung Blackguards reached the stern castle, spread out, bewildered, the\nsailors shouting, Grinwoody shouting and pointing in the wrong direction,\ndistracting, causing chaos, the whistle from the crow’s nest still shrilling.\nKip didn’t think, didn’t hesitate. He dove into the water.\nChapter 112\nThe water was cool and the light of the moon and stars did nothing to\npenetrate its depths. Under the surface, Kip could see nothing. He relaxed\nhis eyes and looked for heat.\nThere!\nKip swam. He wasn’t an accomplished swimmer, but though his target\nwas facedown and unmoving, Gavin wasn’t sinking yet.\nThat changed before Kip reached his father’s body. Gavin slipped\nbeneath the waves and Kip took one deep breath and managed to snag his\ntunic before he got too deep. Kip pulled him to the surface, nearly\nskewering himself on the sword still protruding from his father’s back.

Man overboard!” But he had no hope that the\nflagship was going to hear him. It was only now lighting up and beginning\nto turn. A ship of that size wasn’t going to get back to Kip for ten or fifteen\nminutes, if it ever found him at all. If any Blackguards had jumped into the\nwater after him, Kip couldn’t see them. More to the point, they wouldn’t be\nable to see him unless he was lucky enough to get a sub-red.\nKip tried to fight the panic clamping down on his chest. It made it hard\nto breathe. He took a wave at the wrong time and hacked and coughed to\nclear his lung, almost losing his father’s body. Dear Orholam. Dear\nOrholam, no.\nGavin Guile was dead. Dead. Dear Orholam, no. Father, why? Why’d\nyou do it?\nWhen he regained some calm, he realized he’d soaked up some light\nduring the fight. He hadn’t even been aware of it. He supposed that like his\ntesting, the fear and anger had dilated his eyes. He’d soaked up luxin\nwithout even being conscious of it.\nHe had a little red and a little yellow. There were other ships out here, he\nknew it. He just had to let them know he was here. Someone would save\nhim.\nAfter taking a deep breath, he shot sparkling yellow out of his finger.\nEven that small action pushed him under the waves and left him gasping.\nHe wondered if there were sharks. He wondered if sharks could smell\nluxin. He knew they could smell blood, and his father’s blood would be\ndrawing them.\nHe didn’t panic, though. He didn’t have anything left in him to panic\nwith. After a minute, he held up his hand and drafted red luxin around his\nfinger. With a few tries, he was able to light it with the yellow.\nBut he couldn’t hold it up and hold his father and swim. He tried to light\nit again after bobbing in the waves a bit, but too much had washed away.\nHe heard the ship before he saw it. It came up behind him and blocked\nout the light behind. A net was thrown over him, and within a minute, he\nand his father were pulled up, rolled onto the deck.\n“What have we? What have we?” A man started cackling. “Ceres!” he\nshouted. “Ceres, you fickle wench! You beautiful bitch, Gunner loves you!\nThank you! Apology accepted! Boys, gather ’round. See what Captain\nGunner’s luck has brought us.”\nKip was lying on his back, exhausted. All he had strength to do was\nbreathe.\nGunner? Kip’s thoughts were slow. Gunner was the man on the pirate\nship Gavin and Kip and Liv and Ironfist had sunk outside of Garriston,\nwasn’t he? Gavin had said he hadn’t killed the man because he was an\nartist. Was this the same man?"

Was this the same man?\nCaptain Gunner, a night-black Ilytian bare-chested under a waistcoat—a\ndifferent waistcoat than last time—rolled Gavin over as far as the\nprotruding blade allowed. It was the same Gunner. Oh hell. “Bugger me,”\nGunner said, looking at the blade. He tore it out of Gavin’s body and held it\naloft.\nKip’s blade was not what it had been. His knife was now a longsword.\nNo, more. The wide blade was three and a half feet long, and whiter than\nivory, single-edged with twin black whorls crisscrossing up the blade.\nBracketed by those black, twisting, living whorls, every one of those seven\njewels now burned with inner light, each one its own color from sub-red to\nsuperviolet. The spine of the blade was a thin musket, except for the last\nhand’s breadth, which was pure blade.\nGunner swung the blade back and forth. “Light,” he said. “Lighter than\nshould be possible.” But when he saw the musket, how the single cutout in\nthe blade was positioned to give space for fingers to steady the barrel, he\npositively chortled.\nThe sound of vomiting made Kip and Gunner both turn from their\ninspection of the blade. Murmurs shot through the crew as Gavin puked\nwater onto the deck.\nHe rolled over, gasping and coughing.\n“Alive? Take him below,” Gunner ordered. “Feed him, tend to his\nwounds, and bind him. Don’t let him escape. He’s a fighter.” The men lifted\nGavin and carried him belowdecks. Captain Gunner shouted again, “Ceres!\nCeres! I’m no miser! You share with me, I share with you. I could use this\nman.” He was talking about Kip, Kip realized. “He’s a drafter. You saw!\nYou know how bad I been wanting a drafter! Good drafter’s hard to find on\nthe sea, Ceres. But you done me right.”\nOh shit.\n“I do this, we call it straight between us? Fair? You gave me two. I’ll\ngive you one back!” Gunner said. “Boys?”\nHands descended. Kip tried to fight, but he only got a bloody nose for\nhis trouble. He was so weak there was no resisting. With a heave, the men\ntossed him back into the sea.\nHe surfaced in the darkness, hearing only the sweep of oars and the\ndistant sound of Gunner giving orders and laughing.\nKip swam, barely having the energy to keep floating on his back, out of\nlight, unable to draft, certain that someone would come.\nNo one did.\nChapter 113\nKoios White Oak the Color Prince came the next morning to the palace in\nwhich he’d installed Liv.

It would be weeks,\nprobably, until the city was pacified. The Color Prince was offering\nclemency to those rebels who laid down their arms in the next two days.\nThose who continued fighting would be subject to retributive rapes, the\nkilling of family members, and all the horrors his men could dream up. He\ndidn’t invent war, he said, and he would do anything to end it quickly.\nSharp, quick brutality was better, he said, than tolerating protracted\nlawlessness.\n“Did it work?” Liv asked.\n“Birthing Atirat?” the prince asked. “Oh yes. You succeeded\nmarvelously. The failure was Atirat’s own—and Zymun’s. We’ll retake the\nfort on Ruic Head tomorrow and perhaps we’ll learn what happened. It\nseems he did capture it, but he must have botched something, because they\nknew he had it. And then he lost it. If he lives, I don’t expect he’ll come\nback to camp. You’re free of him.”\nThat was a relief, though Liv felt weak for feeling it. She’d turned the\ntide of a battle, and she was afraid of a sniveling teenaged boy?\n“There’s more good news,” the prince said. “Aside from your\ntremendous success and us taking the city. Your father wasn’t fighting for\nthem.”\n“I know,” Liv said.\n“Has he been in communication with you?”\n“No.”\n“Then how do you know?” Koios White Oak asked.\n“Because we won.”\nThe prince laughed, but Liv could tell her answer peeved him. “Let us\nhope we never have to test your confidence in his abilities, then. But there’s\nmore. Can you feel it?”\nHe meant magically. “No. I don’t have your senses,” Liv said.\n“The Prism is dead. The colors are free.”\n“I don’t understand,” Liv said. She felt sick. Her senses had been shut\noff as soon as Atirat had taken shape. She’d missed the climax of the battle,\nand she’d hoped that somehow she’d been wrong, that Kip and Karris and\nGavin had lived.\n“This…” Koios swept a hand toward the bay. “This was a setback. The\nbane rise spontaneously, Aliviana. All we need to do is wait, and there will\nbe another. Another blue, another green, another one of every color, now.”\nShe looked over at him sharply. No wonder he wasn’t very upset.\n“It will take time, but they can’t stop us now, Liv. The only trick for us\nis to make sure that as each bane rises, a drafter we trust is at the center of\nit.”\n“A drafter we trust? You mean that any drafter can…” She’d seen Atirat\natop the bane, of course, but—Dervani Malargos?\n“Any sufficiently talented drafter, yes. In centuries past, it led to\nbloodbaths, as every green would tear every other apart, each in their quest\nto become a god. And then the gods would war with each other.

So tell me, can you now guess what it is?”\nChapter 114\nAndross Guile stood in his cabin, examining himself. He stood, shirtless,\nwith no hood, no cowl, no dark spectacles, the curtains open. He looked at\nhis hands, his arms, and then, last, he looked at his eyes. The broken red\nhalo he’d been hiding for months was gone. He still had all his colors—sub-\nred, red, orange, and yellow—entwined halfway through the irises of his\nshocking blue eyes, but they were in balance now.\nHe’d seen the Blinder’s Knife work before—and it didn’t work like this.\nThat knife killed. But when he looked at his shoulder, it was flawless, not\neven the skin broken. He looked at his eyes again, certain it was some trick.\nBut there the halo was, stable. And he felt hale. He felt better than he’d felt\nin fifteen years, twenty. He’d had to sink into his own discipline in order to\nkeep the red from driving him mad—and at the end there, he wasn’t sure he\nwas winning.\nNow he was simply a drafter again. A polychrome with a good ten years\nleft in his eyes.\nThis, this changed everything.\nSometime not long before dawn, Kip washed ashore. He couldn’t take\ncredit for swimming in. He’d barely had the strength to float and breathe for\nthe last few hours. He crawled far enough up the sand not to get pulled out\nto sea and collapsed like a beached whale.\nHe woke to someone picking at his pockets, around noon. He\nfloundered, slapping their hands away, afraid he was under attack. He sat\nup, and saw that there were at least a dozen bodies washed up on the beach\naround him.\nThe looter started laughing. Kip blinked up at him, but the young man\nhad the blinding noonday sun burning over his shoulder. He was dressed in\na dirty white tunic and cloak adorned with many bands of color. He also had\na pistol dangling from his hand.\n“Oho, I stopped at the right beach, didn’t I?” the young man said.\n“Lucky, aren’t I?”\nKip looked down the beach and saw the young man’s dinghy on the\nbeach. He must have seen all the dead from the water and decided to loot\nwhat he could. Kip was thirsty. “You have any water?” he croaked.\n“In the boat. Food, too.”\nKip stood with difficulty. The young man didn’t help him up. Then it hit\nhim. He knew that voice. He squinted against the brightness. “Oh no,” he\nsaid.\n“Bit slow, aren’t ya?” Zymun said.

On the bright side, it wasn’t broken. He stood slowly, walked\nover to the dinghy. He halfway emptied the skin. He had a headache that he\nthought was a hangover. He hadn’t had one of those before. Plus he was\nlightsick. Every part of his body hurt. He had a gash along his ribs and his\nleft arm was throbbing from being stabbed.\nKip considered attacking Zymun, who was rubbing his hand: punching\nKip had hurt his fist. But Zymun had a gun. He would see if Kip tried to\ndraft—which right now sounded as appetizing as gargling sewage—and\nKip was feeling about as agile as a hundred-and-twelve-year-old man. Kip\nhad seen the boy draft, long ago. He had no doubt that Zymun had the will\nto use that pistol. He got in the boat.\n“Take off that belt and give it to me. Then tear off a strip of your shirt\nand tie it around your eyes,” Zymun said. “Slowly.”\nKip did both. He felt Zymun push the dinghy into the water. Kip lunged\nforward, tearing off his blindfold.\nZymun was clinging to the prow with one hand, bobbing in the water,\nhalfway to climbing into the boat, and he had the pistol leveled at Kip’s\nface. “Back. Back!” he said. “I can’t hold on here for long, so if you’re not\nseated and blindfolded in five seconds, I’m going to put a bullet in your\nface.”\nSettling back onto his bench, Kip pulled the blindfold back up, defeated.\nHe’d almost done it. Almost. The cloak of failure draped easily around his\nslumped shoulders. Kip Almost. Again.\nNo. That wasn’t true. He wasn’t that Kip anymore. He wasn’t stupid. He\nwasn’t weak. He wasn’t a coward. He wasn’t rejected.\nHe had gotten into the Blackguard. He had been accepted by the best\ndrafters and fighters in the world. He had been accepted by his father. He\nhad fought a king and wights and a god. He’d made huge mistakes: he’d\nbeen stupid and weak and cowardly and rejected. Without him, his father\nwouldn’t have been stabbed. But he also had pulled his father from the\nwaves, had saved his life when no one else could. Kip had donned Almost\nas his spectacles. There was a middle path, a golden mean between the\nwhore’s son and the Prism’s. He wasn’t really Kip Godslayer, but he also\nwasn’t the boy who’d knuckled under to Ramir. Not anymore.

His left arm did not appreciate it. “Brother?” he\nasked. His voice came out calm, unafraid, unashamed.\n“My grandfather Andross Guile’s summoned me to the Chromeria. He\nsaid the rest of his family hadn’t turned out. Said he’s considering adopting\nme. Said he has big plans.” He paused. “What, didn’t you know? I’m Karris\nand Gavin’s son.

Then Zymun barked a\nlaugh. “Holy fuck am I lucky,” he said to himself. “Would you look at that?\nThis gun wasn’t even loaded.”\nChapter 115\nGavin woke to someone slapping his face. He felt awful. The cabin was\ndark and stank of men who hadn’t washed in ages and bilgewater and\nseaweed and fish and human waste. There were manacles on his wrists, and\nhe was naked except for a breechclout.\nAnother slap cracked across his cheek, hard enough to put the taste of\nblood in his mouth. He opened his eyes. He looked at the man in front of\nhim. His lungs and throat felt raw from the seawater he’d tried to breathe.\n“Gunner, you son of a bitch,” Gavin said. His voice was raw, too. Last\nnight was a dim memory. “What are you doing?”\n“Can’t draft, can ya?”\nGavin held up his hands, empty, helpless. It was so dim in the cabin it\nwould take him a couple of minutes to draft enough to be a threat to\nanyone. And summoning the will would be a problem, too, with how\nterrible he felt.\n“Give me a couple minutes,” he said. His left eye was swollen. There\nwas—Oh, Orholam! Gavin checked his chest. It was uninjured. What the\nhell kind of nightmares had he been having? Thinking he’d been stabbed?\nHad he been drugged and smuggled off the flagship?\n“Your eyes are as blue as Ceres’s, Lord Guile. Not a touch of halo in\n’em. Always hated luxlords putting on airs. Ordering people around. Not\nwilling to pull their own weight.” He laughed low, as if he’d said something\nclever. “But I gots my own solution to the little injustices life brings under\nmy purview. It ain’t quite the ship of state, but she is a stately ship, is she\nno?”\n“This your boat?” Gavin asked, still disoriented.

Or you get a whipping.”\n“Orholam damn you, don’t you know who I am?!” It had been almost\ntwo decades since Gunner had worked for Gavin. Maybe time had changed\nhim too much for the man to recognize him without his rich clothes.\nGunner grinned. “He who asks, ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ is the one\nwho doesn’t know the answer. But here’s the thing, Gavin Guile. I’m going\nto give you the opportunity to find out.”\n“Not Gavin,” Gavin said defiantly. “Dazen.

He didn’t resist, for in the open door he’d seen\nsomething worse than bondage. In the dim near-night of the reeking cabin,\nhe hadn’t noticed: colors were always muted by darkness. But with the\nopening of that door, with the sky and the birds and sails, and the pure\npuissant light that Gavin had been waiting to soak up to use to break these\nchains and escape, he saw something worse. He couldn’t split the colors\nfrom that pure white light. He couldn’t split the colors because he couldn’t\ndraft the colors. He couldn’t draft the colors because he couldn’t see the\ncolors. The ignorant speak of subchromacy as color-blindness, when it\nreally is only color confusion.\nBut Gavin was color-blind. All the world was gray. It was as Gunner had\ntried to tell him. In one instant, everything that was special about Gavin\nGuile had been stripped away. He not only wasn’t the Prism anymore, he\nwasn’t even a drafter. The door to the deck slapped closed, and chains\nrattled through the handles, trapping Gavin in a blacker darkness than any\nhe had ever known.\nAcknowledgments\nFrom millimeter waves to martial artists to Magic: The Gathering, I needed\na lot of help with this one.

Deal?\n—Brent Weeks\nBooks by Brent Weeks:\nPerfect Shadow (e-only novella)\nTHE NIGHT ANGEL TRILOGY\nThe Way of Shadows\nShadow’s Edge\nBeyond the Shadows\nNight Angel (omnibus)\nTHE LIGHTBRINGER SERIES\nThe Black Prism\nThe Blinding Knife\nAppendix\nOn Monochromes, Bichromes, and Polychromes\nMost drafters are monochromes: they are able to draft only one color.\nDrafters who can draft two colors well enough to create stable luxin in both\ncolors are called bichromes. Anyone who can draft solid luxin in three or\nmore colors is called a polychrome. The more colors a polychrome can\ndraft, the more powerful she is and the more sought after are her services. A\nfull-spectrum polychrome is a polychrome who can draft every color in the\nspectrum. A Prism is always a full-spectrum polychrome.\nMerely being able to draft a color, though, isn’t the sole determining\ncriterion in how valuable or skilled a drafter is. Some drafters are faster at\ndrafting, some are more efficient, some have more will than others, some\nare better at crafting luxin that will be durable, some are smarter or more\ncreative at how and when to apply luxin.\nOn Disjunctive Bichromes/Polychromes\nOn the light continuum, sub-red borders red, red borders orange, orange\nborders yellow, yellow borders green, green borders blue, blue borders\nsuperviolet. Most bichromes and polychromes simply draft a larger\nspectrum on the continuum than monochromes. That is, a bichrome is most\nlikely to draft two colors that are adjacent to each other (blue and\nsuperviolet, red and sub-red, yellow and green, etc.). However, some few\ndrafters are disjunctive bichromes. As could be surmised from the name,\nthese are drafters whose colors do not border each other. Usef Tep was a\nfamous example: he drafted red and blue. Karris White Oak is another,\ndrafting green and red. It is unknown how or why disjunctive bichromes\ncome to exist. It is only known that they are rare.\nOn Outer-Spectrum Colors\nThere is a small and controversial movement claiming that there are more\nthan seven colors. Indeed, because colors exist on a continuum, one could\nargue that the number of colors is infinite. However, the argument that there\nare more than seven draftable colors is more theologically problematic for\nsome. It is commonly accepted that there are other resonance points beyond\nthe seven currently accepted ones, but those points are weaker and much\nmore rarely drafted than the core seven. Among the contenders is one color\nfar below the sub-red, called paryl. Another equally far above superviolet is\ncalled only chi.\nBut if colors are to be so broadly defined as to include colors only one\ndrafter in a million can draft, then shouldn’t yellow be split into liquid\nyellow and solid yellow? Where do the (mythical) black and white luxins"

        "text": "drafter in a million can draft, then shouldn’t yellow be split into liquid\nyellow and solid yellow? Where do the (mythical) black and white luxins\nfit? How could such (non)colors even fit on the spectrum?\nThe arguments, though bitter, are academic.\nOn Subchromacy and Superchromacy\nA subchromat is one who has trouble differentiating between at least two\ncolors, colloquially referred to as being color-blind. Subchromacy need not\ndoom a drafter. For instance, a blue drafter who cannot distinguish between\nred and green will not be significantly handicapped in his work.\nSuperchromacy is having greater than usual ability to distinguish\nbetween fine variations of color. Superchromacy in any color will result in\nmore stable drafting, but is most helpful in drafting yellow. Only\nsuperchromat yellow drafters can hope to draft solid yellow luxin.\nOn Luxin (with sections on physics, metaphysics, effects on personality,\nlegendary colors, and colloquial terms)\nThe basis of magic is light. Those who use magic are called drafters. A\ndrafter is able to transform a color of light into a physical substance. Each\ncolor has its own properties, but the uses of those building blocks are as\nboundless as a drafter’s imagination and skill.\nThe magic in the Seven Satrapies functions roughly the opposite of a\ncandle burning. When a candle burns, a physical substance (wax) is\ntransformed into light. With chromaturgy, light is transformed into a\nphysical substance, luxin. Each color of luxin has its own properties. If\ndrafted correctly (within a tight allowance), the resulting luxin will be\nstable, lasting for days or even years, depending on its color.\nMost drafters (magic-users) can only use one color. A drafter must be\nexposed to the light of her color to be able to draft it (that is, a green drafter\ncan look at grass and be able to draft, but if she’s in a white-walled room,\nshe can’t). Each drafter usually carries spectacles so that if her color isn’t\navailable, she can still use magic.\nP\nHYSICS\nLuxin has weight. If a drafter drafts a luxin haycart over her head, the first\nthing it will do is crush her. From heaviest to lightest are: red, orange,\nyellow, green, blue, sub-red,* superviolet, sub-red.* For reference, liquid\nyellow luxin is only slightly lighter than the same volume of water.\n(*Sub-red is difficult to weigh accurately because it rapidly degenerates\nto fire when exposed to air. The ordering above was achieved by putting\nsub-red luxin in an airtight container and then weighing the result, minus\nthe weight of the container. In real-world uses, sub-red crystals are often\nseen floating upward in the air before igniting.)\nLuxin has tactility.\nSub-red: Again the hardest to describe due to its flammability, but\noften described as feeling like a hot wind.\nRed: Gooey, sticky, clingy, depending on drafting; can be tarry and\nthick or more gel-like.\nOrange: Lubricative, slippery, soapy, oily.\nYellow: In its liquid, more common state, like bubbly, effervescent\nwater, cool to the touch, possibly a little thicker than seawater.

        "text": "Orange: Lubricative, slippery, soapy, oily.\nYellow: In its liquid, more common state, like bubbly, effervescent\nwater, cool to the touch, possibly a little thicker than seawater. In its\nsolid state, it is perfectly slick, unyielding, smooth, and incredibly\nhard.\nGreen: Rough: depending on the skill and purposes of the drafter,\nranges from merely having a grain like leather to feeling like tree\nbark. It is flexible, springy, often drawing comparisons to the green\nlimbs of living trees.\nBlue: Smooth, though poorly drafted blue will have a texture or can\nshed fragments easily, like chalk, but in crystals.\nSuperviolet: Like spidersilk, thin and light to the point of\nimperceptibility.\nLuxin has scent. The base scent of luxin is resinous. The smells below are\napproximate, because each color of luxin smells like itself. Imagine trying\nto describe the smell of an orange. You’d say citrus and sharp, but that isn’t\nit exactly. An orange smells like an orange. However, the below\napproximations are close.\nSub-red: Charcoal, smoke, burned.\nRed: Tea leaves, tobacco, dry.\nOrange: Almond.\nYellow: Eucalyptus and mint.\nGreen: Fresh cedar, resin.\nBlue: Mineral, chalk, almost none.\nSuperviolet: Faintly like cloves.\n*Black: No smell/or smell of decaying flesh.\n*White: Honey, lilac.\n(*Mythical; these are the smells as reported in stories.)\nM\nETAPHYSICS\nAny drafting feels good to the drafter. Sensations of euphoria and\ninvincibility are particularly strong among young drafters and those drafting\nfor the first time. Generally, these pass with time, though drafters abstaining\nfrom magic for a time will often feel them again. For most drafters, the\neffect is similar to drinking a cup of kopi. Some drafters, strangely enough,\nseem to have allergic reactions to drafting. There are vigorous ongoing\ndebates about whether the effects on personality should be described as\nmetaphysical or physical.\nRegardless of their correct categorization and whether they are the\nproper realm of study for the magister or the luxiat, the effects themselves\nare unquestioned.\nL E P\nUXIN’S FFECTS ON ERSONALITY\nThe benighted before Lucidonius believed that passionate men became\nreds, or that calculating women became yellows or blues. In truth, the\ncausation flows the other way.\nEvery drafter, like every woman, has her own innate personality. The\ncolor she drafts then influences her toward the behaviors below. A person\nwho is impulsive who drafts red for years is going to be more likely to be\npushed farther into “red” characteristics than a naturally cold and orderly\nperson who drafts red for the same length of time.\nThe color a drafter uses will affect her personality over time. This,\nhowever, doesn’t make her a prisoner of her color, or irresponsible for her\nactions under the influence of it. A green who continually cheats on his wife\nis still a lothario. A sub-red who murders an enemy in a fit of rage is still a\nmurderer. Of course, a naturally angry woman who is also a red drafter will"

Of course, a naturally angry woman who is also a red drafter will\nbe even more susceptible to that color’s effects, but there are many tales of\ncalculating reds and fiery, intemperate blues.\nA color isn’t a substitute for a woman. Be careful in your application of\ngeneralities. That said, generalities can be useful: a group of green drafters\nis more likely to be wild and rowdy than a group of blues.\nGiven these generalities, there is also a virtue and a vice commonly\nassociated with each color. (Virtue being understood by the early luxiats not\nas being free of temptation to do evil in a particular way, but as conquering\none’s own predilection toward that kind of evil. Thus, gluttony is paired\nwith temperance, greed with charity, etc.)\nSub-red drafters: Sub-reds are passionate in all ways, the most purely\nemotional of all drafters, the quickest to rage or to cry. Sub-reds\nlove music, are often impulsive, fear the dark less than any other\ncolor, and are often insomniacs. Emotional, distractable,\nunpredictable, inconsistent, loving, bighearted. Sub-red men are\noften sterile.\nAssociated vice: Wrath\nAssociated virtue: Patience\nRed drafters: Reds are quick-tempered, lusty, and love destruction.\nThey are also warm, inspiring, brash, larger than life, expansive,\njovial, and powerful.\nAssociated vice: Gluttony\nAssociated virtue: Temperance\nOrange drafters: Oranges are often artists, brilliant in understanding\nother people’s emotions and motivations. Some use this to defy or\nexceed expectations. Sensitive, manipulative, idiosyncratic, slippery,\ncharismatic, empathetic.\nAssociated vice: Greed\nAssociated virtue: Charity\nYellow drafters: Yellows tend to be clear thinkers, with intellect and\nemotion in perfect balance. Cheerful, wise, bright, balanced,\nwatchful, impassive, observant, brutally honest at times, excellent\nliars. Thinkers, not doers.\nAssociated vice: Sloth\nAssociated virtue: Diligence\nGreen drafters: Greens are wild, free, flexible, adaptable, nurturing,\nfriendly. They don’t so much disrespect authority as not even\nrecognize it.\nAssociated vice: Lust\nAssociated virtue: Self-control\nBlue drafters: Blues are orderly, inquisitive, rational, calm, cold,\nimpartial, intelligent, musical. Structure, rules, and hierarchy are\nimportant to them. Blues are often mathematicians and composers.\nIdeas and ideology and correctness often matter more than people to\nblues.\nAssociated vice: Envy\nAssociated virtue: Kindness\nSuperviolet drafters: Superviolets tend to have a removed outlook;\ndispassionate, they appreciate irony and sarcasm and word games\nand are often cold, viewing people as puzzles to be solved or ciphers\nto be cracked. Irrationality outrages superviolets.\nAssociated vice: Pride\nAssociated virtue: Humility\nL C\nEGENDARY OLORS\nChi (pronounced KEY): The postulated upper-spectrum counter-part\nto paryl.

(Often referred to in tales as “far above superviolet as paryl\nis below sub-red.”) Also called the revealer. Its main claimed use is\nnearly identical to paryl—seeing through things, though those who\nbelieve in chi say its powers far surpass paryl’s in this regard,\ncutting through flesh and bone and even metal. The only thing the\ntales seem to agree on is that chi drafters have the shortest life\nexpectancy of any drafters: five to fifteen years, almost without\nexception. If chi indeed exists, it would mostly be evidence that\nOrholam created light for the universe or for his own purposes, and\nnot solely for the use of man, and would move theologians from\ntheir current anthropocentrism.\nBlack: Destruction, void, emptiness, that which is not and cannot be\nfilled. Obsidian is said to be the bones of black luxin after it dies.\nParyl: Also called spidersilk, it is invisible to all but paryl drafters. It\nresides as far down the spectrum from sub-red as most sub-red does\nfrom the visible spectrum. Believed mythical because the lens of the\nhuman eye cannot contort to a shape that would allow seeing such a\ncolor. The alleged color of dark drafters and night weavers and\nassassins because this spectrum is (again, allegedly) available even\nat night. Uses unknown, but linked to murders. Poisonous?\nWhite: The raw word of Orholam. The stuff of creation, from which\nall luxin and all life was formed. Descriptions of an earthly form of\nthe stuff (as diminished from the original as obsidian supposedly is\nfrom black luxin) describe it as radiant ivory, or pure white opal,\nemitting light on the whole spectrum.\nC T\nOLLOQUIAL ERMS\nStudents at the Chromeria are encouraged to use the proper names for each\ncolor, but the impetus to name seems unstoppable. In some cases, the names\nare used technically: pyrejelly is a thicker, longer-burning draft of red that\nwill burn long enough to reduce a body to ash. In other cases, the reference\nbecomes precisely the opposite of the technical definition: brightwater was\nfirst a name for liquid yellow luxin, but Brightwater Wall is solid yellow\nluxin.\nA few of the more common colloquialisms:\nSub-red: Firecrystal\nRed: Pyrejelly, burnglue\nOrange: Noranjell\nYellow: Brightwater\nGreen: Godswood\nBlue: Frostglass, glass\nSuperviolet: Skystring, soulstring, spidersilk\nBlack: Hellstone, nullstone, nightfiber, cinderstone, hadon\nWhite: Truebright, starsblood, anachrome, luciton\nOn the Old Gods\nSub-red: Anat, goddess of wrath. Those who worshipped her are said\nto have had rituals that involved infant sacrifice. Also known as the\nLady of the Desert, the Fiery Mistress. Her centers of worship were\nTyrea, southernmost Paria, and southern Ilyta.\nRed: Dagnu, god of gluttony. He was worshipped in eastern Atash.\nOrange: Molokh, god of greed.

Her center of worship was primarily in\nwestern Ruthgar and most of Blood Forest.\nBlue: Mot, god of envy. His center of worship was in eastern Ruthgar,\nnortheastern Paria, and Abornea.\nSuperviolet: Ferrilux, god of pride. His center of worship was in\nsouthern Paria and northern Ilyta.\nOn Technology and Weapons\nThe Seven Satrapies are in a time of great leaps in understanding. The peace\nsince the Prisms’ War and the following suppression of piracy has allowed\nthe flow of goods and ideas freely through the satrapies. Cheap, high-\nquality iron and steel are available in every satrapy, leading to high-quality\nweapons, durable wagon wheels, and everything in between. Though\ntraditional forms of weapons like Atashian bich’hwa or Parian parry-sticks\ncontinue, now they are rarely made of horn or hardened wood. Luxin is\noften used for improvised weapons, but most luxins’ tendency to break\ndown after long exposure to light, and the scarcity of yellow drafters who\ncan make solid yellows (which don’t break down in light), means that metal\nweapons predominate among mundane armies.\nThe greatest leaps are occurring in the improvement of firearms. In most\ncases, each musket is the product of a different smith. This means each man\nmust be able to fix his own firearm, and that pieces must be crafted\nindividually. A faulty hammer or flashpan can’t be swapped out for a new\none, but must be detached and reworked into appropriate shape. Some\nlarge-scale productions with hundreds of apprentice smiths have tried to\ntackle this problem in Rath by making parts as nearly identical as possible,\nbut the resulting matchlocks tend to be low quality, trading accuracy and\ndurability for consistency and simple repair. Elsewhere, the smiths of Ilyta\nhave gone the other direction, making the highest-quality custom muskets\nin the world. Recently, they’ve pioneered a form they call the flintlock.\nInstead of affixing a burning slow match to ignite powder in the flashpan\nand thence into the breech of the rifle, they’ve affixed a flint that scrapes a\nfrizzen to throw sparks directly into the breech. This approach means a\nmusket or pistol is always ready to fire, without a soldier having to first\nlight a slow match. Keeping it from widespread adoption is the high rate of\nmisfires—if the flint doesn’t scrape the frizzen correctly or throw sparks\nperfectly, the firearm doesn’t fire.\nThus far, the combination of luxin with firearms has been largely\nunsuccessful. The casting of perfectly round yellow luxin musket balls was\npossible, but the small number of yellow drafters able to make solid yellow\ncreates a bottleneck in production. Blue luxin musket balls often shatter\nfrom the force of the black powder explosion. An exploding shell made by\nfilling a yellow luxin ball with red luxin (which would ignite explosively"

An exploding shell made by\nfilling a yellow luxin ball with red luxin (which would ignite explosively\nfrom the shattering yellow when the ball hit a target) was demonstrated to\nthe Nuqaba, but the exact balance of making the yellow thick enough to not\nexplode inside the musket, but thin enough to shatter when it hit its target, is\nso difficult that several smiths have died trying to replicate it, probably\nbarring this technique from wide adoption.\nOther experiments are doubtless being carried out all over the Seven\nSatrapies, and once high-quality, consistent, and somewhat accurate\nfirearms are introduced, the ways of war will change forever.
