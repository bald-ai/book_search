        "text": "hundred times—during the day. Tonight, his purpose was grimmer.\nReaching the top of the hill, Kip stood and hiked up his pants. The\nriver behind him was hissing, or maybe that was the warriors beneath its\nsurface, dead these sixteen years. He squared his shoulders, ignoring his\nimagination. The mists made him seem suspended, outside of time. But\neven if there was no evidence of it, the sun was coming. By the time it did,\nhe had to get to the far side of the battlefield. Farther than he’d ever gone\nsearching.\nEven Ramir wouldn’t come out here at night. Everyone knew\nSundered Rock was haunted. But Ram didn’t have to feed his family; his\nmother didn’t smoke her wages.\nGripping his little belt knife tightly, Kip started walking. It wasn’t just\nthe unquiet dead that might pull him down to the evernight. A pack of giant\njavelinas had been seen roaming the night, tusks cruel, hooves sharp. They\nwere good eating if you had a matchlock, iron nerves, and good aim, but\nsince the Prisms’ War had wiped out all the town’s men, there weren’t many\npeople who braved death for a little bacon. Rekton was already a shell of\nwhat it had once been. The alcaldesa wasn’t eager for any of her\ntownspeople to throw their lives away. Besides, Kip didn’t have a\nmatchlock.\nNor were javelinas the only creatures that roamed the night. A\nmountain lion or a golden bear would also probably enjoy a well-marbled\nKip.\nA low howl cut the mist and the darkness hundreds of paces deeper\ninto the battlefield. Kip froze. Oh, there were wolves too. How’d he forget\nwolves?\nAnother wolf answered, farther out. A haunting sound, the very voice\nof the wilderness. You couldn’t help but freeze when you heard it. It was the\nkind of beauty that made you shit your pants.\nWetting his lips, Kip got moving. He had the distinct sensation of\nbeing followed. Stalked. He looked over his shoulder. There was nothing\nthere. Of course. His mother always said he had too much imagination. Just\nwalk, Kip. Places to be. Animals are more scared of you and all that.\nBesides, that was one of the tricks about a howl, it always sounded much\ncloser than it really was. Those wolves were probably leagues away.\nBefore the Prisms’ War, this had been excellent farmland. Right next to\nthe Umber River, suitable for figs, grapes, pears, dewberries, asparagus—\neverything grew here. And it had been sixteen years since the final battle—a\nyear before Kip was even born. But the plain was still torn and scarred. A\nfew burnt timbers of old homes and barns poked out of the dirt. Deep\nfurrows and craters remained from cannon shells. Filled now with swirling\nmist, those craters looked like lakes, tunnels, traps. Bottomless.\nUnfathomable.\nMost of the magic used in the battle had dissolved sooner or later in\nthe years of sun exposure, but here and there broken green luxin spears still\nglittered. Shards of solid yellow underfoot would cut through the toughest\nshoe leather."

        "text": "the years of sun exposure, but here and there broken green luxin spears still\nglittered. Shards of solid yellow underfoot would cut through the toughest\nshoe leather.\nScavengers had long since taken all the valuable arms, mail, and luxin\nfrom the battlefield, but as the seasons passed and rains fell, more mysteries\nsurfaced each year. That was what Kip was hoping for—and what he was\nseeking was most visible in the first rays of dawn.\nThe wolves stopped howling. Nothing was worse than hearing that\nchilling sound, but at least with the sound he knew where they were.\nNow… Kip swallowed on the hard knot in his throat.\nAs he walked in the valley of the shadow of two great unnatural hills\n—the remnant of two of the great funeral pyres where tens of thousands had\nburned—Kip saw something in the mist. His heart leapt into his throat. The\ncurve of a mail cowl. A glint of eyes searching the darkness.\nThen it was swallowed up in the roiling mists.\nA ghost. Dear Orholam. Some spirit keeping watch at its grave.\nLook on the bright side. Maybe wolves are scared of ghosts.\nKip realized he’d stopped walking, peering into the darkness. Move,\nfathead.\nHe moved, keeping low. He might be big, but he prided himself on\nbeing light on his feet. He tore his eyes away from the hill—still no sign of\nthe ghost or man or whatever it was. He had that feeling again that he was\nbeing stalked. He looked back. Nothing.\nA quick click, like someone dropping a small stone. And something at\nthe corner of his eye. Kip shot a look up the hill. A click, a spark, the\nstriking of flint against steel.\nThe mists illuminated for that briefest moment, Kip saw few details.\nNot a ghost—a soldier striking a flint, trying to light a slow-match. It caught\nfire, casting a red glow on the soldier’s face, making his eyes seem to glow.\nHe affixed the slow-match to the match-holder of his matchlock and spun,\nlooking for targets in the darkness.\nHis night vision must have been ruined by staring at the brief flame on\nhis match, now a smoldering red ember, because his eyes passed right over\nKip.\nThe soldier turned again, sharply, paranoid. “The hell am I supposed to\nsee out here, anyway? Swivin’ wolves.”\nVery, very carefully, Kip started walking away. He had to get deeper\ninto the mist and darkness before the soldier’s night vision recovered, but if\nhe made noise, the man might fire blindly. Kip walked on his toes, silently,\nhis back itching, sure that a lead ball was going to tear through him at any\nmoment.\nBut he made it. A hundred paces, more, and no one yelled. No shot\ncracked the night. Farther. Two hundred paces more, and he saw light off to\nhis left, a campfire. It had burned so low it was barely more than coals now.\nKip tried not to look directly at it to save his vision. There was no tent, no\nbedrolls nearby, just the fire.\nKip tried Master Danavis’s trick for seeing in darkness. He let his\nfocus relax and tried to view things from the periphery of his vision."

        "text": "bedrolls nearby, just the fire.\nKip tried Master Danavis’s trick for seeing in darkness. He let his\nfocus relax and tried to view things from the periphery of his vision.\nNothing but an irregularity, perhaps. He moved closer.\nTwo men lay on the cold ground. One was a soldier. Kip had seen his\nmother unconscious plenty of times; he knew instantly this man wasn’t\npassed out. He was sprawled unnaturally, there were no blankets, and his\nmouth hung open, slack-jawed, eyes staring unblinking at the night. Next to\nthe dead soldier lay another man, bound in chains but alive. He lay on his\nside, hands manacled behind his back, a black bag over his head and\ncinched tight around his neck.\nThe prisoner was alive, trembling. No, weeping. Kip looked around;\nthere was no one else in sight.\n“Why don’t you just finish it, damn you?” the prisoner said.\nKip froze. He thought he’d approached silently.\n“Coward,” the prisoner said. “Just following your orders, I suppose?\nOrholam will smite you for what you’re about to do to that little town.”\nKip had no idea what the man was talking about.\nApparently his silence spoke for him.\n“You’re not one of them.” A note of hope entered the prisoner’s voice.\n“Please, help me!”\nKip stepped forward. The man was suffering. Then he stopped. Looked\nat the dead soldier. The front of the soldier’s shirt was soaked with blood.\nHad this prisoner killed him? How?\n“Please, leave me chained if you must. But please, I don’t want to die\nin darkness.”\nKip stayed back, though it felt cruel. “You killed him?”\n“I’m supposed to be executed at first light. I got away. He chased me\ndown and got the bag over my head before he died. If dawn’s close, his\nreplacement is coming anytime now.”\nKip still wasn’t putting it together. No one in Rekton trusted the\nsoldiers who came through, and the alcaldesa had told the town’s young\npeople to give any soldiers a wide berth for a while—apparently the new\nsatrap Garadul had declared himself free of the Chromeria’s control. Now\nhe was King Garadul, he said, but he wanted the usual levies from the\ntown’s young people. The alcaldesa had told his representative that if he\nwasn’t the satrap anymore, he didn’t have the right to raise levies. King or\nsatrap, Garadul couldn’t be happy with that, but Rekton was too small to\nbother with. Still, it would be wise to avoid his soldiers until this all blew\nover.\nOn the other hand, just because Rekton wasn’t getting along with the\nsatrap right now didn’t make this man Kip’s friend.\n“So you are a criminal?” Kip asked.\n“Of six shades to Sun Day,” the man said. The hope leaked out of his\nvoice. “Look, boy—you are a child, aren’t you? You sound like one. I’m\ngoing to die today. I can’t get away. Truth to tell, I don’t want to. I’ve run\nenough. This time, I fight.”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“You will. Take off my hood.”"

Take off my hood.”\nThough some vague doubt nagged Kip, he untied the half-knot around\nthe man’s neck and pulled off the hood.\nAt first, Kip had no idea what the prisoner was talking about. The man\nsat up, arms still bound behind his back. He was perhaps thirty years old,\nTyrean like Kip but with a lighter complexion, his hair wavy rather than\nkinky, his limbs thin and muscular. Then Kip saw his eyes.\nMen and women who could harness light and make luxin—drafters—\nalways had unusual eyes. A little residue of whatever color they drafted\nended up in their eyes. Over the course of their life, it would stain the entire\niris red, or blue, or whatever their color was. The prisoner was a green\ndrafter—or had been. Instead of the green being bound in a halo within the\niris, it was shattered like crockery smashed to the floor. Little green\nfragments glowed even in the whites of his eyes. Kip gasped and shrank\nback.\n“Please!” the man said. “Please, the madness isn’t on me. I won’t hurt\nyou.”\n“You’re a color wight.”\n“And now you know why I ran away from the Chromeria,” the man\nsaid.\nBecause the Chromeria put down color wights like a farmer put down\na beloved, rabid dog.\nKip was on the verge of bolting, but the man wasn’t making any\nthreatening moves. And besides, it was still dark. Even color wights needed\nlight to draft. The mist did seem lighter, though, gray beginning to touch the\nhorizon. It was crazy to talk to a madman, but maybe it wasn’t too crazy. At\nleast until dawn.\nThe color wight was looking at Kip oddly. “Blue eyes.” He laughed.\nKip scowled. He hated his blue eyes. It was one thing when a foreigner\nlike Master Danavis had blue eyes. They looked fine on him. Kip looked\nfreakish.\n“What’s your name?” the color wight asked.\nKip swallowed, thinking he should probably run away.\n“Oh, for Orholam’s sake, you think I’m going to hex you with your\nname? How ignorant is this backwater? That isn’t how chromaturgy works\n—”\n“Kip.”\nThe color wight grinned. “Kip. Well, Kip, have you ever wondered\nwhy you were stuck in such a small life? Have you ever gotten the feeling,\nKip, that you’re special?”\nKip said nothing. Yes, and yes.\n“Do you know why you feel destined for something greater?”\n“Why?” Kip asked, quiet, hopeful.\n“Because you’re an arrogant little shit.” The color wight laughed.\nKip shouldn’t have been taken off guard. His mother had said worse.\nStill, it took him a moment. A small failure. “Burn in hell, coward,” he said.\n“You’re not even good at running away. Caught by ironfoot soldiers.”\nThe color wight laughed louder. “Oh, they didn’t catch me. They\nrecruited me.”"

They\nrecruited me.”\nWho would recruit madmen to join them? “They didn’t know you\nwere a—”\n“Oh, they knew.”\nDread like a weight dropped into Kip’s stomach. “You said something\nabout my town. Before. What are they planning to do?”\n“You know, Orholam’s got a sense of humor. Never realized that till\nnow. Orphan, aren’t you?”\n“No. I’ve got a mother,” Kip said. He instantly regretted giving the\ncolor wight even that much.\n“Would you believe me if I told you there’s a prophecy about you?”\n“It wasn’t funny the first time,” Kip said. “What’s going to happen to\nmy town?” Dawn was coming, and Kip wasn’t going to stick around. Not\nonly would the guard’s replacement come then, but Kip had no idea what\nthe wight would do once he had light.\n“You know,” the wight said, “you’re the reason I’m here. Not here\nhere. Not like ‘Why do I exist?’ Not in Tyrea. In chains, I mean.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“There’s power in madness, Kip. Of course…” He trailed off, laughed\nat a private thought. Recovered. “Look, that soldier has a key in his breast\npocket. I couldn’t get it out, not with—” He shook his hands, bound and\nmanacled behind his back.\n“And I would help you why?” Kip asked.\n“For a few straight answers before dawn.”\nCrazy, and cunning. Perfect. “Give me one first,” Kip said.\n“Shoot.”\n“What’s the plan for Rekton?”\n“Fire.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“Sorry, you said one answer.”\n“That was no answer!”\n“They’re going to wipe out your village. Make an example so no one\nelse defies King Garadul. Other villages defied the king too, of course. His\nrebellion against the Chromeria isn’t popular everywhere. For every town\nburning to take vengeance on the Prism, there’s another that wants nothing\nto do with war. Your village was chosen specially. Anyway, I had a little\nspasm of conscience and objected. Words were exchanged. I punched my\nsuperior. Not totally my fault. They know us greens don’t do rules and\nhierarchy. Especially not once we’ve broken the halo.” The color wight\nshrugged. “There, straight. I think that deserves the key, don’t you?”\nIt was too much information to soak up at once—broken the halo?—\nbut it was a straight answer. Kip walked over to the dead man. His skin was\npallid in the rising light. Pull it together, Kip. Ask whatever you need to ask.\nKip could tell that dawn was coming. Eerie shapes were emerging\nfrom the night. The great twin looming masses of Sundered Rock itself\nwere visible mostly as a place where stars were blotted out of the sky.\nWhat do I need to ask?\nHe was hesitating, not wanting to touch the dead man.

It was there, two keys.\n“They think you have something that belongs to the king. I don’t know\nwhat. I only picked up that much by eavesdropping.”\n“What would Rekton have that the king wants?” Kip asked.\n“Not Rekton you. You you.”\nIt took Kip a second. He touched his own chest. “Me? Me personally?\nI don’t even own anything!”\nThe color wight gave a crazy grin, but Kip thought it was a pretense.\n“Tragic mistake, then. Their mistake, your tragedy.”\n“What, you think I’m lying?!” Kip asked. “You think I’d be out here\nscavenging luxin if I had any other choice?”\n“I don’t really care one way or the other. You going to bring that key\nover here, or do I need to ask real nice?”\nIt was a mistake to bring the keys over. Kip knew it. The color wight\nwasn’t stable. He was dangerous. He’d admitted as much. But he had kept\nhis word. How could Kip do less?\nKip unlocked the man’s manacles, and then the padlock on the chains.\nHe backed away carefully, as one would from a wild animal. The color\nwight pretended not to notice, simply rubbing his arms and stretching back\nand forth. He moved over to the guard and poked through his pockets again.\nHis hand emerged with a pair of green spectacles with one cracked lens.\n“You could come with me,” Kip said. “If what you said is true—”\n“How close do you think I’d get to your town before someone came\nrunning with a musket? Besides, once the sun comes up… I’m ready for it\nto be done.” The color wight took a deep breath, staring at the horizon.\n“Tell me, Kip, if you’ve done bad things your whole life, but you die doing\nsomething good, do you think that makes up for all the bad?”\n“No,” Kip said, honestly, before he could stop himself.\n“Me neither.”\n“But it’s better than nothing,” Kip said. “Orholam is merciful.”\n“Wonder if you’ll say that after they’re done with your village.”\nThere were other questions Kip wanted to ask, but everything had\nhappened in such a rush that he couldn’t put his thoughts together.\nIn the rising light Kip saw what had been hidden in the fog and the\ndarkness. Hundreds of tents were laid out in military precision. Soldiers.\nLots of soldiers. And even as Kip stood, not two hundred paces from the\nnearest tent, the plain began winking. Glimmers sparkled as broken luxin\ngleamed, like stars scattered on the ground, answering their brethren in the\nsky.\nIt was what Kip had come for. Usually when a drafter released luxin, it\nsimply dissolved, no matter what color it was. But in battle, there had been\nso much chaos, so many drafters, some sealed magic had been buried and\nprotected from the sunlight that would break it down. The recent rain had\nuncovered more."

        "text": "so much chaos, so many drafters, some sealed magic had been buried and\nprotected from the sunlight that would break it down. The recent rain had\nuncovered more.\nBut Kip’s eyes were pulled from the winking luxin by four soldiers\nand a man with a stark red cloak and red spectacles walking toward them\nfrom the camp.\n“My name is Gaspar, by the by. Gaspar Elos.” The color wight didn’t\nlook at Kip.\n“What?”\n“I’m not just some drafter. My father loved me. I had plans. A girl. A\nlife.”\n“I don’t—”\n“You will.” The color wight put the green spectacles on; they fit\nperfectly, tight to his face, lenses sweeping to either side so that wherever\nhe looked, he would be looking through a green filter. “Now get out of\nhere.”\nAs the sun touched the horizon, Gaspar sighed. It was as if Kip had\nceased to exist. It was like watching his mother take that first deep breath of\nhaze. Between the sparkling spars of darker green, the whites of Gaspar’s\neyes swirled like droplets of green blood hitting water, first dispersing, then\nstaining the whole. The emerald green of luxin ballooned through his eyes,\nthickened until it was solid, and then spread. Through his cheeks, up to his\nhairline, then down his neck, standing out starkly when it finally filled his\nlighter fingernails as if they’d been painted in radiant jade.\nGaspar started laughing. It was a low, unreasoning cackle, unrelenting.\nMad. Not a pretense this time.\nKip ran.\nHe reached the funerary hill where the sentry had been, taking care to\nstay on the far side from the army. He had to get to Master Danavis. Master\nDanavis always knew what to do.\nThere was no sentry on the hill now. Kip turned around in time to see\nGaspar change, transform. Green luxin spilled out of his hands onto his\nbody, covering every part of him like a shell, like an enormous suit of\narmor. Kip couldn’t see the soldiers or the red drafter approaching Gaspar,\nbut he did see a fireball the size of his head streak toward the color wight,\nhit his chest, and burst apart, throwing flames everywhere.\nGaspar rammed through it, flaming red luxin sticking to his green\narmor. He was magnificent, terrible, powerful. He ran toward the soldiers,\nscreaming defiance, and disappeared from Kip’s view.\nKip fled, the vermilion sun setting fire to the mists.\nChapter 2\nGavin Guile sleepily eyed the papers that slid under his door and wondered\nwhat Karris was punishing him for this time. His rooms occupied half of the\ntop floor of the Chromeria, but the panoramic windows were blackened so\nthat if he slept at all, he could sleep in. The seal on the letter pulsed so\ngently that Gavin couldn’t tell what color had been drafted into it.

Oh, sonuva—\nOn every side, the floor-to-ceiling blackened windows dropped into the\nfloor, bathing the room in full-spectrum light as the morning sun was\nrevealed, climbing the horizon over the dual islands. With his eyes dilated\nso far, magic flooded Gavin. It was too much to hold.\nLight exploded from him in every direction, passing through him in\nsuccessive waves from superviolet down. The sub-red was last, rushing\nthrough his skin like a wave of flame. He jumped out of bed, sweating\ninstantly. But with all the windows open, cold summer morning winds\nblasted through his chambers, chilling him. He yelped, hopping back into\nbed.\nHis yelp must have been loud enough for Karris to hear it and know\nthat her rude awakening had been successful, because he heard her\nunmistakable laugh. She wasn’t a superviolet, so she must have had a friend\nhelp her with her little prank. A quick shot of superviolet luxin at the room’s\ncontrols threw the windows closed and set the filters to half. Gavin\nextended a hand to blast his door open, then stopped. He wasn’t going to\ngive Karris the satisfaction. Her assignment to be the White’s fetch-and-\ncarry girl had ostensibly been intended to teach her humility and gravitas.\nSo far that much had been a spectacular failure, though the White always\nplayed a deeper game. Still, Gavin couldn’t help grinning as he rose and\nswept the folded papers Karris had tucked under the door into his hand.\nHe walked to his door. On a small service table just outside, he found\nhis breakfast on a platter. It was the same every morning: two squat bricks\nof bread and a pale wine in a clear glass cup. The bread was made of wheat,\nbarley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, unleavened. A man could live on that\nbread. In fact, a man was living on that bread. Just not Gavin. Indeed, the\nsight of it made his stomach turn. He could order a different breakfast, of\ncourse, but he never did.\nHe brought it inside, setting the papers on the table next to the bread.\nOne was odd, a plain note that didn’t look like the White’s personal\nstationery, nor any official hard white stationery the Chromeria used. He\nturned it over. The Chromeria’s message office had marked it as being\nreceived from “ST, Rekton”: Satrapy of Tyrea, town of Rekton. It sounded\nfamiliar, maybe one of those towns near Sundered Rock? But then, there\nhad once been so many towns there. Probably someone begging an\naudience, though those letters were supposed to be screened out and dealt\nwith separately.\nStill, first things first. He tore open each loaf, checking that nothing\nhad been concealed inside it. Satisfied, he took out a bottle of the blue dye\nhe kept in a drawer and dribbled a bit into the wine. He swirled the wine to\nmix it, and held the glass up against the granite blue sky of a painting he\nkept on the wall as his reference.\nHe’d done it perfectly, of course.

Young and strong as a warhorse, they said. They didn’t say, Grow a\npair. You’ve got lots of friends, your enemies fear you, and you have no\nrivals. You’re the Prism. What are you afraid of? No one had talked to him\nthat way in years. Sometimes he wished they would.\nOrholam, the note hadn’t even been sealed.\nGavin walked out onto his glass balcony, subconsciously checking his\ndrafting as he did every morning. He stared at his hand, splitting sunlight\ninto its component colors as only he could do, filling each finger in turn\nwith a color, from below the visible spectrum to above it: sub-red, red,\norange, yellow, green, blue, superviolet. Had he felt a hitch there when he\ndrafted blue? He double-checked it, glancing briefly toward the sun.\nNo, it was still easy to split light, still flawless. He released the luxin,\neach color sliding out and dissipating like smoke from beneath his\nfingernails, releasing the familiar bouquet of resinous scents.\nHe turned his face to the sun, its warmth like a mother’s caress. Gavin\nopened his eyes and sucked in a warm, soothing red. In and out, in time\nwith his labored breaths, willing them to slow. Then he let the red go and\ntook in a deep icy blue. It felt like it was freezing his eyes. As ever, the blue\nbrought clarity, peace, order. But not a plan, not with so little information.\nHe let go of the colors. He was still fine. He still had at least five of his\nseven years left. Plenty of time. Five years, five great purposes.\nWell, maybe not five great purposes.\nStill, of his predecessors in the last four hundred years, aside from\nthose who’d been assassinated or died of other causes, the rest had served\nfor exactly seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years after becoming Prism.\nGavin had made it past fourteen. So, plenty of time. No reason to think he’d\nbe the exception. Not many, anyway.\nHe picked up the second note. Cracking the White’s seal—the old\ncrone sealed everything, though she shared the other half of this floor and\nKarris hand-delivered her messages. But everything had to be in its proper\nplace, properly done. There was no mistaking that she’d risen from Blue.\nThe White’s note read, “Unless you would prefer to greet the students\narriving late this morning, my dear Lord Prism, please attend me on the\nroof.”\nLooking beyond the Chromeria’s buildings and the city, Gavin studied"

A\nragged-looking Atashian sloop was maneuvering in to dock directly at a\npier.\nGreeting new students. Unbelievable. It wasn’t that he was too good to\ngreet new students—well, actually, it was that. He, the White, and the\nSpectrum were supposed to balance each other. But though the Spectrum\nfeared him the most, the reality was that the crone got her way more often\nthan Gavin and the seven Colors combined. This morning she had to be\nwanting to experiment on him again, and if he wanted to avoid something\nmore onerous like teaching he’d better get to the top of the tower.\nGavin drafted his red hair into a tight ponytail and dressed in the\nclothes his room slave had laid out for him: an ivory shirt and a well-cut\npair of black wool pants with an oversize gem-studded belt, boots with\nsilverwork, and a black cloak with harsh old Ilytian runic designs\nembroidered in silver thread. The Prism belonged to all the satrapies, so\nGavin did his best to honor the traditions of every land—even one that was\nmainly pirates and heretics.\nHe hesitated a moment, then pulled open a drawer and drew out his\nbrace of Ilytian pistols. They were, typical for Ilytian work, the most\nadvanced design Gavin had ever seen. The firing mechanism was far more\nreliable than a wheellock—they were calling it a flintlock. Each pistol had a\nlong blade beneath the barrel, and even a belt-flange so that when he tucked\nthem into his belt behind his back they were held securely and at an angle\nso he didn’t skewer himself when he sat. The Ilytians thought of everything.\nAnd, of course, the pistols made the White’s Blackguards nervous.\nGavin grinned.\nWhen he turned for the door and saw the painting again, his grin\ndropped.\nHe walked back to the table with the blue bread. Grabbing one use-\nsmoothened edge of the painting, he pulled. It swung open silently,\nrevealing a narrow chute.\nNothing menacing about the chute. Too small for a man to climb up,\neven if he overcame everything else. It might have been a laundry chute.\nYet to Gavin it looked like the mouth of hell, the evernight itself opening\nwide for him. He tossed one of the bricks of bread into it, then waited.\nThere was a thunk as the hard bread hit the first lock, a small hiss as it\nopened, then closed, then a smaller thunk as it hit the next lock, and a few\nmoments later one last thunk. Each of the locks was still working.\nEverything was normal. Safe. There had been mistakes over the years, but\nno one had to die this time. No need for paranoia.

He caught it, almost\nwithout looking. He knew it was blue, the still blue of a deep lake in early\nmorning, when night still hoards the sky and the air dares not caress the\nwater’s skin. Unadulterated by any other color, drafting that blue was\ndifficult. Worse, drafting it made the prisoner feel bored, passionless, at\npeace, in harmony with even this place. And he needed the fire of hatred\ntoday. Today, he would escape.\nAfter all his years here, sometimes he couldn’t even see the color, like\nhe had awoken to a world painted in grays. The first year had been the\nworst. His eyes, so accustomed to nuance, so adept at parsing every\nspectrum of light, had begun deceiving him. He’d hallucinated colors. He\ntried to draft those colors into the tools to break this prison. But imagination\nwasn’t enough to make magic, one needed light. Real light. He’d been a\nPrism, so any color would do, from those above violet to the ones below\nred. He’d gathered the very heat from his own body, soaked his eyes in\nthose sub-reds, and flung that against the tedious blue walls.\nOf course, the walls were hardened against such pathetic amounts of\nheat. He’d drafted a blue dagger and sawn at his wrist. Where the blood\ndripped onto the stone floor, it was immediately leached of color. The next\ntime, he’d cupped his own blood in his hands to try to draft red, but he\ncouldn’t get enough color given that the only light in the cell was blue.\nBleeding onto the bread hadn’t worked either. Its natural brown was always\nstained blue, so adding red only yielded a dark, purplish brown.\nUndraftable. Of course. His brother had thought of everything. But then, he\nalways had.\nThe prisoner sat next to the drain and began eating. The dungeon was\nshaped like a flattened ball: the walls and ceiling a perfect sphere, the floor\nless steep but still sloping toward the middle. The walls were lit from\nwithin, every surface emitting the same color light. The only shadow in the\ndungeon was the prisoner himself. There were only two holes: the chute\nabove, which released his food and one steady rivulet of water that he had\nto lick for his moisture, and the drain below for his waste.\nHe had no utensils, no tools except his hands and his will, always his\nwill. With his will, he could draft anything from the blue that he wanted,\nthough it would dissolve as soon as his will released it, leaving only dust\nand a faint mineral-and-resin odor.\nBut today was going to be the day his vengeance began, his first day of\nfreedom. This attempt wouldn’t fail—he refused to even think of it as an\n“attempt”—and there was work to be done. Things had to be done in order.\nHe couldn’t remember now if he had always been this way or if he’d soaked\nin blue for so long that the color had changed him fundamentally.\nHe knelt next to the only feature of the cell that his brother hadn’t"

A single, shallow depression in the floor, a bowl. First he rubbed\nthe bowl with his bare hands, grinding the corrosive oils from his fingertips\ninto the stone for as long as he dared. Scar tissue didn’t produce oil, so he\nhad to stop before he rubbed his fingers raw. He scraped two fingernails\nalong the crease between his nose and face, two others between his ears and\nhead, gathering more oil. Anywhere he could collect oils from his body, he\ndid, and rubbed it into the bowl. Not that there was any discernible change,\nbut over the years his bowl had become deep enough to cover his finger to\nthe second joint. His jailer had bound the color-leaching hellstones into the\nfloor in a grid. Whatever spread far enough to cross one of those lines lost\nall color almost instantly. But hellstone was terribly expensive. How deep\ndid they go?\nIf the grid only extended a few thumbs into the stone, his raw fingers\nmight reach beyond it any day. Freedom wouldn’t be far behind. But if his\njailer had used enough hellstone that the crosshatching lines ran a foot deep,\nthen he’d been rubbing his fingers raw for almost six thousand days for\nnothing. He’d die here. Someday, his brother would come down, see the\nlittle bowl—his only mark on the world—and laugh. With that laughter\nechoing in his ears, he felt a small spark of anger in his breast. He blew on\nthat spark, basked in its warmth. It was fire enough to help him move,\nenough to counter the soothing, debilitating blue down here.\nFinished, he urinated into the bowl. And watched.\nFor a moment, filtered through the yellow of his urine, the cursed blue\nlight was sliced with green. His breath caught. Time stretched as the green\nstayed green… stayed green. By Orholam, he’d done it. He’d gone deep\nenough. He’d broken through the hellstone!\nAnd then the green disappeared. In exactly the same two seconds it\ntook every day. He screamed in frustration, but even his frustration was\nweak, his scream more to assure himself he could still hear than real fury.\nThe next part still drove him crazy. He knelt by the depression. His\nbrother had turned him into an animal. A dog, playing with his own shit.\nBut that emotion was too old, mined too many times to give him any real\nwarmth. Six thousand days on, he was too debased to resent his\ndebasement. Putting both hands into his urine, he scrubbed it around the\nbowl as he had scrubbed his oils. Even leached of all color, urine was still\nurine. It should still be acidic. It should corrode the hellstone faster than the\nskin oils alone would.\nOr the urine might neutralize the oils. He might be pushing the day of\nhis escape further and further away. He had no idea. That was what made\nhim crazy, not immersing his fingers in warm urine.

Not anymore.\nHe scooped the urine out of the bowl and dried it with a wad of blue\nrags: his clothes, his pillow, now stinking of urine. Stinking of urine for so\nlong that the stench didn’t offend him anymore. It didn’t matter. What\nmattered was that the bowl had to be dry by tomorrow so he could try\nagain.\nAnother day, another failure. Tomorrow, he would try sub-red again. It\nhad been a while. He’d recovered enough from his last attempt. He should\nbe strong enough for it. If nothing else, his brother had taught him how\nstrong he really was. And maybe that was what made him hate Gavin more\nthan anything. But it was a hatred as cold as his cell.\nChapter 4\nIn the early morning chill, Kip jogged across the town square as fast as his\nungainly fifteen-year-old frame would allow. He caught his shoe on a\ncobblestone and pitched headlong through Master Danavis’s back gate.\n“Are you okay, boy?” Master Danavis asked from his seat at his work\nbench, his dark eyebrows rising high above cornflower blue eyes, the irises\nhalf filled with the stark ruby red that marked him a drafter. Master Danavis\nwas in his early forties, beardless and wiry, wearing thick wool work pants\nand a thin shirt that left lean, muscled arms uncovered despite the cold\nmorning. A pair of red spectacles sat low on his nose.\n“Ow, ow.” Kip looked at his skinned palms. His knees were burning\ntoo. “No, no I’m not.” He hitched his pants up, wincing as his scraped\npalms rubbed on the heavy, once-black linen.\n“Good, good, because—ah, here. Tell me, are these the same?” Master\nDanavis put out both of his hands. Both were bright red, filled with luxin\nfrom the elbow to his fingers. He turned his arm over so that his light kopi-\nand-cream-colored skin wouldn’t interfere as much with Kip’s examination.\nLike Kip, Master Danavis was a half-breed—though Kip had never heard\nanyone give the drafter any trouble for that, unlike him. In the dyer’s case,\nhe was half Blood Forester, his face marked with a few strange dots they\ncalled freckles, and a hint of red in his otherwise normal dark hair. But at\nleast his lighter than normal skin made what he was asking Kip easy.\nKip pointed to a region from the dyer’s forearm to his elbow. “This red\nchanges color here, and this one’s a bit brighter. Can I, uh, talk to you, sir?”\nMaster Danavis flicked both hands down with disgust and ruby luxin\nsplashed onto ground already splattered a hundred shades of red. The gooey\nluxin crumpled and dissolved. Most afternoons, Kip came to sweep up the\nremnants—red luxin was flammable even when it was dust.\n“Superchromats! It’s one thing for my daughter to be one, but the\nalcaldesa’s husband? And you? Two men in one town? Wait, what’s wrong,\nKip?”\n“Sir, there’s ah…” Kip hesitated. Not only was the battlefield"

        "text": "alcaldesa’s husband? And you? Two men in one town? Wait, what’s wrong,\nKip?”\n“Sir, there’s ah…” Kip hesitated. Not only was the battlefield\nforbidden, but Master Danavis had once said that he thought scavenging\nthere was no different than grave robbing. “Have you heard from Liv, sir?”\nCoward. Three years ago, Liv Danavis had left to be trained at the\nChromeria like her father before her. They’d only been able to afford for her\nto come home at the harvest break her first year.\n“Come here, boy. Show me those hands.” Master Danavis grabbed a\nclean rag and blotted up the blood, dislodging the dirt with firm strokes.\nThen he uncorked a jug and held the rag over its mouth. He rubbed the\nbrandy-soaked rag over Kip’s palms.\nKip gasped.\n“Don’t be a baby,” Master Danavis said. Even though Kip had done\nodd jobs for the dyer for as long as he could remember, he was still scared\nof him sometimes. “Knees.”\nGrimacing, Kip pulled up one pant leg and propped his foot on a work\nbench. Liv was two years older than Kip—almost seventeen now. Not even\nthe lack of men in the village had made her look at Kip as anything more\nthan a child, of course, but she had always been nice to him. A pretty girl\nbeing nice and only accidentally patronizing was pretty much the best Kip\ncould hope for.\n“Let’s just say that not all sharks and sea demons are in the sea.\nChromeria’s a tough place for a Tyrean since the war.”\n“So you think she might come home?”\n“Kip,” Master Danavis said, “is your mother in trouble again?”\nMaster Danavis had refused to apprentice Kip as a dyer, saying there\nwasn’t enough work in little Rekton to give Kip a future, and insisting he\nonly was a halfway decent dyer himself because he could draft. He’d been\nsomething else before the Prisms’ War, obviously, because he’d been\nChromeria trained. That wasn’t cheap, and most drafters were sworn to\nservice to pay the expense. So Master Danavis’s own master must have\nbeen killed during the war, leaving him adrift. But few adults talked about\nthose days. Tyrea had lost and everything had gotten bad, that’s all Kip or\nthe other children knew.\nStill, Master Danavis paid Kip to do odd jobs and, like half the\nmothers in town, would give him a meal anytime he wandered by. Even\nbetter, he always let Kip eat the cakes the women in town sent, trying to\nattract the handsome bachelor’s attention.\n“Sir, there’s an army on the other side of the river. They’re coming to\nwipe out the town to make an example of us for defying King Garadul.”\nMaster Danavis started to say something, then saw that Kip was\nserious. He said nothing for a moment, then his whole demeanor changed.\nHe started asking Kip questions rapid-fire: where were they exactly,\nwhen was he there, how did he know they were going to wipe out the town,\nwhat had the tents looked like, how many tents had he counted, were there"

Kip’s answers were unbelievable even to his own ears, but\nMaster Danavis accepted it all.\n“He said King Garadul is recruiting color wights? You’re certain?”\n“Yessir.”\nMaster Danavis rubbed his upper lip with thumb and forefinger, like a\nman would smooth his mustache, though he was clean-shaven. He strode to\na chest, opened it, and grabbed a purse out. “Kip, your friends are fishing\nthis morning at Green Bridge. You need to get out there and warn them. The\nking’s men will seize that bridge. If you don’t warn them, your friends will\nbe killed or taken for slaves. I’ll warn everyone here in town. Worse comes\nto worst, use that money to get to the Chromeria. Liv will help you.”\n“But—but, my mother! Where—”\n“Kip, I’ll do my best to save her and everyone here. No one else is\ngoing to save your friends. You want Isabel taken as a slave? You know\nwhat happens, right?”\nKip blanched. Isa was still a tomboy, but it hadn’t escaped him that she\nwas turning into a beautiful woman. She wasn’t always very nice to him,\nbut the thought of someone hurting her filled him with rage. “Yes, sir.” Kip\nturned to go, hesitated. “Sir, what’s a superchromat?”\n“A pain in my ass. Now go!”\nChapter 5\nThis was not going to be pretty. The note, the you-have-a-son note, hadn’t\nbeen sealed. Gavin could pretty much guarantee that the White’s people\nread all of his correspondence. But Karris had laughed after giving him the\nnote, which meant she hadn’t. So she didn’t know. Yet. But she’d gone to\nreport to the White. Where Gavin was expected.\nHe rolled his shoulders and stretched his neck to one side and then the\nother, each giving a satisfying little pop, then started walking. His\nBlackguards fell in step behind him, each carrying a wheellock musket and\nwearing an ataghan or other weapon. He climbed the stairs to the open roof\nbalcony of the Chromeria. As always, he noticed Karris first. She was short,\nwith a naturally curvy figure now carved into too-hard planes and veins by\nyears of strenuous training. Her hair was long and straight and platinum\nblonde today. Yesterday it had been pink. Gavin liked it blonde. Blonde\nusually meant she was in a good mood. Her hair color changes were\nnothing magical. She just liked to change frequently. Or maybe she figured\nshe stood out so much that she might as well not even try to blend in.\nLike the other Blackguards protecting the White, Karris wore fine\nblack trousers and blouse, cut for fighting and plain except for the\nembroidery of her rank on the shoulder and at the neck in gold thread. Like\nthe others, she carried a slim black ataghan—a slightly forward-curving\nsword with a single cutting edge for most of its length—and rather than a\nshield, a metal parrying stick with a punch dagger in the middle.

Unlike the others, her skin wasn’t the deep black of a Parian or an\nIlytian.\nNor was her mood dark, apparently. There was a mischievous little\ntwist to her lips. Gavin raised a brow at her, pretending to be mildly peeved\nabout her earlier prank with the shades in his room, and came to stand\nbefore the White.\nOrea Pullawr was a shrunken old woman who was taking more and\nmore to the wheeled chair she sat in now. Her Blackguards made sure that\nevery guard rotation had at least one burly man in case she needed to be\ncarried up or down stairs. But despite her physical infirmity, Orea Pullawr\nhadn’t needed to fend off a challenger for the white robe for more than a\ndecade. Most people couldn’t even remember her real name; she simply\nwas the White.\n“Are you ready?” she asked. Even after all these years, she still had\ntrouble accepting that this wasn’t hard for him.\n“I’ll manage.”\n“You always do,” she said. Her eyes were clear and gray except for\ntwo broad arcs of color surrounding each iris, blue on top and green below.\nThe White was a blue/green bichrome, but those arcs of color were washed\nout in her eyes, desaturated now because she hadn’t drafted in so long. But\neach arc was as thick as possible, extending from the pupil out to the very\nedge of each iris. If she ever drafted again, she’d break the halo: the color\nwould break through into the whites of each eye, and that would be the end\nof her. That was why she didn’t wear colored spectacles. Unlike other\nretired drafters, she didn’t even continue the pretense of carrying around her\nunused spectacles to remind everyone of what she once was. Orea Pullawr\nwas the White, and it was enough.\nGavin headed to the dais. Above it, mounted on arcing tracks so it\ncould be adjusted for any time of day or month of the year, a great polished\ncrystal hung. He didn’t need it. Never had, but it seemed to make everyone\nmore comfortable to think he required some crutch to handle so much light.\nHe never got lightsick either. Life just wasn’t fair. “Any special requests?”\nhe asked.\nHow exactly the Prism felt the imbalances in the world’s magic was\nstill a mystery. Shrouded in religious hokum about the Prism being\nconnected straight to Orholam and therefore all the satrapies, the subject\nhad not even been studied before Gavin became the Prism. Even the White\nhad been quite nearly fearful when she asked about it, and she was as brassy\na woman as Gavin had ever met.\nNot that they’d made much progress, but long ago he and the White\nhad struck a bargain: she would study him intensely and he would\ncooperate, and in turn she would allow him to travel without Blackguards\ndogging his every step. It worked, mostly. Sometimes he couldn’t help but\ntease her, since it seemed they hadn’t learned anything in the sixteen years\nhe’d been the Prism.

Of course, when he pushed her too far, she’d bring\nhim up here and say she really needed to examine how the light moved\nthrough his skin. So he’d balance. In the open air. In the winter. Naked.\nNot pleasant. Gavin being Gavin, he’d learned pretty much exactly\nwhere the line was. Emperor of the Seven Satrapies indeed.\n“I’d like you to start allowing the Blackguard to do their jobs, Lord\nPrism.”\n“I meant about the balancing.”\n“They train their whole lives to serve us. They risk their lives. And you\ndisappear, every week. We agreed you could travel without them, but only\nduring emergencies.”\nServe us? It’s a little more complicated than that.\n“I live dangerous,” Gavin said. They fought about this all the time.\nDoubtless the White figured that if she didn’t make a show here, he would\npush for more freedom. Doubtless she was right. Gavin looked at the White\nflatly. The White looked at Gavin flatly. The Blackguards were very, very\nquiet.\nIs this how you would have handled them, brother? Or would you have\nsimply charmed them into submission? Everything in my life is about\npower.\n“Nothing special today,” the White said. Gavin began.\nA Prism, at core, did two things no one else could do. First, Gavin\ncould split light into its component colors without external aids. A normal\nred drafter could draft only an arc of red, some a wider arc, some a lesser\narc. In order to draft, they had to be seeing red—red rocks, blood, a sunset,\na desert, whatever. Or, as drafters had learned long ago, they could wear red\nspectacles, which filtered the sun’s white light to deliver only red. It gave\nless power, but it was better than being utterly dependent on one’s\nsurroundings.\nThe same limitations applied to every drafter: monochromes could\ndraft only one color; bichromes could draft two colors. Generally, it was\ncolors that bordered each other, like red and orange, or yellow and green.\nPolychromes—those who controlled three or more colors—were the rarest,\nbut even they had to draft from the colors they could see. Only the Prism\nnever needed spectacles. Only Gavin could split light within himself.\nThat was convenient for Gavin, but it didn’t help anyone else. What\ndid help was this: standing atop the Chromeria, light streaming through his\neyes, filling his skin with every color in the spectrum, bleeding out of every\npore, he could feel the imbalances in magic in all the world.\n“To the southeast, like before,” Gavin said. “Deep in Tyrea, likely\nKelfing, someone’s using sub-red, and lots of it.” Heat and fire usually\nmeant war magic. It was the first place most non-drafting warlords or\nsatraps went when they wanted to kill people. No subtlety. The amount of\nsub-red being used in Tyrea meant either they’d been having a quiet war, or\nthe new satrap Rask Garadul had set up his own school to train battle\ndrafters. It wouldn’t be something his neighbors would be happy to learn."

        "text": "the new satrap Rask Garadul had set up his own school to train battle\ndrafters. It wouldn’t be something his neighbors would be happy to learn.\nThe Ruthgari governor who occupied Tyrea’s former capital Garriston\ndefinitely wouldn’t be happy to learn it.\nIn addition to the surfeit of sub-red, more red magic than blue had\nbeen used since Gavin last balanced, and more green than orange. The\nsystem was self-regulating, initially. If red drafters around the world used\ntoo much red, it would begin to get harder for them to draft, and\nsimultaneously easier for the blues. Sealed red luxin would unravel more\neasily, while sealed blue would seal better. At that level, it was an\ninconvenience, an annoyance.\nLegends spoke of an era before Lucidonius came and brought the true\nworship of Orholam when the magic centers had been spread throughout\nthe world: green in what was now Ruthgar, red in Atash, and so forth, all\nworshipping pagan gods and mired in superstition and ignorance. Some\nwarlord had massacred almost all the blues. Within months, they said, the\nCerulean Sea had turned to blood, the waters choked of life. Fishermen on\nevery side of the sea had starved. The few surviving blue drafters had\nheroically worked to bring the balance back by themselves—using so much\nblue magic that they’d killed themselves. The seas cleared, and the red\ndrafters returned to drafting as before. But this time there were no blue\ndrafters left. Anything using red luxin failed, the seas turned bloody again,\nfamine and disease descended.\nAnd so it went. Nearly every generation huge natural disasters wiped\nout thousands who believed they’d done something to offend their\ncapricious gods.\nPrisms prevented that. Gavin could feel what was out of balance long\nbefore there were any physical signs, and fix it by drafting the opposite\ncolor. When Prisms failed, as they inevitably did after seven, fourteen, or\ntwenty-one years, the Chromeria had to prevent disasters the hard way—in\naddition to running around putting out fires (sometimes literally), they\nwould send missives throughout the world, perhaps urging blues not to draft\nunless it was an emergency, and reds to draft more than usual. Because\neveryone could only draft a finite amount in their lives, that meant\nhastening the reds to their death, and keeping the blues from doing useful\nwork in all of the Seven Satrapies. So at such times, the Chromeria sought a\nPrism’s replacement with great fervor. And Orholam was faithful to send a\nnew Prism every generation, or so the teaching went.\nExcept for Gavin’s generation, when in his ineffable wisdom, Orholam\nhad somehow sent two—and torn the world apart.\nGavin spun in a slow circle, spreading his arms wide and releasing\ngouts of superviolet light to balance the sub-red, then red to balance blue,\nthen orange to balance green. When the world felt right once more, he\nstopped.\nHe turned and smiled at the White. Her expression, as usual, was a\ncipher. Her Blackguards—every one of whom was a drafter and thus had an\nidea of how much power Gavin had just handled—looked similarly\nunimpressed. Or perhaps they were simply habituated.

It was his job to do the impossible. If anything, they relaxed\nslightly. Their job was to protect the White, even from him, if it came to it.\nGavin was the Prism, and thus ostensibly the emperor of the Seven\nSatrapies. In reality, his duties were mostly religious. Prisms who became\ntoo much more than just figureheads found themselves forcibly retired.\nOften permanently. The Blackguard would die to protect him from anyone\nelse, but the White was the head of the Chromeria. If it came to it, they’d\nfight for her, not him. If it did, they knew they would likely all die, but then,\nthat was what they trained for. Even Karris.\nGavin wondered sometimes, if that ever happened, would Karris be the\nlast to try to kill him, or the first?\n“Karris?” the White said. “There’s a ship waiting for you, heading for\nTyrea. Take this. You can read it once you set sail. When you can, scull the\nrest of the way. Time is of the essence.” She handed Karris a folded note. It\nwasn’t even sealed. Either the White trusted Karris not to even open it\nbefore her ship sailed, or she knew she’d read it immediately whether it was\nsealed or not. Gavin thought he knew Karris well, and he didn’t know\nwhich she’d do.\nKarris took the note and bowed deeply to the White, never even\nglancing at Gavin. Then she turned and left. Gavin couldn’t help but watch\nher go, her figure svelte, graceful, powerful, but he kept his glance brief.\nThe White would notice regardless, but if he stared, she’d probably say\nsomething.\nShe waved her hand as Karris disappeared down the stairs, and the rest\nof the Blackguard withdrew from earshot.\n“So, Gavin,” she said, folding her arms. “A son. Explain.”\nChapter 6\nGreen Bridge was less than a league upstream from Rekton. Kip’s body\nscreamed at him to quit running, but every time he slowed his pace, he\nimagined the soldiers coming up the opposite side of the river. He had to get\nthere first.\nAbout twelve nightmares of enslavement and death later, he did. Isabel\nand Ramir and Sanson were relaxing against the bridge, fishing. Isabel was\nbundled against the cold, watching while Sanson tried to tease out rainbow\ntrout and Ram told him how he was doing it wrong. They all looked at Kip\nas he bent over, puffing. No sight of soldiers anywhere.\n“Gotta go,” Kip said in between breaths. “Soldiers coming.”\n“Oh, no, oh, no! Not soldiers!” Ram said in mock panic.\nSanson jumped to his feet, thinking Ramir was serious. Sanson was\nbucktoothed and gullible, good-natured, always the last to get a joke and the\nmost likely to be the butt of it.\n“Relax, Sanson. I’m joking,” Ramir said, punching Sanson’s shoulder,\ntoo hard.\nWhen they’d first heard about the recruiters demanding levies, it had\ntaken them about a second to conclude that if one of them were pressed into"

At sixteen, he was a year older\nthan the rest of them, and the only one who seemed remotely like a soldier.\n“I’m not,” Kip said, still bent over, hands on his knees, breathing hard.\nStill uncertain, Sanson said, “My ma said the alcaldesa had a big fight\nwith the king’s man. She said the alcaldesa told him to stick those orders in\nhis ear.”\n“If I know the alcaldesa, she didn’t say ear,” Isa said. She grinned\nwickedly, and Sanson and Ram laughed. They just weren’t getting it.\nKip saw Isa look at Ram—just a quick glance, looking for his\napproval. As she found it, Kip saw her pleasure double, and he felt sick in\nhis stomach. Again.\n“What’s going on, Kip?” she asked. Big brown eyes, full lips, full\ncurves, flawless skin. It was impossible to talk to her and not be aware of\nher beauty. Prettier even than Liv, really, and infinitely more here.\nKip tried to find words. People are coming to kill us, and I’m worried\nabout some girl who doesn’t even like me.\nFrom Green Bridge, it was three or four hundred paces to the nearest\norange grove. There was precious little cover between the bridge and the\ntrees.\n“There are—” Kip started, but Ram ran right over his words.\n“If they conscript me, I’m going to volunteer to become a battle\ndrafter,” Ram said. “It’s dangerous, I know, but if I have to leave everything\nI love here, I’m going to make something of myself.” He looked into the\ndistance, off to a grand future. Kip wanted to punch him in his handsome,\nheroic face.\n“Why don’t you and Sanson run off?” Ram asked. “You know, hide\nfrom the big bad army? Isa and I want to say goodbye.”\n“Why can’t you say goodbye with us here?” Sanson asked.\nIsa blushed.\nRam’s eyes flashed. “Seriously, you two, don’t be assholes, huh?” he\nsaid, pretending to be joking.\n“Ram, listen,” Kip said. “The army is coming to make an example of\nus. We need to leave. Right. Now. Master Danavis said they’d seize the\nbridge.” In fact, Green Bridge itself was a relic from the last army that came\nthrough. It was all green luxin—the most durable luxin: when sealed, it\nbroke down more slowly than any other kind. They said that when Gavin\nGuile had led his army through here on his way to crush his evil brother\nDazen Guile’s army, Gavin Guile, the Prism himself, had drafted this\nbridge. By himself. In seconds. The army had pushed through without\nslowing, though its foragers had stolen all the food and livestock still in\ntown. All the men in the town had been pressed into service on one side or\nthe other.\nIt was why they had all grown up without fathers. No one in Rekton\nshould treat an army passing through as a light matter. Not even the\nchildren."

Not even the\nchildren.\n“Do me a favor, Tubby. I’ll make it up to you,” Ram said.\n“If you go with the soldiers, you won’t be here to make it up to me,”\nKip said. He wanted to kill Ram when he called him Tubby.\nAn ugly look passed over Ram’s features. They’d fought before, and\nRam won every time. But it was never easy. Kip could take a lot of\npunishment, and sometimes he went crazy. They both knew it. Ram said,\n“So do me a favor, huh?”\n“We have to go!” Kip nearly shouted. He didn’t know why he was\nsurprised. It was no mistake they always called Ramir Ram. He picked a\ngoal and went straight at it, bashing down anything in his path, never\nveering right or left. His goal today was to take Isabel’s maidenhead. That\nsimple. No mere invading army was going to stop the stupid animal.\n“Fine. Come on, Isa, we’ll go to the orange grove,” Ram said. “And\ndon’t think I’ll forget this, Kip.”\nRam took her hand and pulled her into a walk. She went with him but\nturned, looking over her shoulder at Kip, as if expecting him to do\nsomething.\nBut what could he do? They were actually going the right direction. If\nhe went over there and punched Ram in the face, Ram would beat him\nbloody—and worse, they’d both be out in the open. If Kip followed on their\nheels, Ram might assume he was trying to start a fight even if he wasn’t,\nwith the same result.\nIsabel was still looking at him. She was so beautiful it hurt.\nKip could stay. Do nothing. Hide under the bridge.\nNo!\nKip cursed. Isa looked back as he emerged from Green Bridge’s\nshadow. Her eyes widened, and he thought he saw the shadow of a smile\ntouch her lips. Real joy at seeing Kip pursue her and be a man, or just venal\ndelight in being fought over? Then her gaze shifted up and left, to the\nopposite bank of the river. Surprised.\nThere was a man’s yell from above, but over the hiss of the waters Kip\ncouldn’t understand what he said. Ram stumbled as he reached the top of\nthe riverbank. He didn’t catch himself. Instead, he dropped to his knees,\ntottered, and fell backward.\nIt was only when Ram’s limp body rolled over that Kip saw the arrow\nsticking out of his back.\nIsa saw it too. She looked at whoever was on the bank, glanced at Kip,\nand then bolted in the other direction.\n“Kill her,” a man commanded in a loud clear voice, on the bridge\ndirectly above Kip. His voice was passionless.\nKip felt sick, helpless. He’d wasted too much time. His mind refused\nwhat his eyes reported.

His heart hammered in his chest, roared in his\nears, and then, suddenly, its rate doubled, tripled.\nThe barest shadow flicked at the corner of his eye: the arrow. Kip’s\narm spasmed as if he himself had been struck. A flash of blue, barely\nvisible, thin and reedy, darted from him into the air.\nThe arrow splashed into the river, a good fifteen paces away from Isa.\nThe archer cursed. Kip looked down at his hands. They were trembling—\nand blue. As achingly bright blue as the sky. He was so stunned he froze for\na moment.\nHe looked back to Isa, now more than a hundred paces away. There\nwas the same flicker of a shadow as another arrow passed from the\nperiphery of his vision to the center of it—right into Isa’s back. She pitched\nface first onto the rough stones of the riverbank, but as Kip watched, she got\nback up to her knees slowly, the arrow jutting from her lower back, hands\nand face streaming blood. She was almost to her feet when the next arrow\nthudded into her back. She dropped face first into the shallows of the river\nand moved no more.\nKip stood there stupidly, disbelieving. His vision narrowed to the point\nwhere crimson life swirled from Isa’s back into the clear water of the river.\nHoofbeats clopped loudly on the bridge above them. Kip’s mind\nchurned.\n“Sir, the men are ready,” a man said above them. “But… sir, this is our\nown town.” Kip looked up. The green luxin of the bridge overhead was\ntranslucent, and he could see the shadows of the men—which meant that if\nhe or Sanson moved, the soldiers might see them too.\nSilence, then, coldly, the same officer who had demanded Isa die said,\n“So we should let subjects choose when to obey their king? Perhaps\nobeying my orders should be optional, too?”\n“No, sir. It’s just…”\n“Are you finished?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Then burn it down. Kill them all.”\nChapter 7\n“You’re not even going to pretend that you don’t read my mail?” Gavin\nasked.\nThe White barked a laugh. “Why insult your intelligence?”\n“I could think of half a dozen reasons, which means you could\nprobably think of a hundred,” Gavin said.\n“You’re avoiding the question. Do you have a son?” Despite her\ndogged determination to get the answer—and Gavin knew she wouldn’t let\nhim dodge this, artfully or not—she kept her voice down. She understood,\nbetter than anyone, the gravity of the situation. Even the Blackguards\nwouldn’t hear this. But if she had read his unsealed mail, anyone else could\nhave too.\n“To the best of my knowledge, it’s not true. I don’t see how it could\nbe.”\n“Because you’ve been careful, or because it’s actually impossible?”\n“You don’t really expect me to answer that,” Gavin said.\n“I understand that a Prism faces substantial temptations, and I\nappreciate your temperance or discretion over the years, whichever it’s"

I haven’t had to deal with pregnant young drafters or irate fathers\ndemanding that you be forced to marry their daughters. I thank you for that.\nIn return, I haven’t joined your father in pressing you to marry, though that\nwould doubtless simplify your life and mine. You’re a smart man, Gavin.\nSmart enough, I hope, that you know you can ask me for a new room slave,\nor more room slaves, or whatever you require. Otherwise, I hope that you\nare… very careful.”\nGavin coughed. “None more so.”\n“I don’t pretend to be able to track all your comings and goings, but to\nthe best of my knowledge, you haven’t been to Tyrea since the war.”\n“Sixteen years,” Gavin said quietly. Sixteen years? Has he really been\ndown there for sixteen years? What would the White do if she found out my\nbrother is alive? That I’ve been keeping him in a special hell beneath this\nvery tower?\nHer eyebrows lifted, reading something else in his troubled expression.\n“Ah. A great many things may be done during war by men and women who\nthink they may die. Those were wilder days for you. So perhaps this\nrevelation is a particular problem.”\nGavin’s heart stopped cold. For all of a thousand things that had\nhappened sixteen years ago, the one that was most important now was that\nduring the time the child must have been sired, Gavin had been betrothed to\nKarris.\n“If you’re absolutely certain that this isn’t true,” the White said, “I’ll\nsend a man to take the note from Karris. I was trying to do you a favor. You\nknow her temper. I figured it would be best for both of you if she learned\nabout this while she is away. After her head cools, I imagine she’ll forgive\nyou. But if you swear it isn’t true, then there’s no need for her to know at\nall, is there?”\nFor a moment, Gavin wondered at the old crone. The White was being\nkind, no doubt, but she had also orchestrated this situation to happen right\nin front of her—and the only reason for her to do that was so she could see\nGavin’s most honest reaction. It was kind and cruel and cunning all at once,\nand by no means accidental. Gavin reminded himself for the hundredth time\nnot to get on the wrong side of Orea Pullawr.\n“I have no recollection of this woman. None. But it was a terrible time.\nI, I cannot swear it.” He knew how the White would take that. She thought\nhe was admitting to cheating on Karris during their betrothal, but that he\nbelieved he’d always been careful. But young men make mistakes.\n“I should go,” he said. “I’ll get to the bottom of it. This is my mess.”\n“No,” she said flatly. “Now it’s Karris’s. I’m not sending you to Tyrea,\nGavin. You’re the Prism. It’s bad enough that I have to send you after color\nwights—”\n“You don’t send me. You just don’t stop me.”"

She refused to let a Prism\nendanger himself, called it madness. Gavin hadn’t made any arguments at\nall, just refused to be stopped. She’d confined him to his apartments. He’d\nblown the doors off.\nEventually, she gave in, and he paid for it in other ways.\nA moment passed, and she said very quietly, gently, “After all this\ntime, Gavin, after all the wights you’ve killed and all the people you’ve\nsaved, does it hurt any less?”\n“I hear there’s some talk of heresy,” Gavin said brusquely. “Someone\npreaching the old gods again. I could go find out.”\n“You’re not the promachos anymore, Gavin.”\n“It’s not like any fifty of their half-trained drafters could stop—”\n“What you are is the best Prism we’ve had in fifty, maybe a hundred\nyears. And they might have fifty-one drafters, or five hundred at their little\nheretical Chromeria, so I won’t hear of it. Karris will check on this woman\nand her son and see what she can learn as she investigates this ‘King’\nGaradul. You can expect her return within two months. And speaking of\ncolor wights, an unusually powerful blue wight was just seen on the\noutskirts of the Blood Forest, heading toward Ru.”\nA blue wight heading toward the reddest lands in the world. Odd. And\nblues were usually so logical. It was a distraction, but it was a good one,\nand it left him almost no time to reach Karris. “By your leave, then, High\nLady,” he said, his good manners always partly ironical. He didn’t wait for\nher approval before he gathered his magic and jogged toward the edge of\nthe tower.\n“Oh no you don’t!” she said.\nHe stopped. Sighed. “What?”\n“Gavin!” she scolded. “Surely you didn’t forget you promised to teach\ntoday. It’s a high honor for each class to meet with you. They wait months\nfor this.”\n“Which class?” he asked suspiciously.\n“Superviolets. There’s only six of them.”\n“Isn’t that the class with the girl always spilling out of her top? Lana?\nAna?” It was one thing when women pursued Gavin, but that girl had been\nthrowing herself at him since she was fourteen.\nThe White looked pained. “We have spoken with that one a few\ntimes.”\n“Look,” Gavin said, “the tide is going out, I have to catch Karris. I’ll\nteach that class next time you see me. No excuses, no fight.”\n“You give me your word?”\n“I give you my word.”\nThe White smiled like a sated cat. “You enjoy teaching more than you\nadmit, don’t you, Gavin?”\n“Gah!” Gavin said. “Goodbye!”\nBefore she could say anything else, he sprinted for the edge of the\ntower and leapt into space.\nChapter 8\nKip was staring at Isa’s body.

After she’d seen the soldiers kill Ram, she’d\nlooked back at Kip. She’d been looking for safety, for protection. She’d\nlooked at him, and she’d known he couldn’t save her.\nA sound and a sudden absence next to him made Kip tear his eyes\naway from Isa. Sanson was running toward the village. Sanson wasn’t\nsmart, but he’d always been practical. He hadn’t done anything so dumb in\nhis life. But Kip couldn’t blame him. They’d never seen anyone die, either.\nBut there was no way the soldiers could fail to see Sanson, and now\nhe’d die too if Kip didn’t do anything.\nKip had stood around enough, doing nothing while his friends died. He\ndidn’t think. He acted. He ran—the other way.\nKip hated running. When Ram ran, it was like watching a hunting\nhound speed after a deer, all hard lean muscles and flowing strength. When\nIsa ran, it was like watching the deer flee, all easy grace and surprising\nspeed. Kip running was like a milk cow lumbering out to pasture. Still, no\none was expecting him.\nHe made it to Ram’s body and to full speed before he heard a shout.\nHe crashed up the bank of the river, barely slowing. Once he got his mass\nmoving, it took a lot to stop him.\nA dead tree, its trunk rising to shin level, mostly hidden in the long\ngrasses, counted as a lot. Kip’s shin cracked into wood in midstride, and he\npitched forward. He skidded on his face and then flopped over like a fish.\nPain blurred his vision black and red. For a second, he thought he was\ngoing to throw up, then he went lightheaded. He looked down, fully\nexpecting bone to be jutting out of his leg. Nothing. Wimp.\nTears streamed from his eyes. His hands were bleeding again,\nfingernails torn. He heard the men on the bridge shouting. They’d lost him\nfor the moment, but horsemen were coming. He wasn’t fifty paces away.\nThe grasses were only knee high. The horsemen would see him any second\nnow, and then he’d die. Just like Isa.\nHe staggered to his feet, his shin afire, tears blurring the world. He\nhated himself. Crying because he fell down. Because he was clumsy.\nBecause he was weak.\nThe horsemen gave a yell as he stood. Kip had seen King Garadul’s\nhorsemen pass through town before, but never in full battle harness. When\nthey passed through Rekton, their harnesses were always stowed. Rekton\nwasn’t even big enough to be worth showing off for. The two horsemen\ngalloping toward Kip were both part of the lower cavalry. Barely able to\nafford their own ponies, weapons, and armor, they served only during the\ndry season.

Lighter and cheaper\nthan the full plate worn by the lords and King Garadul’s Mirrormen, these\nlong jackets bore six narrow rows of thin, overlapping plates down the\nfront, with four-to-one riveted mail for the sleeves and back. Each wore a\ntoep, a round helmet with a spike on top and vulture plumes sticking up\nbeside them. A mail aventail draped down over the shoulders, protecting the\nneck and giving double-thickness mail over the upper chest. Neither carried\na lance. Instead, they bore vechevorals, sickle-swords. The weapons had a\nlong handle like an ax and a crescent-moon-shaped blade at the end, with\nthe inward bowl-shaped side being the cutting edge. The horsemen were\njostling each other for the better line, laughing, competing to see who\nwould hack the child.\nThe laughter did it. It was one thing to give up and die, it was\nsomething else to let some giggling morons murder you. But there was no\ntime. The horsemen had reached a full gallop, trampling the tender, radiant\ngreen grass the way they would trample Kip. They finally split, one\nswitching his vechevoral to his left hand so they could cut Kip down\nsimultaneously.\nKip lashed out, jumping, determined to at least punch one stupid grin\nto oblivion before he died. It was a poor jump, and far too early. But as\nKip’s body rose to meet the extended lances, a radiant green mass rose\nthrough him. He felt energy rush out from his body. A dozen blades of grass\nrose through his hand, with his punch, tearing his skin as they ripped out of\nhim. They thickened to the width of boar spears as green light poured from\nhim, and became blades in truth. As he threw them into the air, Kip was\nthrown back down to the ground. The butts of a dozen radiant jade spears\nthunked into the ground around him.\nThe horsemen barely had time to jerk on their reins before they\nrammed into a wall of spears. Their vechevorals went flying out of their\nhands as their horses were impaled, lifted off the ground by the angle of the\nspears, snapping those in front with the force of their impact, only to find\nmore behind those and be impaled further. The riders were thrown from\ntheir saddles into the waiting green spears. The lighter of the two caught\nand was held, five feet off the ground. The heavier rider snapped off the\nspears and fell flat on his back beside Kip.\nFor a long, stupid moment, Kip had no idea what had happened. He\nheard a shout from the bridge: “Drafter! Green drafter!” He looked at his\nhands. Radiant green was slowly leaking from his bloody fingertips—the\nexact shade of the grass, and the spears. There were cuts at his knuckles,\nwrists, and under his nails, like something had ripped the skin on its way\nout. A scent like resin and cedar filled the air.\nKip felt woozy.

There were four spears through his body, but\nthey were disappearing now, bowing under their own weight, shimmering\nas if on some tiny level they were boiling away into nothingness. The\nsoldier sucked in a breath. The movement made the two spears through his\nchest shift. The soldier whimpered and cursed, and slowly the spears\ndisappeared, leaving only chalky green grit to mix with his blood. Despite\nthe mail hanging askew across the man’s face, Kip could see the gleam of\nhis dark eyes, shining with tears.\nFor a few moments, Kip had felt connected. The green was unity,\ngrowth, wildness, wholeness. But as it slipped from his fingers, the great\nspears bowing like wilting flowers, he felt alone once more. Scared. The\nsmaller rider who’d been held off the ground was released with a thump and\nthe clanging of mail as he hit the ground. The spears shimmered, dissipated,\nand blew apart like heavy dust.\nKip heard weeping. It was the bigger rider, still cursing. The man drew\nin a great breath and abruptly coughed, spitting blood all through the mail\nover his face. He turned over onto his stomach, and more blood poured out\nof his broken toep.\nKip turned away. He looked toward the bridge. The king’s soldiers\nwere gone. Kip could only guess that they had assumed that some trained\ndrafter had shown up to rescue him. Maybe they would wait until dark to\ncome after him, or maybe they had their own drafter back at camp. Either\nway, Kip had to run, fast.\nHe turned on wobbly legs, fingers stinging, his brain thick with grief\nand exhaustion, and stumbled toward the orange grove.\nChapter 9\nGavin Guile plunged past classrooms and barracks and knew that not a few\npeople would rush to the windows to see what came next. In fact, this was\nthe first day of drafting classes for the dims, so he was probably about to be\na perfect illustration of one of the primary lessons every magister taught.\nThe magister would light a candle and instruct the students to\ncomment on what was happening. This always gave the magisters plenty of\nopportunities to abuse the bewildered children, who would invariably say,\n“It’s burning.” “But what do you mean by this word, ‘burning’?” “Uh, it’s\nburning?” The eventual point was that every fire began on something\ntangible and left almost nothing tangible. When a candle burned, where did\nall the tallow go? Into power—power we experience as light and heat, with\nsome residue—whether much or little depended on how efficiently the\ncandle burned.\nMagic was the converse. It began with power—light or heat—and its\nexpression was always physical. You made luxin. You could touch it, hold it\n—or be held by it.\nHalfway down, Gavin drafted a blue bonnet and a harness from the\ncold blue of the sky with some green added for flexibility. It unfurled with a\npop and slowed his fall. When he was a few paces from the ground, he"

When he was a few paces from the ground, he\nthrew down blastwaves of sub-red that slowed him enough that he could\nland lightly in the street. The bonnet dissolved into blue dust and green grit\nand a smell like resin, chalk, and cedar. He strode toward the docks.\nHe found her within minutes, just arriving at the docks herself, a bag\nslung over her shoulder. She’d changed from her Blackguard uniform, but\nwas still wearing pants. Karris only wore a dress once a year, for the\nLuxlords’ Ball, where it was required. She’d also somehow dyed her hair\nalmost black so as not to stand out so much in Tyrea.\nOf course, it was impossible not to stand out with those eyes, like an\nemerald sky adorned with ruby stars. Karris was a green/red bichrome—\nalmost a polychrome. It was an “almost” she’d hated all her life. Her red arc\nextended into the sub-red so far that she could draft fire, but she couldn’t\ndraft stable sub-red luxin. She’d failed the examination. Twice. It didn’t\nmatter that she could draft more sub-red than most sub-red drafters, or that\nshe was the fastest drafter Gavin had ever seen. She wasn’t a polychrome.\nBut on the other hand, polychromes were too valuable to be allowed to\njoin the Blackguard.\n“Karris!” Gavin called out, jogging to catch up with her.\nShe stopped and waited for him, a quizzical look on her face. “Lord\nPrism,” she said in greeting, ever proper in public—and still, evidently, not\nhaving read the note.\nHe fell in step beside her. “So,” he said. “Tyrea.”\n“The armpit of the Seven Satrapies itself,” she said.\nFive years, five great purposes, Gavin. He’d given himself purposes\nsince he’d first become Prism as a focus and distraction. Seven goals for\neach seven-year stint. And the first was—the first had always been—to tell\nKarris the whole truth. A truth that might ruin everything. What I did. Why.\nAnd why I broke our betrothal fifteen years ago.\nAnd you can rot in that blue hell forever for that, brother.\n“Important mission,” he said.\nShe shrugged. “How come the important missions never take me to\nRuthgar or the Blood Forest?”\nHe chuckled. Ruthgar was the most civilized and prosperous nation in\nthe Seven Satrapies, and of course, as a green drafter, Karris would feel a\nstrong fondness for the Verdant Plains. Alternately, the Blood Forest was\nwhere her people were from, and she hadn’t walked among the redwoods\nsince she was young. “Why don’t you make it a quick trip, then? I can scull\nyou there.”\n“To Tyrea? It’s on the opposite side of the sea!”\n“It’s on my way to a color wight I’ve got to deal with.” And I may not\nhave many more chances to be near you.\nShe scowled. “Seems like there’ve been a lot of wights recently.”\n“It always seems like there’ve been a lot recently. Remember last\nsummer, when there were six in six days, and then none for three months?”"

Like most drafters, she felt a\nspecial outrage when a wight had come from her own color.\n“A blue.”\n“Ah. So I’m guessing you’ll be right on your way.” Karris knew about\nGavin’s special hatred for blue wights. “Wait, you’re hunting a blue\nwight… in Tyrea?” she asked, turning to look at him with her haunting\ngreen eyes with red flecks.\n“Outside Ru, actually.” He cleared his throat.\nShe laughed. At thirty-two, she had the faintest lines on her face—\nmore frown lines than smile lines, sadly, but she still had the same dimples.\nIt just wasn’t fair. After years of knowing her, a woman’s beauty shouldn’t\nbe able to reach straight into a man’s chest and squeeze the breath out of\nhim. Especially not when he could never have her. “Tyrea’s a thousand\nleagues from Ru!”\n“Couple hundred at most. If you stop wasting daylight arguing with\nme, I might be able to get you there before nightfall.”\n“Gavin, that’s impossible. Even for you. And even if it were possible, I\ncouldn’t ask you—”\n“You didn’t. I volunteered. Now tell me, would you really prefer to\nspend two weeks on a corvette? It’s clear today, but you know how those\nstorms come up. I heard the last time you sailed, you got so green you could\ndraft off your own skin.”\n“Gavin…”\n“Important mission, isn’t it?” he asked.\n“The White’s going to kill you for this. She’s got an ulcer named after\nyou, you know. Literally.”\n“I’m the Prism. There’s got to be some advantages. And I like\nsculling.”\n“You’re impossible,” she said, surrendering.\n“We all have our special little talents.”\nChapter 10\nKip woke to the smell of oranges and smoke. It was still hot, the evening\nsun slipping through the leaves to tickle his face. Somehow, he had made it\nto one of the orange groves before collapsing. He looked down the long,\nperfect rows for any soldiers before he stood up. His head still felt foggy,\nbut the smell of smoke drove away any thoughts of himself.\nAs he approached the edge of the orange grove, the stench grew\nstronger, the air thick. Kip caught flashes of light in the distance. He\nemerged from the grove and saw the sun setting behind the alcaldesa’s\nmansion, the tallest building in Rekton. As he watched, the sun went from a\nbeautiful deep red to something darker, angry. Then Kip saw the light again\n—fire. Thick smoke billowed suddenly into the sky, and as if on signal,\nsmoke billowed up from a dozen places in the town. In moments, the smoke\nblossomed to raging fires towering dozens of paces above the roofs.\nKip heard screams. A ruin of an old statue lay in the orange grove.

Someone had long\nago carved steps into the broken neck. The head was tall enough to watch\nthe sun rise over the orange trees. It was a favorite spot for couples. Kip\nclambered up the steps.\nThe town was on fire. Hundreds of foot soldiers surrounded the town\nin a vast, loose circle. As the flames drove some townsfolk from their hiding\nplace, Kip saw King Garadul’s horsemen set their lances. It was old Miss\nDelclara and her six sons, the quarrymen. The biggest one, Micael, was\ncarrying her over one burly shoulder. He was shouting at the others, but Kip\ncouldn’t hear what he was saying. The brothers ran together toward the\nriver, apparently hoping to find safety there.\nThey weren’t going to make it.\nThe horsemen lowered their lances as they reached a full gallop,\nmaybe thirty paces away from the fleeing family.\n“Now!” Micael yelled. Kip could hear it from where he stood.\nFive of the brothers dropped to the ground. Zalo was too slow. A lance\npunched through his back and sent him sprawling. Two of the others were\nskewered as their pursuers quickly adjusted their aim and caught the men\nlow to the ground. Micael’s pursuer dipped his lance too, but missed. He\ncaught the ground instead, and the lance stuck.\nThe horseman didn’t release his lance in time, and was slammed out of\nhis saddle by the force of his own charge.\nMicael ran over to the fallen soldier and drew the man’s own\nvechevoral. With a savage chop, despite the layers of mail, he nearly cut the\nman’s head off.\nBut the other horsemen had drawn rein already, and in seconds there\nwas a forest of flashing steel blocking Micael, his brother, and his mother\nfrom Kip’s view.\nKip felt like he was going to throw up. At some signal he didn’t see or\nhear, the horsemen formed back up and charged off toward new victims in\nthe distance. Kip was only glad that they were far enough away he couldn’t\nrecognize them.\nAround the rest of the town, the foot soldiers were moving in.\nMother! Kip had been watching the town burn for several minutes, and\nhe hadn’t thought about anything. His mother was in there. He had to go to\nher.\nHow was he going to get into the town? Even if he could get past the\nsoldiers and the fire, was his mother even still alive? The king’s men had\nseen the direction he had run away, too. They would think that the “drafter”\nthey’d seen earlier was the only threat in the whole area. Surely they would\nbe watching for him. In fact, they might have men out hunting him now.\nIf so, perching on the highest point in the orange grove was probably\nnot the smartest thing to do.\nAs if on signal, Kip heard a branch snap. It might have been a deer.\nEvening was coming on after all. There were lots of deer in the orange\ngroves after—\nNot thirty paces away, someone cursed.\nTalking deer?\nKip dropped to his stomach. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move."

Just like they killed the Delclaras. Micael\nDelclara was big. Tough as old oak. And they’d slaughtered him.\nMove, Kip, just move. His heart was a riot in his chest. He was\nshaking. He was taking tiny breaths, way too fast. Slow down, Kip.\nBreathe. He took a deep breath and tore his eyes away from his trembling\nhands.\nThere was a cave not far from here. Kip had found his mother there\nonce, after she’d disappeared for three days. There’d long been rumors of\nsmugglers’ caves in the area, and whenever his mother ran out of haze and\nmoney she went looking for them. She’d finally gotten lucky about two\nyears ago and found enough of the drug that she hadn’t come home. When\nKip had found her, she hadn’t eaten for days. She’d nearly died. He’d\noverheard someone saying aloud that they wished she had, for his sake.\nReaching the ground, Kip started jogging, trying to keep the ruin\nbetween himself and the man he’d heard. He ran about as fast as Sanson\nwould run if Sanson carried another Sanson on his back. So Kip jogged,\ntrying to be quiet, zigzagging through the straight rows of trees. Then he\nheard a sound that froze his bones to the marrow: dogs barking.\nFueled by fear, Kip found a flat-out run. He ignored the burning in his\nlegs, the stabbing in his lungs. He was already headed toward the river; the\ncave was on its banks. He heard a soldier shouting curses, maybe two\nhundred paces back, maybe less. “Keep those dogs on the lead! You want to\nfind a drafter while it’s still light out?”\nIt was getting darker by the minute. So that was why he was still alive.\nWith all colors muted by darkness, drafters weren’t nearly as powerful at\nnight. And between the smoke and a bank of black clouds rolling in, the sky\nwas darkening faster than normal. If they’d let the dogs go, they’d have run\nhim down already. But with darkness coming on so fast, they might feel\nsafe to let them go at any minute.\nSuddenly, Kip was on the riverbank. He stepped on one pant leg and\nalmost fell down, barely catching himself with one hand. He stopped. The\ncave was upstream, away from town, not two hundred paces away. He\npicked up two stones that fit nicely in his hands. If he had the cave to\nprotect his sides and back, he could… What? Die slowly?\nHe looked at the rocks in his hands. Rocks. Against soldiers and war\ndogs. He was stupid. Insane. He looked at the rocks again, then threw one\nonto the opposite bank of the river, downstream. He threw the second rock\nfarther. Then he grabbed two more, rubbed them against his body, and\nthrew them as far as he could. The last one crashed through the branches of\na willow tree. Lousy throw.\nNo time to mourn his ineptitude.

Kip’s scent trail already was headed\nupstream—the direction he did need to go. He’d just have to hope. It was a\npathetic attempt, but he had nothing else. He kept moving upstream up the\nbank, trying to ignore the sound of the barking dogs closing in. Then he\nstepped into the river, careful not to let his clothes touch any dry rocks. The\nplace where he had come to the river was a bend, so soon he was out of the\nline of sight.\n“Let the dogs go!” the same voice shouted.\nThen Kip was opposite the cave entrance. It was invisible from the\nriver, obscured by boulders that had fallen in front of the opening. But as\nsoon as he stepped out of the river, he’d be leaving scent for the dogs, and a\nvisual trail of wet rocks for the soldiers. He couldn’t get out of the water.\nNot yet. He looked up at the black clouds.\nDon’t just sit there. Give me some rain!\n“What’s the problem? What’s wrong with them?” the soldier\ndemanded.\n“They’re fighting dogs, sir, not trackers. I’m not even certain they’re\non the drafter’s trail.”\nKip kept pushing upstream another hundred paces where the bend in\nthe river straightened out and a tree had fallen down the bank into the water.\nIt wouldn’t do anything for the scent trail, but it would hide the water he\nwas dripping. He cut up the bank and then stopped. If he headed back\ndownstream, he’d be going closer to the men hunting him. But the soldier’s\nmention of other trails had put a small desperate hope in Kip’s breast. Other\ntrails meant maybe other fresh trails. And if it weren’t for the dogs, the cave\nwould be the safest place to spend the night.\nSwallowing so his heart didn’t jump out of his throat, Kip turned\ndownstream, toward the cave. He thought he felt a cool prick on his skin.\nRain? He looked up at the black clouds, but it must have been his\nimagination. He came to the spot overlooking the cave’s entrance.\nTwo soldiers were standing almost directly below him. Two others\nwere on the opposite bank. There was one war dog on each side. Either\ndog’s head would have come up to Kip’s shoulder, easily. They both wore\nstudded leather coats like horse armor without the saddle. Kip dropped to\nthe ground.\n“Sir, if I may?” one of the men said. Apparently getting permission,\nthe soldier said, “The drafter came straight to the river, then veered sharply\nupstream before going into the water? He knows we’re following him. I\nthink he doubled back and went downstream.”\n“With us so close behind?” the commander asked.\n“He must have heard the dogs.”\nWhich made Kip think of something else: dogs can smell scents on the\nwind too. Not just on the ground. Kip’s throat tightened. He hadn’t even\nthought about the wind. It was blowing from the southwest. His path had\ntaken him east and then north when the river turned—the perfect direction.\nIf he’d gone downstream, toward town, the dogs would have smelled him"

If the commander thought about it, he’d surely realize that\ntoo.\n“Rain’s coming. We might only have one shot at this.” The commander\npaused. “Let’s make it fast.” He whistled and gestured for the men on the\nother side of the river to head downstream. They took off at a jog.\nKip’s heart started beating again. He slipped down the bank beside two\ngreat boulders. There was a narrow space between the two. It looked like it\nwent in for about four paces and then stopped, but Kip knew that it turned\nsharply. He never would have discovered it the first time if it hadn’t been\nfor the pungent, sickly sweet odor of haze floating out. Orholam knew how\nhis mother had ever found it.\nNow, even knowing it was there, Kip almost didn’t have the courage to\npush between those rocks. There was something wrong, though. It wasn’t as\ndark as it should be. It was fully night outside and Kip was blocking the\nentrance, so someone was already inside, and they had a lantern.\nKip froze again until he heard the sound of the war dogs change pitch.\nThey’d found the rocks he’d thrown across the river. That meant it was only\na matter of time until they discovered his fraud. The darkness and tightness\nwere suffocating. He had to move, one way or the other.\nHe pushed around the corner and into the open space of the smuggler’s\ncave. There were two figures sitting in the wan light of a lantern: Sanson\nand Kip’s mother. Both were covered in blood.\nChapter 11\nKip couldn’t help but cry out. His mother was seated against the wall of the\ncave, her once-blue dress dyed black and red with blood dried and fresh.\nLina’s dark hair was matted, darker than normal, stringy with blood. The\nright side of her face was pristine, perfect. All the blood was coming from\nthe left side of her head, traveling down her hair like a wick, blooming on\nher dress. Sanson sat next to her, his eyes closed, head back, clothes almost\nas gory.\nAt Kip’s cry, his mother’s eyes fluttered. There was a huge dent in the\nside of her head. Orholam be merciful, her skull was shattered. She stared\nin his direction for several moments before she found him. Her eyes were a\nhorror to behold, the pupil of her left eye was dilated, the right a tight\npinprick. And the whites of both were completely bloodshot. “Kip,” she\nsaid. “Never thought I’d be so happy to see you.”\n“Love you too, mother,” he said, trying to keep his tone light.\n“My fault,” she said. Her eyes fluttered and closed.\nKip’s heart seized. Was she dead? Before today, he’d never seen\nanyone die. Orholam, this was his mother! He looked at Sanson, who\nlooked healthy, despite all the blood on his clothes. “I tried, Kip. The\nalcaldesa wouldn’t listen. I told her—”"

I told her—”\n“Even his own family didn’t believe him,” Kip’s mother said, her eyes\nstill closed. “Even when the soldiers rode down his mother and split his\nbrother open, Adan Marta stood there, arguing how our satrap wouldn’t\npossibly do such a thing to his own people. Only Sanson ran away. Who\nwould’ve thought he was the smart one in that family?”\n“Mother! Enough!” Kip’s voice came out whiny, childish.\n“You came back, though, didn’t you, Sanson? Tried to save me, unlike\nmy own son. Too bad he didn’t try to help me like you tried to help your\nfamily, or I might still have a chance.”\nHer words touched some deep well of rage. Potent, but uncontrollable.\nHe pushed it down, pushed the tears back. “Mother. Stop. You’re dying.”\n“Sanson says you’re a drafter now. Funny,” she said bitterly. “All your\nlife you’re a disappointment, and you learn to draft today. Too late for any\nof us.” With effort, she took a deep breath, then opened her eyes and fixed\nher gaze on Kip, taking a little while to focus. “Kill him, Kip. Kill the\nbastard.” She lifted a narrow, filigreed rosewood jewelry case as long as\nKip’s forearm from the floor of the cave beside her. Kip had never seen it\nbefore.\nKip took the case and opened it. There was a dagger inside, double-\nedged, of an odd material, starkly white like ivory, with a thread of black\nwinding down the center to the point, and no other adornment save for\nseven diamonds embedded in the blade itself. It was the most beautiful\nthing Kip had ever seen, and he didn’t care. He had no idea what the blade\nwas worth, but the case it had come in alone would have paid for a month\nof his mother’s binges. “Mother, what is this?”\n“And I thought Sanson was slow,” she said, hard, sneering, dying,\nafraid. “Put it in his rotten heart. Make that bastard suffer. Make him pay\nfor this.”\n“Mother, what are you saying?” Kip asked, despairing. Me, kill King\nGaradul?\nShe laughed, and the motion made a fresh wash of blood spill down\nher head. “You’re a stupid, stupid boy, Kip. But maybe a dull sword can go\nwhere a sharp one wouldn’t be allowed.” Her head bobbed. Her breathing\nwas getting labored. Her head drooped to her chest, and Kip thought she\nwas dead, but her eyes opened once more, only one focusing, locking Kip\nin her glare. Her fingernails dug into his forearm painfully. “You go, go\ntrain to be a drafter, go to the…” She seemed to be searching for the word\n“Chromeria,” but couldn’t find it. She noticed, looked furious, afraid. It was\nevidence she really was dying. “You learn what you need, but don’t you\nforget me. Don’t you forget this. Don’t listen to him, you hear me? He’s a"

How\ncould she have known him?\n“Kip, if you ever loved me, avenge me. Swear it by your worthless\nsoul, Kip. Swear it, or I swear to Orholam I’ll haunt you. I won’t… let…”\nShe lost her train of thought.\nKip looked over at Sanson, who stared back silently, horrified. Kip’s\nmother’s fingernails dug in deeper, and her seeing eye seemed almost\naflame, demanding his attention, his promise. He said, “I swear to avenge\nyou, mother, by my very soul.”\nSomething like peace stole over her features, softening the hard planes.\nThen she laughed quietly, satisfied, somehow cruel—until her laughter\nstopped. Her hand dropped from Kip’s forearm, leaving bloody tracks. “I\nwon’t let you down, mother, I’ll go right—”\nShe’s dead.\nKip stared at her woodenly, inexplicably numb.

I tried to get her\nout. I was too late.” He was right on the verge of breaking down. Kip was\nan ass.\n“No, Sanson. No, I’m sorry. Don’t talk like that. It’s not your fault.\nListen to me. We need to act right now, not think. We’re in danger. Are you\nhurt?”\nSanson’s eyes cleared and his chin lifted. He met Kip’s gaze. “No, this\nblood is all—no, I’m fine.”\n“Then we need to go right now, while it’s dark and raining. They’ve\ngot dogs. They can track us. It’s our only chance.”\n“But Kip, where are we going to go?” Odd. Just like that, Kip was the\nleader. Was it that he’d found some new well of strength, or was Sanson just\nthat weak? No, don’t even think like that, Kip. He trusts you. Can’t that be\nenough?\nWhat if I’m not worthy of trust?\n“I’m going to be a drafter,” Kip said. “I guess. So we need to get to the\nsea. We should be able to find a ship in Garriston that’s going to the\nChromeria.”\nSanson’s eyes widened, obviously thinking about what Kip’s mother\nhad sworn him to, but he said nothing but, “How do we get to Garriston?”\n“We float the river first.” Kip realized then that he’d lost the purse\nMaster Danavis had given him.

He blinked rapidly. “I know it’s stupid, Sanson.” He couldn’t\nlook his friend in the eyes. “But I don’t have any other ideas. Do you?”\nSanson paused for a long moment. “I saw some dead wood on the\nbank that might work,” he said finally, and Kip knew it was his way of\ntelling Kip he trusted him.\n“Then let’s go,” Kip said.\n“Kip, do you want to… I don’t know, say goodbye?” Sanson nodded in\nthe direction of Kip’s mother.\nKip swallowed, holding the knife-case in a white-knuckled grip. And\nsay what? I’m sorry I was a failure, a disappointment? That I loved you,\neven if you never loved me? “No,” he said. “Let’s go.”\nChapter 12\nThe boys crept out of the cave. Kip went first. Apparently that was the price\nof becoming the leader. Kip had been under these same stars on the river\ndozens of times, but tonight there was hunger in the cool air. The wind had\nchanged direction, and now the smells of the light, misting rain opening the\nearth mingled with woodsmoke and the faint, fresh fragrance of the oranges\nripening on the trees. Always before, that scent had cheered Kip. Tonight it\nwas faint, ephemeral, as fragile as Kip’s chances.\nThey made it to the river’s edge without seeing any soldiers. They’d\nfloated the river before, all four of them grabbing a few planks of wood for\nextra buoyancy, but mostly just lying back and letting the current carry\nthem. But they’d always waited until late fall, when the river was lower.\nEven then, they’d all sported dozens of scrapes and bruises from the rocks\nthey couldn’t avoid. It was the middle of summer now, and though the river\nwas lower than in the spring, it was still high and swift. That meant they\nwould be able to float over rocks that would scrape them in the fall, but the\nrocks they couldn’t avoid they would hit much faster.\nSanson found the sticks he’d seen before while Kip waited anxiously,\ntrying to peer downriver for any hint of the soldiers. The clouds over the\nvillage were glowing orange, lit by the fires below them. Sanson returned\nwith a few branches, not enough for both of them. The boys looked at each\nother. “You take them,” Kip whispered. “I float better than you.”\n“What do we do if they see us?” Sanson asked.\nKip’s nerve almost failed him as he thought about it.

After all, we shouldn’t be the only bodies in the\nwater. Actually that wasn’t true; this far upstream, they should be the only\nbodies in the water. If any of the soldiers realized that, the boys would\nquickly become real corpses.\nThe water was cold even this far from the mountains, but it wasn’t\nfreezing. Kip sat down in it, and the current began pulling him toward town.\nSanson followed. They were pulled around the first bend and approaching\nthe spot where Kip had first come to the river when he saw the flaw in his\nplan.\nTo play dead meant that in the sections of river that were most\ndangerous, the places where he and Sanson would most want to see or listen\nto find out if they’d been discovered, they’d have to keep their ears\nsubmerged and their eyes fixed on the clouds above. If they were\ndiscovered, Kip’s plan guaranteed that they wouldn’t know it until too late.\nThey should get out of the water. He couldn’t do this. Kip glanced\nback. Sanson was already lying back, floating on his back, ears covered,\nlimbs loose. He’d been pulled over to the other side of the river, and the\ncurrent had already brought his lighter body even with Kip. Kip’s heart\nhammered. If he got out now, Sanson wouldn’t know it. Kip wouldn’t be\nable to grab his friend without making so much noise that it would rouse\nanyone within hundreds of paces.\nA voice spoke out of the gloom on the riverbank. “Yes, Your Majesty.\nWe think the drafter climbed up into that tree. The dogs tracked him that far\nand lost him.”\nKip saw the torch first. Someone was approaching the bank of the\nriver, not five paces downstream. His first thought—to run like hell—would\nget him killed. He swept his arms once, twice, paddling downstream, then\nhe lay back. The cold water closed over his ears, muffling all sound except\nthe desperate thumping of his pulse.\nThe bank here was raised a pace and a half, high enough that even\nlying back, Kip could see the man. Kip wasn’t two paces away, and the\ntorch the man held illuminated an imperious face in its flickering orange\nlight. Even warmed in torchlight, there was something fundamentally cold\nabout that face, an unpleasant smirk hiding in the corner of that mouth. The\nking—for Kip had no doubt, even in half a second of seeing him, that this\nman was King Garadul—was not yet out of his twenties but already half\nbald, with the rest of his hair combed to his shoulders. He had a prominent\nnose over a tight, immaculate beard and thick black brows. The king stared\nupstream, a vein on his forehead visible even in the torchlight, gazing at the\nopposite bank where Kip had crossed. His angry question was barely more\nthan a murmur through the water closed around Kip’s ears."

His angry question was barely more\nthan a murmur through the water closed around Kip’s ears.\nThen the king turned just as Kip was starting to get downstream of\nhim. And he turned left, toward Kip. Kip didn’t move a muscle, but it\nwasn’t because he was being smart. He felt warmth blooming in the cold\nwater between his legs.\nIt was only the torch directly between the king and Kip that saved the\nboys. His eyes went right over them, but blinded by that light in the\ndarkness, he saw nothing. He turned, swore something, and disappeared.\nKip floated down the river, head back, almost disbelieving that he was\nalive. The water was cold around him, the stars were pinpricks in Orholam’s\nmantle above. They were more beautiful than he’d ever realized. Each star\nhad its own color, its own hue; brilliant rubies, startling sapphires, and even\nhere and there an elusive emerald. For perhaps twenty paces, Kip floated in\nutter peace, enrapt by the beauty.\nThen he hit a rock. It struck his foot first and spun him around so he\nwas floating sideways. Then another rock, mostly submerged, caught his\nshirt and flipped him facedown in the water. He gasped and flailed, freezing\nwith fear as his head came clear of the water and he realized how loud he’d\nbeen.\nA little way down the river, Sanson had pulled his head out of the\nwater and was staring at Kip with horror. How could Kip make so much\nnoise? Kip looked away, ashamed. They floated in silence for a long\nminute, staring into the darkness, waiting to see if any soldiers would\nappear. They did their best to avoid the rocks, legs pointed downstream,\nhands paddling in little circles to keep themselves afloat. But no one came.\nThey floated as close together as they could, though Kip knew it was\nunwise. Two bodies floating separately might not be remarkable, but two\nfloating side by side? Still, he didn’t move away. Silence settled over the\nboys as they came closer and closer to the bridge where their friends had\ndied that morning. It seemed so long ago now.\nAnd then Kip saw her, lying on the riverbank. The soldiers who’d\nmurdered Isa had pulled their arrows out of her body. But aside from\nturning her over, they hadn’t moved her corpse. She lay on her back, eyes\nopen, head turned left toward Kip, dark hair waving in the river. One arm\nwas raised over her head, not drifting in the current but instead stiff as a\nfelled tree. The underside of her arm and even her face was a horrific dark\npurple with pooled blood.\nKip put his feet down on the slick rocks of the riverbed to go to her. He\nwas about to stand when some sixth sense stopped him. He hesitated and,\nstill lying in the water, looked around as much as he could.\nThere! Standing on the bridge, with only his head visible, the soldier\nkept watch. So they weren’t stupid. They’d figured that whoever this drafter\nwas that they’d run into earlier, he’d have the decency to come back and\nbury his friends.\nThe current was carrying Kip downstream. No decision was a\ndecision."

No decision was a\ndecision.\nBut what could he do? Face soldiers? If there was one, there might be\nten, and if ten, maybe a hundred. Kip was no fighter, he was a child. He was\nfat, weak. One man would be one man too many.\nKip turned away from Isa’s corpse and lay back in the water once\nmore. He didn’t want to remember her like this anyway. A knot formed in\nhis throat, so hard and so tight it threatened to strangle him. Only his fear of\nthe soldier above kept him from crying as he floated under Green Bridge.\nHe didn’t even think of the dagger in its ornate case strapped to his\nback until they were far downstream. He could’ve tried; he could’ve at least\ngotten out of the water and taken a look. Isa deserved more.\nSoon they were drifting into town, where the river flowed in a\nnarrower, deeper channel, lined on each side with great rocks and crossed at\nintervals by sturdy wood bridges.\nParts of the town were still on fire, though Kip didn’t know whether\nthat was because they were built of materials that were less flammable or\nbecause the fire had spread more slowly through some areas and was only\nreaching some buildings now. Soon they encountered their first corpse. A\nhorse. Still harnessed to a wagon full of late-season oranges, it had been\ntrapped in a section of the town that was now smoldering. Maddened by the\nfire, the mare had leapt into the river. The wagon had followed and either\ncrushed or drowned it, spilling oranges everywhere.\nKip thought it might be the Sendina family’s horse and wagon. Sanson,\nnever overly sentimental, grabbed a few oranges from the wreckage of the\nwagon and stuffed them in his pockets.\nSanson was probably right. Kip hadn’t eaten all day, not that he’d\nnoticed until now, but he was starving. Despite feeling like he might throw\nup, he reached over the half-submerged horse and grabbed a few oranges\ntoo.\nThey came closer to the water market, and it kept getting hotter. Kip\nheard strange screams. There were fires still burning ahead. The water\nmarket was a small, circular lake that was dredged regularly to keep a\nuniform depth. It was said that once both river and town had been much\nlarger. The river, supposedly, had been navigable from below the falls all\nthe way to the Cerulean Sea, and then from Rekton all the way to the\nmountains, bringing traders from all of the Seven Satrapies, hungry for\nTyrea’s famous oranges and other citrus fruits. Now, only the smallest flat-\nbottomed boats could make the trip downstream and the number of robbers\nhappy to relieve traders of anything valuable convinced most farmers to\nsend their oranges on the slower, heavily armed, and much less profitable\ncaravans. Even the smallest, hardest, and thickest-skinned oranges sent by\ncaravans over land would rot long before they could reach the distant courts\nwhere nobles and satraps would pay a fortune for such a delicacy. So almost\nevery year some young farmer tried the river, and a few times they got\nthrough, all the way to Garriston, and came home with a fortune—if they"

The townsfolk kept it for pride and for their own use.\nAll the roads were already built around the water market, all their\nstorehouses surrounded, so they maintained the barges and floated around\nthe circle every market day according to rules and an etiquette that no\noutsider could hope to understand. In the middle of the water market was an\nisland, connected by a drawbridge to the north shore.\nAs they came fully in sight of the island, Kip saw where the screams\nhad come from. The drawbridge was down, and the island was filled with\nhundreds of animals trapped by the fires closing in around them. Even the\ndrawbridge, straining with the weight of dozens of horses, sheep, pigs, and\na grotesque carpet of rats, was smoking at one end. Eyes rolling in fear, the\nbrick-maker’s draft horse looked like it was on the verge of bolting, though\nwhere it would go was impossible to say. The animals filled the island to\noverflowing; they were packed shoulder to flank over the entire little circle\nand the bridge.\nKip was so absorbed in the spectacle that he began floating right into\nthe middle of the river between the docks and the island.\n“Master, it’s so hot,” a young voice said behind and above Kip.\nKip thrashed and turned. On the raised bank of the market circle stood\na young man a little older than Kip. The young man wore only a red\nloincloth. His curly black hair and bare chest glistened with sweat. He was\nlooking over his shoulder, apparently to a man behind him. Kip could see\nnothing of that man, but he didn’t wait. Kip thought they must have heard\nhim when he thrashed, but apparently the roar of the fires drowned out the\nsound.\nMotioning to Sanson, Kip swam toward the wall. Sanson followed.\nThe young man’s master said something, but it was lost in the noise. Kip\nand Sanson clung to the wall with their bodies pressed as close to it as they\ncould, looking up.\n“Watch this,” they heard the man say. A whirling lasso of fire spun into\nview over their heads and then flicked forward. It wrapped around one post\nof the drawbridge and stuck there. The rest of the rope flared out of\nexistence, but that length stayed, smoldering, little wisps of flame escaping\nagainst the wood, splinters turning black and curling back, smoking.\nKip was at once horrified and captivated. In all the years he’d spent\nhelping Master Danavis, the drafter had never done anything like this.\n“Now you try,” the man said.\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Kip looked over at Sanson. Both of\nthem were stuck to the wall, arms spread wide to get good holds on the\nstone so they wouldn’t have to tread water. Kip had the sudden feeling that\nthey’d been set up. The drafter knew they were here; he’d just told his\napprentice that so Kip and Sanson would stay in place. They were going"

He should swim, right now, as fast as he could.\nHe tried to breathe deeply, swallowing on his fear. Sanson returned his\ngaze, his own eyes worried, but not understanding what Kip was thinking.\nThen a wheel of flame spun out above them. The animals on the bridge\nand the island shrieked in a hundred different ways. The wheel drew back\nand unraveled, becoming a whip, somewhat like what the master drafter had\nsent out just a minute before—but much, much larger. This was the youth’s\nwork?\nThe whip snapped out, but not at the post of the drawbridge. Instead, it\ncracked audibly as it snapped on the flank of the brick-maker’s draft horse.\nCrazed with pain and fear, the old beast surged forward. Kip heard the boy\nlaughing as the horse rammed directly into the rail of the drawbridge. The\nrail cracked and broke open. Several pigs and thin-coated sheep fell into the\nwater.\nThe draft horse tried to stop, suddenly aware of the drop, but its\nhooves scraped wood for only a moment before it plunged headfirst into the\nwater. Water splashed all the way over to Kip and Sanson.\n“What was that?! Was that what I told you to do?” the master drafter\ndemanded.\nQuickly, Kip looked from the animals in the water to the bridge. The\nbridge post was just starting to catch fire in earnest now. Once it climbed up\nto the drawbridge, the animals would go crazy, just as the horse had. Kip\ndidn’t think the drawbridge itself would catch fire quickly, but he couldn’t\nbe sure.\nIf he and Sanson wanted to get out of the water market and out of the\nburning town, the fastest way was to go under the straining bridge in front\nof them and directly over the waterfall to head downriver. The other way\nwould be to go the long way around the circular lake, exposed to the eyes of\nthe drafter and his apprentice above them the whole time. Either way they\nwent, at some point they would be visible.\nOf the animals that had fallen into the water, the big horse was the\nonly good swimmer. It was kicking toward the other side of the water\nmarket, away from the boy and the fire. The sheep were screaming, little\nlegs churning frantically. The pigs were squealing, lunging at each other,\nbiting.\nThere was a meaty slap and a cry of pain from above the boys.\n“You never go beyond my orders, Zymun! Do you understand?!”\nThe drafter kept yelling, but Kip stopped listening. The drafters were\ndistracted. It was now or never. Kip drew a few quick breaths, nodded at\nSanson—who looked bewildered—and launched off the wall, swimming\ntoward the drawbridge.\nChapter 13\nGavin drafted a blue platform, thin, barely visible against the water it\nfloated on.\n“You did that just to make me nervous, didn’t you?” Karris asked.\nGavin grinned and stepped onto the scull. He extended a hand to\nKarris, giving her a little bow. She ignored his hand and hopped aboard."

She ignored his hand and hopped aboard.\nHe pulled up the keel as she landed, so the scull zipped out from under\nher feet. She yelped—and he caught her with a cushion of softer green luxin\nthat quickly morphed into a seat. He lifted the seat and placed it on the front\nof the scull, then bound both of their packs to the scull near his feet.\n“Gavin, I am not going to sit while you—” She tried to stand, and he\nthrew the scull forward. With nothing to hold on to, she tumbled back into\nthe chair with another yelp. Gavin laughed. Karris was one of the best\nwarriors the Chromeria had—and she still squeaked when surprised.\nShe shot a look back at him, peeved and amused at once.\n“I thought you’d like being swept off your feet,” he said.\n“You had your chance for that,” she shot back.\nHis grin dropped into the waves like so many other treasures and\ndisappeared.\nKarris looked dismayed. “Gavin, I…”\n“No, I deserved that. Please, go ahead and stand.”\nSixteen years. You’d think we’d have both have moved on. Not that we\nhaven’t both tried.\n“Thank you,” she said, but her voice was contrite. She stood up, feet\nwide, knees slightly bent.\nThe scull was propelled by banks of little oars jutting out from each\nside. Through generations of study, green and blue drafters had figured out\nhow to use gears and wheels and chains to drive the oars, each drafter\ncustomizing his craft to fit his own body so that he could propel it with\nwhatever combination of arm and leg movements he preferred, and making\nwhatever tweaks he thought made it more efficient. Because the craft had so\nlittle friction with the water, an athletic drafter could go the speed of a\nsprinting man for an hour.\nThat was fast. Very fast. But it wasn’t nearly as fast as Gavin had\npromised. Still, he leaned fully forward, his body suspended in a web of\nluxin, arms and legs pumping. He elongated and narrowed the scull so it\nbecame a dagger knifing over the water’s face. They attained full speed as\nthey left the harbor.\nGavin was sweating, but it was a good, clean feeling. The wind blew in\nhis face, carrying away any words either he or Karris might have said, and\nwithout words, there was simply her presence, the sight of her dark hair\nwhipping in the sea wind, the strong lines of her face, skin glowing in the\nmorning light, chin lifted, neck extended, enjoying the freedom as much as\nhe was.\nKarris was facing forward, so she didn’t see him draft the luxin scoops\ninto the water. Gavin had always thought there had to be a better way. After\nall, a drafter could throw a fireball at any speed, it was only dependent on\nwill—if he threw something too big or too fast, of course, he might hurt\nhimself from absorbing the kick—but sculls didn’t take advantage of will.\nThey were instead perfect rowing watercraft that used muscle power more\nefficiently than any other machine.

Gavin wanted to do better; he wanted to\nuse magic the way a sail used wind.\nThat had only led to ripping off a mast or two. But he refused to give\nup. It had been one of his seven goals when he’d still had seven years left to\nlive: learn to travel faster than anyone thinks is possible.\nThe solution had come to him from when he was a child, shooting\nseeds through a reed at his brothers. Air, trapped between a plug and the\nwalls of the reed, could shoot a seed with much greater force than if you’d\nsimply tried to throw it with your hand. After a lot of trial and error, he’d\nput the whole reed in the water, opening it at both ends so it traveled fully\nunderwater. He attached another reed diagonally and shot plugs of magic\ndown into the water and then out the back of the reeds.\nHe let the oars drop and the whole mechanism fell away with barely a\nsplash, luxin dissolving even as it hit the waves. He put his hands to the\nreeds.\nAt the first thump, Karris jerked. She squatted deeper to lower her\ncenter of gravity and her hand went instinctively to her ataghan—except\nthat it was in her pack. Then the scull leapt forward. The first great thumps\nshook everything as Gavin strained to get up to speed, his muscles knotting\nwith effort. But within moments, the scull leveled off, and the tension on\nGavin’s arms and shoulders eased somewhat. The plugs hit the water at a\nsteady whup-whup-whup. The modified scull—what he called his skimmer\n—barely kissed the waves.\nThere was still physical effort. Gavin was throwing a lot of force into\nthe water, and his arms and shoulders were basically lifting all of his own\nweight plus Karris’s. But magic could be drafted from the whole body, so it\nwas like carrying a heavy pack with the straps distributing the weight\nperfectly—strenuous, but not crushing. Still, in the last year of doing this\nevery day, his shoulders and arms had gotten bigger than in his entire life.\nKarris turned. Her mouth literally hung open. She stared at the entire\ncontraption, the scoops of blue luxin given flexibility throughout with\ngreen, with the super-flexible, sticky red where the plugs shot into the reeds\nso they wouldn’t be shattered. She straightened slowly, leaning into the\nwind, her back against Gavin so that she wasn’t creating another windbreak.\nHe felt her shaking, and realized she was laughing with delight, though\nhe could barely hear it. The wind blew away the smell of her hair too, but\nfor a moment he imagined he could smell it again. It made him ache.\n“Watch this,” he shouted. In the distance, an island appeared. He\nleaned and the skimmer veered hard toward it. Indeed, he’d quickly learned\nthat the skimmer was capable of maneuvering much faster than he could.\nThe real limit was how quickly he could change direction without tearing\nhimself in half.

He angled the reeds down and the skimmer popped over one of\nthe bigger waves and suddenly they were airborne.\nFor more than a hundred paces, they flew, silent except for the sound\nof the wind, right over the little island. Then they landed like a skipping\nstone and were off once more.\nIn the speed and wind and the closeness of Karris, Gavin finally felt\nfree once more. Despite the warmth of the day, the wind was cold, and if\nKarris didn’t quite burrow into him, she did let her body fully relax against\nhis, grateful for his warmth. If she got too cold, he knew, she would draft\nsub-red, but she was saving her strength. She didn’t know what waited for\nher in Tyrea.\nThat he did—at least in part—lent sweetness to the moment. She\nwould read the White’s letter and learn that he’d fathered a child while they\nwere betrothed. Though she now professed no interest in his love life, it had\nbeen one of the questions she’d asked when he broke it off: Is there another\nwoman? No. Have there ever been any other women while we’ve been\nbetrothed? No, I swear it.\nKarris wouldn’t forgive him this time. It had taken years for her to\nforgive him for breaking their betrothal and refusing to answer why. But\nthis, this was betrayal.\nOrholam, how he’d miss her.\nHe avoided the shipping lanes and stayed far from shore. Around noon,\nhe saw clouds ahead. It didn’t look like a storm, so he guessed that it was\nthe island satrapy of Ilyta. It was a country of many ports and more pirates.\nThe central government had collapsed decades ago, and now parts of it\nwere ruled by whatever pirate lord was powerful at the moment. Most of\nthe Seven Satrapies paid tribute to one or another of the pirate lords,\nenriching them and enabling them to do more piracy.\nGavin had no fear of them, but he didn’t want to be seen either. While\nit might be good for the pirates to have another reason to fear the\nChromeria, he’d prefer to keep his little invention secret for as long as\npossible. Besides, he was only using Ilyta as a landmark. It was a lot of\ntrouble to use an astrolabe, and in the time it took him to calculate their\nposition he could just skim around until he found it. Garriston was at the\nmouth of a large river. It was the busiest port in Tyrea, but that wasn’t\nsaying much. He turned south.\nKarris said something to him, but he couldn’t hear her, so he slowed\nthe skimmer.\n“Can I try too?” she asked.\n“I thought you were saving your strength.”\n“You can’t have all the fun.” Because he was behind her, he couldn’t\nsee her whole smile, but he saw one dimple and one raised eyebrow.\nHe widened the skimmer’s hull so they could stand side by side, and\nhanded over the starboard reed.

Karris always preferred to draft from her\nright hand.\nAt first they were out of synch, and the craft shuddered and strained as\nthey threw the plugs at different speeds and times. He looked over at her,\nbut before he could say anything she took his right hand in her left. She\nsqueezed a tempo to keep him on the beat as she used to do when they\ndanced.\nThe memory hit him as if the skimmer had clipped a reef and smashed\nhim into the sea: Karris, fifteen years old, before the war, at the yearly\nLuxlords’ Ball on top of the Chromeria. Her light blonde hair was long and\nstraight and as fine and shiny as her green silk dress. Their fathers were in\ndiscussion on which of the Guile brothers she would marry. Gavin, the elder\nbrother and likely to become the next Prism, was of course the richer prize.\nHis father, Andross Guile, didn’t care about Karris’s beauty.\n“You want a beautiful woman? That’s what mistresses are for.” But\nthough he didn’t care for the boys’ preferences—alliances were to be\nbought as cheaply as possible, and the marriage of his firstborn was the\nmost valuable stone he had to play—Andross Guile was well aware that\nother families weren’t always so calculating. Some fathers were loath to\nmarry their daughters to men they didn’t care for.\nAndross Guile had ordered the younger Dazen to seduce Karris.\n“There’s a servant’s room one floor down. Here’s the key. Twenty minutes\nafter you leave with her, I’ll make some pretext for her father and I to speak\nprivately, and we’ll come down. I expect to catch you in the act. I’ll be\nsurprised, dismayed, furious. I’ll most likely strike you. But what is one to\ndo? The passions of youth and so forth. You understand?”\nBoth brothers did. Luxlord Rissum White Oak was reputed to be hot-\ntempered. Andross Guile would strike Dazen first and get himself between\nthe two so White Oak didn’t try to kill Dazen. But the real point was that if\nKarris were caught making love with Dazen, her father would have no\nchoice. So as not to shame the White Oaks, Karris would quickly be\nmarried to Dazen. The families would be allied, and Andross Guile would\nstill have his more valuable elder son to play.\n“Gavin, I expect you to be pleasant but not encouraging with the girl.\nIf your brother fails the family in this, you will have to marry her.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nBut then the ball had begun. Gavin had taken the first dance with\nKarris and the worst possible thing had happened. Holding her petite form\nagainst him, her hand in his squeezing out the beat, and looking into her\njade green eyes—at the time, she had had only the tiniest flecks of red in\nher irises—Gavin had been enchanted. By the time Dazen came to dance\nwith her, Gavin was in love. Or lust anyway.\nI’ve been betraying Karris since before we even met.\nKarris squeezed his hand harder than she had been. He looked over.\nHer eyes held a question. He must have tensed, and Karris had caught it."

He must have tensed, and Karris had caught it.\nShe’d always been deeply physical. She hugged or brushed or touched\nthose she loved all the time. Dancing was as natural to her as walking. She\ndidn’t touch Gavin often anymore.\nHe gave a dismissive smile and shook his head. It’s nothing.\nKarris opened her mouth to speak, paused. “Make the tubes bigger!”\nshe shouted, and laughed, the barest edge on it. A forced laugh.\nSo she remembered the dance, squeezing out the beat into his hand. Of\ncourse she did. But she was letting it go, and he was grateful for it. He\nwidened the reeds as far as they could handle, and soon they were going\nfaster than he’d ever gone by himself. He hadn’t meant to show her this\nnext trick, but he couldn’t help himself. He knew it would bring her real\njoy. And what fun is it being a genius if no one appreciates you?\nHe released Karris’s hand. This part was the most dangerous. At this\nspeed, running into something deliberately was stupid. And yet…\n“Brace yourself!” he shouted. Throwing his right fist forward, Gavin\nthrew green luxin out as far in front of them as he could. It landed on the\nwaves with a splash. A moment later, the skimmer hit the green luxin ramp.\nIn an instant, they were airborne. Flying, twenty paces above the\nwaves.\nGavin released the whole reed apparatus and drafted. The luxin of the\nplatform shot up his and Karris’s backs and then shot out from his arms.\nThey were falling now, fifteen paces from the waves, and even if hitting\nthem at this speed meant they would skip rather than just splash, they were\nstill falling twenty paces. The luxin spun out in every color, trying to form\ndespite the gale-force wind.\nTen paces to the waves. Five. At this speed, hitting the water would be\nlike hitting granite.\nThen the luxin hardened in its shape, which was as much like a\ncondor’s wings as Gavin had been able to manage. The wings caught the\nair, and Karris and Gavin shot into the sky.\nThe first time Gavin had attempted it, he’d tried to hold one wing in\neach hand. He’d learned then why birds have hollow bones and weigh\nalmost nothing. The lift had nearly torn his arms off. He’d gone home wet,\nbruised, and angry, with most of the muscles in his arms and chest torn. By\nmaking the condor all one piece instead, he’d taken away the need for\nmuscle at all. The whole thing flew on the strength and flexibility of the\nluxin, speed, and wind.\nOf course, it didn’t really fly. It glided. He’d tried to use the reeds, but\nit hadn’t worked so far. For the time being, the condor had a limited range.\nKarris wasn’t complaining. She was wide-eyed. “Gavin! Orholam,\nGavin, we’re flying!” She laughed, carefree. He’d always loved that about\nher. Her laughter was freedom for both of them. She’d forgotten about the\ndance. That made it worth it."

That made it worth it.\n“Get in the middle,” he said. He didn’t have to shout. They were\ncompletely inside the body of the condor. There was no wind. “I’m not very\ngood at turning; mostly I lean one way or the other.” Indeed, because he\nwas heavier, they were already turning toward his side. Together, they\nleaned toward her side until the condor straightened.\n“The White doesn’t know about this, does she?” Karris asked.\n“Only you,” he said. “Besides…”\n“No one else could do the drafting required,” Karris finished for him.\n“Galib and Tarkian are probably the only polychromes who could\nhandle all the colors necessary, and neither of them is fast enough. If I can\nmake it easy enough for other drafters, I might tell her.”\n“Might?”\n“I’ve been thinking about the ways this could be used. In war, mostly.\nThe Seven Satrapies already fight and scheme over the few polychromes\nthere are. This would make it a hundred times worse.”\n“Is that Garriston?” she said abruptly, looking north and west.\n“Already?”\n“The real question is whether you want to crash onto land or into the\nwater,” Gavin said.\n“Crash?”\n“I’m not very good at landing yet, and with so much extra weight—”\n“Excuse me?” Karris said.\n“What? I haven’t tried flying with a manatee aboard either, I’m just—”\n“You did not just compare me to a sea cow.” Her expression made ice\nlook warm.\n“No! It’s just that all the extra weight…” What is it you’re supposed to\ndo when you’re in a hole? Oh. “Um.” He cleared his throat.\nShe grinned suddenly, dimples flashing. “After all this time, Gavin, I\nstill get you.” She laughed.\nHe laughed ruefully, but the pain went deep. And I still don’t get you.\nMaybe she would have been happy with Dazen.\nChapter 14\nIt felt like years before Kip reached the bridge post. He paused, looking\nback toward the drafters as Sanson caught up with him. The master was still\nstriking his apprentice, who’d curled into a ball, screaming. They definitely\nhadn’t seen Kip or Sanson, but they were also turned toward them, and if\nthey looked up, the bridge post wasn’t big enough to hide both boys.\nThe bridge groaned, and Kip looked up. The opposite post, on the\nisland side, was aflame, and the animals were pushing away from it, but too\nscared to go back into town, which was also burning. That pushed them\nagainst the rail directly above the boys—and against the gap in the rail the\nhorse had made—mere paces to their left.\nHalf a dozen rats splashed into the water, kicked by the other animals.\nEach of them began swimming in a different direction, including several\nright at the boys.\nKip’s stomach knotted in visceral fear.

Sanson yanked on his sleeve, pulling him away. Kip launched\noff the post, splashing awkwardly. He turned back, making sure none of the\nrats latched onto his clothes. His eyes flicked up to the apprentice drafter\nZymun, the boy’s head tucked between his arms as his master beat him. But\nthen Zymun stiffened.\nZymun shouted something and stood, and his master stopped hitting\nhim. Kip got his first good look at the boy. He couldn’t have been more than\na year older than Kip, with unruly black hair, dark eyes, and a wide, fleshy\nmouth curved into a triumphant grin. Even in the moment Kip saw him,\nZymun’s and his master’s skin were filling with red, the swirls like smoke\nbeing inhaled, but then compacted until it filled their bodies.\nKip turned and swam as hard as he could. There was one metal screen\nin front of the waterfall to keep boats or swimmers from going over, and a\ndock and stairs next to it. Sanson was already to the screen, more than ten\npaces ahead of Kip.\nAfter a few more hard strokes, Kip glanced back. The bridge and the\njostling animals blocked much of his view of the two drafters, but as he\nlooked, he saw the master run a few quick steps forward. He jumped,\nspread his arms wide, and slapped his hands together. A shimmering ball of\nred luxin formed between his hands, and as they slapped together it\nrocketed forward. The drafter was blasted back by the force of what he’d\nthrown, but still landed on his feet.\nThe ball caught fire in midair, right before it plowed through the\nanimals on the bridge. Sheep, horses, and pigs exploded in every direction,\nbody parts flying. Wild shrieks filled the air, sounding almost human. The\nburning missile tore off the railing and blasted a chunk out of the middle of\nthe bridge itself, and then it streaked over Kip’s head with a fiery roar and\nsmashed the wood stairs above the dock. Kip didn’t think the drafter had\nmissed, and for a moment he thought the man was trying to trap them.\nThe drawbridge cracked, and all the animals on it stumbled toward the\nsagging middle.\nNow Zymun ran forward. He slapped red hand to red hand, but this\ntime Kip couldn’t even see the ball of luxin—because it wasn’t aimed at\nhim. One moment, Zymun was falling back, completely bowled over from\nthe force of what he had thrown, and the next, the entire wood bridge\nexploded.\nFlames and blood and spinning, detached body parts leapt into the sky.\nOne great flaming section of the bridge streaked toward Kip, tumbling and\nfilling his vision. It hit the water beside him with a great hissing splash.\nWhen Kip could see again, he was pressed against the metal screen in\nfront of the waterfall, surrounded by scraps and shards of wood, some\nsections still burning, one great section of the bridge slowly sinking, and"

The larger animals\nhadn’t been blown so far by the explosion, but they were coming, thrashing,\nkicking, splashing, biting each other in their fear and pain.\n“Kip! Climb over! We’ve almost made it!” Sanson shouted. He was\nalready on the other side of the metal screen.\n“Don’t move!” the older drafter shouted. His skin was already filling\nwith red swirls. “Don’t move or the next one’s coming for your head!”\nKip grabbed the screen, but as soon as his hands touched it, he felt\nlittle claws scratching on his legs, then more on his back. He froze. Rats.\nFirst one or two, then half a dozen.\nHis eyes clamped shut as he felt the claws scramble onto his neck, and\nthen over his head. In holding on to the screen, his body had become a\nbridge—the only way out of the water—and the rats swarmed him.\nIn moments, it wasn’t half a dozen rats. It was hundreds.\nKip’s muscles locked. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t think. Couldn’t\nbreathe. He didn’t dare even open his eyes. Rats were in his hair. A rat had\nfallen down the front of his shirt and was clawing his chest. Rats were\nrunning up his arms.\n“Move, Kip! Move or die!” Sanson shouted.\nSuddenly, Kip felt detached from his own body. He was nearly\ndrowning, the town was on fire, almost everyone he knew was dead, two\ndrafters were trying to kill him, and he was worried about rats. Even as he\nclung here, the drafters were preparing the death blow, and he was too\nfrightened to move. Ridiculous. Pathetic.\nHe felt a hand grab him, and his eyes snapped open. It was Sanson.\nSanson had climbed back up the grate and was braving the rats to try to help\nKip over. Kip shook like a dog, dislodging perhaps a dozen rats, but leaving\nmany more. Still terrified, he began climbing up the grate.\nHe threw one leg up onto the top of the grate, but he couldn’t pull\nhimself up. He was too heavy. A rat fell into his gaping pant leg and began\nscurrying up against his bare skin.\nSanson grabbed Kip’s clothes with both hands and yelled with the\neffort. Kip pulled one last time, and felt his body rising, rising—and finally\nrolling over the top of the grate. He crashed into the water on the other side.\nThe current pulled at him immediately. When he surfaced, Sanson was\nyelling something, but Kip couldn’t even make out the words. He reached\ndown into his pants and grabbed the struggling rat and threw it away.\nThen he was at the waterfall. There were ledges running perpendicular\nto the falls, and the town daredevils would sprint along those and leap over\nthe falls. It was too late for Kip to try that. There were sections where the"

There were sections where the\nwater was shallower than others. Kip turned desperately and his feet caught\nan underwater rock. The force of the current pushed him forward, and he\nsquatted on the rock, gathering his feet underneath him, flailing his hands to\nright himself. The pool at the base of the falls was plenty deep, but if he\ndidn’t jump far enough, he’d hit rocks on his way down.\nHe jumped as hard as he could. To his surprise, he actually went the\ndirection he was trying. For a moment, there was perfect freedom. Peace.\nThe roar of the water drowned out all other sound, all other thought. It was\nbeautiful. Somehow, he and Sanson had been floating in the river all night,\nand now the sun was just peeking above the horizon, beating back the\nmidnight black of one horizon to deep blue, to icy blue, to pinks and\noranges that lit clouds like halos.\nThen Kip realized how fast he was falling. His body was at an angle to\nthe fast-approaching water below. From watching the bolder youths, he\nknew he had to hit feet first or headfirst with arms extended or he would be\nhurt badly.\nThere was no way he was going headfirst, so he arched his back and\nwheeled his arms.\nWhatever he’d done, it seemed to be the exact wrong thing, or maybe\nhe’d already been twisting forward, because he found himself parallel to the\nwater. He was going to land the most colossal bellyflop ever seen. From this\nheight, it might well kill him.\nNot only that, but he realized that he was falling with the water—all\nthe divers he’d ever seen had jumped out beyond it. The water always\nglanced off one rock on the way down.\nHe didn’t even have time to think a curse before a rock smacked his\nfoot, hard. He threw his arms out—\n—as he crashed into the water headfirst, feeling like someone had just\nhit him over the top of the head with a board. His arms felt like they’d been\ntorn off. And he’d forgotten to take a breath before he hit. Kip opened his\neyes underwater in time to see something big streak down into the water\nbeside him in a gush of bubbles. Sanson!\nSanson had hit feet first, but had been spun when he hit the water so he\nwas upside down. He seemed stunned for a moment, unmoving, then his\neyes opened, but he was looking away from Kip. Obviously disoriented\nfrom the fall, Sanson began swimming—down. Kip grabbed his foot to get\nhis attention.\nBut Sanson panicked. He thrashed and kicked Kip square in the nose.\nKip yelled—and watched the last of his air go rushing toward the surface.\nSanson turned, saw Kip, saw the direction the bubbles were going, and\nthen saw the blood blossoming in the dark water. He grabbed Kip, and\ntogether the boys swam for the surface.\nKip barely made it. He gasped, inhaling water and blood, and then\ncoughed it out. He coughed again, then retched.

We’ve got to get to shore before we get to the rapids.”\nThat woke Kip up. Within fifty paces of the deep, still area where the\nwaterfall landed, there was another set of rapids so steep they were almost a\nseries of waterfalls themselves. And already the current was getting swifter.\nFoot aching, head splitting, nose streaming blood, he swam with Sanson.\nThey made it to shore with ten paces to spare. The boys hauled\nthemselves onto a grassy bank and inspected the damage, exhausted.\nSanson was uninjured, and he looked sheepish. “Sorry, Kip. I mean, about\nyour nose and all. I never liked swimming. Always thought there were\nthings in the deep that’d grab me.”\nPinching his bleeding nose, Kip looked at his friend. “Oo sabed my\nlife ub dere,” he said. “Oo din’t eben break ma nose.” Kip was more\nconcerned about the foot he’d struck on his way down. He unlaced his shoe\nwith one hand and tugged the shoe and stocking off. His foot was sore, and\nthere were some nice scrapes along the top, but when he rubbed it he didn’t\nthink any bones were broken. He began tugging his wet stocking back on,\nwhich was hard to do while still pinching his nose with one hand.\n“I can’t believe we got—” Sanson started.\n“Away?” Kip asked. He had abandoned trying to tie his shoe with one\nhand and was sniffing hard, trying to keep blood from dripping all over him.\nEven as he finished the knot, though, he knew why Sanson had stopped\nspeaking. They were bathed in a harsh red glare.\nLooking up, Kip saw a red flare hanging in the sky above them,\nmarking their location for the rest of the king’s army—who had to be\nnearby. The flare’s smoke trail led back to the top of the falls, where the two\ndrafters stood, looking at them.\nKip and Sanson had escaped two drafters. Now they had to escape the\nrest of the army.\nKip hopped to his feet, sniffing hard. He thought he was going to\nhyperventilate. Then he saw a horseman on the ridge that wound from\nabove the waterfall down to the Sendinas’ farm. He abruptly forgot about\nhis bleeding nose. The horseman would have to go farther to go around, but\nhe had a horse. Kip and Sanson had to make it down the trail along the\nrapids and get to the farm before the horseman did.\nThen Kip saw three other horsemen join the first. And then another,\nand another.\nHe and Sanson started running.\nThe waterfall kicked up huge clouds of mist, day and night, and the\nvalley stayed dark for hours longer than the surrounding country. When the\nflare winked out, Kip lost sight of both the horsemen and the trail.\nHe stopped, terrified. Broad-leafed plants, slick with the mist, obscured\nboth sides of the tiny trail.

One foot set on those, and he would plunge\ndown the rocky incline to the river. In the rapids, he’d be battered to death.\nHe needed to see. He tried to look at things out of the corners of his\neyes, the way Master Danavis had taught him. The part of your eye that\nfocused on things was best at seeing colors, but outside the focus area was\nbetter at seeing light and dark.\n“Move!” Sanson said.\nKip looked over his shoulder. Sanson’s face looked like it was on fire.\nKip took a step back and tottered on the sharp edge of the trail. Everywhere\nSanson’s skin was exposed, he looked hot. Kip could even see the steam\nevaporating off his arms in little orange whorls.\n“What’s wrong with your eyes?” Sanson asked. “Never mind. Move,\nKip!”\nSanson was right again. It didn’t matter what Kip was seeing, or how.\nHe turned and started forward. Somehow, the wonder of it all crowded out\nhis fear. The plants were like torches lighting his way, even gently\nilluminating the trail between.\nOne hand still hitching up his wet, heavy pants, Kip began jogging as\nfast as he could, fearless despite the slick rocks, narrow trail, and death\nbeckoning from every side.\nThere were bodies in the river, caught up in the rapids. Dear Orholam,\nthere were bodies at the Sendinas’ farm, little lumps nearly as cold as the\nsurrounding ground. Smoldering, ruined buildings burned hot in Kip’s\nvision. More important for him and Sanson, he saw a flat-bottomed punt\ntied at the Sendinas’ dock. He and Sanson hit the bottom of the trail at a full\nrun. They rounded a corner and in the morning sun saw thirty mounted\nMirrormen, drawn up in battle formation.\n“We wanted to take you alive,” the red drafter said. His skin was\ncrimson, and fury tinged his voice. “A drafter with your potential doesn’t\ncome along every day. But you’ve killed two of King Garadul’s men, and\nfor that, you die.”\nChapter 15\n“You’re not really going to crash us,” Karris said as Gavin brought them\nover the scrub desert.\n“Oh, I see. When I’m flying, we’re flying, but when we’re crashing,\nI’m crashing.”\nGavin banked the condor to the right so they wouldn’t be seen from\nGarriston. There was still a good chance some farmer or fisherman would\nspot them, but who would believe a lone fisherman who said he’d seen a\ngiant flying man-bird? If a whole city saw them, it would be a different\nstory. Garriston, despite being the most important port in Tyrea, wasn’t\nmuch. The bay was overfished, the land was hot and dry with bad soil, the\nRuthgari governor corrupt, his men worse.\nIt hadn’t always been this way.

        "text": "been a vast system of irrigation canals that had brought this scrub desert\ninto bloom, with two or even three harvests a year. There had been locks\nthat fed trade to dozens of small cities up and down the Umber River. But\ncanals and locks required drafters and maintenance. Without either, this\nland had withered, punished for the sins of dead men.\n“Gavin, I’m serious. Are we really going to crash?”\n“Trust me,” he said.\nShe opened her mouth, then shut it. He guessed what she hadn’t said:\nBecause that’s worked out so well for me before?\n“Got anything fragile in your bag?” he asked.\n“How bad is this going to be?” she asked, real concern in her voice.\n“Sorry. I should have waited until we were closer to the ground.”\n“Wait, what’s that?” Karris asked.\nGavin looked west, following her eyes, but didn’t see what had made\nher curious. The land around Garriston was plains and dry farmland, but to\nthe west it quickly yielded to steep, tall, impassable mountains that abutted\nalmost directly on the sea. The Umber River was just on the other side of\nthose mountains. If it could go straight to the sea—through the mountains—\nit would have been only ten leagues long. Instead, it had to go east to\nGarriston, separated from the ocean by fencelike mountains, almost a\nhundred and fifty leagues from origin to outlet.\n“There,” Karris said, pointing. “Smoke.”\nGavin wasn’t sure that the black wisp was anything more than Karris’s\n—and now his—imagination. Regardless, it was on the other side of the\nmountains, so it didn’t matter. He was just opening his mouth to tell Karris\nthat when the condor passed over one of the foothills. A powerful updraft\nshot them higher into the air.\nIt took Gavin’s breath away. He’d only experimented with the condor\nover water. He hadn’t even thought about how the ground beneath where he\nwas gliding would affect the air above it. Now that he had experienced it, it\nmade sense. Why else did birds of prey spiral so often in the same places?\nGavin had assumed they were good hunting grounds. Now he knew.\nUpdrafts.\n“Can we make it over the mountains?” Karris asked.\nFrom this new height—Gavin looked down, gulped, and immediately\nlooked back to the horizon—he was certain that what they had seen was\nsmoke. And for it to be visible from this far away, it could only be one of\ntwo things.\nLet it be a forest fire. Please, Orholam.\n“We can. But if we do, you’re not going to meet the man who was\nsupposed to get you into Garadul’s army. And I can’t get the condor back\ninto the air without the sea. I’ll have to float all the way down the river.”\n“Gavin, when I see that much smoke, I think red wight. A Torch could\nbe burning down an entire city. You’re heading out to stop a color wight\nnear Ru? These people aren’t worth any less than the people of Ru. If it\ncomes to it, there are a lot of drafters in Ru who could work together\nagainst the blue wight. These people have no one.”"

These people have no one.”\nIn his mind’s eye, Gavin was comparing the land below him to the\nmaps he knew of Tyrea. It was surprisingly easy, given that he was closer to\nthe perspective most maps were drawn from than most people ever got. He\nlooked at the mountains, the not-quite-pass through them, and the position\nof the rising smoke. A thought struck him with a greater force than mere\nintuition. He wasn’t here on accident. It wasn’t coincidence that he was\ngliding in the one place where he could see this fire, or that he had Karris\nwith him. That was no forest fire. It wasn’t a red wight either.\nThat fire was rising from Rekton. It had been a beautiful town before\nthe war. It was the town where Gavin’s “son” was. Gavin knew it, even\nthough they were so far away there was no way to know it. If Orholam had\nactually existed, this was the kind of punishment he would devise for\nGavin. Or test.\nWhatever it was, it was a choice.\nFive years left, and five great purposes still to accomplish. And one of\nthose actually was mostly selfless: to free Garriston, which had been\ncrushed because of him. Which was suffering still, because of him.\nIf Gavin went to Rekton, he’d have to face that crazy woman, Lina.\nHe’d have to face her son Kip, and tell him that he wasn’t his father: Sorry,\nyou’re still fatherless. I have no idea what your lying slut mother is talking\nabout.\nThat would doubtless go over well. They would also be close to Rask\nGaradul’s army, so Karris would open her orders, and everything would get\nmessy fast.\nAll Gavin had to say was, “I’ve got my orders.” Karris would\nunderstand. She’d always been dutiful. To a fault.\nBut you aren’t Karris. This isn’t her test.\nHe opened his mouth to say it, and it tasted like cowardice. He\ncouldn’t force the words past his gritted teeth.\n“Let’s go see,” Gavin said. He banked the condor, and saw that he\nhadn’t made his decision a moment too soon. It would be a near thing to\nclear the gap between the mountains.\nKarris squeezed his hand and her eyes sparkled, those jade green eyes\nwith red diamonds in them. For some reason, her joy struck him more\ndeeply than any disappointment could have. That joy was a reminder of\nsixteen years of joy he should have given her, joy stolen. He turned away,\nhis throat tight.\nThe mountains loomed, and Gavin realized for the first time just how\nfast they were going. There was no hope of a splashing wet landing here. If\nthe updrafts he’d expected didn’t catch them soon, he and Karris were\ngoing to paint a large crimson blotch across the face of these rocks.\nOrholam, if there isn’t any wind at all, then there isn’t any wind to get\nthrown upward, is there?\nHe was beginning to draft a red cushion—hopelessly, knowing no"

They were hurled skyward, the wings of the condor\nstraining.\nKarris shouted with exultation.\nThe force was incredible. It was hard to estimate how fast they were\nrising, but Gavin shortened the condor’s wings both to take stress off them\nand because Rekton wasn’t so far away that they would need that much\nheight. The higher they were, the more visible they were. But it did make\nhim think. With all the height he could get off of mountains, the condor’s\nrange was vastly greater than he had assumed.\nIt was a thought for another time. Right now the problem was to stay\nlow so they weren’t visible to all of Tyrea, and to lose some of the\ntremendous speed they’d built up. He drafted a bonnet the same blue luxin\nhe’d used for himself when he jumped from the Chromeria. It popped open\ninstantly, throwing both him and Karris forward, then ripped away almost\nas fast.\nWhen they regained their balance, Gavin tried again. Green this time,\nand much smaller. He sealed the bonnet to the luxin of the condor so it\ndidn’t tear him apart. It worked, sort of. They slowed a little. Now they\nwere headed downward at merely ridiculous speeds. Gavin struggled to\nexpand the wingspan again.\n“What can I do?” Karris shouted.\nGavin cursed. He’d barely begun to experiment with changing the\ncondor’s wings. In all his trials, he’d merely leaned to one side or the other\nand caught himself before hitting the ground or the water. Grunting with the\nstrain, he lifted the front edge of the wings skyward. Point up to go up,\nright?\nIt was exactly the wrong thing to do. They pitched sharply downward.\nBy the time he leveled off the wings, they were heading straight down.\nWorse, the suddenness of their drop meant his feet weren’t even touching\nthe floor. He had no leverage to push against to continue to manipulate the\nwings. He threw luxin up to the ceiling to force his body down, and began\nlocking his feet to the floor, but the eucalyptus trees were looming huge. He\nwas too slow.\nThen he was slammed to the floor. The condor dipped below the height\nof the trees, in a meadow, and then began to rise. It wasn’t going to make it.\nGavin reached into the luxin as the condor crashed through the\nbranches. The blue luxin cracked and would have shattered if he hadn’t\ngrabbed it. For another instant, he couldn’t see anything as they knifed\nthrough the trees, then again they were airborne. Heading up and up, steeper\nand steeper.\nHe finally looked at Karris. Her skin was a war of green and red. Her\nhands were braced against the ceiling and the luxin lines traced from both\nhands to the back of the condor. She’d taken control of the tail. It was\nflared, green, bent up.

She was standing on her hands on\nthe ceiling. Gavin locked her in again and together they turned the wings\nand tail once more. They were crushed to the floor as the great luxin bird\nswooped out level once more, only twenty paces above the trees.\nGavin breathed freely for the first time in what seemed like hours. He\nchecked the condor. It seemed well enough.\n“Did they see us?” Karris asked.\n“What? Who?” How was she able to see so many things at once?\n“Them,” she said, nodding.\nGavin looked toward Rekton. They were only a few leagues east of the\ntown now, and it had indeed been burned. All of it. That meant either an\nincredibly strong red wight, or something else entirely.\nAnd they were looking at the something else. There was a small army\nencamped around the town. It could only be Garadul’s men.\nOrholam have mercy.\n“No,” Gavin said. “They’d have to stare almost straight into the sun to\nsee us.”\n“Huh. Lucky, I guess,” Karris said.\n“You call this lucky?” Gavin asked.\n“What’s that?” she interrupted.\nBelow the town, after the falls fed into rapids and the Umber River’s\nrage finally cooled, there was a group of homes. Almost a village, but all the\nbuilding were smoldering. There was a green drafter, skin filling with\npower, facing several of King Garadul’s Mirrormen.\n“That’s a child!” Karris said. “Two! Gavin, we’ve got to save them.”\n“I’ll bring us down as close as I can. Roll when we hit.” They leveled\noff ten paces above a plain of rock and brush and tumbleweeds. Gavin\nthrew out a small bonnet to slow the condor again. It snapped open, but this\ntime they were both ready for the whiplash and braced themselves. Gavin\nthrew out another and another. They slowed down faster than he’d\nexpected. The condor pitched toward the ground.\nGavin flung his hands out, blasting the condor to pieces. As they fell,\nhe wrapped Karris and then himself in an enormous cushion of orange\nluxin, rimmed with a shell of segmented flexible green, with a core of\nsuper-hard yellow.\nThey slammed into the ground, the orange and green luxin slowing\nthem before exploding from the force of their landing. The yellow luxin\nwas formed into a more rigid ball around each of them.

Gavin crashed\nthrough some bushes, bouncing and rolling half a dozen times before the\nyellow luxin cracked and spilled him unceremoniously onto the ground. He\nwiggled his fingers and toes. Everything worked. He jumped up.\n“Karris?”\nHe heard a yell. Not a good one. He ran.\nKarris sprang to her feet, twenty paces away. Her hair was askew, but\nhe didn’t see any obvious injuries. He came to stand by her. “What is it?” he\nasked.\nShe glanced down. There was a rattlesnake at her feet, as long as\nGavin’s spread arms. A dagger through its head pinned it to the ground.\nKarris’s dagger.\nAs Gavin stood there, mouth open, Karris put a foot behind the snake’s\nhead and pulled the dagger out—with her hand, for Orholam’s sake, not\nwith drafting. Sometimes Gavin forgot how tough Karris was. She wiped\nthe blood off on a black kerchief the Blackguards carried for such purposes\n—black didn’t show hard-to-explain bloodstains. She shook slightly as she\ntucked the kerchief away, but Gavin knew it wasn’t fear or nerves. It took a\nbody time to relax from the amount of adrenaline imminent death triggered.\nKarris didn’t blame him for nearly getting her killed. She grabbed her\nbag and bowcase, strapped her ataghan belt around her narrow waist,\nchecked to make sure neither blade nor scabbard had been damaged in the\nfall, and threw her bag on her back. It was like the sudden violence had\nreminded her of what she was—and of what they weren’t. Back on the\nground, back to reality.\n“Sorry ’bout that,” Gavin said. “I should have gone for the sea.”\n“If we had, there could have been sharks.” She shrugged. “And now\nI’d be wet.” She smirked, but it didn’t touch her eyes. He wasn’t going to\nreach her now. Work loomed—and her work was dangerous, a job that\nmight well lead to war, a job that might require her to kill or to die. She had\nto ruthlessly cut away any entanglements that would distract her.\n“Karris,” he said. “What’s in that note… it isn’t true. I don’t expect\nyou to understand or maybe even believe me, but I swear it isn’t true.”\nShe looked at him, hard, inscrutable. Her irises were jade green, but\nnow the flecks of red were like starbursts, flaring, diamond-shaped. One\nway or another, through means magical or mundane, luxin or tears, Gavin\nknew that soon those eyes would be red. “Let’s save those children,” she\nsaid.\nKarris ran, and he followed her. They cut back and forth down a\nhillside dominated by eucalyptus trees, peeling bark scattered on the\nground, brush slapping them. Karris cut toward the skinny child, leaving\nGavin to save the one facing the red drafter.\nBut it didn’t matter. Neither of them was going to make it in time.\nChapter 16\nIt was too far to run for the punt, even for Sanson. A cool realization settled\non Kip: he was going to die.

        "text": "Chapter 16\nIt was too far to run for the punt, even for Sanson. A cool realization settled\non Kip: he was going to die. He was surprised at his own reaction. No\npanic. No fear. Just quiet fury. Thirty elite Mirrormen in full harness against\na child. A trained red drafter against a child who’d first drafted yesterday.\n“When I tell you, run,” Kip told Sanson.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw something flash over the trees\nhundreds of paces to his left, but when he looked, there was nothing there.\nHe saw that the Mirrormen were looking back and forth at each other, as if\nthey’d caught the same glimpse he had.\n“Now, Sanson. Run.” Kip didn’t take his eyes off the drafter.\nSanson ran.\nThe Mirrormen hesitated until the red drafter gestured, a quick sign,\nwith military efficiency. One Mirrorman from each side of the line peeled\noff and circled around Kip, digging their heels hard into their horses. The\nred drafter himself rode forward alone.\nEverything Kip had done with magic so far had been instinctive. Now\nhe needed to do something on purpose. Light was pouring over him. There\nwas green everywhere. The two Mirrormen circling him were each keeping\nan eye on him, but they were going after Sanson. The wildness surged\nthrough Kip once again and he felt the skin under his fingernails tear open\nagain as luxin poured into his palm. A javelin formed in his hand. He hurled\nit at the Mirrorman nearer to Sanson, but the throw was pathetic. It flew\nmaybe fifteen paces, not even half the distance it needed.\nThe red drafter laughed. Kip ignored him.\nKip had seen the other red drafter and his apprentice Zymun throw\nfireballs from a standstill. They’d been thrown back from hurling something\nwith so much force, but they hadn’t fully thrown it physically. Kip imagined\nthe magic streaking from him as the reds’ had done. The air in front of him\ncoalesced, sparkling, coruscating greens, from sea-foam to mint to\nevergreen, taking on the outline of a spearhead.\nWith an explosion of energy, it leapt away. Kip felt as if he had fired an\novercharged musket. He tumbled to the ground. Worse, he missed. The\ngreen spear cut the air behind the galloping Mirrorman. It crashed into one\nof the few standing walls of one of the burned-out homes. The wall went\ndown in billows of ash.\nKip scrambled to his feet to try again, but even as the air began\nsparkling green in front of him, he caught something red out of the corner\nof his eye. He turned toward the red drafter—too slowly. Something hot\nblasted through his hands, scattering the green luxin he’d been gathering,\nburning him.\nThe red drafter was advancing toward him, dismounted now, walking\ncalmly, red swirling down into his hands again. Kip held his hands up, just\nas he had a hundred times when Ram was threatening to hit him. This time,\na green shield formed, translucent, covering him from head to toe, its\nweight supported on the ground."

        "text": "as he had a hundred times when Ram was threatening to hit him. This time,\na green shield formed, translucent, covering him from head to toe, its\nweight supported on the ground.\nThe red drafter flicked a finger forward. A spark shot out, trailing a\nlong red tail. It stuck to Kip’s shield, burning faintly, its red trail going all\nthe way back to the drafter. Kip panicked and, only carrying the shield\nbecause it was stuck to his arms, dodged to one side. A much larger red\nmissile roared out from the red drafter. It followed the tail toward the spark,\ncurving in midair along that line.\nKip was blown off his feet and thrown back a dozen feet. He felt the\ngreen shield crack with a report, as if it had been his own bones snapping.\nHe lifted himself from the dirt in time to see one of the Mirrormen\npursuing Sanson raise his long, sweeping cavalry sword and slash\ndownward in midcharge. Kip couldn’t see Sanson, but the Mirrormen\nreined in and the second horseman reversed his grip on his lance and\nstabbed downward hard, once, twice, professionally, coolly.\nBoth Mirrormen relaxed like men who’ve finished their work, and Kip\nknew Sanson was dead.\nHe rolled over. The red drafter was standing over him. Kip was faintly\nsurprised by how ordinary the man looked. A long face, dark eyes, roughly\ncut hair, crooked teeth revealed by his grimace. He was going to kill Kip,\nbut without passion. Just a man following orders.\nBefore Kip could gather magic one more time, the drafter imprisoned\nKip’s arms in red sludge, sticky and thick. Kip couldn’t move.\nThe drafter raised his bespectacled eyes toward the sun once more,\nmagic spiraling like smoke down into his arms, filling him with power for\nthe killing blow. A dense indigo dot appeared on his ear, then over his\ntemple as his head moved, as if someone with a lantern letting out a single\nray of light from somewhere in the forest was somehow focusing that little\nbeam right on his—\nThere was a roar, for just a fraction of a second, as if Kip were\nstanding at the base of the waterfall once again. Something huge and yellow\nblasted into the red drafter so fast and hard it seemed the man disappeared.\nHis body was thrown into the air, torn in half by the force of the collision.\nThe red luxin sludge holding Kip fell into dust.\nKip stood and looked in horror at what had been a man. The red of the\ndrafter’s clothes now mingled with his blood, magic and violence mixed.\nBut his entire upper body had been reduced to jelly. Kip looked to the\nforest.\nWith the boy saved for the moment, Gavin ran toward the Mirrormen.\nKarris had headed down the hill to save the other boy running for the river,\nbut she was already too late. The Mirrormen formed up with surprising\ndiscipline and speed. None of these men had bothered to bard their horses.\nBarding was heavy and awkward and tired the horses quickly, and the\nMirrormen obviously hadn’t expected to run into any real opposition, much\nless drafters. That meant the horses were easily the most vulnerable targets."

That meant the horses were easily the most vulnerable targets.\nBut Gavin didn’t like killing innocent beasts. Their masters? That was a\ndifferent matter.\nHe swept a hand in a sharp, hard arc, the air crackling like a succession\nof rocks exploding in a fire. A dozen blue globes, each half the size of his\nfist, shot out. The mirrored armor, working like a mirror reflecting light,\nreflected part of any luxin thrown against it, making it unravel. That was a\nbig problem for a drafter trying to cut down a horseman with a luxin sword,\nbut it was only protection, not invulnerability. The thin-walled luxin globes\nsmashed against mirror armor—and sheared open, dumping out flaming red\ngoo that splashed all over the Mirrormen, up and down their chests, into\ntheir visors, down the seams into their groins.\nWith fire and screams and the sizzle of burning skin, the charge\nfaltered. Gavin swept his other hand out and another dozen globes shot out.\nMen were crashing to the ground from their saddles, trying to roll and put\nout the fires. Others clawed at their flaming helmets, cooking. Still others\nwere trying to continue the charge, half a dozen men lowering their lances\n—until the second wave of globes caught them.\nMore than a dozen horses continued the charge, though. Even without\ntheir riders’ guidance, these horses were bred to war, and they ran toward\nGavin.\nGavin threw green wedges around himself like a clamshell and braced\nhimself. The horses jostled him hard as they charged past, but left him\nstanding.\nThere were only three Mirrormen left uninjured, all of them men on\nthe ends of the line who’d broken off the charge early. They were sawing\ntheir reins, turning tail to flee. Cowards, perhaps. But smart cowards. Gavin\nflicked fingers at each in turn. Superviolet luxin was fast, light, and invisible\nto almost everyone. Like a spider, each dot stuck to one of the men and then\nclimbed up to the joint in their armor at the back of their necks.\nThree spiked missiles of yellow luxin sped along the superviolet\nspiderwebs trailing from those spiders to Gavin a moment later. With a\nmeaty crunch, each missile punched through mail and into a spine. Three\nriders toppled from their galloping horses.\nWith all the riders around him dead or dying, Gavin looked down the\nhill to see how Karris was doing against the last two Mirrormen. One was\nalready down, and if anything, Gavin was surprised to see that the other was\nstill alive—a fact that would no doubt change shortly.\nFour hundred years ago, when it had been founded, the Blackguard\nhad been an Ilytian company, chosen as much for their proud relation to\nLucidonius as for their martial skill. But when Ilyta lost influence in the\nSpectrum, the Blackguard had been forced to abandon choosing on the\nbasis of province and instead had justified their elite position on function:\nwhen a drafter drafted, his skin filled with the color he was about to use."

        "text": "Spectrum, the Blackguard had been forced to abandon choosing on the\nbasis of province and instead had justified their elite position on function:\nwhen a drafter drafted, his skin filled with the color he was about to use.\nThat meant in a fight, a paler-skinned Atashian or Blood Forester drafter\nwas easier to predict. That justification had satisfied the Parians who were\nalso darker-skinned, just fine. Since then, Blackguards had been mostly\nParians or Ilytians, with Parians gradually becoming the majority as their\npolitical power waxed.\nBut having based their protected status on their fighting prowess, the\nBlackguard had been forced to accept more than a dozen elite warrior-\ndrafters from countries other than Paria and Ilyta over the last two centuries.\nKarris had joined them because it was impossible to deny her. She’d\nsparred with every member of the Blackguard and defeated all but four of\nthem. She was simply the fastest drafter Gavin had ever seen, and after her\nBlackguard training, one of the most dangerous. And it meant nothing to\nher. At the rate she pushed herself, Gavin thought she’d be lucky if she\nlasted another ten years. Probably closer to five. It was like she was racing\nhim to Death’s gates. But she wouldn’t die today.\nThe other horseman charged her, his sword drawn. Karris stood her\nground, only moving at the last second so that she was directly in the\nhorse’s path. The horseman, expecting her to move the other way, was too\nsurprised to change his course. Karris dropped to the ground just as the\nhorse was about to trample her. With flexible fingers of green and red luxin\nextending from her own hands and crossed, she grabbed the cinch strap as\nthe horse passed over her.\nThe horse thundered past and for a moment Gavin thought she’d been\ntrampled. Then he saw her flipped into the air. The luxin uncrossed and\nwhipped her back toward the still-galloping horse. She crashed into the\nback of the horseman and almost spilled out of the saddle, but she\nscrambled and managed to maintain her seat behind him.\nThe horseman flailed, having no idea what had just happened or what\nhad hit him from behind. Karris drew her knife as she reached around his\nhead with her other hand. She tore open his visor and buried the knife deep\nin his face. The man spasmed hard and both of them fell.\nKarris tried to push the horseman down so she’d land on him, but his\nfoot never cleared the stirrup. Instead of a cushioned landing, she was spun\nhard backward by his body being yanked from under her, and then hit the\nground and abruptly rolled forward. She had the good fortune to land on\ngrass, though.\nGavin looked at the boy they’d just killed thirty of Satrap Garadul’s\nelite bodyguards to save. He was maybe fifteen, chubby, awkward, with\neyes round at what he’d just seen. The child turned and ran toward the river.\nAt first Gavin thought he was fleeing in fear, but then he realized the boy\nwas going to check on his friend, the one Gavin and Karris had come too\nlate to save.\n“What is the meaning of this?” a man shouted.\nGavin turned—and cursed himself.

He’d been so concerned about the\nboy and Karris and what was happening down toward the river, he hadn’t\nbeen paying attention to what was happening up the road. The roar of the\nrapids and the waterfall had muffled the sound of hooves, but there was still\nno excuse. The man who’d shouted had the same weak chin that seemed to\nbeg someone to stick a fist in it that he’d had sixteen years ago, the last time\nGavin had seen him. His whole body was quivering with outrage as he took\nin the carnage that was all that remained of thirty of his supposedly\ninvincible Mirrormen.\nBut Satrap Garadul’s face changed the moment he saw Gavin. He drew\nrein even as half a dozen of his drafters and a score of his Mirrormen\nsurrounded him. “Gavin Guile?”\nChapter 17\nThe White was going to kill him.\nGavin deserved killing. The presence of Satrap Garadul himself\nchanged everything. If these had merely been Satrap Garadul’s soldiers, as\nGavin and Karris expected, Gavin could have killed the men and left.\nSatrap Garadul would be furious and would hunt the drafters who had done\nit, but he would have had no idea who he was after. It might have simply\nbeen that there was a powerful drafter living in—what was this worthless\nlittle town called? Rekton, that was it. Oh, the irony.\nIt was too late to grab the spectacles Gavin kept in a pocket against\nsuch eventualities. With spectacles, with what he’d done, he was a\nmysterious polychrome. Without them, he could only be the Prism.\nSo now the Prism himself had moved against Satrap Garadul, and\nthere was no denying it. Rask Garadul knew him.\n“Gavin?” Satrap Rask Garadul said again. There was something odd in\nhis tone of voice, an intensity, maybe a trap. He was dressed in mail with\nsegments of plate worked in. Smaller segments, not requiring articulated\njoints. His was a poor country.\nHe’d changed his seal. It used to be his family’s moon and two stars on\na field sable, his personalized with a snarling fox. Now both fox and field\nhad been done away with. The king’s new seal was a white chain, broken,\non a black field. Gavin knew instantly that the symbol was important. Rask\nwasn’t merely repudiating his name and his father, whom he’d always\ndespised as weak. This was new. Had he fallen under the sway of the heresy\nof the old gods that Gavin had heard rumors about? What was he doing?\nWhy was he asking Gavin’s name when he already knew it was him? Was\nhe giving Gavin an opportunity to lie, to say that he wasn’t the Prism?\nIf Gavin did so, what would Rask Garadul do? Kill him and explain\nlater to the Chromeria that it had been a mistake; through no fault of his\nown, he’d killed an attacker who’d disavowed being Gavin Guile. If Rask"

If Rask\nthought he was going to kill Gavin with a handful of drafters and a score of\nMirrormen, he was wrong, but what else could it be? Maybe Satrap Garadul\nwas simply as surprised to see Gavin as Gavin was to see him, and he didn’t\nknow how to play this.\nIf Gavin lied and Rask attacked, Gavin would have no choice but to\nkill him. If he killed Rask, he’d have to kill all of Rask’s men. And what\nwould the satrapies make of that? More men were coming down the path\nbehind the satrap even now. Gavin couldn’t kill them all. No matter how\nstrong he was, if a hundred men fled in a hundred directions, some of them\nwould get away. Word would get out that the Prism himself had come to\nTyrea and assassinated the satrap without provocation.\nIt didn’t matter that Satrap Garadul was massacring everyone in this\ntown. It was his town; he could do with it as he saw fit. At one time, a Prism\ncould have destroyed or killed one of his satraps at will, but that time was\nlong past. Perhaps back when the Seven Satrapies had really been satrapies.\nNo longer. His power was ceremonial, religious only. The Prism wasn’t\nsupposed to interfere in the internal affairs of a nation—and Gavin had\nalready more than just interfered. If he killed everyone here, and skimmed\nback to the Chromeria so he got home within a few days of having left, the\nChromeria could plausibly deny that he was responsible. It was too far\naway for him to have come and gone.\nHe would kill a man he’d never liked; he would stay out of trouble,\nand the only people to pay for it would be a bunch of soldiers in the most\nbackward of the Seven Satrapies. Well, the boy might have to die too.\nOtherwise he could blackmail Gavin. And what would Karris think? Well,\nwhat did it matter what she thought? She was an impossibility for him\nalready. He’d known he was going to lose what little he had with her today\nregardless.\nThe man he’d once been wouldn’t have hesitated.\nWhat would you do, brother?\nIt had been so long, Gavin wasn’t even sure anymore.\n“I am the High Lord Prism Gavin Guile,” Gavin said, bowing slightly,\nputting one hand behind his back and trying to wave off Karris.\n“So, Lord Prism,” Satrap Garadul said loudly, “is this how the\nChromeria declares war?”\n“Strange that your thoughts should so quickly go to war, Satrap.”\n“Strange? No, it’s strange you should call me a satrap. You expelled\nthe rightful satrap, my father, from Garriston, stole that city, our capital and\nonly port, and have denied Tyrea’s people access to the Chromeria. Tyrea is\na satrapy no more, and hasn’t been since your war, Prism. I am King Rask\nGaradul of Tyrea. You have murdered my personal guards. And you call it\nstrange that war should occur to us?” Rask’s voice rose. “Perhaps you think"

        "text": "Garadul of Tyrea. You have murdered my personal guards. And you call it\nstrange that war should occur to us?” Rask’s voice rose. “Perhaps you think\nTyreans are bred to be slaughtered by the Chromeria’s lackeys?”\nThere was a rumble among the Mirrormen that told Gavin this kind of\ntalk was nothing new.\n“But surely the Chromeria wouldn’t send the Prism himself just to kill\na few of my men.” Rask pretended to be thinking, but didn’t wait long\nenough for Gavin to get a word in. “No. The Prism would only come if\nthere was something much more important to accomplish. Something that\nwould ensure the Chromeria’s stranglehold on the Seven Satrapies\ncontinued. Tell me, Lord Prism, have you come to assassinate me?”\nOne doesn’t send a lion to kill a rat.\nSo help him, Gavin almost said it out loud.\nThere was a rattle of armor and stomping of hooves as the Mirrormen\nand drafters pressed in closer to Rask Garadul. Gavin only heard it; he was\nlooking down the hill. He’d avoided looking until now to avoid drawing\nattention to Karris. By now, she’d probably decided whether she was going\nto stay or go.\nShe was almost gone, already starting down the swift-flowing river on\na little punt. If Gavin knew Karris, though, she would stop and try to see\nwhat happened to him. After all, she was a Blackguard, and though their\nfirst responsibility was always to the White, his protection came in a close\nsecond. He wondered if she’d left because she trusted him, because she\nthought he could fend for himself, or because she had her own mission to\naccomplish and nothing could be allowed to interfere with that.\nThe stout boy, on the other hand, was now almost directly behind\nGavin. After Gavin had saved him once from Mirrormen, apparently he\nthought Gavin was his best hope to survive.\n“You misunderstand me, King Garadul,” Gavin said, turning once\nmore, committed, letting the title stand. “I saw these men slaughtering the\ninnocent citizens of your satrapy. I intervened to save your people. I\nbelieved I was doing you a favor.”\n“Doing me a favor by murdering soldiers in my uniform?”\n“Renegades, surely. Bandits. What sort of madman would burn his\nown town to the ground?”\nMany of the Mirrormen looked away or down and threw furtive\nglances at King Garadul. Clearly, not all of them had been happy to murder\ntheir countrymen. The king flushed. “I am king,” he declared. “I will not\nhave my choices questioned. Especially not by the Chromeria. Tyrea is a\nsovereign nation. Our internal conflicts are no business of yours.” The\nsoldiers went back to being stony-faced.\n“Of course not. It’s simply… novel to find a king burning his own\ntown and people. Murdering children. You can understand my confusion,\nI’m sure. My apologies for this misunderstanding.

        "text": "the Seven Satrapies. Tyrea included.”\nIt was, perhaps, as well played as Gavin could manage. If they’d been\nstanding before fifty nobles versed in the interplay of nations and respectful\nof diplomacy, it might have been enough. Rask Garadul would demand\nsome monetary consideration, allowing it had been an honest and\nunderstandable error and preserving his own right to have been outraged,\nand Gavin would be understood to have won. Elegant and clean.\nBut Rask Garadul was a young man and a new king. He was not\nstanding in front of nobles, but in front of his men. He saw that he was\nlosing, but with the bloody corpses piled on every side and his men looking\naskance at him, he didn’t think he could afford to lose. “Surely you haven’t\ncome hundreds of leagues simply to patrol our kingdom for bandits? And\nunannounced, no less. One would think you’d snuck into our kingdom\nunder cover of darkness, like some sort of spy.”\nAh, not stupid either. When on a losing path, take a new one, quick.\nGavin glanced once more at the boy, to see how he was holding up. Not\nwell. He was practically quivering with terror. He had eyes only for Rask\nGaradul. Or was that rage?\n“A spy?” Gavin said lightly. “How droll. No no no. One has people to\ndo that sort of thing. One doesn’t do it oneself. Surely you’ve been king\nlong enough to know this?”\n“What are you doing here?” King Garadul demanded. Again,\nshockingly rude if they’d been in a court in any capital in the Seven\nSatrapies. He glanced at the boy, and Gavin knew he was lost. He could\nleave—he was the Prism, after all, and even killing thirty of Garadul’s\nMirrormen wasn’t enough to justify his seizure or murder. Especially not\nunder questionable circumstances. Rask would risk uniting the satrapies\nagainst Tyrea. Killing a satrap would be an outrageous breach; killing the\nPrism would be an unconscionable one. But Rask felt he was losing, and he\nwas going to make Gavin pay for that. He was going to hurt him as badly as\nhe could.\nGavin would be released; the boy would be killed.\n“I saw smoke,” Gavin said. “One of the ways I serve the Seven\nSatrapies is by dealing with color wights. I came to help.”\n“What are you doing in our kingdom?”\n“I wasn’t aware you’d closed your borders. Indeed, I wasn’t aware of\nthis new ‘kingdom’ at all. This seems needlessly… hostile. Especially to\nwish to bar a servant of the realms like myself.” The myth of polite\ndialogue between disinterested, reasonable neighbors, that myth upon\nwhich so much of diplomacy rested, was clearly dead, so to turn the\nattention away, Gavin stepped right over its corpse. “Are you hiding\nsomething, King Garadul?”\n“You’re from Rekton, aren’t you, boy?” King Garadul asked. He\nwasn’t going to play Gavin’s game. “What’s your name? Who’s your\nfather?”\n“I’m Kip. I’ve got no father. Most of us don’t. Not since the war.” It"

        "text": "wasn’t going to play Gavin’s game. “What’s your name? Who’s your\nfather?”\n“I’m Kip. I’ve got no father. Most of us don’t. Not since the war.” It\nsent a lance through Gavin’s guts. He’d almost let himself forget. The False\nPrism’s War had wiped out dozens of these little towns. All the men, from\nboys who couldn’t grow a mustache to old men who had to use their spears\nas canes, had been pressed into service by one side or the other. And he and\nDazen had sent them against some of the most talented drafters the world\nhad known. Like lumber to a mill.\n“What about your mother, then?” King Garadul asked, irritated.\n“Her name was Lina. She helped at a couple of the inns.”\nGavin’s heart stopped. Lina, the crazy woman who’d sent him the\nnote, was dead. This boy, this fearful boy, was supposed to be his son? The\nonly survivor from a town burnt to the ground stood here, and he was the\nonly one who could cause Gavin grief. If Gavin had believed in Orholam,\nhe’d have thought it a cruel prank.\n“Lina, yes, I think that was the name of the whore,” King Garadul said.\n“Where is she?”\n“My mother was no whore! And you killed her! You murderer!” The\nboy looked near tears, though of rage or grief Gavin couldn’t tell.\n“Dead? She stole something from me. You’ll take us to your house,\nand if we can’t find it, you’ll work for me until you pay it off.”\nRask Garadul wasn’t going to have the boy work off his mother’s debt.\nGavin had no doubt Rask was lying about the whole thing. It was merely an\nexcuse to take the boy—who, if Rask was a king, was one of the king’s\nsubjects. Most likely, Rask would kill him right in front of Gavin, just to\nsalve his own pride. The boy meant nothing. He could have been a dog or a\nnice blanket for all Rask cared. He’d become a chit. Part of Gavin was\nsickened, and part of him reveled in it.\nPut me in a situation where I can’t win? Really? You think this is\nimpossible for me? Let’s play.\n“The boy goes with me,” Gavin said.\nRask Garadul smiled unpleasantly. He had a gap between his front\nteeth. He looked more like a bulldog baring its teeth than a man smiling.\n“You’re going to risk your life for this thief? Hand him over, Prism.”\n“Or what?” Gavin asked, deliberately polite, curious, as if he really\nwondered. Threats so often withered when you pulled them out into the\nlight, naked.\n“Or my men will say how there was a big misunderstanding. We had\nno idea the Prism was here. If only he’d announced his coming. If only he\nhadn’t been confused and attacked my soldiers. We simply defended\nourselves. It was only after his unfortunate death that we discovered our\nerror.”\nGavin smirked. He put a fist to his mouth to cover his chuckle. “No,\nRask. There’s a reason I don’t travel with Blackguards: I don’t need them."

        "text": "error.”\nGavin smirked. He put a fist to his mouth to cover his chuckle. “No,\nRask. There’s a reason I don’t travel with Blackguards: I don’t need them.\nYou were just a snot-nosed boy during the False Prism’s War, so maybe you\ndon’t remember what I can do, but I can tell that some of your men do.\nThey’re the ones who look nervous. If your men attack, I will kill you. The\nWhite will be furious with me for a month or two. It will be a diplomatic\nproblem, to be certain, but do you really think anyone cares what happens\nto the king of Tyrea? ‘King,’ not satrap, and thus a rebel. They’ll only want\nassurances that it won’t happen to them. We’ll make promises and\napologies and pay the tuitions of all Tyrean students for a few years, and\nthat will be the end of it. Your successor will doubtless be less belligerent.”\nRask moved to speak, but Gavin wasn’t about to let him.\n“But let’s pretend for a moment that by some chance you actually\nkilled me without being killed in turn. I see what you’re doing here: razing\na town so you can raise an army. Founding your own Chromeria. The\nquestion is, do you think you’re ready, right now, for war? Because if I go\nback now, armed only with words, the Spectrum might not believe me. But\nif you kill me, that will be a more elegant testimony than any I could\nmuster. And do you really think your version of what happened is the only\nversion that’s going to get out? You are a young king, aren’t you? And here\nyou were talking about spies just moments ago.”\nSilence stretched cool hands between them. Gavin had won as\ncompletely as he’d probably ever won a pure argument.\n“The boy is my subject and a thief. He stays.” Garadul’s whole body\nwas quivering with fury. He wasn’t calling Gavin’s bluff. He was simply\nrefusing to lose.\nGavin hadn’t been bluffing. Nine times out of ten, he could probably\nkill every one of these soldiers and drafters—depending on how good the\ndrafters were. And he’d probably emerge with nothing more than a singed\neyebrow. Protecting the child during such a fight was another matter. Is it\nbetter that the guilty should perish, or that the innocent should live?\nAnd not all of the Seven Satrapies would be quite as quick to forgive\nas he’d pretended.\n“He’s no thief,” he said, looking to redirect the conversation from a\npure I-win/you-lose bifurcation. “He’s got nothing but the clothes on his\nback. Whatever his mother may or may not have done, it’s nothing to do\nwith him.”\n“Easy enough to test, isn’t it?” Rask asked. “Search him.”\nFrom the look on his face, apparently Kip was a thief. Unbelievable.\nWhere was hiding whatever he’d stolen? Between rolls of fat?\n“No! It’s the last thing she gave to me! You took everything else. You\ncan’t have it! I’ll kill you first!” There was a wildness in the boy’s voice\nthat Gavin recognized immediately, even before Kip’s irises were flooded"

        "text": "can’t have it! I’ll kill you first!” There was a wildness in the boy’s voice\nthat Gavin recognized immediately, even before Kip’s irises were flooded\nwith jade green. The boy was going to attack King Garadul, his Mirrormen,\nand his drafters. Very brave, but more stupid.\nKing Garadul’s drafters would see it too.\nGavin threw his left hand up in a quick arc, forming a wall of red,\ngreen, yellow, and blue luxin intertwined between Kip and King Garadul’s\nmen. With his right hand, he drafted a blue cudgel and clubbed Kip over the\nback of the head. The boy crumpled. Only Karris, Gavin thought, could\nhave done it faster.\nA single red luxin fireball thrown by one of Garadul’s drafters hit the\nwall and sizzled as it plunged into Gavin’s shield, instantly extinguished.\nEveryone else stood stunned. Gavin released the shield. A few of the\nMirrormen were looking again at the corpses of their comrades, maybe\nthinking that their deaths were no fluke. Rask Garadul alone seemed\nunfazed. He dismounted, walked over to the unconscious boy, and searched\nhim roughly.\nRask Garadul produced a slender rosewood case that had been tucked\ninside the back of Kip’s belt. He opened it a crack, shot a satisfied smile at\nGavin, and tucked it in his own belt. He walked back to his horse and\nmounted.\n“A thief and an attempted assassin. Thank you for your service in\nfoiling the attack, Lord Prism.” King Garadul motioned one of his men\ntoward Kip. “I think that tree should support a noose. Will you be staying\nfor the execution, Gavin?”\nSo this is where it ends. This is the cost of my sins.\n“There was no attempt on your life, King Garadul. We both know that.\nThe boy didn’t even draft. I was merely disciplining him as a Chromeria\nstudent for considering drafting without permission. You have the box, and\nyou’ve already murdered the supposed thief, his mother. A harsh\npunishment to be sure, but this is your satrapy—er, ‘kingdom.’ It’s obvious\nhe knew nothing of it except that his mother gave it to him. Whatever claim\nyou have to him pales in comparison to mine.”\n“He’s my subject, and therefore mine to do with as I will.”\nOnly one card left. Gavin said, “You asked earlier why I came to this\nboiling latrine you call a country. Kip is the reason. My claim to him is\ngreater than yours. He’s my bastard.”\nRask Garadul’s eyes went stony, and Gavin knew he had won. No man\nwould publicly claim a dishonor if it weren’t true. He also knew from that\nlook, before the man even spoke, that he was going to have to kill Rask\nGaradul. But not today.\n“Your time is finished,” Rask Garadul said. “Yours and the\nChromeria’s. You’re done. Light cannot be chained. Know this, Prism: We\nwill take back what you’ve stolen. The horrors of your reign are almost at\nan end. And when it ends, I will be there. This I swear.”\nChapter 18"

This I swear.”\nChapter 18\nKarris floated the punt downstream until she rounded a corner and\ndisappeared from sight. She didn’t think the soldiers had seen her leave, so\nshe beached the punt on the opposite side of the river and found a hill from\nwhich she could see Gavin. She climbed the hill on her hands and knees.\nThere were several trees and bushes and long grasses between them. Ideal.\nWhat wasn’t ideal was the distance. One hundred and twenty paces. She\nwas a great shot, but the bow she’d brought was a simple recurve, not a\nlongbow. Good and portable, very accurate to seventy paces. One twenty\nwas a different question. She shuttled the mental abacus. She should be\naccurate within four feet, and she could shoot rapidly. If Satrap Garadul\nstood still, she could shoot four arrows within a few seconds, correcting for\nher mistakes. Good enough. At least, better than any of her other options.\nShe scooted back from the top of the hill and strung her bow, checked the\nfletching and trueness of her arrows, and crawled back into position, hidden\nand deadly.\nWhen Gavin and the satrap talked for a few minutes, Karris relaxed. In\nconversation, Gavin could tie anyone in knots except maybe the White.\nThough Gavin was standing amid piles of Rask Garadul’s dead, now it was\nprobably just a matter of how much the satrap would pay Gavin for\ntroubling him.\nMaking sure she could still see Gavin and that her weapons were close,\nKarris opened her pack. The White had told her not to read her orders until\nshe’d left for Tyrea, so Karris had put the orders in the bottom of her pack,\nbeneath a change of clothes, spare spectacles, cooking implements, a few\nflares and grenadoes—thank Orholam those hadn’t ignited when she fell\nduring the fight, but they were worth the risk. She pulled out the folded\nnote. As sensitive orders always were, it was made of the thinnest paper\npossible, the outer folds covered with scribbles so the translucent paper\ncouldn’t simply be held up to the light to read what was within. The seal\nhad a simple spell trigger: anyone who simply broke the seal would bring\ntwo luxin contact points together, and there would be a small but instant\nfire. It wasn’t foolproof, of course: any careful drafter could disarm it, or\nany non-drafter could simply cut around the seal, but sometimes simple\nprecautions worked where more elaborate schemes did not.\nKarris checked on Gavin. Still talking. Good.\nDrafting a bit of green from the grass she was sitting on, she unhooked\nthe trap on the seal. Gavin had told her not to believe what was on this note,\nwhich had been written by the White herself. So who was more likely to lie\nto her? Gavin, ten times out of ten. The thought made her sick to her\nstomach. No, she was getting ahead of herself. She almost put the note\naway—she could deal with this later.\nBut her orders had to do with Tyrea, maybe even with Satrap Garadul,"

The orders could be to kill him—or\nto make sure no one else did. She had to know right now.\nShe opened the note. The White’s script was a little shaky, but still\nexpressive and elegant. Karris translated the thin code automatically.\n“Inasmuch as purple may be the new color, we’d all be gratified to know the\nnew fashions.” Infiltrate and ascertain the satrap’s intentions. The Seven\nSatrapies and the Chromeria are nervous about the new satrap and what he\nwants.\nThere was a curlicue on the last “s” to let her know the formal code\nwas ended, but the note continued. “I also have news of a fifteen-year-old\nboy in a town called Rekton. His mother claims he is G’s. If you have the\nchance, find out. I’d love to meet them.” Gavin had a bastard in Rekton.\nBring mother and son to the Chromeria.\nKarris looked toward Gavin in time to see him draft a cudgel and crack\nit over the back of the boy’s head. It would have been either funny or\nalarming, except that she felt like she’d been hit the same way. She\nwatched, dumbfounded, as Gavin threw up a luxin wall, quenched an\nattack, and kept talking—cool to the end.\nShe was so stunned, she didn’t pick up the bow, didn’t draw. This was\nRekton. That boy could draft. It was too much of a coincidence. She had\nbeen the one who insisted Gavin turn the flying contraption here. She felt a\nchill. For them to be here now was nothing less than Orholam’s hand\nmoving. Karris knew Orholam didn’t care about her. She wasn’t important\nenough. So what was this? A test for Gavin?\nFifteen years old. Son of a bitch. That child had been conceived while\nshe and Gavin were betrothed.\nGavin picked up the boy, straining—the boy was both tall and chubby\n—and threw him over a shoulder. Then he walked toward the river, as if he\ndidn’t have a care in the world. The man really was walking away from a\nsatrap, leaving thirty of the satrap’s bodyguards dead. As always, Gavin was\naudacious, unstoppable, unflappable. The ordinary rules just didn’t apply to\nhim.\nNever had.\nFor a single, perilous moment, Karris was sixteen again, with\neverything she had known, everyone she had loved torn away. She’d wept\nthat day, wept until she realized no one was going to comfort her. She’d\ndrafted red to take comfort from its heat and fury. She’d drafted so much\nred it had almost killed her. Today, she didn’t even need to draft. The fury\nwas there in a heartbeat. “Don’t believe what’s in your orders,” Gavin had\nsaid. Of course he had. The liar. The son of a bitch.\nThat was why the White had told her not to open her orders\nimmediately. She’d wanted Karris to cool off before she had to face Gavin."

She’d wanted Karris to cool off before she had to face Gavin.\nTo not cause problems.\nNice to see that the two most important people in her life were both\nmanipulating her.\nGavin drafted a scull onto the river and set the boy down. He didn’t\nhurry, merely let the current take him, not so much as turning. It must have\nbeen a near thing, then. He was treating Satrap Garadul like he was a dog\nand eye contact might provoke him. Being treated like a dog, well, Karris\nknew all about that, didn’t she?\nShe found herself on her feet, striding back toward the river. Her\nspectacles had mysteriously found their perch on her nose. If Satrap\nGaradul weren’t just two hundred paces away, Karris thought she’d have\nhurled a fireball at Gavin’s head. He rounded the corner on the punt and saw\nthe look on her face.\nHe blanched. And, for once, said nothing.\nKarris stood on the bank of the river, trembling as he floated nearer\nand nearer.\nGavin didn’t ask if she’d read her orders, he could tell. “Get in,” he\nsaid. “If you have that black cloak, cover yourself. Better that they don’t get\na good look at you.”\n“Go to hell. I’ll make my own way,” Karris said.\nHe extended a hand and blasted a fist-size hole in her punt with a\nbullet of green luxin. “Get in!” he commanded. “King Garadul’s coming\nany minute.”\n“King?” She drafted green luxin to cover the hole. It was petty and\ndumb, and curse Gavin for making her seem unreasonable. She hated him.\nShe hated him with a passion that made all the world fade. Just let the\nhorsemen come on her now.\n“He’s rejected the Chromeria, the Prism, the Seven Satrapies, Orholam\nhimself. He’s set himself up as a king.” Gavin swept a hand toward her\npunt. Hundreds of tiny fingerling missiles flew from his hand and stuck\nquivering in the wood along the entire length and breadth of the punt, and\nthen they burst all at once. Woodchip shrapnel and sawdust sprayed over\nboth of them. Gavin said, “Slap me and be done with it, but get your ass in\nthe boat.”\nHe was right. Karris got in. This was not the time. She rummaged\nthrough her pack for the cloak and threw it on, pulling up the hood despite\nthe heat. The boy was still unconscious. Gavin didn’t wait, as soon as she\nwas in, he drafted the oars and straps. They hit the water, and the scull sped\nforward almost immediately. Karris looked back and wasn’t much surprised\nto see a dozen horsemen crest a hill, coming after them.\nBut it was a hopeless pursuit. The land along the river wasn’t smooth,\nand Gavin’s scull was fast. Gavin and Karris said nothing, not even when\nthe scull entered a long section of rapids. Karris helped widen the platform\nwith flexible red luxin and stiffer green, giving it a wide and high lip. Gavin"

Gavin\ndrafted slick orange onto the bottom of it so when they did hit rocks, they\nslid right over them.\nWithin half an hour, they were certainly safe. Still Karris said nothing.\nHow many times could one man hurt you this badly? She couldn’t even\nlook at him. She was furious with herself. He’d seemed so different after\nthe war. His breaking their betrothal had left her with nothing. She’d left for\na year, and he’d seemed overjoyed when she came back. He’d respected her\ndistance, never said anything when she had a few affairs to try to purge him\nfrom her mind. That had somehow made her more furious. But eventually,\nshe’d been drawn back to the mystery of him, and slowly won over by this\nman who seemed so completely changed by the war.\nHow many men come back from war better?\nNone, apparently.\nAnd how many women come back smarter?\nNot this one.\nThe river was joined by another tributary and widened considerably\nand Karris’s place at the prow, looking out for rocks, became unnecessary.\nIt was a beautiful day. She took off the cloak and felt the sun’s rays—\nOrholam’s caress, her mother had told her when she was a little girl. Right.\n“They say there are bandits on this river who rob anyone who comes\nthrough,” Gavin said lightly. “So maybe we’ll find someone for you to kill.”\n“I don’t want to kill someone,” Karris said quietly, not meeting his\ngaze.\n“Oh, you had that look in your eye—”\nShe looked up and smiled sweetly. “Not someone. I want to kill you.”\nChapter 19\n“Ah.” Gavin cleared his throat.\nThe boy twitched, and then sat bolt upright. Maybe hearing “I want to\nkill you” wasn’t the best way to be awakened after your village had been\nmassacred. Gavin raised an eyebrow at Karris. You really need to do this\nnow?\nShe huffed out a breath and turned away while the boy rubbed his head\nand moaned. The boy squinted at her, but she kept her back to him. She\nbusied herself unstringing her bow and stowing it. The boy turned his royal\nblue eyes to Gavin. Interesting, with his light brown skin and kinky hair.\nBlue eyes were blue because they were the deepest, and thus the most light-\nsensitive and best light-collecting. It was far from the only criterion, but\npeople with blue eyes were disproportionately represented among the most\npowerful drafters. More light to use, more power to burn.\nRight now, those deep eyes were narrowed in pain. Apparently Gavin’s\nswat had left the boy with a nice headache.\n“You saved me,” Kip said.\nGavin nodded.\n“Who are you?” the boy asked.\nStraight to the gut, huh? Karris turned to see what Gavin would say.\nShe folded her arms.\nGavin stopped rowing. “This is Lady Karris White Oak, who, despite\nthe sometimes humorously juxtaposed conjunctions of name and skin color\nand title, is a member of the Blackguard.” Karris’s look of fury didn’t shift"

Apparently the old jokes still weren’t funny. “And I…”\nHe’d introduced Karris first to give himself a moment to think. It hadn’t\nworked. Five years and five purposes left, Gavin. This might be your last\nchance.\nThe boy had been unconscious when Gavin had claimed his patrimony.\nHe didn’t know. He didn’t have to know. Better for him not to know, in\nmany ways. But better still for him not to hear it from Karris first, in a burst\nof rage. This boy was not his son, but without Gavin and Dazen’s war—the\nPrisms’ War or the False Prism’s War, depending on which side you’d\nfought—none of the children of Rekton or a hundred other villages would\nbe fatherless now. Gavin fantasized again for a moment about telling Karris\neverything she didn’t know, and letting the chips fall where they may. But\nKarris wouldn’t believe a partial truth and couldn’t handle it whole.\nAt least this lie would give an orphan a father. It would give a child\nwho’d lost everything one thing back. Gavin shouldn’t care, but he did.\n“I’m Prism Gavin Guile. I’m… you’re my natural son.”\nThe boy looked at him like he didn’t understand what Gavin had said.\n“Perfect,” Karris said. “Why don’t you just drop everything on him at\nonce? Why don’t you think, Gavin? I swear you’re as impulsive as Dazen\never was.”\nImpulsive? Pot, meet kettle. Gavin ignored Karris, looking only at the\nboy. He’d just admitted to cheating on her years ago, lying to her about it\nafterward, and then—just an hour ago—lying to her again. She was doing\ncold rage, and it didn’t fit her. Hot rage was more her style.\nThe boy glanced at her, confused by her anger, then glanced back. He\nwas still squinting, though Gavin couldn’t tell how much of that was from\nhis headache from being cracked across the back of the head, how much\nmight be lightsickness from drafting, and how much was confusion from\nhis rapidly changing situation.\n“You’re what?” Kip asked.\n“You’re my natural son.” It was too hard, for some reason, to say, “I’m\nyour father.”\n“And you come now?” Kip asked, sick despair painting his face. “Why\ndidn’t you come yesterday? You could have saved everyone!”\n“I didn’t know you existed until this morning. And we came as fast as\nhumanly possible.” Faster, really. “If your town hadn’t been on fire, we\nwouldn’t have known to come.”\n“You didn’t know about me? How could you not know?” Kip asked\nplaintively.\n“Enough!” Gavin roared. “I’m here now! I saved your life, probably at\nthe cost of a war that will make ten thousand more orphans. What more do\nyou want?”\nKip withered, shrank in on himself.\n“Unbelievable. You bully,” Karris said. “You’re given a son, and the\nfirst thing you do is scream at him. You’re a brave man, Gavin Guile.”"

You’re a brave man, Gavin Guile.”\nThe unfairness of it all made Gavin’s fists curl. Justice and injustice\nand the insanity of this life he’d chosen boiled over. “You want to lecture\nme about bravery? Is this the woman who ran away from a noble house to\nbecome a guard? Trying to get yourself killed through work or using too\nmuch magic isn’t bravery, Karris; it’s cowardice. What do you want from\nme? You want me to bring back your dead brothers?”\nKarris slapped him. “Don’t,” she said. “Don’t you ever—”\n“Talk about your brothers? Your brothers were vipers. Everyone\nbreathed a sigh of relief when Dazen killed them. The best thing he ever did\nwas kill them, and the best thing they ever did was die.”\nKarris’s eyes went red, and luxin curled through her skin in an instant.\nGavin felt a stab of fear—not for himself. He could stop whatever she threw\nhis way. But every time a person drafted huge quantities, they hastened\ntheir own death. And they granted their color more sway over them. When\nhe’d first met Karris, her jade green eyes had only the smallest ruby stars in\nthem. Now, even at rest, when she wasn’t drafting, those ruby stars\ndominated the green.\nBut Karris didn’t attack. She said, “I’m a slow learner, but I finally got\nit. You’ve betrayed me for the last time, Gavin.” She nearly spat his name.\n“I—”\n“You damn stubborn woman! I love you, Karris. I’ve always loved\nyou.”\nIt was like the wind went out of her sails for a few heartbeats. Red\nluxin drained from her fingertips. Then, when Gavin was just starting to\nhope, she said, “You dare? You unbelievable—you—you—Gavin Guile,\nyou’ve brought me nothing but misery and death. We’re finished!” She\ngrabbed her bag and jumped off the boat.\nGavin was too startled to say anything. He watched as Karris swam to\nshore and then dragged herself and her bag out of the water. She could\ntravel to Garriston without him, of course, and she’d still arrive earlier than\nher contact had expected. There were, of course, bandits to worry about,\nand a woman traveling alone would make a prime target.\nIf the bandits got careless because of that fact, they’d be lucky to\nsurvive. But everyone had to sleep sometime. Karris was being rash, but\nnothing Gavin could say would make any difference.

She liked having a plan. She\nliked order, structure, hierarchy. Even as a child, she enjoyed learning\netiquette. Sitting at a Parian formal dinner and knowing the exact function\nof every tiny spoon and shell cracker, knowing how many times to flick the\nexcess water from your fingers after washing in the water bowl between the\nfirst and second course, and knowing where exactly to set your three-tined\nurum to let the table slaves know you were finished eating brought her\nsomething akin to peace. Placing your goblet halfway over the lateral\ndivisor meant you wanted exactly half a glass more wine. On the vertical\nmeant you’d like to switch from white to red. Sign and countersign. The\nluxiat’s call and the congregation’s response. She loved dance and could\nperform most of the dances of the Seven Satrapies. She loved music and\ncould play the gemshorn or accompany herself on the psantria while she\nsang. But nothing she’d learned was helping her now. There was no\nstructure, no hierarchy, no order to direct her.\nShe was supposed to still be on a ship. She was supposed to meet with\na Chromeria spy before she got this far into Tyrea. He was supposed to\nguide her up the river to King Garadul’s army and give her a cover that\nwould get her into the army without getting killed. Instead, she was\ndripping wet, alone, and less than a full day’s walk from that army, with no\nintroduction, no map, no guidelines, no plan. Gavin and his bastard had\ndisappeared down the river not five minutes ago.\nI’m getting reckless. The red is destroying me.\nKarris wrung out her heavy black wool cloak and started looking for a\nplace to make camp. On the hillside there were huge numbers of eucalyptus\ntrees filling the air with their fragrance, mixing with the taller pines,\nblocking out the harsh rays of Orholam’s bright eye. It took her only a few\nminutes to find a decent spot mostly obscured by brush. She gathered wood\nand made a little pyramid. She didn’t bother with kindling: there were\nadvantages to being a red. But she did look around carefully for several\nminutes before she drew out her spectacles from their little pocket up one\nsleeve. She was alone. She drafted a thin thread of red luxin into the base of\nher pyramid.\nEven drafting that much red blew on the coals of her fury. She tucked\naway the red and green lenses and thought of smashing Gavin’s grinning\nface. I love you? How dare he?\nShe shook her head and shook her finger out, flinging away\ndeliberately off-center red luxin, getting rid of the excess. As with all luxin\ndrafted imperfectly, it decayed rapidly, releasing a paired scent: the smell of\nresin that all luxin shared and the odd, dried-tea-leaves-and-tobacco smell\nof red in particular.\nShe took out a flint and her knife instead of drafting sub-red directly\nfor a spark. She was already cold, so she struck the spark like a mere\nmortal."

She was already cold, so she struck the spark like a mere\nmortal.\nI love you. That bastard.\nWhile her wet clothes dried, she changed into the spare clothing that\nhad been in her waterproof bag. Tyrean fashion had become mercifully\npractical in the last fifteen years. Though in social or urban settings women\nwore calf- or ankle-length dresses belted and often accompanied with a\nwrap or a full jacket for the evening, on the trail and in the countryside\nwomen often wore men’s linen trousers, albeit with longer shirts than men\nwore as a nod to modesty, worn untucked but belted, like a tunic. The way\nCommander Ironfist had explained it to her was that after the False Prism’s\nWar, there hadn’t been enough men and boys to harvest the oranges or other\nfruits. The young women who’d joined the harvesters had shortened their\nskirts to make it easier to climb ladders repeatedly. Clearly someone had\nobjected to that. Probably not the young men holding the ladders.\nThus the addition of trousers.\nKarris liked the clothing. She was used to wearing men’s clothes from\ntraining with the Blackguard, and if this loose linen didn’t move with her as\nnicely or feel as soft as the stretchy, luxin-infused Blackguard garb, it was\nstill cool. It also did a better job of camouflaging her body than the tight\nBlackguard garb. No man would dare so much as whistle at a woman\nBlackguard on the Jaspers, even if she was flaunting a hard-earned figure a\nlittle. A woman traveling alone in a far country shouldn’t tempt fate more\nthan necessary.\nAs her little fire burned merrily, Karris distracted herself by arming\ncarefully. Her ataghan would sit concealed and fairly accessible within her\npack once the black cloak was dried and rolled up. A bich’hwa—a scorpion\n—was strapped to one thigh inside her trousers. It was a weapon with iron\nrings to fit the fingers, four claws for swiping, and a dagger—the scorpion’s\ntail—for stabbing. It wasn’t quickly accessible, but she always thought it\nwas good to have more weapons than were visible. Another long knife was\ntucked into her belt. Her bifocal spectacles went into the bag. Their weight\nsimply made them too obvious if she concealed them in these long, flowing\nsleeves. That left her with her eye caps. The caps, with horizontally\nstreaked lenses of red and green, each fit onto an eye socket, as tight and\nclose to the eye as possible. A thin ridge of sticky red luxin made sure the\nlenses would stay on her face—and, if she weren’t careful, would rip off\nhalf her eyebrow when she removed them. The sticky red luxin was\nshielded with a little strip of solid yellow luxin that was to be torn off\nbefore you stuck the caps onto your eyes.\nFor all that the eye caps had saved her life a time or three, Karris didn’t\nlike them. Naturally long eyelashes were a nice accessory at the Luxlords’\nBall, but not so much when you had a lens a finger’s breadth from your eye.\nKarris hid her caps in plain sight, on a necklace made of chunky"

The caps clicked together around one link and blended with\nall the other stones. Another pair of caps was tucked under her belt buckle.\nI’m stalling, she thought.\nFrom where she was now, she had only two choices. She could head\ndown the river and meet up with her contact in Garriston and then come\nback up the river, or she could try to infiltrate King Garadul’s army on her\nown. Going down the river would waste time, and she’d still be much too\nearly. There was also the threat of bandits. She assumed her contact would\nhave some good way of circumventing them on the way back up, but that\nwouldn’t help her as she headed downriver. Going on alone would mean\ntrying to join a hostile army without a proper introduction. And now that\nGavin had clashed with King Garadul, the king knew that the Chromeria\nhad already gotten one drafter here, so surely he would be doubly\nsuspicious of anyone else showing up.\nIn fact, Gavin’s little stunt in Rekton had probably made her work\nimpossible. There were certainly Tyreans as pale as she was, but her accent\nwas wrong, and she was a drafter. To a suspicious camp, everything about\nher would scream spy. The White’s orders had never factored in the\ncircumstances in which she found herself now. It was like sitting at what\nyou thought was a dignified Parian dinner with its rules, and finding\nyourself seated with raucous Ilytian pirates feeding you blowfish instead.\nThere were rules for that too, and if you broke them, you’d consume a nice\ntender morsel that contained a poison that would leave you in agony for ten\nminutes, at which point it would leave you dead.\nAnd Karris didn’t know the rules here.\nOf course, Gavin would just eat the whole damned fish—and\nsomehow, miraculously, it wouldn’t harm him. Everything was effortless\nfor Gavin. He’d never had to work hard for anything. Born with a\nmonumental talent to a scheming rich father, he simply took what he\nwanted. Even the rules of being a Prism didn’t constrain him—he traveled\nto and fro about the Seven Satrapies without so much as a Blackguard\nescort when he didn’t want one. And now he could cross the Cerulean Sea\nin a few hours. For Orholam’s sake, now he could fly.\nGet out of my head, liar. I’m done with you.\nThe lines didn’t fit. The tiny spoons were gone, and the urums had a\nthousand tines instead of three. Fine. Karris wasn’t going home. She wasn’t\ngoing to wait for some man to come hold her hand and get her into\nGaradul’s camp. She wasn’t going to fail. There was more than one way to\nfind out what King Garadul’s plans were.\nOf course, she didn’t know what those were, but she was going to\nfigure it out. As for now, she remembered something her brother Koios used\nto say before he’d been killed in the fire: “When you don’t know what to"

But not necessarily what’s\nright in front of you.”\nThe town of Rekton had been burned to the ground. There had been\none survivor. There might be more, and if there were, they would be in\ndesperate need of help and possibly protection. Those, Karris could provide.\nAnd if it involved lighting some jackass up with a fireball the size of a\nsmall house, so much the better.\nChapter 21\nThey practically flew down the river. Kip had never traveled so fast in his\nlife. And the Prism didn’t speak a word, sunk into his own dark mood. For\nmost of the afternoon, Gavin Guile worked what the scull had in the place\nof oars—for a while, it would be almost like a ladder, then it would be like\nthe bellows of a forge, then it would be oars, then it would be a rolling\ntrack. Gavin worked at one until he was exhausted, muscles quivering,\nsweat matting his thin shirt. Then he would draft a little, the oars would\nchange to some new shape that gave his most weary muscles a rest, and he\nwould keep going.\nWhen Kip finally found his voice, he said, “Sir, um, he took my case?”\nHe wasn’t going to ask about Karris White Oak or what Gavin had said.\nNot now. Not ever.\nGavin looked at Kip, his mouth tight. Kip regretted speaking at once.\n“It was that or your life.”\nKip paused, then said, “Thank you, sir. For saving me.” That seemed\nlike a better choice than saying, But that was mine! It was the last thing—\nthe only thing—my mother ever gave me!\n“You’re welcome,” Gavin said. He glanced back up the river, his\nthoughts obviously elsewhere.\n“That man, he’s responsible for killing my mother, isn’t he?” Kip\nasked.\n“Yes.”\n“I thought you were going to kill him right there. But you stopped.”\nGavin glanced at him, weighing him. His voice was distant. “I wasn’t\nwilling for the innocent to die so I could kill the guilty.”\n“Those men weren’t innocent! They murdered everyone I know!”\nTears leaked down Kip’s face. He felt ragged, wrung out, finished.\n“I was talking about you.”\nIt caught Kip short, but his emotions were still a jumble. His presence\nhad kept Gavin from killing King Garadul. He didn’t know words that\ncould convey his feelings for that. He’d failed his mother again. He’d\nactually blocked her vengeance by his own incompetence.\nI’ll make good, mother. On my soul. I’ll kill him. I swear it.\nHalf a dozen small villages passed, and dozens of boats. Fed by\ntributaries, the river widened. But Gavin stopped only once, to buy a\nroasted chicken and bread and wine. He threw the food to Kip. “Eat.” Then\nthey were off again. Gavin didn’t eat. He didn’t speak or even slow when\nthey passed the fishermen startled by their appearance."

He didn’t speak or even slow when\nthey passed the fishermen startled by their appearance.\nIt wasn’t until the sun set and Gavin shifted the oars again that Kip\nventured to speak once more. “Can I help… sir?”\nThe Prism gave him an appraising glance, as if he hadn’t even thought\nof having him help. But when he spoke, he said, “I’d really appreciate that.\nHere, stand on this and just walk.” He’d been running. “You can use these\nhand oars to help if you want. Steer by dropping in the hand oar on the side\nyou want to turn toward. Port for port, starboard for starboard, right?”\n“Port is left?”\n“Right.”\nKip blinked. Uh…“Port is right?”\n“Only if you’re facing aft.”\nThe panic must have been clear on Kip’s face, because Gavin\nchuckled. “It doesn’t matter. You just go until you’re too tired, or if we hit\nrapids or bandits. I’m going to rest for a bit.” Gavin sat in Kip’s place and\ntore into the remains of the chicken and bread. He watched as Kip struggled\nwith getting the scull up to a halfway decent pace. Kip turned a time or two\n—it actually was pretty simple—and looked at Gavin to see if he approved,\nbut the Prism was already asleep.\nThe quarter moon was straight overhead as night fell and Kip began\nwalking. Even driven only by Kip’s walking, the scull was fast. Gavin had\nnarrowed the hull even further when Karris had left, so the boat seemed\nmore to hover over the water than plow through it. For the first few\nminutes, Kip was gripped with anxiety. Every turn he was sure they would\nconfront bandits and the Prism wouldn’t awaken. But soon he fell into the\nrhythms of the boat, the waves, and the night.\nAn owl was hooting in the distance, and little bats were swooping and\ndiving, eating the insects that flew high above the water while trout leapt to\neat those that flew too low. The scull startled a heron, which flew off into\nthe night on great blue wings.\nGradually, the peace of the night seeped into Kip. The surface of the\nriver became as smooth as a mirror, and the stars shone in it. He saw ducks\nhuddled on the shore, their heads tucked into their wings. And then he\nlooked once more at the man who was supposedly his father.\nGavin Guile was a muscular man, broad-shouldered but as slender as\nKip was fat. Kip searched for any resemblance at all, some hint that this\ncould be true. Gavin was lighter-skinned; he looked like a mix between a\nRuthgari, who had green or brown eyes, dark hair, and olive skin, and a\nBlood Forester, with their cornflower blue eyes and flaming red hair and\ndeathly pale skin. Gavin’s hair was the color of burnished copper, and his\neyes, of course, were those of a Prism. When he was drafting they looked\nwhatever color he was using at the moment, and could change in an instant."

When he was drafting they looked\nwhatever color he was using at the moment, and could change in an instant.\nWhen he wasn’t drafting, Gavin’s eyes shimmered as if they were prisms\nthemselves, every little twitch sending a cascade of new colors through his\nirises. They were the most disconcerting eyes Kip had ever seen. They were\neyes to make satraps squirm and queens faint. The eyes of Orholam’s\nChosen.\nKip’s eyes were plain blue, which did nothing for him except mark\nhim as a crossbreed. Maybe some Blood Forester lineage. Like most\npeoples, Tyreans had dark eyes. Kip’s hair was dark as a Tyrean’s, but\ntightly curled like a Parian’s or an Ilytian’s, rather than straight or wavy.\nEnough to mark him a freak, but nowhere near enough to mark him this\nman’s son. Of course, his mother hadn’t had the look of a Tyrean either,\nwhich just complicated things. Darker than either, with kinky hair and hazel\neyes. Kip tried to imagine what the child of his mother and this man might\nlook like, but he couldn’t do it. Blend enough mutts, and who knows what\nyou’ll get? Maybe if he weren’t so fat he might see it. Maybe it was simply\na cruel trick. A lie.\nThe Prism. The Prism himself? How could such a man be Kip’s father?\nHe’d said he hadn’t known Kip even existed. How could that happen?\nThe answer seemed pretty obvious. It had been during the war. Gavin’s\narmy had met Dazen’s not far from Rekton. So as they’d come through\ntown, Gavin had met Lina. He was the Prism, heading to what might be his\ndeath. She was a young, pretty girl whose town had been destroyed. She’d\nshared his bed. Then he’d gone on to kill his brother—perhaps the very next\nday—and in the aftermath of the war and the reconstruction and the work of\nputting down the rest of the rebellion and rebuilding alliances and\nadministering the peace, he’d probably never thought of her again. Even if\nhe had, Tyrea wasn’t exactly the friendliest or safest of places for the Prism\nback then. It had sided with Dazen, the evil brother, and been treated cruelly\nas a result.\nOr maybe Gavin had raped Lina. But that didn’t make sense. Why\nwould a rapist claim Kip? Especially because it obviously cost Gavin a lot\nto do so.\nKip could imagine his mother, pregnant, unmarried, left in the\ndevastation that was Rekton. Of course she’d want to escape. Kip would\nhave been her one hope. What would she have done? Travel, alone, to\nGarriston, where the victors were administering Tyrea? He could imagine\nthat well enough. His mother, presenting herself to some governor,\ndemanding to see Gavin Guile because she bore his bastard. She’d have\nbeen lucky if she got as far as a governor with that tale. So she’d been\nturned away, her dreams of anything good or easy in her life dashed.\nWhenever she looked at Kip, she didn’t see her own bad choices, she"

He’d always tired quickly, but if he\npushed through his initial fatigue he had a lot of stamina.\nHe wasn’t going to wake the Prism. Not at all. Let the man rest. He’d\nearned that much from Kip. Kip would keep going until Gavin woke. Even\nif it killed him. He swore it.\nThe oath made Kip feel good. He was insignificant. A nothing. But he\ncould give the Prism himself a good night’s sleep. He could do something.\nHe could matter, in a small way, but a bigger way than he ever had in his\nwhole life.\nHe kept going. The Prism had saved him today. The Prism himself!\nGavin had faced down King Garadul. He’d killed a score or more of\nGaradul’s Mirrormen—and walked away. And Kip had probably\nendangered it all by trying to attack the king. How stupid could he get?\nWith all the drafters there, Kip had thought he could get to the king?\nStupid!\nDespite the coolness of the night, it wasn’t long before Kip was\ncovered in sweat. His fast walk had become a trudge, but that trudge still\ndrove the scull as fast as a horse’s canter.\nKip was so focused on just keeping going that he was on top of the\ncamp before he noticed it. There were maybe a dozen men carousing\naround a fire, drinking and laughing as one strummed a badly out-of-tune\nlute. Kip kept trudging, his brain slow to take in what this had to be. The\nmen were all armed, including one who looked like he was supposed to be\non watch—that one still held his crossbow cocked and ready against his\nshoulder.\nKip thought of whispering to wake Gavin, but they were so close that\nanything loud enough to wake the Prism might be loud enough to carry over\nthe river to the crossbowman who stood just at the edge of the firelight, his\nbody turned toward the river but his head turned to his comrades.\nThe scull made only a slight hiss as it cut across the water. Surely it\nwould be inaudible beneath the merry crackling of the bandits’ fire. The\nbandits had partially dammed the river, with rocks pinching in from either\nside. They’d laid wood planks over the top to make a walkway with only a\ntiny gap in the middle. Any boat that tried to get through would be within\nrange of at least their spears.\nKip could disengage himself from the oars and touch Gavin—but what\ncould Gavin do? It was night.

The crossbowman turned, shaking his head,\nthen froze as he saw Kip. In the dark, the translucent luxin must have been\nwell-nigh invisible to the sentry’s fire-spoiled night vision. He was seeing a\nfat boy running past him—on the river’s surface. Impossible.\nKip smiled and waved.\nThe sentry lifted a hand and waved back. Froze. Looked back at his\ncomrades at the fire. His mouth opened to shout an alarum, but nothing\ncame out. He turned back to the river and looked for Kip.\nKip was still within easy crossbow shot. He knew that, but he didn’t\nspeed up, even though—at this moment—he had energy to spare. Anything\nhe did might spook the sentry.\nThe sentry stared hard into the darkness at the disappearing ghost—\nand said nothing. He rubbed his forehead in consternation, shook his head,\nand turned back to his friends. Then Kip ran, not for long, but after a minute\nof running the scull was hundreds of paces downriver. Kip returned to his\nwalk. He smiled. Stupid as it had been, he’d made it through without even\nwaking the Prism.\nHe didn’t know how long he walked. He tried to keep an eye on the\nshore, but weariness had sunk into his bones. He passed smaller camps—\nwhether of bandits or just innocent travelers, he couldn’t tell. But each time\nhe saw them, he slowed to a crawl until he could see that all the men in the\ncamp were asleep. He even did his trick again of unfocusing his eyes, and\nhe could see the sleeping lumps of several more men than his focused eyes\ncould, but never another sentry.\nThe sky didn’t lighten for what seemed a thousand years.

He extricated himself from the oar\nmechanism and stepped over to grab the wineskin.\nOr tried to. His numb feet got tangled up and he pitched forward,\nbarely able to twist one way so he didn’t crush the Prism. His turned\nshoulder slammed onto the scull’s gunwale, and suddenly everything that\nhad been good about the scull turned bad.

The\nbowl-like flare of the slick hull that had allowed them to slide over rocks\nmeant that the sudden shift in weight was cataclysmic.\nOne moment, Kip was staring at the river from thumbs away. The next,\nthe entire scull flipped. Kip’s head went in first. And yet despite the water\nclosing over his ears and the thrashing of his own stupid clumsy limbs and\nthe crashing of the rest of the scull hitting the water, somehow he was\ncertain he heard a man’s startled yell.\nThe river was warm. Kip was so mortified, he decided to just die and\nget it over with. He’d just dunked the Prism into the river. Orholam!\nOh, he’ll be real impressed now, Kip.\nThen his lungs started burning, and the idea of quietly dying to remove\none ignominious blot from creation lost all appeal. Kip thrashed, weakly.\nHis legs decided now would be a good time to cramp, and both did. Then\nhis left arm. He flapped in the water like a lame bird, got one gulp of air,\nand plunged back down. Part of him knew he could float. He’d floated\nleagues down the river just yesterday, but panic had him fully in its grip. He\nfloundered, took a breath at the wrong time, and sucked in water.\nHis head hurt. Orholam, it was like someone was ripping out all of his\nhair.\nHe spit and spluttered. He was in air! Sweet, precious air! Someone\nhad grabbed him by the hair and pulled him out of the water. He coughed\ntwice more and finally opened his eyes.\nThe Prism was winking at him—no, not winking.

Ignoring the cold in his limbs, ignoring the stiffness\nand pain in his body from sleeping on blue luxin with only a thin blanket,\nhe sat and folded his arms.\nThe dead man was whistling tunelessly, sitting against the opposite\nwall, bobbing his head to a nonexistent beat.\nThe madness of blue was a madness of order. A giist would understand\nevery nuance of Gavin’s prison. But every time Dazen sank into the\nmadness, he was frightened that he’d never come out of it. The last time\nhe’d tried must have been years ago. He’d drafted a lot of blue since then.\nChoosing a descent into the blue again might well be choosing annihilation.\n“Dazen,” the dead man said. “You are Dazen this morning, aren’t\nyou?” It was a favorite trick of the dead man’s, pretending Dazen was the\ncrazy one. “You aren’t thinking of going giist, are you?”\nHe hated his brother for doing this, for forcing this choice. But there\nwas no passion to his hatred. It was a bare fact, as naked as his own limbs,\nstripped of mystery.\nEnough. Better oblivion chosen of his own will than torture forever\naccording to his brother’s.\nDazen drafted blue like he was taking a deep breath. His fingernails\nturned that hateful blue, his hands, arms. It spread over his chest like an icy\ncancer, and it cooled him. His hatred itself became an oddity, a mystery,\nsomething so irrational and powerful it couldn’t be quantified or\nunderstood, merely accounted for approximately. The blue suffused his\nentire body.\n“Bad idea,” the dead man said. “I don’t think you’ll come out of it this\ntime.” He started juggling little blue luxin globes. He could handle five\nnow. When Dazen had first met him, the dead man couldn’t even juggle\nthree.\nWithout passion clouding his study, he could appreciate the cell. His\nbrother was brilliant. What had he said after imprisoning him? “I made this\ndungeon in a month, you will have as long to break out as it takes. Consider\nit a test.” Every time he had given up, he’d returned to that statement. It was\nan admission of imperfection. The cell could be broken. There was a\nweakness; he merely had to find it.\n“The hellstone isn’t the weakness,” the dead man said. “Didn’t I tell"

He respects you too much. It won’t go a few thumbs deep, it’ll go two\npaces.”\nHe was aware, briefly, of a human emotion barely at the threshold of\nhis perception. Loss—fury at how he’d scrubbed piss and oil for years,\nyears of degradation, for nothing. His brother had no interest in degrading\nhim. That wasn’t his way. All that effort, for nothing. He turned those\nfeelings over like an odd stone in his hands, then tossed them aside. They\nonly clouded his vision.\nSomething was sitting right in front of his face, and he wasn’t seeing\nit. It had to be something obvious, something that simply required him to\nlook at the problem from a new angle. His brother had been so good at that\nkind of thinking.\n“Maybe the only question is, are you going to do this Gavin’s way, or\nDazen’s?” the dead man asked. He had that little superior, mocking smile.\nDazen wanted to smash his face in when he grinned like that.\nBut maybe he was right. That was the trap: trying to do this Gavin’s\nway. If he did this his brother’s way, it would only lead deeper.\nHe put his luxin-filled hands to the ground, feeling the outline of the\nwhole structure. The cell was sealed, of course, hardened and guarded\nagainst simple magical tampering, but as before, it felt different to the\nsouth. Not that he was sure it was the south side, he’d merely decided that\nthe one area that felt different would be the south for him, his lodestone.\nThat was where his brother stood when he came to see him. It hadn’t\nhappened in a long time, but there was a room beyond the blue luxin walls\nthere, where Gavin could come when he wanted to check on his brother, to\nassure himself that he was still a prisoner, still safely kept from the world,\nstill suffering as much as he hoped.\nThat would be the weakness. The luxin there had to be thinner,\nsimpler, so Gavin could manipulate it so that he could see through it. It\nwould be warded, of course, but Gavin couldn’t have thought of everything.\nHe’d only had a month.\nBut Dazen’s every attempt with fire had been a failure. Red luxin was\nflammable, so he’d thought that if he cut himself, he could draft red luxin.\nHe could, a little. But that was good for nothing unless he could make it\nburn. A fire would give him full-spectrum light to work with—and he would\nbe able to get out. But he had nothing to make a spark. Trying to leach heat\nfrom his own body had nearly worked—or at least he’d thought he was\nclose, and he’d nearly killed himself the last time by cooling his body too\nmuch.\nIt just wasn’t possible. He was going to die down here. There was\nnothing he could do.\nHe drafted a sledgehammer and, screaming, smashed it against the\nwall. It shattered, of course. It didn’t leave so much as a scratch.\nDazen rubbed his face. No, the enemy was despair. He had to conserve"

Tomorrow he’d rub the bowl more. Maybe tomorrow would be\nthe day.\nHe knew it wouldn’t, but he held on to the lie anyway.\nIn the wall, the dead man was cackling.\nChapter 23\n“We need to talk about your future,” Gavin said. “You have some choices.”\nKip looked at the Prism across their fire. Night was coming on fast in\ntheir little island. Kip had slept for hours, apparently, completely missing\nGarriston and only waking as their boat lurched, hitting the sand as night\nfell.\n“How long will I live?” Kip asked. He was grumpy, hungry, and just\nstarting to comprehend some of the implications of what had happened in\nthe last two days.\n“A question for Orholam himself. I’m just his humble Prism,” Gavin\nsaid, a wry smile twisting his lips. He was looking out into the darkness.\n“You know what I mean.” It came out sharper than Kip meant.\nEveryone he knew was dead, and he was going to be a green drafter. He’d\nseen his future in the color wight: death or madness and then death.\nGavin’s eyes snapped back to Kip. He moved to speak, stopped, then\nsaid, “When you draft, it changes your body, and your body interprets that\nchange as damage—it heals what it can, but it’s always a losing battle, like\naging. Most male drafters make it to forty. Women average fifty.”\n“Then the Chromeria kills us or we go mad?”\nGavin’s face went hard. “You’re getting emotional. I don’t think\nyou’re ready for this.”\n“Not ready?” Kip said. Gavin was right, Kip knew it. He was on edge.\nHe should just shut up, but he couldn’t help himself. “I wasn’t ready for\neveryone I know to be murdered. I wasn’t ready to impale some horsemen\nand jump over a waterfall. Words are nothing. What is it? Once we aren’t\nuseful anymore, we have to kill ourselves?” Why was he yelling? Why was\nhe trembling? Orholam, he’d sworn on his soul to kill a king, was he mad\nalready?\n“Something like that.”\n“That or turn into a color wight?” Kip asked.\n“That’s right.”\n“Well, I guess we’ve talked about my future,” Kip said bitterly. He\nknew he was being snotty, but he couldn’t stop himself.\n“That wasn’t what I meant, and you know it,” Gavin said.\n“How would you know what I know, father?”\nIt was like watching a spring release. One second, the Prism was\nsitting across the fire from Kip. The next, he stood right in front of Kip, his\narm drawn back. The next, Kip was hitting the sand, head ringing from\nGavin’s openhanded blow, ass scraped from sliding off his log, his wind\ntaken by the fall.\n“You’ve been through hell, so I’ve given you more slack than I give\nany man.

Just slobber, not blood.\n“Orholam’s balls!” he said. “Guess what I’ve found? A line! I’m the\ngreatest discoverer since Ariss the Navigator!”\nGavin trembled, his face a mask. He rolled his shoulders, popped his\nneck right and left. Though his back was to their fire, Kip could see red\nluxin smoke-swirls curling into his eyes.\n“What are you going to do? Beat me?” Kip demanded. It’s just pain.\nSometimes Kip hated himself for how he saw weakness. The Prism\nthreatened him and the first thing Kip saw was the threat’s emptiness. Gavin\ncouldn’t beat him precisely because Gavin was a good man and Kip was\ndefenseless.\nGavin’s look darkened to murder for one moment, then cleared to\nsimple intensity. The briefest flicker of amusement. “Take a deep breath,”\nhe said quietly.\n“What?”\nThe Prism made a little backhanded gesture, as if whisking away a fly.\nA gob of red luxin flicked out of his hand and splattered over Kip’s mouth.\nKip took a deep breath through his nose before the luxin spread and covered\nthat, too. Then it wrapped around the back of his head, spread over the top\nof his head, and solidified. Only Kip’s eyes were uncovered, mouth and\nnose were covered, utterly blocked. He couldn’t breathe.\nGavin said, “You remind me of my brother. I could never win against\nhim growing up. And when I did, he’d give me some patronizing praise that\nmade me wonder if he’d let me win. You see the cracks in things? Fine. It’s\nproof enough that you’re a Guile. Our whole family has it. Including me.\nThink about this, Kip: there are a lot of problems that would go away for\nme if I leave that mask on your face until you’re dead. You might want to\nthink twice before you try to use a man’s conscience against him. It may\nturn out he doesn’t have one.”\nKip listened, conserving his strength against his rising panic, certain\nthat after Gavin was done talking, he would take the luxin off his face. But\nGavin stopped talking, and he didn’t remove the mask. Kip’s stomach\nchurned as his diaphragm worked to suck in more air, pumped down to\nexpel the dead air he held in. Nothing.\nHe reached up to his neck, trying to find the seam where luxin abutted\nskin. But the line was smooth, the luxin sticking close to the skin. He\ncouldn’t get his fingernails under it. He reached up around his head, his\neyes. If he stabbed his fingernails into the soft skin next to his eyes, he\ncould lift the edge of the mask and get one finger underneath it. His vision\nwas darkening. He looked at Gavin, pleading, sure that the man would step\nin now.\nGavin watched him, pitiless. “If the only thing you’re going to respect\nis strength, Kip, first, you’re a fool, and second, you’ve come to the right"

He should have known he couldn’t\ntrust…\nChapter 24\nAfter traveling all day and into the night, Karris first became aware of\nRekton in the distance as a great, unvariegated glow as she stalked through\nthe forest. It was long after nightfall now, the air cool in the undergrowth.\nShe was enough of a sub-red to use dark vision, but it wasn’t perfect, and\non a moonlit night like tonight she kept switching back and forth from\nnormal to dark vision. Light below the visible spectrum was rougher; it\ndidn’t lend itself to fine differentiation of features. Even faces simply\nlooked like warm blobs, brighter here and there, but it was much more\ndifficult to make out expressions or fine movements—or even to identify a\nface from much of a distance.\nThe glow meant Rekton was still burning. Karris circled it slowly,\nclimbing the last hill. She stayed off the road, admiring the waterfall just\nbelow the town in the silver moonlight. She hadn’t seen anyone on the road\nall day, which she found odd. If no one was fleeing downriver from Rekton,\nit probably meant no one had made it out. But it was also strange to follow\nthe river through arable land and not come across any other settlements.\nShe’d seen orange orchards that clearly hadn’t been tended since the war,\nbut they were still growing fruit. The fruit was sparse and the trees leafy\nand chaotic and growing haphazardly in comparison to the paintings Karris\nhad seen of orange harvests, but they were still here. With the price Tyrean\noranges fetched, she found that hard to believe. Tyrean oranges were\nsmaller but sweeter and juicier than Atashian oranges, and the Parian\noranges didn’t even compare. No one had moved back after the war?\nHad the Battle of Sundered Rock really killed so many that even now,\nsixteen years later, the land lay fallow, bearing fruit for deer and bears\nalone?\nKarris didn’t see any bodies until she crept into the still-burning town,\nwrapped in her hooded black cloak. She was following the main road, its\ncobbles even and well maintained: a symbol in Karris’s mind of a place\nwell governed. A burned body lay in the middle of the street, facedown, one\narm extended, a finger pointing deeper into the town. Only the hand and\npointing finger were unburned. The head was missing.\nShe hadn’t seen this kind of burn since the war. During the war, the\narmies had clashed a number of times in areas where the bodies couldn’t be\nburied and where there wasn’t enough natural fuel for funeral pyres.\nCorpses had to be disposed of to avoid losing even more soldiers to disease,\nso red drafters would spray a corpse with a quick stream of red jelly.

It wasn’t cremation, though. If bodies were burned singly, rather\nthan in piles, the bones remained. If the drafter weren’t thorough, certain\nbody parts wouldn’t be reduced entirely to bone. Rib cages and skulls ended\nup full of smoking meat—good enough for exigencies of war when you had\nto dispose of your opponents’ corpses to avoid spreading disease, but never\ngood enough for one’s own countrymen.\nKing Garadul hadn’t fought in that war, but he was aping the worst\npractices of it—on his own people.\nAs she suspected, that pointing hand led Karris to more bodies. At first\nthey were spread widely, then one every thirty paces, one every twenty\npaces, one every ten. All were headless. Then bodies lined the sides of the\nmain road now in a solid row, past smoking, crumbled homes and shops.\nThe nicely maintained cobblestones here had cracked from the heat. There\nwere tracks across the cobbles. At first she couldn’t tell what they were, but\nas she got closer it became obvious: they were drag marks, streaks of dried\nblood perhaps a day old from the decapitated bodies being dragged from the\nsquare.\nShe paused amid the smoke and gore before she rounded the corner\nthat would take her to the town square. She drew the short sword, but didn’t\nput on her spectacles. If there was a trap, it would be here, but there was\nenough red and heat for her to fight magically if necessary. Even if she\nwasn’t planning on a straight infiltration, there was no need to announce\nthat she was a drafter if she didn’t have to. When the moment came, she’d\nannounce it with fire.\nKarris rounded the corner.\nDear Orholam.\nThey hadn’t melted the heads. They’d preserved them with a blue-and-\nyellow luxin glaze and stacked them in the middle of the town square. Eyes\nstaring, faces mangled, blood cascading from the top to the bottom like a\nchampagne pyramid at the Luxlords’ Ball. Karris had half expected\nsomething like this from all the decapitated bodies, but expecting it wasn’t\nthe same as seeing it. Her stomach heaved. She turned and clamped her jaw\nshut, blinking rapidly, as if her eyelids could scrape the horrors off her eyes.\nShe studied the rest of the square to give her stomach time to settle.\nIf Gavin had seen this, he would have killed King Garadul. Pitiless as\nthe sea, righteous as Orholam, he would have hunted down every one of\nthese monsters. Whatever he had done during the war and before—\nwhatever he had done to her—since the False Prism’s War, Gavin had\ntraveled the Seven Satrapies meting out justice. He’d sunk Ilytian pirate\nfleets twice, killed the bandit king of the Blue-Eyed Demons, made peace\nwhen war had broken out again between Ruthgar and the Blood Forest, and\nbrought the Butcher of Ru to justice. Other than the Tyreans, the people\nloved him. And he would have wreaked a mighty vengeance here, even for\nTyreans. He wouldn’t have stood for this."

He wouldn’t have stood for this.\nMost of the buildings were piles of rubble, smoking in the predawn\ngray. Here and there a single wall stood, scorched and blackened and\nseparated from its fallen fellows. The alcaldesa’s residence, if such it was—\nit was the grandest building she’d seen here, with steps leading directly onto\nthe square—was a total loss. The soldiers had flattened it; there wasn’t one\nrock left sitting on another.\nBut the square itself was immaculate. Any burnt wreckage had either\nbeen pushed into the streets leading here or shoveled directly into the river,\nwhose channel bounded the square to the west. King Garadul had wanted\nnothing to distract a visitor from his grisly trophy. Steeling herself, Karris\nlooked back to the pyramid of human heads. All the drag marks, all the\nbloody streaks led here. The bodies—Karris hoped they’d all already been\nbodies by the time they came here—had all been decapitated here so that\nthe pyramid would be as bloody as possible. This was a spectacle. King\nGaradul wanted everything to lead to this horror.\nThe pyramid was taller than Karris. The heads at the top, crowning the\npyramid, were children: round-cheeked little boys and little girls with their\nhair in ribbons and bows.\nKarris didn’t throw up. There was something about this that simply left\nher cold. By their ages and her own, those children could have been hers.\nShe found herself counting the heads. There were forty-five at the base, and\nthe pyramid was as wide as it was tall, built with mathematical precision.\nThe children’s heads were smaller, and there was no way to tell if the\npyramid was solid or if these heads had been stacked around the outside of\na smaller pyramid made of something else. Karris’s fingers moved as she\nmentally moved the beads of an abacus, shuttling them left and right.\nIf the pyramid was solid heads, there were somewhere in the\nneighborhood of a thousand heads here.\nCold tingles shot over her skin, the precursor to vomiting. She looked\naway. You’re a spy, Karris. You have to find out everything important.\nTaking long, deep breaths, she examined the bottom corner of the pyramid,\nthen looked edge-on at one face of the shape. It was made of multiple layers\nof different colors of luxin. King Garadul wanted this to last for years.\nSomeone could attack the pyramid with a sledgehammer, and they might be\nable to crack it, but not break it open. There would be no burying these\nheads or removing this hideous monument.\nThe skill evident here meant King Garadul had access to a number—\nperhaps a large number—of fairly talented and skilled drafters. Bad news.\nKarris had heard Gavin express his belief that King Garadul was starting a\npseudo-Chromeria to train his own drafters away from the Chromeria’s\noversight. This was pretty strong evidence that Gavin was right.\n“Bastard,” Karris said. She wasn’t sure whether she meant Garadul or\nGavin. How stupid was that? She was staring at a pile of heads and she was\nas angry at Gavin as she was at the monster who’d done this? Because he’d"

Because he’d\nslept with some strumpet during the war?\nInsanely, even after the great fire that had ruined everything in her life\nand killed her brothers, Karris had been more than half tempted to go over\nto Dazen’s side during that time. If only to hear his side of what had\nhappened. Maybe Gavin had known.\nOr maybe it was the guilt of his illicit liaison that had caused Gavin to\nbreak their betrothal right after the war.\nSo he was unfaithful. Welcome to the common fate of women who\nlove great men. For all you know, it was only one night of weakness on the\neve of the last battle, some beauty throwing herself at him, and he didn’t say\nno, just once.\nRight. But for all I know, every night was a night of weakness.\nIt was years ago, Karris. Years! How has Gavin acted in all the years\nsince the war?\nAside from breaking our betrothal and leaving me with nothing?\nHow has he acted toward you in the last fifteen years?\nDecently. Damn him. Aside from lying and secrets. What had he said?\n“I don’t expect you to understand or even believe me, but what’s in that\nnote, I swear it isn’t true.” Something about that niggled at her. Why would\nhe compound the lie?\nThe wind shifted and blew smoke across the open square. Karris\ncoughed, her eyes burning. But just as she finished coughing, she thought\nshe heard a crack.\nAnother crack, and then, just a block away, a chimney came crashing\ndown into the torched remains of a house. The dawn was red—a trick of the\nsmoke and spectrums, not a heavenly mirror to all the blood spilled here.\nKarris began searching the town, looking for survivors and surveying\nthe damage. Do what’s right, do what’s in front of you. The town hadn’t\nburned easily. The buildings were stone, albeit with wooden supports, and\nthe trees were green, either from manual watering—the river ran right\nthrough town—or from their roots reaching deep enough. But every single\nbuilding in the town center had burned down completely. That meant red\ndrafters.\nThey must have walked through all the buildings, spraying red luxin\non every wooden beam.\nKarris searched for two hours, climbing over rubble in the streets,\nsometimes having to go around whole blocks. She wrapped a wet cloth\naround her face, but still got lightheaded, coughing frequently. She found\nnothing other than more corpses and a few mournful dogs. All the livestock\nhad been taken. The town church had been the site of a small battle. A\nluxiat’s body lay decapitated like the rest, outside the doors of the church.\nKarris could imagine him denouncing the soldiers outside, trying to protect\nthose of his flock who’d sought sanctuary within the walls. Inside, she\nfound pruning shears, an ax, and knives, and a pair of cleavers, and one\nbroken sword, and decapitated bodies.

Either clumsy drafting,\nor religious fear, or the fact that the ironwood beams, imported from the\ndeserts of southern Atash, were so old and dense.\nThe pews, however, and the bodies had burned. Karris was in a daze,\nwhether from inhaling smoke or just becoming inured to the tableau of\ndeath and suffering. In the back corner of the church behind the stairs, she\nfound a young family, the father with his arms wrapped around the mother,\nwho was sheltering a child. The soldiers hadn’t found these. They’d died in\neach other’s arms from the smoke. Karris checked each of them carefully,\nfeeling for the faint tremor of life at each neck. Father, dead. The mother, a\ngirl not yet out of her teens, dead. Karris took the swaddled babe in her\narms last, a boy. She prayed under her breath. But Orholam turned a deaf\near; there was no life in his tiny breast.\nKarris staggered. She had to get out of here. She put the dead babe\ndown on the nearest table, only to see it was the altar. She careened up the\nmain aisle of the church, past smoldering pews on her left and right, images\nof another time, another sacrificed babe, joining the horrors before her eyes.\nShe was almost out when the floor collapsed.\nChapter 25\n“You need to make some choices, Kip,” Gavin said.\nFrom all he could tell, Kip had only been unconscious for seconds or\nminutes. It was still dark, the stars burning coldly overhead, the fire not yet\nscorching his clothes despite its nearness to where he’d fallen. The\nstrangling red luxin mask was gone, though there remained a light coating\nof dust, gritty and sharp on his skin.\n“I’ll kill you!” Kip said. He couldn’t trust anyone. Everyone was a liar.\nEveryone was just out for himself. Fear rose, and that made the anger flare\nas it sometimes did, hot and fierce and uncontrollable. He sat up, eyes\nlocked on the Prism’s face. The man looked at him coolly, unapologetic,\nmerely curious about what Kip would do, ignoring his words. Kip\nwondered if he could conjure giant green spikes from the fire to impale the\nman.\nSmart, Kip. In the middle of Orholam only knows where, you’d kill\nyour guide? For what? For not tolerating your peevishness?\nNot betrayal, Kip, a lesson. Kip shivered. He’d really thought Gavin\nwas going to kill him. And that was the point. He had given Gavin no\nchoice but to show that he couldn’t be handled, not by a child. He was not\nonly older than Kip, he was smarter, and harder, and more experienced, and\nhe demanded respect.\nAnd that was… appropriate.\nBut that didn’t stop Kip’s shivering. If only for a few seconds, he’d\nreally thought he was dying—and there had been nothing he could do about\nit. But this was the one man who could show him how to never be\npowerless again. This was the man who could teach him how to avenge his\nmother and Rekton. And Kip was going to sit in silence and stubbornness?"

He cleared his throat so he\nwouldn’t squeak. “What choices?” he asked.\nHe could tell Gavin was a little surprised and pleased that Kip didn’t\nfight, but the man left it alone. “You’re my natural son, Kip. That has\nconsequences. For you.” Kip was watching Gavin’s face closely. He said\nthe words “my natural son” without a grimace, without even his eyes\ntightening. Kip wondered if he’d rehearsed to be able to say that so blithely.\nKip had seen something of what claiming his own patrimony had cost\nGavin, and still the man claimed him without so much as a grimace at Kip’s\ngrimace-worthy existence. It had to be an act—who could be pleased about\nlearning that he’d fathered a bastard?—but it was an act for Kip’s sake.\nGavin was a better man than Kip would have expected. “Being known\nas my bastard has costs,” Gavin continued. “You haven’t been raised in\nprivilege, but people who resent those raised in privilege will resent you.\nYou haven’t been educated, but those who have been will look down on you\nif you know less than they do.

It isn’t fair, but that’s how it is. You’ll be under constant scrutiny, and\nboth your successes and failures will have repercussions you can’t even\nguess at now. My father may choose not to recognize you. Others will seek\nto prove you’re a fraud. Others will attempt to use you against me. And still\nothers will want to befriend you only in the hope that it will help them gain\nsome favor with me. False friendship is a poison I’d like to protect you\nfrom.”\nToo late for that. Kip thought of Ram: Ram who was always in charge,\nwho always liked smearing Kip’s face in his own inferiority and claiming it\nwas friendly teasing. Ram, whom Isa had loved. Ram, dead, lying with an\narrow in his back. “So what are my options?” Kip asked. “I am what I am.”\nGavin rubbed the bridge of his nose. “You could go as just another\nstudent for the time being. Then, whenever you like, I’ll publicly\nacknowledge you. You’ll have time to gain your bearings, to learn who your\nreal friends are.”\n“By lying to them?”\n“Sometimes lies are most necessary with our friends,” Gavin snapped.\nHe paused. “Look, I just wanted to give you the option—”\n“No, I’m sorry. I’m not—I’m not mad at you. My mother… Do you\nremember what she was like? I mean, before me?” Kip asked.\nGavin’s mouth worked. He wet his lips. Then shook his head. “I don’t"

At all.”\nSo, not exactly a love affair. Kip’s emptiness doubled. There was no\nfamily to belong to. “You’re the Prism; I guess a lot of women want to be\nwith you,” Kip said.\n“It was war, Kip. When you expect to die, you don’t think about the\neffects your actions might have on others ten years on. When you’ve seen\nfriends die all around you, there’s something about making love that makes\nyou feel alive. There was far too much wine and spirits and no one who\nwould rein in a young hothead who had the misfortune to be the Prism. But\nit’s not an excuse. I’m sorry, Kip. I’m sorry for what my thoughtlessness\nhas cost you.”\nSo my mother had one night with you, and she pinned her hopes on\nthat. Kip had no doubt she’d elbowed and schemed her way past a dozen\nother women who would have gladly shared the Prism’s bed. And she’d\nfilled years with bitterness for that?\nKip forced a laugh, his heart breaking. For all the times he’d dreamed\nabout who his father might be, he’d never dared to dream that he might be\nthe Prism himself. But in his dreams, his father had been called away by\nsome emergency. He’d left them because he had to. But he’d loved Kip’s\nmother and Kip. Missed them. Wanted to come back, and would any day.\nGavin was a good man, but he didn’t care about Lina. Or Kip. He would\ntake care of Kip because he was dutiful. A good person. But there was no\nlove. No family to belong to. Kip was alone, outside, staring through barred\nwindows at what he would never have.\nIt was like being given a gift that was wildly exotic when you wanted\nsomething perfectly common. Still, what kind of an ingrate was he?\nComplaining? Feeling sorry for himself—because the Prism was his father?\n“I’m sorry,” Kip said. He stared at his fingernails, still torn from his\nluxin use. “This isn’t right. My mother had… some problems. I guess she\nwanted to trap you by showing up with me.” Kip couldn’t maintain eye\ncontact. He was so ashamed. How could you be so stupid, mother? So\nmean? “You don’t deserve this. You saved my life, and I’ve been… awful.”\nKip blinked, but he couldn’t fully stop the tears. “You can leave me\nwherever—well, preferably not on a deserted island.”\nGavin smirked, then got serious. “Kip, your mother and I did what we\ndid. I appreciate you trying to shield me from the consequences of my\nactions, but you are not trapping me into anything. People can talk. I don’t\ncare. Understand?” He expelled a breath. “Regardless, the only damage I\ncare about has already been done.”\nFor a second, Kip didn’t understand.

Kip had caused a rift with\nthe only person in the world Gavin cared about. What had been intended to\nmake Kip feel better hit him instead where he was weakest. His mother had\nmade him feel guilty for simply existing for as long as he could remember.\nHe’d ruined her life by being born. He’d ruined her life by having too many\ndemands. He’d made people look down on her. He’d held her back from all\nthe things she could have done. Mentally, he could try to shrug off her\nwords. She didn’t mean it. She loved Kip, even if she had never said the\nwords. She didn’t know how she was hurting him.\nBut Gavin was a good man. He didn’t deserve this.\n“Kip. Kip.” Gavin waited until Kip looked up at him. “I will not\nabandon you.”\nVisions of a locked cupboard, screaming—screaming—and no one\nanswering. “Is there anything to eat?” Kip asked, blinking. “I feel like I\nhaven’t eaten in a week.” He poked his chest. He could feel ribs sticking\nout.\nGavin pulled a rope of sausages out of his pack, cut one off—only\none?—and tossed it to Kip. “Tomorrow, you start at the Chromeria.”\n“Oomowwow?” Kip asked, mouth full.\n“I’m going to share a secret with you,” Gavin said. “I can travel faster\nthan anyone suspects.”\n“You can disappear and reappear somewhere else? I knew it!” Kip\nsaid.\n“Um, no. But I can make a boat that goes really fast.”\n“Oh, that’s… amazing. A boat.”\nGavin looked nonplussed. “Point is, I don’t want anyone to know how\nfast I am. There’s war coming, and if I need to unveil it, I need it to be a\nsurprise. You understand?”\n“Of course,” Kip said.\n“Then I need you to tell me what you want. I’m going to go take care\nof some things while you’re being initiated.”\n“Initiated?”\n“Just some tests to determine the rest of your life. You’re late, though,\nall the other students have already started, so we have to hustle you in. After\ninitiation, you can stay and be trained.”\nKip’s throat tightened. Dropped alone on a strange island, knowing no\none, and having little time to prepare for a test that was supposed to\ndetermine the rest of his life? On the other hand, the Chromeria was where\nhe’d learn the magic he needed to kill King Garadul. “What’s the other\noption?”\n“You come with me.”\nIt was light at the end of a tunnel. Kip’s heart flipped. “And what are\nyou going to do?”\n“What I’m good at, Kip.” Gavin stared up, his irises swirling rainbows.\nHe smiled, but it didn’t touch his eyes.

Sometimes looking at Gavin, he felt like he was\nstaring through trees, getting glimpses of a giant striding through a forest,\ncrushing everything in his path.\nGavin turned his eyes back to Kip. His face softened. “Which mostly\ninvolves boring meetings to convince cowards to spend money on things\nother than parties and pretty clothes.” He grinned. “I’m afraid you’ve\nprobably seen more magic out of me already than most of my soldiers ever\ndid.” His eyes clouded. “Well, not quite. You look confused.”\n“It’s not really about what you just said, but—” Kip stopped. It seemed\nlike a pretty offensive question, now that it was halfway out of his mouth.\n“What do you do?”\n“As Prism?”\n“Yes. Um, sir. I mean, I know you’re the emperor, but it doesn’t seem\nlike…”\n“Like anyone listens to me?” Gavin laughed. “Seems like it to me too.\nThe bald truth of it is that Prisms come and go. Usually every seven years.\nPrisms have all the foibles of lesser men, and huge shifts of power every\nseven years can be devastating. If one Prism sets up his family members to\ngovern every satrapy, and the next Prism tries to set up his own in their\nplaces, things get bloody fast. The Colors, on the other hand, the seven\nmembers of the Spectrum, are often around for decades. And they’re\nusually pretty smart, so Prisms have been managed more and more over\ntime, given religious duties to fill their days. The Spectrum and the satraps\nrule together. Each satrapy has one Color on the Spectrum, and each Color\nis supposed to obey the orders of his or her satrap. In practice, the Colors\noften become co-satraps in all but name. The jockeying between Color and\nsatrap, and all the Colors and the White, and all the Colors and the White\nagainst the Prism, pretty much keeps order. Each satrapy can do what it\nwants at home as long as it doesn’t rile up any other satrapy and trade keeps\nflowing, so everyone has an interest in keeping everyone else in check. It’s\nnot quite that simple, of course, but that’s the gist.”\nIt sounded plenty complicated enough. “But during the war…?”\n“I was appointed promachos. Absolute rule during wartime. Makes\neveryone nervous, in case the promachos decides that the ‘war’ lasts\nforever.”\n“But you gave it up?” It was a dumb question, Kip realized.\nBut Gavin smiled. “And wonder of wonders, I haven’t been\nassassinated. The Blackguard doesn’t only protect Prisms, Kip. They\nprotect the world from us.”\nOrholam. Gavin’s world sounded more dangerous than what Kip had\njust left. “So you’ll teach me to draft?” he asked. It was the best of all\nworlds. He would learn what he needed to learn, without being set on a\nstrange island alone. And who could teach drafting better than the Prism\nhimself?\n“Of course.

But first there’s some things we have to do.”\nKip looked longingly at the sausage rope Gavin still held. “Like eat\nmore?”\nChapter 26\nBy noon the next day, Kip had fully swallowed his teasing about a fast boat.\nThey were flying across the waves at mind-boggling speed, and Gavin had\nenclosed the boat, muttering something about that woman and her ideas, so\nnow, despite the speed, they could speak.\n“So you’ve used green,” Gavin said, as if it were normal for him to be\nleaning hard forward, skin entirely red, feet strapped in, hands gripping two\ntranslucent blue posts, throwing great plugs of red luxin down into the\nwater, sweating profusely, muscles knotted. “That’s a good color. Everyone\nneeds green drafters.”\n“I think I can see heat, too. And Master Danavis said I’m a\nsuperchromat.”\n“What?”\n“Master Danavis was the dyer in town. Sometimes I’d help him. He\nhad trouble matching the reds as well as the alcaldesa’s husband liked.”\n“Corvan Danavis? Corvan Danavis lived in Rekton?”\n“Y-yes.”\n“Slender, about forty, beaded mustache, couple freckles, and some red\nin his hair?”\n“No mustache,” Kip said. “But, otherwise.”\nGavin swore quietly.\n“You know our dyer?” Kip asked, incredulous.\n“You could say that. He fought against me in the war. I’m more\ncurious about you seeing heat. Tell me what you do.”\n“Master Danavis taught me to look at the edges of my vision.\nSometimes when I do, people glow, especially their bare skin, armpits,\nand… you know.”\n“Groin?”\n“Right.” Kip cleared his throat.\n“Blind me,” Gavin said. He chuckled.\n“What? What’s that mean?”\n“We’ll see later.”\n“Later? Like what, a year or two? Why do all adults talk to me like I’m\nstupid?”\n“Fair enough. Unless you’re truly freakish, you’re likely a\ndiscontiguous bichrome.”\nKip blinked. A what what? “I said I’m not stupid; ignorant’s different.”\n“And I meant later today,” Gavin said.\n“Oh.”\n“There are two special cases in drafting—well, there are lots of special\ncases. Orholam’s great bloody—I’ve never tried to teach the early stuff.\nHave you ever wondered if you were the only real person in the world, and\neverything and everyone else was just your imagination?”\nKip blushed. Back home, he’d even tried to stop imagining Ram,\nhoping the boy would simply cease to exist. “I guess so.”\n“Right, it’s one of a puerile mind’s first flirtations with egoism. No\noffense.”\n“None taken.” Since I have no idea what you just said.\n“It’s attractive because it validates your own importance, allows you to\ndo whatever the hell you want, and it can’t be disproven. Teaching drafting\nruns into the same problem. I’m going to assume here that you do accept\nthat other people exist.”\n“Sure. I’m not much for lecturing myself,” Kip said. He grinned."

He grinned.\nGavin squinted at the horizon. He’d rigged up two lenses separated by\nan arm’s length and mounted on the luxin canopy so he could scan the seas.\nHe must have seen something, because he banked the skimmer hard left—\nport! Hard to port.\nWhen he turned back, he’d apparently missed Kip’s quip.\n“Anyway, where were we? Ah. The problem with teaching drafting is\nthat color exists—it’s separate from us—but we only know it through our\nexperience of it. We don’t know why, but some men—subchromats—can’t\ndifferentiate between red and green. Other subchromats can’t differentiate\nbetween blue and yellow. Obviously, when you tell a man that he can’t see a\ncolor he’s never seen, he might not believe you. Everyone else who tells\nhim red and green are different colors could be just playing a cruel joke on\nhim. Or he must accept the existence of something he’ll never see. There\nare theological implications, but I’ll spare you. To make it simple, if there\nare color-deficient men—incidentally, it is almost always men—why could\nthere not also be those who are extremely color-sensitive, superchromats?\nAnd it turns out there are. But they’re almost always women. In fact, about\nhalf of women can differentiate between colors at an extreme level. For\nmen, it’s one in tens of thousands.”\n“Wait, so men lose both ways? Blind to colors more often and really\ngood at seeing them less often? That’s not fair.”\n“But we can lift heavy things.”\nKip grumbled. “And pee standing up, right?”\n“Very useful around poison ivy. I was on a mission with Karris this\none time…” Gavin whistled.\n“She didn’t,” Kip said, horrified.\n“You thought she was mad at me back on the river? Somehow, it was\nmy fault that time, too.” Gavin grinned. “Anyway, to wend my way back to\nmy point, most of us can see the normal range of colors. Hmm, tautology\nthere.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“That’s a digression too far. Just because you can see a color doesn’t\nmean you can draft it. But if you can’t see a color, you’ll draft it poorly. So\nmen aren’t as accurate when drafting certain colors as superchromat\nwomen, which is half of them. Will can cover a lot of mistakes, but it’s\nbetter if there aren’t mistakes to begin with. This becomes vital if you’re\ntrying to build a luxin building that won’t fall down.”\n“They make luxin buildings?”\nGavin ignored him. “The special cases that I started all this to tell you\nabout are sub-red and superviolet. If you can see heat, Kip, there’s a good\nchance you can draft it.”\n“You mean I can start a fire like whoosh?!” Kip made a grand\nsweeping gesture.\n“Only if you say ‘whoosh!’ when you do it.” Gavin laughed.\nKip blushed again, but Gavin’s laughter wasn’t mocking.

But neither seemed mean. Neither\nseemed bad.\n“And that would be very strange,” Gavin said, “because you’ve drafted\ngreen.” He looked like he was trying to figure out how to teach something.\n“Have you ever seen a rainbow?”\n“A rain-what?” Kip asked, doe-eyed.\n“It was a rhetorical question, smarty. The order of colors is superviolet,\nblue, green, yellow, orange, red, sub-red. Usually, a bichrome simply spans\na broader arc. So they draft superviolet and blue, or blue and green, or green\nand yellow. A polychrome—much rarer—might draft green, yellow, and\norange. A drafter who drafts colors that don’t border each other is rare.\nKarris is one. She drafts green, but not yellow, not orange, and then she\ndrafts most of red and into sub-red.”\n“So she’s a polychrome.”\n“Close. Karris can’t quite draft sustainable sub-red—what they call a\nfire crystal. Fire crystals don’t last long regardless because they react to air,\nbut—never mind that. Point is, she’s just short of being a polychrome, and\nthat matters.”\n“I bet that made her happy,” Kip said.\n“On the bright side, they wouldn’t have let her become a Blackguard if\nshe was a polychrome—polychromes are too valuable—and the pressure on\nher to bear children would have increased. Regardless, it’s rare, and it’s\ncalled being a discontiguous bichrome. Discontiguous because the arcs\naren’t touching. Bichrome because there are two. See? Everything in\ndrafting is logical. Except what isn’t. Like so: seeing sub-red is seeing heat,\nso seeing superviolet should be seeing cold, right?”\n“Right.”\n“But it isn’t.”\n“Oh,” Kip said. “Well, that makes sense, I guess.” Except that it\ndoesn’t.\n“I have the strongest urge to ruffle your hair,” Gavin said.\nKip grunted. “So how is this going to work?”\n“There’s a small island we use as an artillery station. There’s a tunnel\nbetween there and the Chromeria, which is a secret so important that if you\ntell anyone, the Chromeria will hunt you down and execute you.” He said it\ncheerfully, but Kip had no doubt that he was serious.\n“Then why did you just tell me?” Kip asked. “I could let it slip.”\n“Because I’ve already shared a secret that I think is more important—\nthe existence of this skimmer. But if you betray that secret to our enemies,\nthe Chromeria might do nothing. But if you do betray us deliberately, you’d\nalso tell them about the escape tunnel. So now if you betray me, you’ll\nbetray the whole Chromeria too. And they’ll come after you and they’ll kill\nyou.”\nKip felt a chill. This man was warm, personable.

The casual way that Gavin prepared for Kip’s possible\nbetrayal told Kip he’d been betrayed before and been caught unaware by it.\nAnd Gavin wasn’t the kind of man who had to learn a hard lesson twice.\n“I’m going to dock on the island and put you on a boat to the main\nisland. I’ll send a Blackguard with you to take you to the Thresher. In a few\ndays, you’ll leave with me wherever I decide we have to go and I’ll start\nteaching you to draft.”\nKip hardly heard the last part, though. “The Thresher?”\nChapter 27\nKarris only fell a few feet through the floor before she hit something soft.\nHer left foot sank to the knee while the rest of her body continued falling\ninto the basement. The sticky whatever-it-was held her leg as she fell, so\nshe swung upside down and the rest of her slapped into the side of\nsomething like a great red egg—a thin crust over gooey innards. She\nsmacked into it, broke the side, and splatted into red luxin. Then her fall\npulled her free and she fell onto a stone floor.\nAs she’d been trained, she flung her right hand down hard, the shock\nof slapping the floor hurt her hand—it always hurt—but that slap took the\npressure off more vulnerable areas of her body and allowed her to guide the\nlast part of her fall. She rolled instead of landing on her head.\nIn a moment, she popped up to her feet, and pulled the thin-hilted\nataghan from her pack. There was no light in the chamber except what\nspilled down through the hole she’d made in the ceiling. Chunks of wood\nwere still falling into the hole. The great red egg shone in the sudden light.\nSettling smoke, stirred by Karris’s fall, climbed the shaft of light\nsurrounding the egg. The entire room, perhaps twenty paces by thirty, stank\nof smoke and burnt red luxin, which was odd, because red luxin usually\nburned perfectly cleanly. For that matter, every surface illuminated in the\nweak light appeared to be blackened luxin as well.\nBut the great egg took all of Karris’s attention. At least seven feet tall,\nit was seared perfectly black except where Karris had broken it. Red luxin\nnow oozed out of that wound like tar. A half dozen tubes snaked away from\nthe egg in every direction, disappearing into the ceiling, each also\nblackened. The seared corpses of a dozen of King Garadul’s soldiers lay\nabout the room.\n“What in the hell?” Karris murmured. She lifted her sword to crack the\negg open.\nThe egg exploded before she could touch it. A great section of the front\nflew into her, the blackened shell shattering over her barely raised left arm,\nher chest, stomach, and legs. Caught in midstep, she was thrown off\nbalance. She stumbled and felt more than saw a form shooting backward\nout of the egg even as the shell splattered over her.\nInstead of trying to catch herself, Karris flung herself into the fall.

There was no hesitation. Ironfist had pounded that lesson into\nKarris for years: when attacked, you counterattack instantly. The speed of\nthat strike was often the only advantage you had. Especially if you were\nsmall. Especially if you were a woman. Especially if you weren’t wearing\nyour spectacles and the other drafter was.\nKarris’s attacker had backed all the way up to the wall. He stood with\nliving coils of red luxin like giant knots around his hands. Karris knew that\nconstruction. If you knew what you were doing, you could hold extra open\nluxin outside your body. Those knots of open luxin could be formed into\nanything you wanted and, held on your hands, you could actually fling them\nhowever you needed. The man stood like a trained fighter, too: left side\ntoward Karris, left hand up to block but still with some springiness to throw\nout an attack, right hand higher and pulled back, right knee bent deeply,\nholding most of his weight. Even with Karris’s speed with drafting and the\namount of red luxin here to reflect red light to her eyes, it still took some\ntime to ready an attack, and he had the drop on her. Her only hope was to\nclose the distance between them before he killed her.\nHis left hand flicked out, right to left, low. Red luxin glommed on the\nfloor to slow her. She was expecting it, and she stutter-stepped over the\nsticky patches. His right hand snapped forward in three sharp jerks. Three\nballs, each the size of a fist, whipped out right to left. Karris dodged the first\nand second, but the third caught her as she had to stutter-step again to miss\nanother sticky patch on the floor. It thumped hard into the ribs on her left\nside, then splattered. She rolled with it, spun into range, and slashed with\nthe ataghan.\nThe red drafter met her descending sword with layer after layer of red\nluxin. Held luxin, even red luxin, could gain a certain degree of rigidity\nfrom the drafter’s will, and more from being woven, but red luxin could\nnever stop steel. It was like pitting water against a sword.\nBut this wasn’t just a bit of held red luxin. It wasn’t like slapping a\nsword into still water. It was like standing below a dam when they opened\nthe floodgates. It was only water, but the speed and volume of it would\nblow a man off his feet. Likewise, the red luxin hitting Karris slowed her,\nslowed her more, and finally brought her to a complete halt.\nThe red drafter’s face paled as the luxin drained out of him. Next, his\nneck and chest went back to their natural hue as the torrent continued. Then\nhis muscular shoulders, the luxin being bleached out of his body from eyes\nto extremities. They both realized he was running out of luxin at the same\ntime.\nKarris broke off her attack at the same time he did.

Instead,\nher sword clanged against something hard, but she didn’t see any sword. He\ncouldn’t have drawn one without her seeing it, not even in this darkness.\nNot hesitating, she lifted the ataghan and brought it down toward his\nhead. It clanged and stopped as he lifted his hands in a V.\nHe shoved her hard backward and followed, keeping close. The shaft\nof light piercing the gloom of the room illuminated his hands and what he\nwas holding as he shouted, “Enough! Damn you, stop for one second.”\nThe drafter held a pistol in each hand, crossed, their barrels holding\nKarris’s ataghan prisoner between them. His right pistol stared at her right\neye, his left at her left eye. Karris had her other knives and the bich’hwa, of\ncourse, but there was no way she could draw any of them before he could\npull a trigger.\nThe pistols staring at her were of Ilytian design. The Ilytian\nrenunciation of magic usually meant their mundane tools were the best.\nWith pistols, however, it was still dicey. This drafter had wheellock pistols.\nThey negated the need to keep a fuse burning, but the flints failed to ignite\nthe black powder at least one time in four.\nUnfortunately, both pistols were double-barreled, and all four hammers\nwere raised. Karris tried to do the figures—was it one time in sixteen or one\ntime in two hundred fifty-six that all four shots would fail? Her heart\ndespaired. She wasn’t going to gamble on those odds, not even one in\nsixteen.\nSo… talking.\n“What do you draft?” the man demanded, his voice strained.\n“I don’t know what you’re talking—”\n“What. Do. You. Draft?!” he screamed. He flung her ataghan aside and\nput one pistol directly against her forehead. It was too dark for him to see\nher irises, but he was going to figure out soon, anyway, so Karris said,\n“Green. Green and red.”\n“Then draft a ladder and get out. Now!”\nAnother time, Karris might have been irked that she obeyed so\npromptly, but her spectacles were on her face in an instant and she turned\ntoward the light. Everything in this chamber was covered with either open\nred luxin or blackened, seared, closed red luxin. Finally, she found an\nironwood beam up in the temple that reflected a pure enough white light to\nallow her to draft a good solid green.\nEven as her body filled with green, she saw why the drafter was so\nurgent. This chamber was filled with red luxin. She shouldn’t have put it\ntogether so slowly. There were two entrances to the room, and the dead\nsoldiers were seared but not roasted to death—and the red luxin had\nremained, coating everything rather than burning as it should have.\nAnd it still remained. This room was full of red luxin, old and new.\nThey were inside a powder keg.\nA burning pew fell over, spilling smoldering and flaming brands\ntoward the hole.

One tottered on the edge, promising death.\nKarris ran forward, throwing down green luxin thick enough to stand\non. She drafted what was effectively an impossibly narrow staircase, the\nsteps only wide enough to hold her feet, only strong enough to hold her\nweight if she concentrated her will. But it only had to last for two seconds\nwhile she sprinted out—and it did. She stepped, stepped, stepped, fleet-\nfooted as a hind, and vaulted, landing on the church floor. She felt a bit of\nthe floor give way to drop into the chamber below, so she rolled again and\nkept running for the open front door. That much red luxin in the basement\nmeant the whole thing could—\nWhoomp!\nThe explosion made the floor jump beneath Karris’s feet. It hit just as\nshe was pushing off of a step, and it flung her like a spring. The yawning\nopen doors of the church yawned wider and she was lifted and thrown\nforward. For a moment she thought she would make it through them and be\nflung harmlessly outside, but she’d been lifted high by the explosion—too\nhigh. The ironwood frame above the door loomed. Then her upper body\nsmashed into it, and through it. The burned, weakened ironwood gave way\nafter only an instant, but the instant it held was long enough for her to be\nspun viciously, upside down, flipping so fast she didn’t even know how\nmany times she tumbled.\nThen she was skidding on cobblestones and gravel, not sure if she’d\nblacked out for a second or exactly how she’d come to the ground.\nShe turned over, ignoring the just-starting screams of protest from all\ntoo much of her body, and looked toward the mangled front door of the\nchurch.\nA gigantic crimson snake, all aflame, stabbed its head out the front\ndoor. No, not a snake, a tube of pure red luxin, afire, the width of a man’s\nshoulders. Then the serpent vomited, and just a little faster than fire could\ncurl up the flammable red luxin, the drafter was shot clear of church and fire\nand luxin alike.\nHe landed not far from Karris, and far more gracefully, rolling to bleed\noff speed, and finally standing. He scanned the streets on every side and,\nseeing no one, only then allowed himself to relax a little. But once he did,\nKarris could see the bone-deep weariness steal over him. Drafting as much\nmagic as she’d just seen left him looking about as bad as she felt, deathly\npale and tottering on his feet.\n“Come on,” the drafter said. “I think Garadul’s soldiers are all gone,\nbut if not, they’ll be here soon after what you just did. We need to go.”\nKarris stood, wobbled, and would have fallen if he hadn’t grabbed her.\n“Who are you?”\n“I’m Corvan Danavis,” the drafter said. “And if I don’t misremember,\nyou’re Karris White Oak, aren’t you?”\n“Danavis?” she asked. Orholam how she hurt. “You were Dazen’s. A"

I can make it on my own, thank you.” She shrugged off his help,\nleaned crazily to one side, then the other, and finally collapsed. He watched,\narms folded, and didn’t catch her. Her shoulder hit the ground and the world\nswam.\nKarris saw Corvan’s boots come close. He was probably going to leave\nher here for the soldiers. She deserved it, too. Stupid, stubborn girl.\nChapter 28\nThe dory Gavin drafted while they were still five leagues from Little Jasper\nIsland was modeled on one he’d seen an Abornean wild drafter use, with\nhigh sides and a flat bottom, a pointed prow, and a flat bow plate. It was\nsafer and far less efficient than the sculls Gavin preferred, but that was the\npoint. Not many drafters dared to use a scull on the ocean, because if you\nwere going to use a scull on the ocean, you had to be willing to fall in the\nwater. That meant being confident of getting out of the water solely by\ndrafting, and not many drafters had the skill or the will to swim in rough\nseas and draft at the same time.\nGavin’s skill—or recklessness—meant his usual silhouette on the open\nsea was instantly recognizable. He didn’t want that. Thus the dory.\nKip was sulking, nervous about the Thresher and Gavin’s refusal to tell\nhim anything about it.\nWithin a couple of leagues, they passed two merchant galleys and a\ngalleass. Each time, a mate inspected them through a spyglass, saw Gavin’s\nmuddled clothes and no distress flags, and rowed past without a word.\nThere was little wind today, so the sailors got to rest while galley slaves\nmanned their banks of oars. Each time he encountered another ship, Gavin\nwaved gamely when the spyglass came out, and returned to his own oars.\nWhat people called the Chromeria was really two islands: Little Jasper,\ncovered entirely by the Chromeria itself, and Big Jasper, home to\nembassies, merchants’ estates, shops, stalls, taverns, brothels, prisons,\nflophouses, tenements, warehouses, rope makers, sail makers, oar turners,\nfishermen, convict slaves, and far more than its fair share of graspers,\nschemers, and dreamers.\nBig Jasper had two large natural harbors, one on the east that provided\nnatural protection during the dark season, and one on the west for the light\nseason, when the storms came from the east. As the island had grown in\npopulation and importance, breakwaters had been built on each side so both\nharbors could be used year-round. After several occupations, which had\nnever touched the Chromeria but had purged Big Jasper in fire and blood, a\nwall had been built to encircle the entire island. Thirty paces thick and\ntwenty high, it was now used mostly by the city’s runners to spot and stop\ncrimes in the streets below.\nGavin’s business was on Little Jasper, but he couldn’t dock in its\nsingle, smaller harbor without being seen by spies from every one of the\nSeven Satrapies.

Even Tyrea would have a spy watching those who were\nimportant enough to dock there directly. So he rowed them between the two\nislands. Between the jaws of Little Jasper’s U-shaped harbor was Cannon\nIsland. Only twenty men were garrisoned there at any time, and there were\nalways two drafters on duty, ostensibly because of the hazards of docking\non the island when there was anything more than the gentlest tide and\nlightest wind. It was a loathed posting, and one from which not even the\nBlackguards escaped. It was thought that the White kept the rolls restricted\nto higher-ranked Chromeria guards in order to be able to teach humility to a\ncertain class of men and women who tended to be a little more brash than\nwas good for themselves.\nAnd indeed, the White and the Black did use postings to Cannon\nIsland as punishment, but only for trusted soldiers. The fiction worked\nbetter if it was half true. When other soldiers traded postings—I’ll take your\nCannon Island post next week if you’ll just take my rounds this next\nweekend—the watch commander noted the names of anyone who switched.\nThose were then watched carefully while they were on duty, and more\ncarefully afterward. Spies had certainly infiltrated the island, which was\nstrategically important for purely mundane reasons, but none had yet—the\nWhite believed—penetrated Cannon Island’s real importance.\nAmid the crashing waves of high tide, Gavin brought the dory around\nthe back of the island. With his drafted multitude of oars, he had far greater\ncontrol than he would have had over a mundane boat, but it was still tricky\nbusiness to line up with the rollers erected long ago so boats could be pulled\nclear of even storm-height waves. They’d been seen, of course, and two\nBlackguards—Blackguards were always given the boat duty—greeted\nthem.\nThe men, imposing brothers with coal-black skin, recognized Gavin\ninstantly. Each held up a hand—not in greeting, but to give Gavin a stable\ntarget. He aimed superviolet at each hand, stuck it there, and then flung a\ncoil of green luxin along that stable thread. Like rope, the luxin stuck in\neach big man’s hand. Gavin fastened the other ends directly to the boat with\ntwo small globs of red luxin. The men pulled him in expertly. The dory\nrattled as it settled awkwardly from the waves onto the rollers and then\nslipped smoothly up the ramp.\nCommander Ironfist, the elder brother, spoke first, as always: “Sir.”\nHis eyes flicked down to Gavin’s tattered clothes. The “sir” was his laconic\nequivalent of, Of course I recognize you, but if this is supposed to be a\ndisguise, I’m smart enough not to ruin it. What do you want us to call you\ntoday?\n“I’ll need a Blackguard to take Kip to the Chromeria, Commander.\nI’ve told him about the escape tunnel, by the by, so keep an eye on him.”\nBoth men absorbed that in displeased silence.\n“We’ll need to wait until low tide for—” Tremblefist began."

No rush, tomorrow will be fine. Report the results to\nthe White. Tell her Kip is my… nephew.”\nIronfist’s eyebrow twitched, and Tremblefist’s eyes widened. Kip, on\nthe other hand, looked stricken.\nGavin looked at the boy, but Kip seemed suddenly shy.\n“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Gavin said. “You’ll do fine. After all, you’ve\ngot my blood.” He smirked.\nKip looked baffled. “You mean you’re not… saying I’m not your, um,\nbastard?” Kip himself looked confused with all the negatives.\n“No no no. I’m not disavowing you! When I say ‘nephew,’ everyone\nknows what it means. It’s just more polite. And it pays to be polite where\nthe White is involved.”\nIronfist coughed. He could cough quite pointedly.\nGavin looked at him pointedly in return. Ironfist adjusted his ghotra,\nhis checkered Parian headscarf, as if oblivious.\n“But how do people know I’m not really your nephew?” Kip asked. He\nwas still clutching the luxin oar Gavin had drafted for him.\n“Because they’ll pause like it’s delicate, and not say your surname.\n‘This is Kip, the Lord Prism’s… nephew.’ Not, ‘This is Kip Guile, the Lord\nPrism’s nephew.’ You see?”\nKip swallowed. “Yes, sir.”\nGavin looked across the waves to the Prism’s tower. He hated being\ngone overnight. His room slave Marissia would dye the bread and throw it\nin the chute for the prisoner, and he knew he could trust her. But that was\ndifferent from doing it himself. He looked back to the frightened boy.\n“Do me proud, Kip.”\nChapter 29\nKip watched the Prism head out across the waves with something akin to\npanic. Gavin was so in control of everything, so fearless, and now he’d left\nhim. With two unfriendly giants.\nAs Gavin finally disappeared from sight, Kip turned to look at the\nmen. The scarier one, Ironfist, was putting on blue spectacles with large\noval lenses wrapped close to his eyes. As Kip watched, the blue luxin filled\nthe man, but it was almost invisible against his coal-black skin. The whites\nof his eyes already looked blue when you saw them through the blue lenses,\nso it wasn’t until the skin under his fingernails turned icy blue that Kip was\nsure he hadn’t just imagined the Blackguard was drafting at all.\n“Grab a rope,” Ironfist told his brother. “With the float on it.”\nTremblefist disappeared, leaving Kip with his brother.\n“I don’t know why you’ve been trusted with this island’s secret,”\nIronfist said, “even if you are his… nephew. But now that you know, you’re\na guardian of it like the rest of us, you understand?”"

Was he never able to keep his mouth shut?\nA look of surprise flitted across Ironfist’s face, and was quickly\nreplaced with amusement. “A deep thinker, our friend,” he said. “And a\nyoung man with ice water in his veins. How appropriate.”\nFrom the “our friend,” Kip understood that they weren’t even to say\nthe Prism’s name here, not even now, with the wind whipping around them\nand the possibility of eavesdropping nil. It was that kind of secret.\n“The story is you and your master, a scribe, came out on a friend’s boat\nto… hmm.”\n“To study some local fish?” Kip asked.\n“Good enough,” Ironfist said. “He didn’t account for the waves and\nhad no skill with boats. He tried to bring you here for shelter. Your dory\ncapsized and he was lost. We pulled you out of the sea.”\n“Oh, to account for why he isn’t here if any of the others saw us\ncoming in,” Kip said.\n“That’s right. Hold tight.”\nKip was holding a luxin oar up between himself and Ironfist, but he\nalmost didn’t get what the big man meant until too late. With a quick,\nsnapping punch, Ironfist lashed a hand through the luxin and stopped it so\nclose that Kip flinched. He barely even noticed the luxin crumbling to dust\nin his fingers. He had a sudden urge to urinate.\n“I don’t know if you’ve given your sire reason to suspect you,” Ironfist\nsaid. “But if you betray him, I’ll tear your arms off and beat you with\nthem.”\n“Good thing I’m fat, then,” Kip shot back.\n“What?” Incredulous.\n“Soft arms.” Kip grinned, thinking Ironfist had been kidding. The\nstony, flat, willing-to-kill look on the big man’s face made Kip’s grin break\nand disintegrate like broken luxin.\n“That fat’ll make you float, too. Get in the water,” a cold voice behind\nhim said.\nKip flinched. He hadn’t even heard Tremblefist approach. The man\nwas carrying a hollow log with numerous knotted ropes and loops attached.\nThe wood was carved with several handles too, so it would be easy to throw\ninto the sea. A swimmer could then grab for whatever length of rope he\nneeded.\nTremblefist handed the log to Kip and Ironfist rang a loud bell. “Man\noverboard!” Ironfist shouted. “We’ve got two in the water!”\n“Move it,” Tremblefist said. “And you’d better get completely wet.\nFast. Help will be here in seconds.”\nKip clutched the hollow log and jogged down the ramp between the\nrollers. The first big wave knocked him cleanly off his feet.

It was a cold that you quickly\ngot used to—the Cerulean Sea was fairly warm—but Kip didn’t have\nmoments. He gasped and inhaled salt water as another wave passed over\nhim. As he coughed his lungs clear, flapping his arms like an injured bird,\nhe could feel the riptide grab him. Where was the log? He’d lost it. It was\ngone.\nSomeone was shouting, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying\nover the crash of the waves. The swells were only a pace high, but it was\nenough to blot out Kip’s vision. He turned in a circle.\nThere was a bell ringing, ringing. Kip turned toward it, and despite the\nswells, he could see the looming black of Cannon Island. It was still\nreceding. He started swimming. A wave pummeled him, drove him under\nthe water and spun him. He kicked, kicked, trying not to panic. Failing. He\nhad no air. Orholam, he was going to die. He kicked, desperate.\nHe bobbed to the surface like a cork, but he was lost once more.\nHis panic receded. He’d floundered somehow to the side of the riptide,\nand now the waves were bringing him in toward Cannon Island, but not\ntoward the boat ramp. He was headed for the rocks. He swam hard\nsideways toward the sound of the bell.\nHe was rising with one of the swells when he saw something\nimpossible. Ironfist, with a rope tied around his chest, was running—\nthrough the air. He was wearing blue spectacles, and both of his hands were\npointed down. He was hurling blue luxin toward his feet, sprinting, making\na platform to stand on even as he ran.\nAs Kip watched, the blue luxin platform—anchored only somewhere\nback on Cannon Island—cracked with a report and began to crash toward\nthe waves. Ironfist leapt as the platform fell, releasing the luxin and\nexecuting a perfect dive.\nHe surfaced right next to Kip, his spectacles and ghotra ripped off by\nthe waves, and grabbed Kip with one arm. Then the men on the beach\nbegan pulling in the rope as fast as they could. In less than a minute, Kip\nand the big man were staggering up the ramp. Well, Ironfist was striding,\none hand holding a fistful of Kip’s shirt in case he fell, and Kip was\nstaggering on jellied, naked legs.\n“We couldn’t save your master, son. I’m sorry,” Ironfist said. There\nwere a dozen soldiers crowded on the narrow portico outside the back door\nof Cannon Island. One threw a blanket over Kip’s shoulders. “Take this\nyoung man inside and take care of him,” Ironfist commanded. “I’ve got\nbusiness on Big Jasper, I’ll take him with me and notify the family.

        "text": "“Damn, those were my best blue specs.”\nChapter 30\nLiv Danavis walked briskly over the luxin bridge called the Lily’s Stem that\nconnected the Chromeria on Little Jasper Island to the markets and homes\non Big Jasper Island, trying to ignore the tension knotting her shoulders.\nShe was wearing rough linen pants, a cloak against the chilly wind of the\nbright morning, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and the same\nsensible low leather shoes she’d worn when she’d first come to the\nChromeria as a terrified fourteen-year-old. She always felt the temptation to\ndress up in her nicest things when she was summoned, but she always\nresisted. Her rich, imperious handler would make her feel shabby no matter\nwhat she wore, so she might as well be defiant. If Dazen Guile had won the\nPrisms’ War, Liv would be Lady Aliviana Danavis, the daughter of the\ncelebrated general Corvan Danavis. Being Tyrean would have been a badge\nof honor. She wouldn’t have owed anyone anything. But Dazen had been\nkilled, and those who sided with him disgraced, her own father narrowly\navoiding execution despite being held in higher esteem than any general on\neither side. So now she was plain old Liv Danavis from Rekton, the dyer’s\ndaughter. And Ruthgar owned her contract. So what? She wasn’t scared of\nbeing summoned.\nMuch.\nDespite having been on the Jasper Islands for the last three years, Liv\nhadn’t come over to Big Jasper very often. The other girls came every week\nto listen to minstrels, get food not made in the Chromeria kitchens, meet\nboys who weren’t drafters, shop, and drink too much after examinations.\nLiv couldn’t afford any of those, and didn’t want to ask charity of anyone,\nso she begged off, always saying she needed to practice or to study.\nThe benefit of that was that she wasn’t yet jaded to the wonders of Big\nJasper. The entire island was stuffed with buildings, but nothing was\nhaphazard, unlike back home or in Garriston. The buildings were white\nstucco, blindingly bright in the sun, rising in terraces with the shape of the\nland. Geometric shapes dominated: hexagonal buildings and octagonal\nbuildings topped with domes. Every building large enough to justify one—\nand many that weren’t—sported a dome, and the domes were every color in\nthe rainbow. Blue domes the color of the Cerulean Sea, beaten gold domes\non the homes of the rich, copper domes turning gradually green and\nscrubbed every year to gleam again at Sun Day, domes painted the color of\nblood, mirrored domes. And with the domes, the doors, too, were beautiful.\nIt was as if all the irrepressible personality of the Jasperites rebelled against\nthe conformity of their white walls and similar-shaped homes, but only in\nthe decorating and designing of their doors. Exotic woods, chiseled patterns\nfrom every corner of the Seven Satrapies and beyond, doors apparently\ncarved of living wood with leaves still growing from the Tree People,\nTyrean horseshoe arches, Parian chessboard patterns, huge doors to small\nbuildings, keyhole doors in huge edifices.\nBut at least as iconic as the colored domes and shining white walls of"

Every street was laid out perfectly\nstraight, and at every intersection stood pairs of narrow arches, thin, looking\nimpossibly spindly on their white legs, at least ten stories tall, connecting\nhigh above the intersection in a groin vault. Mounted on swivels at the\npinnacle of the groin vault was a circular mirror, highly polished, flawless,\nas tall as a man. With the special layout of the streets, as soon as the sun\nconquered the horizon, light could be directed anywhere.\nLong ago the builders had said, In this city, there will be no shadow\nthat Orholam’s eye cannot touch. Day was longer on Big Jasper than\nanywhere in the world.\nThe original purpose, as near as Liv could guess, had been to extend\nthe power of drafters on the island. In other densely populated cities, the\nbuildings eventually crowded out the sun. Not only did that make a city feel\ndark, but it meant drafters walking down those streets were vulnerable. The\nbuildings here were separated carefully according to height and width,\nleaving lightwells, but with the Thousand Stars, a drafter could have as\nmuch power available to her as she could handle for hours longer than she\nwould otherwise.\nOn Sun Day, every one of the Thousand Stars was slaved to the Prism.\nEverywhere he walked, every mirror turned, illuminating him. Obviously,\nsome beams were blocked by buildings, but no matter where he walked—\neven in the poorest areas—at least a few had unobstructed views. Indeed,\nbefore anyone built a building, their plans had to pass inspection that they\nwouldn’t interfere with the Thousand Stars. Only a very few had been able\nto circumvent the rules, like the Guile palace.\nOf course, Liv thought, the same rules don’t apply to the obscenely\nrich. Never do. Not here.\nEvery principality in the city was allowed to determine how it wished\nto use its stars when they weren’t needed for defense, law enforcement, or\nreligious duties. Some moved their stars in rigid schedules, making a light\nclock that everyone in the district could easily see.\nToday, the first principality Liv walked through, the Embassies, was\nhaving a market day. They’d fitted diffuse yellow lenses over half of their\nstars, lighting an entire great square with cheery light. A half dozen yellow\ndrafters, hired specially for the occasion, were—without spectacles—\njuggling brightwater, liquid yellow luxin. Dragons exploded in the air, great\nfountains of shimmering, evaporating yellow luxin shot skyward, drawing\ngreat crowds toward the market. The other half of the stars, fitted with\nlenses of every color, spun in great circles around the market in a dizzying\ndisplay.\nLiv pitied the tower monkeys—the petite slaves, often children—who\nhad to work the ropes here today. Among slaves, they were well treated,\neven paid, their work for the star-keepers considered important, technically\ndifficult, and even holy, but they spent their days in two-man teams in the\nnarrow spindles, one spotting and one working the ropes with deft hands,"

When the Prism or\na superviolet traveled and needed use of the stars, they could do so directly,\nmagically. But every mundane purpose required the services of the\nmonkeys.\nIdly, Liv considered reaching into a superviolet control line embedded\nin the street and taking control of a star, just to wreak some havoc on the\nrich people’s party. That was the beauty of being a superviolet. No one\ncould tell you were drafting who couldn’t also see superviolet.\nStill, it wasn’t like she would be the first student to do such a thing.\nPunishments for such pranks were swift and severe.\nLiv’s stomach was doing backflips, though. Despite the hubbub of the\nmorning crowd and shouts of merchants and the singing of minstrels and\nthe crackling of the brightwater fireworks, nothing could distract her from\nher upcoming meeting.\nThe Crossroads was a kopi house, restaurant, tavern, the highest-priced\ninn on the Jaspers, and downstairs, allegedly, a similarly priced brothel. It\nwas centrally located in the Embassies District for all the ambassadors,\nspies, merchants trying to deal with various governments, and drafters\nhaving just crossed the Lily’s Stem, because the Crossroads was housed in a\nformer embassy building. As a matter of fact, it was in the old Tyrean\nembassy. Liv wondered if her handler had done that on purpose, or if she’d\njust chosen it because she knew it was far too expensive for Liv to afford.\nLiv hiked up the grand staircase to the second floor where the kopi\nhouse was. A beautiful greeter met her with a dazzling bright smile. The\nCrossroads had the best staff in the city: every last man, woman, and table\nslave attractive, immaculately dressed, and unfailingly professional. Liv had\nalways suspected that the slaves here earned more than she did. Not that\nthat would be hard. Actually, it was Liv’s first time inside.\n“How may we serve you today?” the greeter asked. “We have some\nlovely tables by the south window.” She politely didn’t stare at Liv’s rough\nclothing.\n“A private table, if possible. I’ll be meeting a… friend from the\nRuthgari embassy, Aglaia Crassos.”\n“Of course, I’ll be sure to send her over.” The staff here knew\neveryone who was anyone, by name. “Will you be needing muting for your\ntable?”\nMuting? Oh. Liv tightened her eyes to see into the superviolet. Of\ncourse. She’d forgotten; she’d heard about this too. A third of the tables\nhere were surrounded by superviolet bubbles. The bubbles had holes, of\ncourse, or the patrons inside would suffocate, so the sound couldn’t be\ncompletely cut off, but it would certainly help make sure it was a hundred\ntimes harder to eavesdrop. Some of the bubbles even had small spinning\nsuperviolet fans to blow fresh air into them. Which, Liv realized, was\neminently practical. Those patrons who had opted to have the bubble but\nnot the fan looked uncomfortably warm."

No wonder Liv hadn’t noticed right away. When a\nsuperviolet drafter got much further along, the color in their eyes began to\nbleed over into the visible range, lending a slight violet tinge that was\ndifficult to see in brown eyes and made blue eyes astonishingly beautiful—\nnot that Liv was ever going to get that, with her bland browns.\n“Actually…” Liv said. She turned her cloak so the woman could see\nthe back. It was common for superviolets to weave some extra pattern into\ntheir clothing so that other superviolets could identify them.\nThe greeter’s pupils tightened to pinpricks in a heartbeat as she\nglanced at Liv’s cloak. “Very finely done. Superviolets are welcome to draft\ntheir own muting, just let us know you’re going to be using muting when\nyou visit so our servers don’t make any mistakes.”\nThe woman took Liv to a table by the windows on the south side\nwhere she could get sunlight through open windows. There was plenty of\nsunlight here in the clerestory—the arches and flying buttresses supported\nall the weight of the roof easily, so the second story had windows from floor\nto ceiling—but one of the downsides of being a superviolet was that thick\nwindows like those used here interfered with light collection. Any skilled\ndrafter could still use magic, but it took longer and gave some drafters\nheadaches.\nLiv sat and watched how the staff worked, weaving effortlessly\nbetween tables, giving a wider berth to those surrounded by superviolet\nshells. A slender young serving man with short kinky hair and a gorgeous\nsmile came to her table, pausing just outside where her bubble would have\nbeen if she had already drafted one. He was probably only a few years older\nthan her, and devastatingly beautiful, his jacket expertly tailored to a leanly\nmuscled body.\nSomehow, she managed to give him her order. Just a kopi. Which\nwould doubtless cost a full danar. When he brought it back, steaming hot\nand dark as hellstone, and gave her a long smile, Liv decided the kopi was\ndefinitely worth a danar. Maybe more.\nHer good mood died at the sight of Aglaia Crassos climbing the stairs\nwith her butt-puckered gait. The twenty-something-year-old Ruthgari was,\nas best Liv could tell, the youngest daughter of some important family. She\nhad the prized, vanishingly rare Ruthgari blonde hair, but other than that,\nshe was no beauty. She had the blue eyes that were wasted on non-drafters,\na long, horsey face, and a huge nose. Stationed at the Ruthgari embassy to\nget some political experience before she married some fiancé she hadn’t\nmet back in the city of Rath, she had always acted like she was too good to\nhandle Liv.

She’d even told Liv that being assigned Liv’s case had been her\npunishment for some indiscretion with the Atashian ambassador’s son.\nMostly, she handled bichromes and polychromes and real spies.\nCatching sight of Liv, Aglaia came right over, giving a little wave to a\nfew patrons and a wink to one.\n“Aliviana,” Aglaia said, coming to stand before her table, “you’re\nlooking so… active this morning.” The pause said it all. The searching\nexpression, as if she was really trying to find something good to say. From\nsome women, it might have been an accident.\nYou want to play it like that? Fine. “Such a pleasure to see you, Aglaia.\nYou wear petty malice so well,” Liv said. Oops.\nAglaia’s eyes widened momentarily, and then she faked a laugh.\n“Always were a sharp instrument to handle, weren’t you, Liv? I love that\nabout you.” She sat across from Liv. “Or is it just that you’re too stupid to\nunderstand your situation?”\nMy father told me not to come here. Sharks and sea demons, he said. I\nshould have listened. I’m antagonizing the woman who holds my future.\n“I…” Liv licked dry lips, as if a little lubrication would help her force\nsubmissive words out. “I’m sorry. How may I be of assistance, Mistress?”\nAglaia’s eyes lit up. “Say that again.”\nLiv hesitated, clenched her jaw. Forced herself to relax. “How may I\nbe of assistance, Mistress?”\n“Draft us a bubble.”\nLiv drafted the muting bubble, complete with a fan.\n“Such a proud girl you are, Liv Danavis. The next time I have a party,\nI’ll have to remember to have you come serve the food. Or perhaps clean\nthe chamber pots.”\n“Oh, I love cleaning chamber pots. And I love telling all my friends\nwho haven’t yet signed contracts how well the Ruthgari treat their drafters,”\nLiv said.\nAglaia laughed. She really did have an unpleasant laugh. “Well played,\nLiv. That was an empty threat, and I deserved to be called on it. You’re\nfrom Rekton, aren’t you?”\nLiv was instantly on her guard. Aglaia had let an insult pass? Liv\nwould have expected that after being called on an empty threat, Aglaia\nwould lay out a real one—and she had quite a few possibilities at her\ndisposal. That she didn’t should have made Liv feel better. It didn’t.\n“Yes,” Liv admitted. There was no reason to lie. Nothing came from\nRekton. Besides, Aglaia would have a record of where Liv was from. It was\non her contract. “It’s a small town. Inconsequential.”\n“Who is Lina?”\nWhat? “She’s a serving woman. Katalina Delauria. Takes odd jobs.”\nAn addict, a disgrace, and a nightmare of a mother. But Aglaia didn’t need\nto know that, and Liv wasn’t going to say anything bad about the folks back\nhome.\n“Any family?”\n“None,” Liv lied. “She settled in Rekton after the war, like my father\ndid.”"

I don’t know. Some Parian or Ilytian blood,\nmaybe,” Liv said. “Why?”\n“What’s she look like?”\nToo skinny, with bloodshot eyes and bad teeth from smoking haze.\n“Tall, short kinky hair, mahogany skin, stunning hazel eyes.” Now that Liv\nthought about it, Lina had probably been a real beauty once.\n“And Kip? Who’s he?”\nOh, hell, caught. “Uh, her son.”\n“Oh, she does have family, then.”\n“I thought you meant does she have any people around Rekton.”\n“Right,” Aglaia said. “How old is Kip?”\n“Fifteen now, I suppose.” Kip was nice, though it had been obvious the\nlast time Liv was home that he was terribly infatuated with her.\n“What’s he look like?”\n“Why do you want to know all this?” Liv asked.\n“Answer the question.”\n“I haven’t seen him for three years. He probably looks totally different\nnow.” Liv threw up her hands, but Aglaia didn’t relent. “A bit chubby. A\nlittle shorter than me, the last time I saw him—”\n“For Orholam’s sake, girl, his eyes, his skin, his hair!”\n“Well I don’t know what you’re looking for!”\n“Now you do,” Aglaia said.\n“Blue eyes, medium skin, not as dark as his mother’s. Kinky hair.”\n“Half-breed?”\n“I guess so.” Though Liv couldn’t have said what Kip’s halves would\nbe. Parian and Atashian? Ilytian and Blood Forester? Something else?\nProbably not simple halves, whatever he was. “Half-breed” was a mean\ndescription, though, and completely unfair. The finest families and all the\nnobles in the Seven Satrapies intermarried far more often than commoners,\nand they were never called half-breeds.\n“Blue eyes, though. That’s interesting. Not many people in your town\nwith blue eyes, are there?”\n“My father has blue eyes. There’s a few among people who settled\nthere after the war, but no, we’re like the rest of Tyrea.”\n“Is he a drafter?”\n“Of course he is. My father’s one of the most famous red—”\n“Not your father, idiot girl. Kip.”\n“Kip? No! Well, not the last time I saw him. He was twelve or thirteen\nthen.”\nAglaia sat back. “I should let you grope in the dark after your attitude\ntoday, but then you’d be even more likely to muss everything than you\nalready are. I have an assignment for you, Liv Danavis. It turns out that my\npunishment of having to deal with you was Orholam’s gift in disguise. We\nintercepted a letter this woman Lina wrote to the Prism.”\n“She what?”\n“She claimed Kip was his bastard.”\nLiv laughed, it was so ridiculous. Aglaia’s face said she wasn’t\nkidding.\n“What?!” Liv asked."

Aglaia’s face said she wasn’t\nkidding.\n“What?!” Liv asked.\n“She said she was dying, and she wanted Gavin to meet his son Kip.\nWe don’t know if it’s their first communication or not. But she didn’t ask\nfor anything, or threaten him. Kip’s the right age, and Gavin had blue eyes\nbefore becoming the Prism. The rest is inconclusive, but the note was\nwritten as if it were true. As if Gavin knows her.” Aglaia smiled. “Liv, I’m\ngoing to give you an opportunity at a better life, and I hope I don’t need to\ntell you that I can already make you have a much worse life, if I so choose.\nYou tested as a superviolet and a marginal yellow. For obvious reasons,\nyour sponsor chose not to train you as a bichrome.”\nYes, Liv knew it well. A bichrome was expected to be kept in a certain\nstyle, or it reflected badly on the sponsor and the sponsoring country. And\nyellow was so hard to draft well that few who were trained in yellow passed\nthe final examination. So supporting a yellow bichrome was a huge\ninvestment, with little possibility of a return. Liv’s sponsor had pretended\nshe wasn’t a bichrome to save his money. It wasn’t fair, but there was no\none to speak up for Tyreans.\n“Here’s your assignment, girl. I’ve maneuvered things so that your\nclass will be up next for the Prism’s personal instruction. Get close to him\n—”\n“You want me to spy on the Prism?” Liv asked. The very notion was\nnearly… blasphemous.\n“Of course we do. He may solicit you for information about his son\nand this woman Lina. Use that opportunity. Become indispensable to him.\nBecome his lover. Whatever you need to—”\n“What? He’s twice my age!”\n“And that would be horrible—if you were forty years old. You’re not.\nIt’s not like we’re talking about someone old and decrepit. Tell me the truth,\nyou’ve already dreamed about him tearing off your clothes, haven’t you?”\n“No, absolutely not!” Really she’d just admired him. Every girl did\nthat. But for Liv, it had been completely abstract. Platonic.\n“Oh, a saint you are. Or a liar. I guarantee every other red-blooded\nwoman in the Chromeria has dreamed about it. No matter. You’ll think\nabout it now.”\n“You want me to seduce him?!”\n“It is the easiest way to be in a man’s room while he’s sleeping. Then if\nhe wakes while you’re rifling through his letters, you can pretend to be\njealous and say you’re looking for letters from some other lover. Truth is,\nwe don’t care how you get close to him, but let’s be honest: what do you\nhave to offer the Prism? Witty conversation? Insight? Not so much. On the\nother hand, you’re pretty for a Tyrean. You’re young, not very bright,\nuncultured, not powerful, not a scholar or a poet or a singer. If you can get\nclose to him some other way, great.

I’m not going to be your whore.”\n“Your piety’s touching, but it’s not whoring if you want to do it, is it?\nYou’ve seen him. He’s gorgeous. So you get a few extra benefits. You can\nenjoy him, you can bask in every woman’s jealousy, you get everything that\nwe offer—”\n“I don’t want anything more from you.”\n“You should have thought of that before you signed your contract. But\nthat’s in the past. Liv, if you can get even one private meeting with Gavin\nGuile, we will set you up as a bichrome. Get close to him, and we’ll make\nyour rewards even richer than that. But spit in my face, and everything in\nyour life can turn to hellstone. I have full power over your contract, and I\nwill use it.”\nThe offer of setting up Liv as a bichrome seemed awfully generous just\nfor getting one meeting with the Prism, but she saw the logic behind it. A\nPrism could do what he wanted, but sleeping with a Tyrean monochrome\nwould seem questionable, tasteless. Slumming. A bichrome, on the other\nhand, at least had some standing. The truth was, the offer was still probably\ngenerous, and might make Gavin more suspicious of them, but the prize—\nhaving a spy next to the Prism himself—was worth so much that the\nRuthgari were willing to risk it. They needed Liv to say yes.\n“Besides,” Aglaia said. “If you’re smarter than I think you are, you can\nfind out for yourself who gave the orders to burn Garriston. You could find\nout who’s responsible for your mother’s death.”\nChapter 31\nGavin had hunted down hundreds of color wights, and this one didn’t feel\nright.\nThe madness struck every color wight differently, but blue wights\nalways reveled in order. They loved the hardness of blue luxin. Most\neventually tried to remake themselves with it. Every one of them believed\nthey could avoid madness if only they were careful enough, smart enough,\nand thought through every step. But what was a blue wight doing crossing\nthe reddest desert in the Seven Satrapies?\nRondar Wit had been posted in one of the smaller coastal cities of\nRuthgar. Married, four children, and a good relationship with his lord\npatron, who’d waited two weeks to report Rondar’s disappearance—no one\nliked to believe that their friend might go mad.\nGavin trudged through the desert. He’d stopped briefly at one of his\ncontacts on the coast, got dressed entirely in red, and armed, and still\nthought he should reach the wight before dark. Still, he was exhausted.\nSkimming was fast, but his arms and shoulders and stomach and legs ached.\nHis will felt sapped. He didn’t get lightsick when he drafted too much—but\nhe did get tired and shaky.\nComing near the top of a dune, he stopped so as not to skyline himself\nand drafted a pair of long lenses.

If you\nfigured out where they were going, you could guess they would take the\nmost efficient route there. Gavin had no idea where this one was going, but\nhe was following the coast. Unless his objective was nearby, Gavin was\ngoing to assume that the giist would continue heading down the coastline,\nstaying far enough from the coast to avoid farms and towns. Of course, this\nwight had made a mistake, coming in too close from the desert for the sake\nof speed and access to water, and had been seen by a boy herding the rangy\ndesert cattle the nomads kept. The boy had told his father, and his father had\ntold everyone, including Gavin’s contact.\nFor a few days, the wight would try to put as much distance between\nhimself and the herders as possible.\nSo Gavin made guesses, drafting blue to help himself think like one of\nthem. Assuming the blue wight didn’t have a horse that the boy hadn’t seen\n—and horses usually hated color wights—a man pushing hard through this\ndesert could only move so fast. Gavin had been through here before, and\nthough he didn’t know it intimately, there were a number of points where a\nman had to decide if he wanted to follow the coastal road or take a trader’s\nroute through the Cracked Lands. And there were places where the Cracked\nLands were so broken and treacherous that there was no discernible traders’\nroute at all. Gavin wasn’t going to choose one or the other. He waited at one\nof the places where the roads met and diverged.\nAnd waited. He untucked his shirt, pulled it askew, rebuttoned it offset\none button, and tucked it back in. And waited. He drafted sub-red into fire\ncrystals to bleed off heat from his body, watching the tiny crystals take\nshape, crinkle, and then flame out. Every ten minutes, he trudged back high\non the great dune to poke his head over and scan the desert.\nAs the sun descended, he saw the telltale gleam. Aches forgotten, he\nwas again, a circling hawk, waiting for the marmot to step just this far from\nhis hole. He felt the same spasm of black fury that he felt every time. He\nshould kill it, kill it instantly, and not listen to its lies, its justifications, its\nhaughty madness.\nNo, this time, he needed to listen. First.\nThis giist’s skin was layered with blue luxin. It wasn’t just armor: it\nwas a carapace. Chromaturgy changed all men, but blue wights were\nseduced by the perfections of magic. They sought to trade flesh for luxin.\nThis one had progressed further than most. Talented, then, not to mention\nmeticulous and likely brilliant. It still wore blue pants and shirt, though both\nwere dirty and, uncharacteristically for a blue’s personality, torn. So it\nthought it was almost done with the need for clothing, but either the dangers\nof exposure in the desert or the possibility of needing just a bit more blue to\ndraft from had convinced the creature to keep its clothing for a little longer.\nIts face, though, was the true wonder—or horror, depending on how you\nlooked at it."

Gavin had seen it\nbefore. The process had to be done slowly and carefully enough to not\ncause infections or rejection, but once begun, it had to be finished quickly.\nThe skin lost feeling and began dying as soon as it was cut off from the\nbody, so the wight began sloughing off rotting skin. This one’s forehead had\nsplit open, revealing robin’s egg blue beneath peeling, necrotic skin. It had\ndrafted blue covers for its eyes arcing from brow to cheekbones in a solid\ndome so it would effectively always be wearing blue spectacles, but the\nresult made it look like a bug with bulging blue eyes. It was, Gavin had\nalways thought, one of the worst parts of giists trying to remake themselves.\nIf all your skin died, your eyelids died. Even if you could draft a thin blue\nmembrane every time you needed to clear your eyes—and it had to be held\nblue luxin, because rubbing blue glass against your eyeballs was never a\ngood idea—even if you deal with that, you could never close your eyes to\nsleep. Even wights needed sleep.\nAn hour later, as the sun was almost touching the horizon, burning the\ndesert beautiful, Gavin put on his borrowed red spectacles, gathered the red\ncloak around himself, cracked open a white mag torch, and stepped out in\nfront of the giist.\nThe blue wight convulsed. Blues hated surprises, hated not having\nforeseen something, hated having their plans disrupted. But they were also\nhard to read, the blue perfection of a luxin face preventing facial expression\nof emotions even as the magic in their veins slowly obliterated their\ncapacity to feel them.\nBut the surprise lasted only a moment. The giist sprinted straight for\nGavin, its skin afire with blue, its eyes literally aglow, buggy, lit from\nwithin with refracting blue light. Gavin tossed the mag torch down in the\nsand in front of himself and threw open his red cloak, taking a wide stance\non the side of the dune as the giist charged.\nGavin’s hand swept up past the weapons harness, little fingers of red\nluxin plucking all the tiny daggers from their sheaths. As he took one great\nstep forward with his left foot, he drafted a dozen thin barrels along his arm.\nThen his right arm whipped forward with all the energy coiled in his body\nadded to the force of his will. The dozen tiny daggers became steel missiles\nas he flung them. They flew at incredible speed, one after the other.\nA blue shield sprang from the wight’s left arm and blossomed huge, to\ncatch the splashing fire it expected from a red drafter with a mag torch.\nInstead, the steel daggers hit with a sound like hail on a tin roof. The shield\npitted, cracked, cracked wide, and gaped open. The last three daggers sailed\ncleanly through. The first struck its cheek and deflected off its carapace. The\nnext cut only the air next to its neck, and the last buried itself in the wight’s\nshoulder.\nThe giist had already begun its counterstroke, though. It flung its right"

It flung its right\nfist forward and five enormous spikes formed in the air around its hand and\nstabbed for Gavin’s stomach in a line so that even if he moved left or right,\nhe’d still be skewered.\nGavin cheated, of course. He drafted a solid platform beneath the sand\nto give himself a solid surface to jump off of and dove down the dune,\nflipping and landing in a great slide down the dune’s face.\nThe giist whipped around, dropping its luxin spears and drafting a blue\ngreat sword in their place. It saw that Gavin had lost his spectacles in his\ndive, and it twitched a smile. Its cheek had been sliced by Gavin’s dagger,\nand a flap of skin peeled open, drooping toward earth, showing a\ncrosshatched network of blood vessels and blue luxin, though the luxin was\ncracked and broken at the point of impact, capillaries oozing blood. The\ndagger in its left shoulder seemed to be hampering its motion, but it was\nnothing lethal.\n“You reds,” the giist said, its voice gravelly, as if it hadn’t spoken in\nsome time. “So impulsive. You thought you could take me, alone, just\nbecause it’s sunset in a desert?”\nGavin glanced at his spectacles lying on the sand above him. The giist\nsaw it and swung its great sword. The blade elongated in midair, closing the\nfull five paces, and smashed the red spectacles to bits, then shortened again.\n“You should leave murdering the Unchained to your Prism,” the giist\nsaid.\nThe Unchained?\nGavin said, “They told us the Prism was too important for you. They\ntold us we should be able to handle one blue wight in the middle of a desert.\nThey said Rondar Wit wasn’t that gifted.”\nThe giist laughed. “Was that supposed to make me angry? I’m not\nRondar any longer. The Prism’s empire crumbles over your head, slave.\nJoin us. See what it is to be free. You have, what, perhaps five years left?\nNot long, not even for a drafter in their world. Why die for their false god?\nWhy die for their lies? Why die, ever?”\nThe giist was trying to recruit him? This was different. Gavin kept his\neyes squinted. The less the giist saw his eyes, the less likely it was to notice\nhow odd they were. “False god?” Gavin asked. Immortality?\nSlimy held blue luxin swiped along the insides of its bug eyes, from\nthe inner corner to the outer. Blinking. “Surely you don’t believe in\nOrholam? Are you all corrupt, or just stupid? If Orholam himself chooses\nthe Prism as the Chromeria has preached since Lucidonius, how could there\nbe two Prisms in one generation? Or are you one of the mental cowards\nwho shrugs and calls it a mystery, who says Orholam’s ways are ineffable?”\nIt was one thing for a color wight to run: not even blues were immune"

But an attack on Orholam himself was a heresy that cut to the\nroot of the world. If you called Orholam a fraud, and said everyone in\npower must know it, the Chromeria became the purveyor of lies, an\noppressor who stole from you, not a friend who needed your help to sustain\ntheir worthy efforts. “I haven’t believed in Orholam for years,” Gavin said,\nhonestly. “But why trade one superstition for another?”\nThe giist glanced at Gavin’s shirt, noticing the buttons weren’t done\nproperly. Good. Any time it spent looking at his buttons was time it didn’t\nspend looking at his eyes. “You stop believing lies so you can believe the\ntruth, not so you can believe nothing at all. King Garadul has…” He trailed\noff, looking at Gavin suspiciously. Putting something together.\n“King Garadul, is he who leads the Unchained?” Gavin asked.\n“Who are you?” it demanded. “You aren’t nervous. And you should\nbe.” It tore the dagger out of its shoulder, sealed the wound, and tossed the\ndagger aside. It drew a long, ball-handled matchlock pistol from the ragged\npouch, began loading in a precise manner with the odd, quick, but\nabsentminded mode blue wights sometimes had. It used blue luxin like an\nextension of its hands. Blue luxin ramrod, blue luxin fingers to hold the\nslow match, blue luxin to draw out the powder horn and a lead ball. It\ngrabbed the still-burning mag torch from the sand and held it up to light the\nslow match. “Foolish, rash red drafter,” the giist said, glancing down at\nGavin’s misbuttoned shirt. “You should always spend the extra to buy a\nmag torch in your own color.”\n“I did,” Gavin said.\nThe giist’s eyes snapped from the white torch to Gavin’s eyes. Even\nthrough the buggy eye cover and the frozen luxin face, Gavin read\nrealization in every line of the giist’s body.\nBefore it could move, Gavin leapt forward with an insane scream.\nTaken off guard, the giist lost concentration on the luxin hand holding\nthe mag torch, and that hand disintegrated, dropping the flaming brand. The\ngiist didn’t forget its great sword or the pistol, though. It lifted the blade to\nimpale Gavin, raised the pistol.\nDrafting parrying sticks of blue luxin in each hand, Gavin slapped the\nblade aside. He flung the giist’s hands wide. Letting the parrying sticks\ndisintegrate, he drafted. A narrow blue blade sprang from his palm. He\nstepped close, inside the blue wight’s arms even as the pistol’s hammer\nclicked and the match slapped down. He slammed blade and palm into the\ngiist’s chest, its carapace yielding with a popping sound. Gavin shed the\nremaining blue luxin with a flick of his arms and pulled in the hottest sub-\nreds he could handle into each hand. Flames curled around his fists as he\nclenched them.\nThe pistol roared and went spinning harmlessly out of the giist’s hand."

It all happened so fast the blue wight couldn’t resist. Blues\nwere slow to react when they found their presuppositions were wrong.\nBroken, the giist sank, sat, tried to catch itself, and fell on the sand.\nDespite its solid blue lidless eyes, despite the burned skin and the\ncrosshatched blue luxin through the cut on its cheek, to Gavin it looked\nabruptly human once more.\nThe startled look in those broken-haloed eyes.\nThe red red blood spilling down its chest.\nAnd suddenly, the figure looked more like a man than like the monster\nthat Gavin had found standing over Sevastian’s bed all those years ago, the\nwindow broken open behind him, light gleaming off blue skin and red\nblood.\nGavin took a deep, unsteady breath.

I—”\n“Dazen!” the giist shouted, hands clutching its wound, writhing.\nGavin was so startled he lost his place in the funerary rite.\n“Dazen leads us, and the Color Prince is his strong right hand.” The\ngiist laughed, blood flecking his segmented blue lips.\n“Dazen’s dead,” Gavin said, his gut twisting.\n“Light cannot be chained, Prism. Not even by you. You’re the heretic,\nnot…” And then the darkness of death closed over the giist at last.\nChapter 32\nKip barely had time to get scrubbed down with towels, dressed in some\nsoldier’s pants and a dry shirt and heavy boots—surprisingly enough, it all\nfit; apparently they were used to big soldiers out here—and plopped in front\nof a fire before Ironfist showed up. His tightly curled hair was damp, but\notherwise there was nothing to give away that he had just been in the ocean\ntoo. He wore a regulation gray uniform like Kip’s, though with a gold\nseven-pointed star and two bars on his lapel, where Kip’s uniform was\nblank.\n“Up,” Ironfist said.\nKip stood, rubbing his arms in what seemed a vain effort to get warm.\n“I thought you were a commander of the Blackguard. Why are you wearing\na captain’s uniform?”\nIronfist’s eyebrow barely twitched. “So you know Chromerian ranks?”\n“Master Danavis taught me all the military ranks of all Seven\nSatrapies. He thought—”\n“That’s nice. You have all your belongings?” Ironfist said.\nKip scowled, at being interrupted and dismissed and at the thought of"

You have all your belongings?” Ironfist said.\nKip scowled, at being interrupted and dismissed and at the thought of\nbelongings. “I don’t have any stuff. I didn’t have that much to start with,\nand—”\n“So the answer is yes,” Ironfist said.\nSo that was how it was going to be. “Yes,” Kip said. “Sir.” He was\nonly a little sardonic with the sir, but Ironfist looked at him sharply, no\nhumor at all in the one raised eyebrow. He really was very big. Not just tall,\nnot just really tall. Rippling with muscle. Intimidating. Kip looked away. He\ncleared his throat awkwardly. “I’m sorry you had to dive in and get me. I’m\nsorry I made you lose your spectacles. I’ll pay you back, I promise.”\nSuddenly, to his complete horror, Kip felt tears welling up from\nnowhere. Orholam, no! But the pull was as irresistible as the riptide. His\nstomach convulsed as he tried to choke back the sob, but it escaped anyway.\nHe was so sick of being weak. He was the child who couldn’t even hold on\nto the rope someone put in his hands. He hadn’t been able to do anything.\nHe hadn’t saved Isa when she needed him. He hadn’t saved his mother. He\nhadn’t saved Sanson. He was powerless, stupid. When it had come down to\nit, he’d panicked. His mother was right about him.\nHalf a dozen expressions rushed over Ironfist’s face in quick\nsuccession. He raised one hand awkwardly, lowered it, raised it again, and\npatted Kip’s shoulder. He cleared his throat. “I can requisition another pair.”\nKip started laughing and crying at the same time, not because Ironfist\nwas funny, but because the big man thought Kip was crying about his\nspectacles.\n“There you go,” Ironfist said. He thumped Kip’s shoulder with the side\nof his fist in what Kip thought was supposed to be a friendly manner—\nexcept it hurt. Kip rubbed his shoulder and laugh-cried harder.\n“Let’s go,” Kip said, shrinking back lest Ironfist tap one of his\nnamesakes on his shoulder again and leave a smoking ruin.\nIronfist’s eyebrows twitched up in a momentary expression of relief.\n“Almost as bad as dealing with a woman, huh?” Kip said.\nIronfist stopped cold. “How’d…” he trailed off. “You are a Guile,\naren’t you?”\n“What do you mean?” Kip asked.\n“Let’s go,” Ironfist said in a tone that brooked no argument. Kip didn’t\nhesitate. He didn’t know what precisely Ironfist would do to him if he didn’t\nobey, but knowing was a logical process. Fear was faster.\nOutside, he saw that they’d rigged up another boat on the ramp. He\nrubbed his clammy arms and stared at the sea.

And it was smaller. Kip’s stomach turned.\n“Commander?” one of the men said. “You sure? I wouldn’t want to go\nout on this even with experienced sailors. Especially if you’re going the\nlong way.”\nKip didn’t see the look that passed between the men, but he heard the\nsoldier say, “Yes, sir,” quickly afterward.\nCannon Island was in the middle of the current that flowed between\nLittle Jasper and Big Jasper. Little Jasper Bay was calm, protected by a\nseawall, but Kip and Ironfist were headed the opposite direction, to circle\nthree-quarters of Big Jasper in order to get to its bay.\n“Aren’t we going to the Chromeria?” Kip asked. He could see the tops\nof colored towers, only partially visible above the rocky body of Cannon\nIsland. “Why can’t we go to their bay? It’s closer.”\n“Because we’re not going straight there,” Ironfist said. He gestured for\nKip to get in and handed him an oar.\nThe men pushed them off and Ironfist began rowing hard. Kip did his\nbest to keep up with the big man, but almost immediately they began\nturning toward Kip’s side. Ironfist said nothing; he just switched sides and\nrowed hard a few times on Kip’s side until they were straight, then returned\nto his own side. The commander aimed them so they quartered the waves.\nKip’s heart was constantly in his throat. The three- and four-foot-tall waves\nyielded to five- and six-foot-tall waves.\nAnd then Ironfist raised their little sail a third of the way. “Keep us\nstraight,” he barked, working the lines. Kip felt like a headless chicken,\nflopping awkwardly from one side of the boat to the other, keeping them\nheaded slowly forward, going up each wave with a lurch and swooping\ndown the opposite side.\n“Down! Get down!” Ironfist shouted. Kip dropped just as the wind\nshifted and the sail swung from one side of the boat to the other, the boom\nwhipping over his head. It snapped so hard against the ropes that Kip\nthought it might tear off or break.\nOrholam, that could have been my head.\nThe dinghy leaned over hard, even with the sail only a third of the way\nraised, and jumped forward. Kip had barely gotten back up to his knees, and\nthe sudden forward motion made him tumble backward, splashing into the\ncold dirty water at the bottom of the dinghy.\n“The rudder! Take the rudder!” Ironfist ordered.\nKip grabbed the rudder and held it straight for a long moment, though\nthe dinghy was turned too far away from the wind—taking the waves\nalmost side on. He blinked seawater out of his eyes. Throw the rudder this\nway, it turns at the fulcrum there, and the boat turns… Got it.\nPart of the next wave sloshed over the gunwales as Kip threw the\nrudder hard toward the port side.

A hard gust of wind made the dinghy bear\ndown even farther in the water, then they popped up hard as they escaped\nthe killing grip of the wave.\nKip whooped as they sped forward, riding the waves, plowing through\nthem at times now, rather than simply being at their mercy. But Ironfist\ndidn’t share his joy. He was glancing up at the sky. He raised the sails a\nlittle more, and the dinghy picked up even more speed, leaning so hard to\nthe port side that Kip thought they were going to capsize.\nWhen they reached the west side of Big Jasper, they were able to run\nbefore the wind. It was like flying.\nIronfist kept glancing south, but the dark clouds there seemed to\ndissipate rather than gather, and by the time they turned into Big Jasper’s\nwind shadow, Kip could tell from Ironfist’s demeanor that they were out of\ndanger.\n“There’s a small dock that we want, head straight,” Ironfist told him,\nraising their sail all the way.\nSo Kip aimed them past galleys and galleasses, corvettes armed with a\nsingle gun mounted on a swivel, and galleons with fifteen cannons on each\nside. They stayed fairly far out so they wouldn’t interfere with the constant\nstream of ships coming in and out of the bay, the dinghies taking crews\nashore.\n“Is it always like this?” Kip asked.\n“Always,” Ironfist said. “Bay’s too small, so to accommodate the\nnumber of boats needed to keep trade flowing smoothly there’s an elaborate\nsystem to determine who gets in first. It works…” He glanced up at a\ncaptain swearing loudly at the harborman standing on his deck with an\nabacus. The harborman looked singularly unimpressed. “For the most part.”\nBetween having to veer sharply now and again to avoid other boats\naccording to some ships’ etiquette that he didn’t understand, Kip didn’t get\nto catch more than a few glimpses of the city covering Big Jasper. And from\nwhat he saw, it did cover Big Jasper. There was a wall just above shore\naround the entire island—leagues of walls—but even that couldn’t hide the\ncity as it rose on two hills. Aside from a few green patches—gardens?\nparks? mansions’ grounds?—there were buildings everywhere. Soaring\nbulbous domes in every color, everywhere. And people, more people than\nKip had ever seen.\n“Kip. Kip! Port! Gawk later.”\nKip tore his eyes off the island and turned to port, narrowly avoiding\nramming a galleass. They sailed past under the evil eye of the galleass’s\nknotted-haired first mate. He looked like he was going to spit on them, but\nsaw their uniforms and spat on his own deck instead.\nThey proceeded into open water until they started to round the eastern\nside of the island. “Turn in here,” Ironfist said. Kip turned toward a little\ndock with a few small fishing boats moored to it. They docked and headed\nup to the wall. Kip tried not to gawk, though the wall itself was easily the\nbiggest man-made structure he’d ever seen."

The guards outside looked confused.\n“Captain?” Then they snapped sharp salutes, eyes wide. “Commander!”\nA smaller door inset to the larger gate was open, and Ironfist walked\nthrough, nodding to acknowledge the men. The city inside was too\noverwhelming for Kip to comprehend even part of it. But the part that hit\nhim first was the smell.\nIronfist must have noticed the look on his face. “You think this is bad?\nYou should try a city without sewers.”\n“No,” Kip said, looking at the hundreds of people in the streets, the\nthree- and four-story buildings everywhere, the cobbled streets with tracks\nworn a hand’s breadth down into the stones. “It’s just that there’s so much.”\nAnd there was. Smells of cooking pork, spices Kip didn’t know, fresh fish,\nrotting fish, a thin odor of human waste and a stronger one of horse and\ncattle manure, and, overwhelming it all, the smell of unwashed men and\nwomen.\nThe people parted naturally around Ironfist, and Kip followed in his\nwake, trying not to run into anyone as he shot glances at all the people.\nThere were men wearing ghotras like Ironfist, but also bedecked in robes\nwith checkered patterns and loud colors. There were Atashian men with\ntheir impressive beards: beads, braids, natural sections, and more beads and\nbraids. There were Ilytian women with multilayered dresses and shoes\nnearly like stilts, making them a full hand taller. And a riot of colors\neverywhere. Every color in the rainbow, combined in every possible way.\nIronfist looked back at Kip, amused.\n“Those soldiers at the gate,” Kip said, trying to take Ironfist’s attention\noff his being a bumpkin. “Those weren’t your men.”\n“No,” Ironfist said.\n“But they recognized you, and you didn’t recognize them, and they\nwere really excited that they’d seen you.”\nIronfist looked at Kip again, scowling. “How old are you again?”\n“I’m fift—”\n“The commander,” Ironfist said. As if that answered everything. He\nsmirked as Kip scurried up beside him. “You’re the genius. Let’s hear it,”\nhe said.\nGenius? I never acted like I thought I was that. But that was a\ndistraction. This was a test. In fact, Ironfist had been testing Kip the whole\ntime, Kip saw now. Putting him on the rudder had been a test, to see what\nhe would do, how quickly he would figure it out, and if he would freeze up.\nKip wasn’t even sure how well he’d done on that count.\nIronfist was a commander.

Oh my.\n“There’s only one company of Blackguards, isn’t there?” Kip asked.\nLike most of Ironfist’s expressions, this one was quick and quickly\nmuted: the full white of his eyes around dark irises visible for a bare\nmoment, then a little smirk to cover. “Not bad, given the obvious hint, I\nsuppose.”\n“So you’re the sole commander of the most elite company in the\nChromeria. That makes you like a general or something?”\n“Or something.”\n“Oh,” Kip said. “So that means I should probably be even more\nintimidated of you than I am right now, huh?”\nIronfist laughed. “No, I think you’ve got it just about perfect.” He\ngrinned.\n“What were you doing pulling guard duty on that rock?”\n“It is a bit more than a rock.”\nPut that way, it did make some sense. The Blackguard had to protect\nthe Chromeria’s most important people, and a secret escape tunnel was the\nkind of thing you had to check yourself. “Still,” Kip said.\nThey came to a much wider road and Ironfist—Commander Ironfist—\nturned onto it, heading west, the opposite direction of almost all of the\ntraffic. He sighed. “It’s not a duty anyone wants, so it’s sometimes used as\npunishment. Let’s just say I’ve given the White reason to be displeased\nrecently.”\nKip said quietly, “Or that’s a cover so you can go out and check the\nmaintenance of the tunnel.”\n“Except that a tunnel is… a tunnel. Don’t make things more\ncomplicated than they are, little Guile.”\nHuh? “Oh.” Ironfist could come from the Chromeria side and make\nsure the tunnel worked. He didn’t need to sail out to the island for that.\nSome genius I am. Embarrassed, Kip rushed to ask another question, and\nasked the question he knew he shouldn’t. “So what did you do to make him\nmad at you? You know, the White.”\n“Him?” Ironfist asked.\n“Her?”\nIronfist turned in at a little house with an oxidized copper dome,\nunlocked the door, and pointed for Kip to go in. “There’s hard tack and\ncheese and olives in the kitchen. Latrine off to the left. Bed straight down\nthe hall. You’re not to leave until I come get you tomorrow at dawn.”\n“But we came across those huge waves instead of waiting, I—I\nthought we were going straight to the Chromeria.”\n“I’m going straight to the Chromeria.”\n“While I just sit here all day?”\n“When you see what you have to do tomorrow, you’ll be glad you had\nthe rest.” Ironfist moved to leave.\n“But, what—what are you going to do?”\n“I’m going to go get back in the White’s good graces.”\nKip scowled as the door closed. There was a click. He was locked in.\n“That’s great,” he told the closed door. “I’ll just wait here. I’ve been\nmeaning to catch up on my thumb-twiddling.” Grumbling, he made his way\nto the olives and cheese. Ten minutes later, he was asleep.\nChapter 33"

Ten minutes later, he was asleep.\nChapter 33\nKarris woke beneath a lean-to constructed of tree branches and a man’s\ncloak. It was either dusk or dawn. She guessed dawn from the dew on the\nground. She examined herself with a soldier’s efficiency, moving each limb\nand digit experimentally, trying to gauge her own potential for movement,\nviolent or otherwise. All her fingers and toes worked properly, but her entire\nleft side was bruised. She must have not only crashed through the\ndoorframe with her upper body there, but also landed on her left side,\nbecause her shin ached, her knee ached, there were gravel scratches on her\nhip, her breast felt like someone had mistaken it for a sawdust-filled training\nbag and punched it for an hour, and her shoulder—Orholam, her shoulder.\nShe could breathe without much pain, though, which she hoped meant there\nweren’t any broken ribs, and she could still move her arm, although it\nalmost made her black out to do so.\nHer right side hadn’t escaped undamaged either. She had long gravel\nscrapes on her right arm and her stomach, probably some to match on her\nback, and her neck was sore from Orholam knew what. She’d stubbed all\nthe toes of her right foot—didn’t remember doing that either—and her left\neye was swollen, not enough to block her vision, but enough to look real\npretty. There was also a scratch on her forehead, several attractive lumps on\nher head, and—what the hell, a cut right on the tip of her nose?\nNo, not a cut. A pimple. Unbe—A pimple? Now? Orholam hates me.\nEvery one of her cuts and scratches had been smeared with some kind\nof ointment that smelled of berries and pine needles. Someone cleared his\nthroat. “There’s more ointment to your right. I tended the more… obvious\ncuts.”\nWhich Karris took to mean that Corvan hadn’t stripped her naked.\n“Thanks,” she grumbled. “What happened back there?”\n“Aside from the obvious?” Corvan asked, his voice flat.\n“In the church, downstairs. I’ve never seen red luxin that didn’t burn\ncleanly. If you drafted it wrong, it should have evaporated, not formed a\ncrust. And what was that thing you were in?” Karris sat up, wincing. Her\nankle hurt too. Ow, when had she twisted her ankle? She ignored it, and\ntried to remember all she knew about Corvan Danavis. He’d been a rebel, of\ncourse, but before he’d sided with Dazen, he’d been a scion of one of the\ngreat Ruthgari families. For nearly a hundred years, Ruthgar and the Blood\nForest had been bound together in peace, the closest of allies. Noble\nfamilies from Ruthgar had intermarried with the leading families of Blood\nForesters, holding lands on either side of the Great River. Other peoples had\nbegun referring to the countries as one, merging the Verdant Plains and the\nBlood Forest to call the joint country Green Forest.

Vician’s Sin had put an\nend to that, and by a generation before the False Prism’s War, the countries\nwere instead known as the Blood Plains. If one good thing had come from\nthe False Prism’s War, it was that it had given Gavin the clout to finally end\nthe interminable small-scale war constantly simmering between Ruthgar\nand the Blood Forest.\nCorvan was a product of that conflict. Born into a warrior family, with\nsome ungodly number of brothers (eight? ten?), he was, Karris thought she\nremembered, the last one alive. Karris barely remembered him from before\nthe False Prism’s War. He was just another Ruthgari from old blood left\nsuddenly penniless with little more than the fine weapons he carried and the\nfine clothes on his back. He’d been a monochrome, too, so his prospects of\nreclaiming wealth in some other land had been dismal. When the war had\nstarted, he’d joined Dazen immediately, like so many other dispossessed\nyoung lords with everything to gain.\nKarris had been fifteen years old, and she couldn’t remember Corvan\npersonally at all. Which, she supposed, wasn’t too surprising, given all the\nattention she’d been getting from the Guile brothers. He’d been an adviser\nonly for much of the war, but near the end of the war, Dazen had made him\na general. Karris had heard Commander Ironfist credit that fact with Gavin\nwinning the war—not calling Corvan Danavis incompetent, but the\nopposite. Commander Ironfist had said that if Corvan Danavis had been a\ngeneral for the whole war, Gavin’s armies wouldn’t have even made it to\nthe Battle of Sundered Rock. Ironfist had further said that if General\nDanavis hadn’t surrendered unconditionally after Sundered Rock, there\nmight still be guerrillas fighting in half of the Seven Satrapies. Corvan’s\ngrace in defeat had convinced his men to go home.\nDipping her fingers into the bowl of ointment, Karris gave Corvan a\nlook. He appeared confused. She began lifting her long shirt, ointment on\nher fingers, and he got it. He cleared his throat and turned away. Karris\nsmeared ointment gingerly on the scrapes on her chest, giving herself time\nto think.\nWith all that history, Karris expected Corvan Danavis would be some\ngraybeard. This man was in his mid-forties, shaven except for a day or\ntwo’s stubble. His skin was lighter than most Tyreans, but much darker than\nBlood Forester pale, though he did perhaps have some freckles on his\ncheeks. His eyes were blue—no shock there, with the ludicrous amount of\nred he’d been able to draft. The luxin halo was only halfway through his\nirises—even less than Karris’s, despite his being probably twelve or fifteen\nyears older than she was. There were perhaps red highlights in his dark hair,\ntoo, and his hair was wavy rather than kinky. And the general had been\nfamous for his red mustache, which he’d kept trimmed except at the ends\nthat dangled below his chin, where he’d tied red and gold beads. Maybe this\nwas some other Corvan Danavis, or some man who’d taken his name,"

Maybe this\nwas some other Corvan Danavis, or some man who’d taken his name,\nhoping to profit from the general’s good reputation. “They were on us\nbefore we knew what was happening,” Corvan said. “I’d counseled the\nvillage to send a boy or two for the levies but even I didn’t expect this kind\nof retribution. King Garadul came here not to teach us a lesson, but to teach\nthe rest of Tyrea one. I’ve only run into his like once before.” General\nDelmarta, the Butcher of Ru, Karris guessed.\n“You saw the pyramid?” Karris asked, turning back to him.\nCorvan Danavis got very still. The side of his mouth ticked up in a\nsnarl for the briefest instant. But when he turned his gaze to Karris, it was\ncool, in control. There wasn’t even a hint of fresh red luxin in his eyes,\nwhich spoke of astonishing control for a drafter his age. “I gathered those I\ncould and pulled back to the church.” Was he hoping Garadul’s men would\nrespect holy ground? “It’s the least flammable building in town” Corvan\nsaid, answering the unspoken question. “We fought, and we lost. The\nDelarias and the Sworrins couldn’t get the door to the basement open, and I\nwas too busy fighting. Maybe I shouldn’t have fought at all. I think the\nchromaturgy just drew more soldiers. They overwhelmed us. I retreated\ndownstairs.”\n“Alone?”\nHe looked surprised at the question. “Everyone else was dead,” he\nsaid.\nExcept for one young family, not ten paces from the stairs. Had\nCorvan fought at all, or had he immediately retreated downstairs and locked\nthe door behind himself, dooming the townsfolk to fiery death? The soldiers\nhad carried away their dead, and the fires had obscured most of the\nevidence of battle in the temple, so Karris couldn’t know for sure.\n“So this is where you tell me how you used the most flammable luxin\nto escape a fire,” Karris said.\n“Do you know why you blow on a flame when you’re starting a\ncampfire?” Corvan asked. He didn’t wait for Karris to answer. “Because fire\nneeds to breathe. I’m a monochrome, Lady White Oak. We have to be more\ncreative than near-polychromes like you.”\n“Just tell me what you did,” Karris said. How did he know she was\nnearly a poly? She was still trying to decide if it was even possible that this\ncould be General Danavis. In this backwater? And from a Blood Forester\nfamily? The eyes and freckles spoke of Blood Forester heritage, but with\nthat skin? Of course, he had grown up in a noble family, and a family\nbreeding its sons for war. The perfect combination for a warrior drafter was\nblack skin with blue eyes. Even caramel skin was far better than pale Blood\nForester skin to give a warrior an extra fraction of a second before their\nopponents knew what color they were drafting. So it was possible. Noble\nfamilies had certainly married off their daughters and sons for lesser\nreasons. Fearing that your children wouldn’t look like natives of their own"

Fearing that your children wouldn’t look like natives of their own\nland might move far down the list of concerns when pure survival was at\nstake.\n“When I went downstairs,” Corvan continued, “I knew they’d come\nafter me, so I covered every surface in the room with red luxin. I sealed the\nroom completely and coated myself in the luxin as well. When the soldiers\ncame in, I closed the door behind them and set it all afire. The conflagration\ndevoured all the air in the room, and both the fire and the soldiers died.” So\nthat was why the red luxin had had a crust rather than burning away cleanly.\nNo air.\n“And the tubes?” Karris had crashed through some tubes when she’d\nfallen.\n“They led outside. So I could breathe.”\n“So why didn’t you leave after you killed them?”\nHe stared hard at her. “Because if I didn’t wait until every last ember\nburned itself out, I’d be inviting the entire room to explode. As you might\nhave noticed when you brought burning embers with you and made the\nentire room explode.”\nOh.\n“Why is King Garadul gathering an army?” Karris said. “Why now?”\n“To assert himself, I’d imagine. New king, wants to show he’s tough.\nDoes it have to be more complicated? Rask Garadul was always a crazy\nlittle bastard.”\n“If you really are Corvan Danavis, you just lied to me,” Karris said. A\ngeneral of Corvan’s standing would have been delving into the possible\nstrategies Rask might be pursuing. A general with Corvan’s record of\nsuccess would have come up with a dozen already.\nCorvan paused, and if anything, Karris thought he looked pleased. “So\nlittle Karris White Oak is all grown up,” Corvan said. “Joined the\nBlackguard, and now a Chromeria spy.”\n“What are you talking about?” Karris said. She felt like she’d been hit\nin the stomach.\n“The only question is, who wants to kill you, Karris? Not only are you\nmore conspicuous in Tyrea than even I am, what with that fine hair and fair\nskin, but you of all people? They sent you? Here?”\n“Why shouldn’t I be here? I came to research the southern desert reds\n—”\n“Seriously, Karris. Don’t demean us both. At the very least, I’m an\nenemy of your enemy. You’re here for information. I’ll give it, but not if\nyou lie to me. If you go unprepared against these people, you’ll die.”\nHe could have killed her in the church, Karris realized. Or he could\nhave left her and let the fire do it. Corvan did have a sterling reputation,\neven among his enemies, and she needed to know what he knew. She\nsurrendered, lifting her open hands.

Dazen’s armies were a\nmotley bunch. A lot of bad men, and some good ones who’d been\nwronged.”\n“Like you,” Karris interjected sarcastically.\n“This isn’t about me. Point is, a lot of us couldn’t go home. Some went\nto Green Haven; the Aborneans accepted a few small communities, and the\nIlytians claimed to be willing to take anyone, but the only thing anyone got\nfrom them was a clipped ear.”\nKarris shuddered. It was how the Ilytians marked slaves. They heated\nshears red-hot and cut the slave’s left ear nearly in half. The scar tissue kept\nthe ear from ever fusing back together and made it easy to identify who was\na slave.\n“Some of us were more fortunate,” Corvan said. “Our armies raged\nback and forth across this land for a few months, and the people here had no\nreason to love either side. We wiped out whole villages. Those that survived\nhad nothing but young children, old men, and a few women. Most of the\ntowns reviled the soldiers, and where former soldiers tried to stay by force,\nRask’s father, Satrap Perses Garadul, wiped them out. But a few towns\nrealized that if they were ever going to rebuild, they needed men. The\nalcaldesa of Rekton was one of those. She chose two hundred soldiers and\nlet us stay, and she chose well. A few nearby towns did the same. Other\nmen, of course, became bandits, and even Perses Garadul couldn’t hunt all\nof those down.”\n“How did you get to stay?” Karris asked. “As a general, you were\nmore responsible for what happened to this country than most.”\n“My wife was Tyrean. We’d married a few years before the war. She\nwas in Garriston when… when it burned. One of her retainers survived and\nsaved our daughter and brought her to me. So I had a year-old little girl, and\nthe alcaldesa took pity on me. The point is, people around here remember\nthe war a little differently than Gavin’s people do.”\nNot terribly surprising, considering they got the ass-end of the deal.\n“They remember it as a fight over a woman,” Corvan said blandly.\n“That’s—that’s ridiculous!” Karris spluttered. Orholam have mercy.\n“You’re a great favorite of artists here. Not that we have many talented\nones, but the fair-skinned, exotic beauty with fiery hair still inspires artists\ngood and bad to raptures. Even if most men wouldn’t dare believe you were\nthe same woman—you’re usually portrayed in a wedding dress, sometimes\ntorn—Rask doubtless owns paintings by talented artists who’d actually seen\nyou.”\n“It wasn’t like that,” Karris said.\n“But it makes a good story.”\n“A good story?”\n“Good tragic. Good interesting. Not good happy.” Corvan cleared his\nthroat. “I can’t believe you don’t know this.”\n“There are almost no Tyreans on the Jaspers now.

Finally, he said, “So the question is, who would send you to our\nnew King Garadul, knowing that he would surely recognize you, and what\ndid they hope to achieve by delivering you into his hands?”\nThe White. The White betrayed me? Why?\nChapter 34\nIt had been a long morning already. Gavin had woken painfully early to\nreach the coast by the dawn, and then had skimmed as soon as he’d been\nable to draft the sun’s first rays. Then he’d sculled to Cannon Island and\nmade an unpleasant, claustrophobic trip through the escape tunnel, leaving\nhim dirty, sweaty, sore, and deprived of sleep. But there was no other option\nthan to push; not after what the color wight had told him.\nThe tunnel met the Chromeria at a disused storage room in the\nbasement, three levels underground. There was a plain closet set in the back\nof one of the rooms, and a hidden door in the back of that closet. Gavin\ngrabbed a lantern from a hook, twisted the flint, and was gratified to see it\nlight instantly. He released the luxin he’d been holding into two puddles on\nthe floor that quickly dissolved—no need to terrify anyone he ran into—and\nslipped into the closet.\nThe hidden door closed smoothly behind him. He opened the closet\ndoor. A hand’s breadth, then it stopped, blocked. With the light of the\nlantern only cutting through the little crack, he couldn’t see what the\nproblem was. He reached through the crack into the darkness. Polished\nwood greeted his fingertips, smooth and straight, then more, right on top of\nit. Chairs.\nWell, that was the problem of a super-secret door hidden in a disused\nstorage room, wasn’t it? Sometimes people saw a disused storage room and\nthought it should be used to store things.\nSighing, Gavin set down the lamp and braced his shoulder against the\ndoor. He pushed, hard, harder. The door slid another hand’s breadth or two\nas the stacked chairs shifted, then stuck fast. He glanced at the lantern,\ndrafted a green wand, and stuck a blob of red luxin to the end. He lit the red\nwith sub-red and poked his narrow torch through the gap, holding it high.\nHe poked his head through the gap after it.\nThe entire room was packed with furniture, as if half a dozen lecture\nhalls and dining areas had been cleared out and everything put in here. Dear\nOrholam. Gavin swore quietly. The only clearance was down at floor level.\nThe only way out was to crawl between the legs of the chairs and tables.\nThere was nothing for it. Unless Gavin wanted to start a fire, draft\nhuge amounts, and obliterate everything in the room so he could simply\nwalk out—not terribly discreet—he was going to be mopping the floor with\nhis body. Great. He let the luxin torch disintegrate and started crawling.\nTen minutes later, he stood. He didn’t try to brush the dust from his\nclothing. There wasn’t much point. He was muddy with dust, that’s how\nmuch dust there was, along with damp floors and sweat and dust he"

He was muddy with dust, that’s how\nmuch dust there was, along with damp floors and sweat and dust he\nknocked off of the chairs and tables above him. He listened at the door for a\nfull minute, heard nothing.\nStepping into the hall lightly, he closed the door behind himself. He\nextinguished his lantern with a puff; the halls were brightly lit. Even three\nfloors below the sea, the cherry glims (the red-drafting second- to fourth-\nyear students) were expected to keep the lamps fueled with red luxin. The\nstoreroom, wisely, was set almost at the end of one of the long hallways.\nGavin ducked down to the lift at the end, mere paces away.\nThe lifts had to serve the entire Chromeria, which meant they had to be\nserviceable by slaves or the dims, the newest students. So it was entirely\nmechanical. As anyone stepped into the lift, a scale would indicate how\nmany counterweights were needed. If a drafter chose to use less\ncounterweight, she would have to pull herself up the rope, albeit only lifting\na fraction of her own weight. If she used more counterweight than her own\nweight, it could be difficult to stop at the correct floor. A central lift handled\nall the heavier loads and moved entire classes, while these side lifts took\nsmaller loads. Additionally, each lift bay had numerous slots and ropes so\nthat ambassadors wouldn’t have to wait while dozens of dims made their\nway to class.\nGavin grabbed the second to the last rope. Secrecy meant he couldn’t\ntake the last one, though if someone saw and recognized him, they would\nwonder why he wasn’t taking the lift reserved for a man of his rank, so it\nwas probably a wash as to which way was more discreet. He drafted a\nbrake, threw the lever to double his own weight, and kicked the release.\nHe flew upward at great speed. Though he started deep beneath the\nearth, the lifts were brightly lit. At the top of each chute were holes to the\noutside, and mounted there were highly polished mirrors from Atash that\nsent natural light down the chutes for as long as the sun was visible to that\nchute each day. Adjusting the mirrors every few minutes was another fun\njob for the dims, and every evening they would have to crank all the\ncounterweights back into place. Gavin could remember doing that himself.\nAs memories went, it wasn’t a terribly pleasant one.\nThe lift didn’t go all the way to his chamber near the top of the\nChromeria, of course. That would be far too convenient—or, as the\nBlackguards preferred to say, insecure. No reason to give assassins a direct\npath to the Prism or anyone else important. Instead, after whizzing upward\nat high speed halfway up the Chromeria, zipping past students and\nmagisters and servants and slaves so fast that they had no chance to see who\nwas in such a hurry, Gavin threw the brake.\nHe stopped at the top of the chute and stepped out in front of the guard\nstation that protected this floor. There were four men here, guards, not\nBlackguards, all looking up from their dice guiltily. Apparently they hadn’t\nnoticed the whizzing rope until too late. Their mouths hung open at the\nsight of him, Gavin Guile himself, sweaty, dirty, and here."

Their mouths hung open at the\nsight of him, Gavin Guile himself, sweaty, dirty, and here.\n“Tell you what,” Gavin said, tucking the brake into his belt. “You keep\nthis quiet and I will too.” He stared significantly at their dice and the coins\non their table. Guarding the lift at this high a floor had to be boring, but\nLuxlord Black wouldn’t be pleased to learn that his soldiers were gambling\non duty.\nFour heads bobbed as one. Gavin stepped into the next lift, which was\nright next to the one he’d exited, and got in his accustomed position. This\ntime, he chose a more human speed.\nThere were two Blackguards guarding the lift at his level, and these\nmen weren’t dicing. They were barely even blinking. Both had their spears\nin hand, knees lightly bent, spectacles on.\nWhen the Blackguards were on duty, they were on duty.\nThe men snapped salutes and slapped their spears crisply to their\nshoulders, swiveling smoothly back into their spots. Gavin walked past and\nslipped into his room. A bit of superviolet dropped all the shades, giving\nhim light. He pulled a summons chain by his desk and walked over to his\nbathtub. Today was going to involve a lot of diplomacy, but most\nimportantly, it was going to involve his brother, and there was no way he\ncould appear before Dazen disheveled. It might be interpreted as weakness.\nHe opened the tap, tested the water, and heated it with sub-red.\nHe was starting to take off his clothes when the door opened and his\nroom slave Marissia walked in. She’d been captured during the war\nbetween Ruthgar and the Blood Foresters. Like most of her people, she was\nred-haired and freckled, eyes like jade. Karris had Blood Forester blood.\nGavin had never thought it a coincidence that his room slave was a young,\npretty girl from the Blood Forest. The White had hoped, doubtless, to dull\nsome of his appetites that had caused so much trouble before the war. The\ngirl had even been a virgin when she came to serve him ten years ago,\nwhich meant that the Ruthgari who’d captured her had had more of a taste\nfor gold than flesh.\nMarissia helped him strip off his filthy clothes and piled them to take\nthem for laundering. Then Gavin stepped in the bath. “I have messages for\nyou,” she said. “Are you ready to take them?”\nGavin held a hand out, telling her to wait, then sighed as he slipped\ninto the hot water. Messages, demands, barely a minute to think.\n“Call a meeting of the full Spectrum. When do you think is the earliest\npossible, Marissia?”\nMarissia had already loosened the laces of her dress, and now she\npulled it and her shift over her head, folding them right side out next to the\ntub. If there was one skill Marissia hadn’t mastered in her ten years serving\nGavin, it was pretending that the rest of the world ceased to exist when\nthere was the possibility of making love with him. She would bathe with\nGavin, she would make love with Gavin if he wanted to, but she wouldn’t\nlet her hair get wet, and afterward she would pick up her perfectly folded"

Marissia was many\nexcellent things, but “abandoned to the moment” wasn’t one of them.\n“Luxlords Blue and Yellow are over on Big Jasper today,” she said,\npicking up soap and a washcloth. “Yellow has family visiting and is hiding\nout in one of the taverns. Black is working on his ledger and swearing at\nanyone within a league, and Red is likely in the kitchens. So far as I know,\nthe others are in their normal places on Little Jasper.”\nFor as pretty as she was—and how the White had obviously chosen her\nbecause she looked like Karris—the most surprising thing about Marissia\nwas how competent she was. She knew everything, and carried everything\nshe knew right at her fingertips. Gavin had taken great care to win her full\nloyalty, knowing there was no way he could keep his prisoner’s existence\nsecret from his room slave—not forever—and knowing full well that she’d\nbeen sent to spy on him by the White.\nGavin’s options had been simple: to let a succession of room slaves\nparade through his chambers, getting rid of each quickly, hoping that they\ndidn’t have enough time to discover his secret, or win one’s loyalty\ncompletely. Karris didn’t like Marissia, but she ignored her. It would have\nbeen ten times worse if Gavin had a new room slave every month—and\ndoing so would doubtless also have meant that over time he was allowing a\nspy for every noble family to ransack his room and report the most intimate\ndetails about him to all the satrapies.\nBesides, he needed someone to throw bread down the chute when he\nwas gone.\nStill, the White had shown impeccable taste in choosing Marissia.\nThough her body was nearly as familiar as his own after ten years, it was\nstill a joy to see her lean curves. She slid into the tub behind him, holding\nsoap and a washcloth, and began washing his back and shoulders.\n“Tonight, then, after dinner. Let the White know I would like to see her\nin an hour.”\n“Yes, Lord Prism. Is there anything else before I give you the\nmessages?”\n“Go ahead.”\n“Your father wishes to speak with you.”\nGavin gritted his teeth. “He’ll have to wait.” He lifted an arm as\nMarissia scrubbed his armpit.\n“And the White wishes to remind you that you promised to teach that\ncohort of superviolets when you returned.”\n“Oh, hell.” How’d she even know he was back?\n“Would you like me to wash your hair, Lord Prism?”\nGavin wanted nothing more than to enjoy Marissia and then relax in a\nhot bath until evening, but there was something he had to do before he\nspoke with the White, before he met with the whole Spectrum, and\ndefinitely before he spoke with his father.\n“No time,” he said, trying to shut off the rising feeling of panic,\nignoring the tightness in his chest at the prospect of what he had to do.\nShe soaped his chest, her body warm and slippery against his back.\nSoft, comforting. It was almost enough to relax him. She kissed the spot on"

She kissed the spot on\nthe back of his neck that always made him shiver, and trailed her fingernails\ndown his soapy chest, over his stomach, lower. She kissed his neck again,\nhesitated. A question in that pause.\nHe made a plaintive sound. “No, no time for that either.” How well did\nMarissia know him? Often when there was no time for meetings or other\nduties, there was still time for that.\nOften? Almost always.\nShe squeezed him under the water, hesitated for a moment more, as if\nto say, Your lips say no, but someone else says yes, please! But then she\nkissed his neck again, a peck, and began scrubbing the soap off his body.\n“I’ve missed you greatly, Lord Prism,” she said quietly. She finished and\nstepped out of the bath. “I’ll lay your clothes out,” she said, toweling off\nbriefly, then wrapping the towel around her waist, walking to a closet to\nselect clothes for him.\nHe watched her appreciatively, then shook himself.\nI’m not going to be able to lace my pants if I keep this up.\nAfter she laid out his clothes, she came back to the bath as Gavin\nstood, but he waved her off, he could towel himself dry today. Marissia\ndried and dressed herself in about the time it took Gavin to pat his chest dry.\nThen she went out.\nAfter getting dressed, Gavin opened the little service closet, carefully\nlifted the stacked, folded linens from the shelves, and walked them over to\nanother closet where he stacked everything carefully. He then lifted out the\nshelves themselves and slid them into a nook on the other side of the room.\nThe result was an open space in a closet that barely came up to his chest.\nThe process was slow, but the point was that no one ever discover his\nsecret. If someone came while he was gone, the room must simply look\nempty. If they searched the room, they should find nothing that appeared\nout of the ordinary. That was worth extra time and inconvenience.\nGavin drafted a blue-green board fit to his feet, shoulder width, with a\nhole in the center. Then, tucking a mag torch into his belt and clutching the\nboard in one hand, he stooped and stepped into the closet. He closed the\ndoor behind him. The floor beneath his feet clicked. In order to keep it\nsecret, he’d designed the floor not to open unless the door was shut.\nHunched, he found the hook and pulled it up, threaded it through the hole in\nthe board, and wrapped it around his belt. He dropped the board and slid his\nfeet into the slots on it. His design was based on the tower’s lifts, but\nsimplified because he had no one to maintain it, and no space for\ncounterweights. It was basically ropes into the darkness and a pulley at the\ntop.\nNow the terrifying part. Gavin edged the floor open farther—and\ndropped like a stone into the darkness.\nThe pulley whizzed, but its high-pitched protests disappeared within\nmoments as Gavin fell. There was no resistance at all. He fell faster, faster."

He fell faster, faster.\nHe drew the blue mag torch and broke it against his leg. The lift shaft,\nwhich he had cut himself into the Chromeria’s heart, was barely a pace and\na half wide. There was nothing to be seen except smooth cut stone and the\nrope, one side whizzing up and the other side speeding down with Gavin.\nHe reached to the rope brake at his belt, but his movement tilted the\nboard strapped to his feet, making one side touch a wall. The friction\nyanked that side upward, slamming him into the rock on the other side. The\nbrake went tumbling from his fingers—and landed on his board. He\nsnatched for it. Missed. He drew his knees up, his back skidding along the\nsmooth wall, and grabbed the brake.\nAs he stood back up slowly, he grabbed the hook, attached the board to\nthe brake, and threw the brake onto the whizzing lines. He squeezed the\nbrake, all too aware that if he didn’t brake quickly he might hit the bottom\nof the shaft at incredible speed, but if he braked too quickly he could break\neither the board or his own legs.\nHis legs trembling from the strain of trying to remain standing as he\nrapidly decelerated, he passed five broad white lines painted on all walls of\nthe shaft. It was the warning that he was almost to the bottom. A moment\nlater, he passed four broad white lines. Still too fast. Three. Two.\nOkay, not too bad. One.\nHe hit the ground with a surprisingly hard thump. His natural reaction\nwas to try to roll with the impact—which didn’t work well, given that there\nwasn’t any slack in the rope. He flopped over onto his back and rolled on\ntop of the mag torch. It burned through his shirt instantly.\nGavin jumped to his feet with a yelp. Mercifully, the shirt didn’t catch\nfire. He examined the angry red burn on his ribs. Very painful, but not very\nserious. He unhooked himself from the lift.\nThe chamber at the bottom of the lift was only four paces square.\nGavin saw none of it. In the blue light of the mag torch, he walked to one\nblue wall. At his touch, it became translucent, but there was nothing behind\nit. Not yet. Slowly, ever so slowly, the chamber opposite lifted from its\nresting place and spun into position.\nThis was Gavin’s greatest work. He’d constructed it in one furious\nmonth, sinking everything he knew into it. But whenever he called the blue\nchamber forth, his heart seized. And it did so today. The slow speed of the\nblue chamber’s lift and rotation was necessary so that the man inside\nwouldn’t even know he was moving.\nOn the other hand, it gave Gavin five minutes with nothing to do but\nwait. It would be empty today. Dear Orholam. Gavin’s chest tightened. It\nwas hard to breathe. The chamber was too small. There was no air. Breathe,\nGavin, breathe.

Paint that nonchalance on thick.\nFinally, the translucence revealed the smooth globe of the dungeon’s\ninterior. Opposite Gavin stood a man who looked much like himself, though\nthinner, less muscular, dirtier, and with longer hair.\n“Hello, brother,” Gavin said.\nChapter 35\n“Now this,” Ironfist said, “is how you should be introduced to the\nChromeria. High tide and dawn.” He’d arrived before dawn, waking Kip to\nthe bewildered feeling of not knowing if it was morning or night. Kip had\nonly slowly been able to get his bearings as the commander hustled him\nthrough the less-crowded streets, finally cresting this hill. “They call it the\nGlass Lily,” Ironfist said. “A rather softer name than it deserves, but then\nsteel isn’t transparent, is it?”\nAs they crested the hill, on first glance, the Chromeria did look\nsomething like a flower. Six towers in a hexagon surrounded one central\ntower. Because Little Jasper rose in altitude from south to north, the towers\nfarther away from Kip rose higher, though all were the same height from\nbase to tip. And each tower was completely transparent on its south side.\nCompleting the odd flower imagery was the bridge, if it could be called a\nbridge.\nThe bridge crossing the ocean between Big Jasper and Little Jasper\nwas green, like a flower’s stem, heading right to the flaring towers and the\nbulbous walls that actually hung past vertical. But not only was the bridge\ngreen, it wasn’t supported by anything. It lay at the surface of the water. It\nwasn’t floating, because it didn’t move with the waves, and the sea was\nchoppy on one side of it and much calmer on the other.\n“Why green?” Kip asked, trying to kick his brain into working. Wasn’t\ngreen flexible?\n“It’s blue reinforced with yellow. It only looks green,” Ironfist said,\nresuming his walk toward the bridge. Kip hurried to keep up, having\ndifficulty gawking and walking at the same time, all tiredness fled.\n“Yellow?” Kip asked. “How does that work? The Pr—erm, my uncle\nhasn’t told me anything about yellow.”\nIronfist looked at Kip, his gaze heavy as a sledge. He didn’t answer,\nnot even when Kip shut up and walked quietly alongside him, looking\nexpectantly up at the big man but not bothering him.\nFinally, Ironfist glanced at Kip. “Do I look like a magister to you?”\n“Just figured that you’re not much good as a fighter without your blue\nspectacles,” Kip said. Stop, you moron! Don’t—“So we might as well put\nyou to some use.”\nThe Blackguard commander’s head snapped toward Kip. Kip\nswallowed. You deserve the crushed skull you’re about to get, Kip. You’re\nbegging for it.\nThen a small, unwilling smile crept over the commander’s face. He\nguffawed. “When Orholam hands out the brains, the folks at the front of\nthat line have to go to the back of the common sense line, huh?”"

The perverse little grin on his\nface told Kip that he knew Kip was waiting for an answer and was only\nholding his tongue because he didn’t want to start another topic. But Ironfist\nwasn’t going to give him the pleasure of winning an answer. Pudgy force,\nmeet immovable mass.\nWithin minutes, though, they had made their way onto the Lily’s Stem\n—or rather, into it—and Kip forgot whatever it was that he had asked. The\nbridge was fully enclosed, albeit with blue luxin so thin it was almost as\ncolorless as glass. But beneath their feet, the bridge actually glowed. Kip\nshot a look at Ironfist.\n“No matter how often you look at me, I’m still not going to be a\nmagister,” the big man said.\n“How about a guide?”\n“Nope.”\n“A polite host?”\n“Uh-uh.”\nA jackass? Kip’s mouth actually opened to say it when he noticed\nagain how thickly muscular Ironfist’s arms were. He closed his open mouth\nand scowled.\n“You were going to say something?” Ironfist asked.\n“Your name,” Kip said. “Is that common, among Parians?”\n“Ironfist? Far as I know, I’m the only one.”\n“That isn’t what I—” Oh, he was teasing.\nIronfist smirked. “You mean to take a name that describes us? Very\ncommon. Some use our old tongue, but the coastal folk—my people—use\nwords that outsiders can understand. But the Ilytians do it too. To a lesser\nextent, the whole Chromeria does it. Gavin Guile is almost never called\nEmperor Guile or Prism Guile. He’s just the Prism. Orea Pullawr is just the\nWhite. A lot of people think that meaningless names are the true puzzle.”\n“Meaningless names. You mean like Kip?”\nIronfist cocked an eyebrow. Shrugged.\nThanks a lot.\nThe crowds heading to Little Jasper for the day didn’t even seem to\nnotice the wonder beneath their feet. The bridge was perhaps twenty paces\nwide and three hundred long from shore to shore. The surface was lightly\ntextured, but that barely interfered with its transparency, aside from some\ndirt. Kip could see the water right under his feet, not even a foot away,\nswelling up with every wave and gapping in between them. They were on\nthe side of the bridge with heavy seas, too—apparently here traffic traveled\non the right, unlike at home, so waves crashed into the luxin right next to\nKip. After having been pulled in and pounded by those same waves, it made\nhim more than a little nervous. No one else seemed to even notice it.\nThen, at about the time Kip and Ironfist reached the middle of the\nbridge, Kip saw a monster wave coming in.

It’s a good little reminder of whom they’re\ndealing with.”\nLittle reminder?\nThe next wave crashed over the bridge as well, and soon even the\nwave troughs were higher than the bottom of the bridge. By the time Kip\nand Ironfist stepped off the bridge, it was half submerged in the sea.\nUnbelievable. Kip hadn’t grown up on the sea, but even he knew that the\ntide coming in so hard and high and fast was unusual. It made him wonder\nif there was some magic to that too. And through it all, the bridge didn’t\neven shudder. Some reminder.\nThe bridge curved up before it spilled them onto the shore, of course,\nbut when it did, Kip was finally able to start paying attention to the\nChromeria.\nThe first two towers, to the right and left as one stepped onto Little\nJasper, were set narrower than the back two towers, either to help\nstrengthen the wall near the huge gate where it was most likely to be\nattacked or—\nOh. It’s all about the light.\nAs soon as Kip realized that, everything else made sense. Everything\nabout the Chromeria was designed to maximize exposure to sunlight.\nBuilding on a slope meant that more sun could reach the lower levels of the\nnortherly towers and the yard. Having the first two towers of the hexagon\nset narrower meant that they didn’t cast shadows on the back towers. The\n“glass” northern walls and the north sides of each of the towers meant that\nevery north-facing room got as much sunlight as they could use, while the\nsouthern rooms had opaque walls more amenable to privacy and comfort.\nKip imagined that those with a stifling fear of heights might not do well in\nsome of the Chromeria’s rooms—minimizing its footprint, and adding to\nthe flaring lily shape, all the towers except the central one leaned out. It was\nno accident either; despite the lean, the floors were all level. Perhaps it was\nthat the Chromeria needed more space than was available on the island, so\nthe only way to have more space was to make the towers extend beyond the\nisland.

        "text": "the only way to have more space was to make the towers extend beyond the\nisland. Perhaps it was simply because they could.\nEither for support or convenience, there was a lattice of translucent\nwalkways between each tower and its adjacent ones. Encircling the central\ntower, halfway up, a clear walkway connected to the tower at two points\nand then radiated out to each of the other towers in turn. Kip could see that\nthose enclosed walkways were filled with people making their way between\ntowers. Doubtless it was much faster if you had business high in each tower\nto be able to travel directly rather than walk all the way down the stairs,\ncross the central yard, and then climb all the way back up. But the visual\neffect remained. The air around the central tower, like a flower’s style, was\nkept uncluttered, prominent.\n“Each color has its own tower,” Ironfist said.\n“Thought you weren’t a guide,” Kip said before he could stop himself.\nHe blinked. If he didn’t dislike pain so much, he would have physically bit\nhis tongue to give himself a reminder.\nIronfist simply looked at him.\n“Sorry,” Kip squeaked. He cleared his throat and said, deeper, “I mean,\nsorry.”\nIronfist still looked at him flatly.\n“Let me guess,” Kip said, squirming, wanting to deflect Ironfist’s\nintense gaze. He pointed to the tower to the left of the gate they were\napproaching, then in a sunwise circle. “Sub-red, red, orange, yellow, green,\nand blue.” Blue was the last one, just to the right of the gate.\n“Good guess,” Ironfist said reluctantly.\n“So why do the superviolets get bent over the fence?” Kip asked.\n“Excuse me?” Ironfist’s voice pitched higher.\n“You know,” Kip said. What?\nIronfist’s right eyebrow climbed.\n“Like for a whipping.”\n“That expression doesn’t mean what you think it means,” Ironfist said.\nKip opened his mouth to ask what it did mean then, but could tell the\ncommander wasn’t going to tell him.\n“There are never enough superviolets to fill an entire tower, and\nsuperviolets can draft best if they are higher up. The quality of light there is\nbetter for their work, plus a good majority of their work is directly for the\nWhite. So they inhabit the Prism’s Tower, close to the top.”\nThey walked to the great gates with hundreds of other people who\nwere coming, to work or conduct business. The gates were covered with\nbeaten gold, but were open, so Kip only caught a glimpse of the scene and\nfigures depicted on them. The walls, however, were a wonder themselves. It\nbecame obvious that blue luxin was their main element, but the luxin itself\ncould be lighter or darker, and it apparently had to be mixed with yellow.\nFor strength? That had to be it, given that the entire bridge was made of that\nmix. But each wall of the hexagon was different. There were patterns of\nblue and yellow and green throughout, and that wasn’t even including the\ntowers. While the north side of each tower was as close to perfectly\ntransparent as possible for maximum sun exposure, the rest was constructed"

While the north side of each tower was as close to perfectly\ntransparent as possible for maximum sun exposure, the rest was constructed\nto mark the buildings for their owners, so that even the untrained could tell\nwhich building belonged to whom. And, apparently, to show off.\nEvery surface of the blue tower was cut like a giant sapphire so that\nthe entire tower gleamed off a thousand surfaces no matter what angle you\nsaw it from. The sub-red tower, over its base of interwoven blue and yellow\nand green, seemed to burn. Illusory flames licked up the luxin for ten and\ntwenty feet and occasionally threw sparks and flames even higher. All the\nrest of the tower seemed to ripple, like the air over a fire.\nKip stumbled as they entered the central yard. He looked at his feet.\nGreat grooves cut the ground in a broad arc, connecting the gates. But the\ngates Kip had passed didn’t slide shut, they just shut on hinges, like normal\ndoors. He looked at Ironfist, confused.\n“Glass flower,” Ironfist said.\n“Huh?”\n“What do flowers do?”\nLook pretty? “Uh…”\nIronfist looked pleased to have stumped him. “With regards to the\nsun.”\n“They open?”\n“And how would that work with a group of buildings?”\nKip thought about it, and gave up.\n“It wouldn’t,” Ironfist said.\n“Oh. Then…”\n“Try again.”\n“Do you ever answer questions straight?” Kip asked.\n“Only to my superiors.” Which was, Kip realized, a straight answer.\nHe wrinkled his nose, too intimidated by Ironfist to point that out, but the\ntwitch at the corner of the big man’s mouth told him he knew. “Flowers\nfollow the sun from morning to night,” Ironfist said, perhaps by way of\napology.\nKip looked at the tracks again as he and Ironfist approached the central\nbuilding. Before the road came to the gate, it flared wide—so wide that\nmost of it simply abutted the wall in a wide crescent. “You mean the whole\nthing turns?” It was the only thing that made sense, Kip realized. If the\nbuildings were all transparent on the north side, they would only take full\nadvantage of the sunlight in the middle of the day, but if the whole\ncompound turned, they would get maximum light from dawn until dusk.\nBut all of it? Impossible!\n“Here we are,” Ironfist said.\nKip swiveled his head back to the front as they stopped in front of a\nhuge silvery gate. It was as plain as everything else here was ornate.\nTwo guards on either side of the gate, dressed in full mirror armor,\neach wearing a sword and holding a matchlock musket nearly as tall as he\nwas. “Commander Ironfist,” they said in greeting.\n“Finally,” Ironfist said, pushing Kip inside. “You are about to meet the\nThresher.”\nChapter 36\nMeetings with Dazen were always a practice in deception.\nGavin’s tightened chest didn’t ease at the sight of his brother.

        "text": "Chapter 36\nMeetings with Dazen were always a practice in deception.\nGavin’s tightened chest didn’t ease at the sight of his brother. He\nshould have killed him years ago. How simple that would have been. How\nsimple it still could be. All he needed to do was stop dropping bread down\nthe chute. Just like that, his problem would go away. He thought of it every\nmorning, after every sleepless night. But this was his brother. He hadn’t\nkilled him in the heat of battle, how could he kill him in cold blood?\nSeven years, seven purposes.\nThree times now, he’d put “Tell Karris Everything” on the list. Not just\nabout loving her. About this. That Dazen wasn’t dead, that he was here.\nThat so much was built on lies. She deserved to know; she could never\nknow. Because if she knew, it might bring them reconciliation and\nhappiness together—or it might bring a new war to consume the Seven\nSatrapies.\n“Hello, brother,” Gavin said again. The air was cool on his skin, the\nscent of resin and stone inescapable. He braced himself for the response.\nHis brother, after all, was a Guile too. And unlike Gavin, he had nothing\nelse to think of except what he would say to Gavin the next time he came to\nvisit. That, of course, and plot to escape. After sixteen years, most men\nwould have given up, but not a Guile. That was their legacy: absolute,\nunreasoning faith in their supremacy over other men. Thank you, father.\n“What do you want?” Dazen asked, his voice rough from disuse.\n“Did you know that during the war, I fathered a bastard? I just found\nout about a month ago. As big of a surprise to me as to anyone, but all sorts\nof things happen during war, don’t they? Karris was furious, of course. She\nwouldn’t share my bed for three weeks, but, well… making up with Karris\nhas always been so good that I almost want to fight with her.” He looked up\nand left and smiled for an instant, as if at a private memory.\nIt was important to layer the lies with a Guile. In Gavin’s narrative to\nhis brother over the years, he had established an alternate life. He and\nKarris were married, but had no children—a nagging heartache, and a\nsource of conflict with Andross Guile, who wanted Gavin to put Karris\naside and find a woman who could produce heirs. He leaked those details\nslowly, grudgingly, making his brother work to uncover them. Then, every\ntime, Gavin could leak more information to see if his brother looked either\nconfused by the lies or contemptuous of them.\nDazen had a nasty smile on his face. “So who was it? Do you even\nknow her name? Did she have proof?”\nHe was fishing, hoping Gavin would give him something for nothing.\nAnd he would suspect Gavin if Gavin gave it to him. But Gavin went\nahead. “His face is proof enough. He’s the very image of Sevastian.”\nDazen’s face paled. “Don’t you bring Sevastian into your lies, you\nmonster, don’t you dare.”\n“We’ve adopted the boy. His name is Kip. Good kid. Smart. Talented."

He might not believe it, but\nhe was close. “Who’s the mother?”\nGavin shrugged, as if it didn’t matter. “Lina.”\n“You lie!” Dazen snarled and slapped a hand against the blue luxin\nseparating them. “Karris would never take that harlot’s bastard!” It was real\nfury, after sixteen years bathing in placid blue light, something deep and hot\nand too instant to be false.\nWhich told Gavin three things. But some purposes are best achieved\nby misdirection. “She had a rosewood box,” he said, “about this long. Do\nyou know what was in it?”\nThe expression on Dazen’s face told Gavin he’d made a mistake. Head\npulled back, stunned, then confusion, hope, and finally laughter. There was\ngenuine joy. Dazen kept laughing, shaking his head, prolonging the laugh,\nnow, rubbing it in. He leaned against the blue luxin between them, but\nnaturally, confident. “Here’s what bothers me more than everything else,”\nDazen said. “More than your betrayal. More than your murders. More than\nthe cruelty of imprisoning me rather than just killing me. More than you\nstealing Karris. More than all the rest of it together. How is it that no one\nhas noticed?”\n“We’re not doing this again, dead man,” Gavin said. “You don’t want\nto trade, fine. I’ll be going.”\n“This is my trade. Let me hear you say it, and I’ll tell you all about the\ndagger.”\nDagger? Dazen had dropped that tidbit deliberately. Oh, shit. Gavin\nhad overlooked something. His chest tightened, throat clamped shut. It was\nhard to breathe, harder still to keep his face smooth.\nThere was no one here. No one who could overhear if he said it aloud.\nIt wasn’t new information. If he could get new information for old, it wasn’t\na loss. But it felt like one.\nGavin moistened his lips. “My name is Dazen Guile, and I stole your\nlife.”\n“How’d you do it, Dazen? How did no one notice?”\nI took your clothes and strode out of the flames at Sundered Rock. My\nface was swollen from our fight. I’d already given myself your scar and cut\nmy hair like yours. I just started giving orders, and your people became\nmine. “I just acted like a selfish asshole, and everyone assumed I was you,”\nhe said, feigning nonchalance.\nThe prisoner laughed, ignoring the last part. “Well, it’s a beginning.\nFeels good, doesn’t it? They say confession is good for the soul.”\nDazen—Gavin!—snarled, “Now… about that dagger.”\n“It’s my vengeance, little brother,” the prisoner said. “It is the sweet\nsong of victory,” the prisoner said. “It is the sting in the night. Dryness in\nyour bones. Sleeplessness and terrors. It is your death and my freedom,\nDazen. It is the end of all your lies.”"

        "text": "your bones. Sleeplessness and terrors. It is your death and my freedom,\nDazen. It is the end of all your lies.”\n“And apparently I’ve only heard the beginning of yours,” Gavin said,\nsneering. His brother was lying. Had to be. He was just trying to make\nGavin worry. He was chained, not witless. Confined, not toothless.\nThe real Gavin laughed. “No, you see, the beauty of it is that I don’t\nhave to lie. What are you going to do, little brother? You don’t have the\nspine to starve me. No, you’ll just watch it coming. Death will draw his\nsword and you will stand and do nothing. It’s always been your way.” He\nlaughed again. “I have nothing more to say to you. Begone.”\nDazen trembled. Every word his brother said touched some deeper\nwell. The time Karris’s elder brother Rodin had sworn to beat Dazen, and\nDazen had stood still, waiting, not really believing Rodin would do it until\nit was too late. The terrible dreams Dazen had had as a child, and for which\nthe elder Gavin had mocked him. Even being dismissed, as Dazen had\nalways hated. Orholam damn him, Gavin had always known the cracks in\nhis armor. Dazen shook his head.\nNo, he was Gavin now. The mask had to be total, even in his own\nthoughts. At all times. Dazen was another life. “Dazen” was the wretch on\nthe other side of the luxin now. Dazen was the weak bastard trying to anger\nhim so that Gavin would kill him. That’s all this was. The prisoner was\nterrified, weak. He was a shell. He was trying to provoke Gavin to kill him\nbecause he couldn’t summon the courage to suicide. That was all.\nThe man Gavin had once been would have killed the prisoner and been\ndone with it. In the war, Dazen had become ruthless. Dazen loved the clash\nof arms, the splash of blood. Dazen loved his mastery over other men.\nDazen would crush those who rose against him. Now, as Gavin, he\nwouldn’t be pulled back to that. He wouldn’t give his brother the\nsatisfaction. “Well,” Gavin said. “It was a pleasure as always, but it’s\ngetting late”—of course, it was barely noon, but he liked making the real\nGavin wonder just how disoriented he was down here—“and Karris is eager\ntonight. She made me promise not to keep her waiting.” That’s for cheating\non her and leaving me with the mess, you bastard. “So a good evening to\nyou, Dazen.”\nThe prisoner said, “Your lies are failing already, Dazen. You just keep\nwondering who already knows, and how they’re plotting against you. Sweet\ndreams.”\n“There are worse things than waking from a nightmare to find yourself\nin the arms of the woman you love. Say, waking in a cell. Sweet dreams to\nyou too, brother.” Gavin touched the glass and it went dark, and once more\nthe cell began its slow, slow rotation into the earth.\nGavin leaned against the cold wall, trying to calm his racing heart.

It\nwasn’t a loss; he’d learned some things from his brother. First, he had\nindeed been cheating on Karris. Kip was Gavin’s bastard. Second, Gavin\nhad known Kip’s mother—and she wasn’t a prostitute. If she had been, he\nwould have said, “Karris would never take a harlot’s bastard.” Instead, he’d\nsaid, “That harlot’s bastard,” which meant he intended the word as a slur,\nnot a description. Third—unless he was far, far smarter than Gavin gave\nhim credit for, which was possible—the real Gavin still wasn’t getting\ninformation from the outside.\nThat was why Gavin had put all of this lies all in the past tense: Kip’s\ndiscovery. A month of not sharing a bed with Karris, decisions already\nmade about raising Kip. If someone were passing him news, the prisoner\nwould be confused by the chronological disparity—which, because it didn’t\nseem to serve a purpose, he wouldn’t expect to be a lie. Gavin didn’t expect\nhis brother to voice his confusion, of course, but he was hoping to see it in\nhis eyes. There had been none.\nSo Dazen wasn’t getting information from the outside, which meant he\nwasn’t plotting with this “Color Prince,” whoever the hell that was. So the\nColor Prince was merely using a retelling of the Prisms’ War to agitate\ndissent. All the world believed Gavin had won, and the Color Prince didn’t\nlike how things had turned out, so he was pretending to be in league with\nthe losing brother—whom he had no idea was actually alive. This Color\nPrince was a liar and an opportunist then, not a zealot who knew the truth.\nWhich meant there was only one place the Color Prince could be:\nTyrea. Either King Garadul was the Color Prince himself, or the two were\nconnected.\nThank you, brother. Very helpful. And you used to be better at lying\nthan I was.\nBut after the prison finally settled into place, he checked and double-\nchecked all his chromaturgy. Nothing was out of place. And yet, even as he\nascended up the shaft and out of the evernight he’d created down here for\nhis brother, he trembled. He was as trapped as Gavin was.\nI could just stop feeding him. I wouldn’t even have to do anything. I\ncould just take a vacation, tell Marissia not to drop the dyed bread down the\nchute while I’m gone. He’d simply… die.\nHe remembered when they’d been children and Dazen had climbed the\nlemon tree to prove he could do everything his older brother could—and\nfallen. They thought he’d broken his ankle. Gavin had carried him all the\nway home. A small thing, for an adult, but Gavin had been reduced to tears\nby the effort. But he refused to give up. His little brother had never\nforgotten it.\nAnd now the little brother is going to kill that man in cold blood,\nwithout even having the courage to face him as he did it?\nEnough.

There’s a class waiting for you. A class you promised me you’d\nteach.” Her nose twitched. “Did you burn something in here?”\n“Um, yes?” Gavin said. It came out as a question. Damn it.\n“ ‘Um, yes?’ ”\nGavin cleared his throat. “Yes.”\nShe waited.\nHe said nothing more.\n“Very well, then. Be like that. I thought you left to take care of that\ncolor wight.”\nAh, she was angry because she thought he’d neglected a mission\nwhose abandonment might mean people dying. And she would have been\nsure, it being a blue, that he would go immediately. And she didn’t know\nwhy he’d summoned the Spectrum. The White didn’t like to be left in the\ndark. “Consider it taken care of,” Gavin said. Which she would interpret to\nbe him blowing her off, but he didn’t know how to not tell her about the\nskimmer if he was fully honest.\nAfter showing it to the boy and Karris, it was a secret he couldn’t\nexpect to keep much longer, but that would be a big conversation, and he\nwasn’t ready for it yet.\nShe lifted her eyebrows, like, You’re going to be dismissive, to me?\nA thought hit him. “The class is superviolets?”\nThe White nodded, suspicious.\n“There’s a girl from Tyrea in that class, isn’t there? Alivia?”\n“Aliviana Danavis, from Rekton.”\nSo he’d remembered correctly. A girl from Kip’s town. Perfect.\nHe hesitated. Kip had said Corvan was there, but…“No relation,\nsurely?”\n“Actually, she’s General Danavis’s daughter.”\nGavin let the shock show as dull surprise, like he’d just heard about\nsome minor tragedy on the other side of the world.

It’s a holy responsibility.” Juggling,\nalways juggling.\n“I always distrust you when you get dutiful,” the White said.\nHe smiled, blandly innocent.\nChapter 37\nIt seemed to Kip that the entire first floor of the Prism’s Tower was a jungle\nof benches, desks, signs, queues, and clerks. Obviously, the whole business\nof the Chromeria passed through this room. There were queues for traders\nseeking contracts for food, queues for traders delivering contracted food,\nthe same for every other trade good Kip could imagine, queues for redress\nof grievances caused by Chromeria residents, queues for laborers seeking\nwork, queues for adjudicating fee disputes on Big Jasper. There were even\nqueues for nobles—although there were many more clerks staffing that one\nthan any of the others. The room had a busy hum, but despite the crowd, it\nwas obvious that the Chromeria ran like a well-oiled mill. The people were\nimpatient but not angry, bored but not surly.\nCommander Ironfist led Kip to a desk with a single clerk, and no\nqueue at all. “All the rest of this year’s darks were admitted weeks ago.”\n“Darks?” Kip asked.\n“That’s what people like you are called. Unofficially. Supplicants,\nofficially: you want to be part of the Chromeria, but you aren’t yet. So\nyou’re a dark. Darks, dims, glims, gleams, beams. But you don’t need to\nremember any of that right now.”\nKip opened his mouth, shut it. Ironfist said nothing until they reached\nthe desk. The clerk, obviously daydreaming, sat bolt upright when he\nnoticed Commander Ironfist.\n“Yes, Commander? How may I assist you?”\n“I have a supplicant for immediate testing.”\n“Immediate as in…”\n“Now.”\nThe clerk’s throat bobbed. “Yes, Commander. Supplicant’s name?”\n“Kip. Kip Guile,” Ironfist said.\nThe clerk grabbed his quill, began writing, got halfway, froze. “Guile\nas in…?”\n“As in, no one needs to hear it from you. Is that a problem?” Ironfist\nasked.\n“No, sir. I’ll just go talk to my superiors. You could go ahead up to the\ntesting room. I’m sure the testers will be along presently.” With a quick bob\nof his head, the clerk got up and ran to a back office.\n“I understand the rest, but what’s a glim?” Kip ask as they climbed the\nstairs together. He trod on his sagging pant leg, which had fallen lower as\nhe climbed the stairs, and he almost pitched forward on his face. He cleared\nhis throat and hiked up his pants. Life would be so much easier if he had a\nwaist.\n“A glimmer,” Ironfist said."

Got it?”\nKip almost said yes, then nodded instead. This might be harder than he\nhad thought. Ironfist gestured to the door, and Kip walked in. Ironfist closed\nthe door behind him.\nThe room was utterly plain. One wall curved slightly inward, so Kip\nguessed that was the outer wall of the tower. Other than that irregularity, the\nroom was a square, ten paces wide, all white stone with a single wood table\nand a single wood chair. The room was lit by a strange white crystal set into\nthe wall, the same kind Kip had seen in all the halls and even, now that he\nthought of it, in the great room downstairs with all the queues. Kip flopped\ninto the chair. It had been an exhausting week. Had it only been yesterday\nthat he’d been skimming across the waves, that he’d tried to drown, tried to\nsail? Had it only been a few days since… No, Kip wasn’t going to think\nabout that. Too jagged. Too heavy. He’d be blubbering again if he wasn’t\ncareful.\nHe’d been waiting for several hours when he heard the muffled\nexchange of angry words from the hall. That was definitely Ironfist, laying\ninto somebody. Kip swallowed hard. He wanted to get up and eavesdrop,\nbut he knew that with his luck as soon as he got to the door it would open.\nWhatever the argument had been about, it was over as quickly as it\nbegan. The door didn’t open. Kip waited. And waited. He was just starting\nto get tired, eyes drooping, when the door popped open.\nA man of perhaps thirty, wearing red spectacles hung from a red cord\naround his neck, came in. He was clearly furious. Apparently not the winner\nof the argument, then. “Darks will stand!” he snarled.\nKip shot to his feet. His chair skittered back, caught its legs, and went\ncrashing to the floor. Kip flinched, smiled weakly in apology, and picked up\nthe chair.\nThe man continued staring at him, his mouth a tight white line. He had\na large hooked nose and the deep olive skin of an Atashian, though he was\nbeardless, but it was the eyes that captured Kip’s attention. The brown eyes\nwere interrupted by a hard circle of royal red in the middle of the iris.\nScarlet streaks like sunbeams pierced the rest of the brown irises. Kip put\nthe chair back as he’d found it, looked back to the man, and got nothing, no\nhint of what he expected.\nKip moved away from the chair. The man stared liquid hatred at him.\n“Sorry,” Kip mumbled, defensive.\n“Darks will not speak! Ignorant Tyrean trash.”\n“Oh, kiss my blubbery butt cheeks,” Kip said. Oops."

Oops.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut to curse himself, so he didn’t even see the\nblow coming. The fist cracked across his jaw, and the next thing he knew,\nhe was on the ground, drooling blood.\nKip was slow to anger. Usually. But he popped up to his feet almost as\nfast as he’d fallen, and the rage was there, everywhere. Everyone he knew\nwas dead. Everything he cared about was gone. He didn’t care if the drafter\ntore him apart.\nBut as he bounced to his feet, he saw the light in the drafter’s eyes. Do\nit! the man’s eyes said. Give me the excuse. I will bounce you out of the\nChromeria before you know what hit you.\nAnd like that, Kip’s anger dropped into a more familiar channel, and\nhe had control again. There was a footstep in the hall. “Good,” Kip said.\n“We’ve got something to build on there. A little clumsy for a kiss, but I\nunderstand your eagerness. I’m sure with that ugly face you don’t get much\npractice. But I said kiss my butt cheeks. Butt cheeks. Butt cheeks, cheeks.”\nHe gestured. “They’re different. Try again, this time with feeling.”\nThe drafter’s face went from incredulity to rage. He stepped forward\nand—just as the door opened—buried his fist in Kip’s stomach. The drafter\nwas distracted by the opening door and didn’t put his full weight into the\nblow, but Kip doubled up as if it were the hardest blow he’d ever taken. He\ncrumpled and coughed blood, retching.\n“Magister Galden, what in Orholam’s name is going on here?”\nThe drafter who’d hit Kip said, “I—I—He defied me!”\n“So you struck him? Like the benighted do? Get out. Get out now! I’ll\ndeal with you later.”\nMagister Galden turned and stood over Kip. “I’ll remember this, and\nI’ll find you someday when there’s—”\n“So help me Orholam, if you threaten a student in my presence for\nyour own malfeasance, Jens Galden, I will strip you of your colors and put\nyou off Little Jasper this very hour. Test me. Please.”\nMagister Galden looked absolutely stricken. Like his life was falling\napart without warning.\nThat embarrassment and pain could be turned to rage, oh so easily.\nSometimes Kip frightened himself. Magister Jens Galden was standing\nbetween him and the man who’d come in the door. Kip couldn’t see the\nman, and that man couldn’t see Kip. All he had to do was give Jens Galden\na big, triumphant smile and leave his stomach open. The magister would\nlose control—Kip knew all about losing control—and kick him. Kip would\nleave his stomach open, inviting it. Jens would kick him, and lose\neverything.\nAnd for what, Kip? For having a temper and being an asshole? Kip\nhesitated. The man had made him furious, but that was too much."

The man had made him furious, but that was too much.\nBut if Kip didn’t smile, he’d have an enemy. An enemy he could\ndestroy right now.\nWherever that thought was going, he didn’t get time to follow it. The\nmoment passed. Jens Galden snarled and wheeled out of the room. Kip was\nleft on the floor, the inside of his lips still lacerated, bleeding and painful.\nHe’d done what was right; maybe he should have done what was smart.\nHe picked himself up. The man who’d saved him was just poking his\nhead out the door after Magister Galden. He said, “Arien, I need you to\nconduct the testing.”\nA woman said, “Luxlord, I’m not a tester.”\n“And I don’t want to wait while a new one is summoned!” he said\nsharply. “I’m supposed to meet with the Prism in half an hour. We need to\nget started now.”\nThe luxlord came back into the room. He was a tall man, wearing\nIlytian hose and doublet though his skin was olive like Jens Galden’s rather\nthan deep black. He was balding; his fringe of dark, wavy hair was streaked\nwith white and brushed out long, halfway down his back. He was\nsomewhere in his fifties, fit, and wearing a heavy black woolen cloak\nembroidered with gold thread in intricate lattice. His fingers were burdened\nwith wide gold rings and jewels of every color of the spectrum, oddly worn\nbetween the knuckles in the middle of his fingers rather than closest to his\nhand. But Kip was learning to look at people’s eyes—and the odd thing\nabout the luxlord’s eyes was perhaps that they were normal. They were\ngreen; there was no foreign color shot through those eyes.\nThe luxlord smiled. “No,” he said, “I’m not a drafter. The Black\nusually isn’t. My name is Carver Black. Luxlord Black, for most purposes.”\nThe name didn’t sound Atashian, so maybe he was Ilytian, but Kip guessed\nthe man could just as easily have grown up here or anywhere. Obviously,\nthere was a lot of trade and movement among certain nations. Just not\nTyrea.\nKip moved to speak, stopped, pointed to his lips.\n“Yes,” the luxlord said. “You can speak. We’ll begin momentarily, as\nsoon as Arien is ready.”\n“Um, nice to meet you, Luxlord Black. I’m Kip.”\n“And you, Magister?” Luxlord Black asked. “Are you ready?”\n“Yes, Luxlord,” she said. She sat at the chair, and the Black stood\nbeside the table. Kip came to stand in front of the table himself.\nMagister Arien was short and skinny, nervous around the Black, but\nhappy and cute. She looked up at Kip like she wanted him to succeed. He\ntried not to let her orange eyes disturb him. “Supplicant,” she said, “I’m\ngoing to lay out a series of colored tiles, from one tone to another. You will\narrange the tiles in order.” She smiled suddenly. “We’ll start easy.”"

You will\narrange the tiles in order.” She smiled suddenly. “We’ll start easy.”\nWith that, she opened a bag in her lap, rummaged through the tiles for\na bit, and extracted a black tile and a white tile. These she laid at the edges\nof the table. Then she laid a dozen tiles in various shades of gray in\nbetween. Kip quickly moved them into place from lightest to darkest.\nArien said nothing, simply checked the backs of the tiles, made marks\non a parchment, and swept the tiles off the table and back into the bag. Then\nshe laid out brown tiles, from a tumbleweed to sepia. This was harder, but\nKip swapped tiles quickly once more.\nThe test was repeated with blues, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds.\nWhen Kip got the reds perfect, Arien pulled out a black bag, checked the\nbacks of the tiles carefully—shielding them from Kip’s eyes with a hand as\nshe did so—and lined up another series of reds, except this group had twice\nas many tiles, so the gradations of color were much much finer. Scarlets,\nvermilions, strawberry, raspberry, cerise. Kip lined them up and only had\ntrouble with one. The color at the edge of that tile was slightly darker than\nthe color on its face. Finally he put it in its spot by the color on its face.\nShe flipped the tiles over, and Kip saw that he’d put tile fourteen\nbetween tiles nine and ten. Arien winked at him apologetically, as if he’d\ndone better than she expected, despite failing.\n“That’s not right,” Kip said.\n“Silence!” Luxlord Black said. “I know you don’t know our ways,\nsupplicant, but you will not speak during the testing.”\n“But it’s wrong,” Kip said.\n“I’m warning you.”\nKip raised his hands in silent protest.\nLuxlord Black sighed. “Magister?” he asked. “Usually protests have to\nbe lodged after the test results are finalized, but apparently nothing is going\nto go according to custom today. A judgment, please?”\nArien flipped the tiles back over as Kip had had them lined up. She\ncleared her throat awkwardly. “Luxlord, I’m sorry, I’m not a superchromat.\nI tried to tell you. I can’t tell the difference myself. The key says that the—”\n“The key is being challenged.” Luxlord Black scratched an eye with\none finger. “Half of women superchromats, and I choose… Never you\nmind. Go get a superchromat, Magister.”\n“Yes, Luxlord,” she said meekly.\nShe left and the luxlord turned his green eyes to Kip. “Who are you,\nreally? Why are you testing today? Why the special treatment? Where are\nyou from?”\n“I’m from Tyrea, sir. King Garadul wiped out my—”\n“King? What’s this about?”\nThe door opened and Magister Arien came in, followed by a woman\nwho looked like a scarecrow.

He shot a look at Arien.\n“She was just in the hall; she asked what I was doing,” Arien said\ndefensively.\n“Nearly bowled me over. What’s this challenge?” the old woman\nasked. The tiles were lying face up the way Kip had left them. “How did the\nsupplicant order them?”\nSilence. The mistress looked from Luxlord Black to Magister Arien.\n“That is the way he ordered them,” Arien said.\n“So he’s a freak to his gender. Are we done?”\n“The key says it should be like this,” Magister Arien said. She turned\nthe tiles over and pointed to the numbers on the back.\n“You come to me to differentiate the finest red chroma and you think I\ncan’t read?” Mistress Varidos asked sharply.\nMagister Arien looked horrified. Her mouth opened and shut.\nThe old scarecrow picked up tile fourteen in her bony claws. She\nturned it and looked at the edges. “Strip your tester of her position,” she\nsaid. “This tile has been left in the sunlight. It’s been bleached. It’s the\nwrong color. The boy’s a superchromat.” She turned to Kip.\n“Congratulations, freak.”\n“Freak?” Kip said.\n“Simple, is he? Too bad.”\n“What?” Kip asked. He still hadn’t figured out what everyone’s titles\nmeant, much less what he was supposed to do with all of this.\n“Kip, you’re forbidden to speak!” Magister Arien said.\n“That’s an injunction against cheating,” Luxlord Black said. “For when\nhundreds of supplicants are testing in the same room.”\n“He just came today,” Magister Arien told Mistress Varidos. “The\nPrism himself ordered that he be tested immediately. He doesn’t know all\nthe rules.”\n“Continue the testing,” the mistress ordered.\nKip and Magister Arien glanced at Luxlord Black. Kip guessed that,\ntechnically, the luxlord was the highest-ranking person in the room, but the\nman gave the tiniest shrug, as if it wasn’t worth fighting over. Go on, he\nwaved.\nMagister Arien sat once more, pulled out a set of tongs, and used them\nto lay out another dozen tiles—except these were all the same deep red. Kip\nblinked. Magister Arien handed him the tongs. Um, thanks?\nKip reached a hand out for a tile, and then he understood. He could\nfeel the heat radiating off them. He was supposed to see the differences in\nheat? He stared as if by sheer willpower he could tear the truth out of the\ntiles.\nTime crawled past. Kip started to daydream. He wondered if Liv\nDanavis was here. Oh, no, he’d have to tell her.\nHi, Liv, great to see you. Your father’s dead."

Kip thought about the flames roaring through his town,\nabout that drafter and his apprentice, throwing fireballs. Jumping over the\nwaterfall, running down the waterfall path in the utter darkness, relaxing his\neyes so he could actually see better than focusing directly. Oh, Orholam, I\nam simple.\n“Okay, that’s long enough,” Luxlord Black said.\n“No wait! Wait! I just—I just…” Kip stared at the tiles again. Relax,\neyes, come on! He let his focus go soft, and abruptly it was clear. Using the\ntongs, he shuffled each tile into its correct place in moments from the\nhottest to the merely warm. This was what Master Danavis had been\nteaching him? The old dyer had never let on that what he was showing Kip\nwasn’t normal. Unbelievable.\nThe thought of the dyer left a hollow in Kip’s stomach. Master\nDanavis had been good to him. Inventing chores he probably could have\ndone faster himself, just to give Kip a little money. And like everyone in\nRekton, he’d been slaughtered.\nKip hoped Master Danavis had taken some of the bastards with him.\n“Are we almost done?” he asked roughly. He wanted to be alone. He\nwas too tired, his emotions erratic, the reality of what had happened in\nRekton trying to rush in and overwhelm him now that he had a second\nwhere he wasn’t running from soldiers or bandits or having magic thrown at\nhim.\n“No,” the old scarecrow said. “Don’t bother, girl,” she told Arien,\nwho’d only flipped over half of the tiles. “He got them all correct. Show\nhim the superviolets.”\nMagister Arien put away the hot tiles with a glance at Luxlord Black,\nwho seemed unfazed. Then she pulled out the last tiles, which were all the\nsame deep violet.\nRelax my eyes to see one side of the spectrum, so… Kip tightened his\neyes as hard as he could, and the colors leapt apart. Someone had written a\nletter on each tile. It read: “Nicely done!”\nKip laughed. He slapped them into place.\nMagister Arien looked at Mistress Varidos. “Why are you looking at\nme, you fool girl?” the old woman asked. “I can’t see superviolets. I’m at\nthe other end of the spectrum.”\nThe younger woman blushed and flipped over the tiles. They were in\nthe correct order.\n“Congratulations, boy,” Mistress Varidos said. “You can be some\nsatrap’s gardener.”\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“It’s one use for excellent color matchers, and a step up for you,\nTyrean.”\nThe door opened and Commander Ironfist stepped in. “What’s this?”\nhe asked.\n“We’ve just finished testing the supplicant,” Magister Arien said. “He’s\na full-spectrum superchromat!”\n“You’re wasting his time with tiles? I don’t care what colors he can\nsee, I want to know what he can draft. Where’s that idiot tester I started"

The Prism demands to know his\ncapabilities before they go.”\n“This is highly irregular,” the mistress said. “Who is this boy?”\n“I’m right here,” Kip said, irritated.\n“Regular or irregular is irrelevant,” Ironfist said. “Can you and this\nmagister assist in the testing or not?”\n“Me?” Magister Arien asked, alarmed. “I don’t think I—”\n“We can do it—” the mistress began.\n“Good, then—” Ironfist said.\n“—but I demand to know who he is first.”\n“I’m right here!” Kip said.\n“Don’t you raise your voice to me, boy,” the mistress said, stabbing the\nair in front of his nose with one bony claw.\n“Who are you, boy?” Luxlord Black asked quietly, even as the voices\ncontinued to rise.\n“I think I’d really prefer not to help with the Thresh—” Arien was\nsaying.\n“You have no standing to make demands, Mistress—” Ironfist was\nsaying to the old woman.\n“I’m Kip Guile!” Kip shouted. “I’m Gavin Guile’s bastard, Kip.”\nSilence.\nKip looked from one face to another. Luxlord Black merely looked\nshocked. Magister Arien looked stunned to the point of tears. Commander\nIronfist looked peeved.

Could this man be Kip’s father?\n“Liv! Move!” Vena hissed.\nLiv started. She’d stopped right at the top of the steps, blocking the\nrest of the class. She hurried forward, blushing. She knew it was bad when\noblivious Vena noticed something. Perfect. Liv was going to hear about this.\nIf not from Magister Goldthorn, certainly from a few of the less friendly\ngirls in the class.\nAs the six girls took their places—there were no boys in the class—the\nPrism saw them. He pulled himself away from the edge of the tower and\nwalked to the head of the class. As when they sat in their normal class—\nthough mercifully the days of solid book learning were mostly past—Liv\ntook the second row, her Poor joining her friend Vena’s Oblivious Artist and\nArana’s Plain Merchant’s Daughter. The girls who somehow embodied\nbeautiful, rich, connected, noble, preening, and gifted into only three bodies\ntook the front row, as they always demanded. Magister Goldthorn, barely\nthree years older than her disciples, did everything those girls wanted.\nGavin Guile came to stand in front of the class. “Hail, disciples,” he\nsaid. It was the traditional teachers’ greeting.\n“Hail, Magister,” they said in unison, answering without thinking\nabout whether they actually should address him by some other title. He was\nthe Prism, after all.\n“Good,” he said, giving a lopsided grin. Orholam, he was cute. “Today,\nI am only a magister. And you are only glims.”\n“Gleams,” Liv corrected without thinking.\nShe shrank into her chair as Magister Goldthorn hissed and all the girls\nturned disbelieving stares at her. Correcting the Prism! He could say up was\ndown and everyone should nod and smile. But he didn’t look upset. He just\nstared at Liv for a long moment with those unsettling prismatic eyes.\n“Ah, yes,” he said. “Well, since you are advanced students, I suppose\nyou have questions for me? What’s your name?”\n“Me?” Liv asked. Of course he meant me, he’s looking right at me.\n“Um, Liv.”\n“Umliv?”\nShe blushed harder. “Aliviana. Liv. Liv Danavis.” Had she added that\nlast part hoping he would notice? Wouldn’t she have just said Liv\notherwise? Was she trying ingratiate herself, just as her Ruthgari masters\nwanted?\n“Well done,” Beautiful whispered from the front row. “Only took you\nthree tries.”\n“Related to General Danavis?”\nLiv swallowed. “Yes, sir. He’s my father.” Committed now. Well done,\nLiv.\n“He was a good man.” He said it as if he genuinely respected the man\nwho’d been responsible for so many of his own men’s deaths.\n“He was a rebel.” She couldn’t keep the bitterness out of her voice.\nBitterness that her father had lost everything in the war, including her\nmother.

Do you have a question, Aliviana?”\nAll the students were supposed to have prepared questions, but\nBeautiful, Rich, and Connected in the front row usually dominated any time\nthe class had with important drafters, so Liv hadn’t expected to get the\nchance to ask hers.

It was\nreasonably warm on top of the Chromeria, but Ana had to be cold,\nconsidering how little of her body that dress covered. The combination of\nAna’s frustratingly effortless natural beauty, short skirts, and deep cleavage\nwas rarely lost on male magisters.\n“Wait, I do have a question,” Liv said. She’d already brought up that\nshe was Corvan Danavis’s daughter. The only way she could be more\ninteresting to him—and make him suspect more that she was a spy—was by\nvolunteering that she was from Rekton and knew Kip.\nAnd the only way out was to go much, much further. Dear Orholam,\nplease…\n“Yes, Liv,” Gavin said. But he didn’t look at her. Face expressionless,\nhe was staring hard at Ana. He glanced down at her propped-up cleavage\nthen back to her eyes and shook his head just a fraction. Yes, I see. No, I’m\nnot amused.\nAna blanched. Her eyes dropped, she sat up and shifted in her chair to\npull her skirt down. Thank Orholam Liv was in the back row, because she\ncouldn’t suppress her grin, despite everything.\n“Liv?” Gavin asked, turning those prismatic eyes on her. Entrancing.\nShe cleared her throat. “I was wondering if you could talk to us about\nuses of yellow/superviolet bichromacy.”\n“Why?” Gavin asked.\nLiv froze. Her prayer was answered. A chance.\nMagister Goldthorn interjected. “How about we talk about\nsuperviolet/blue bichromacy instead? It’s far more common. Three of my\ndisciples are bichromes. Ana here is nearly a polychrome.”\nGavin ignored her.\nLiv hadn’t thought this moment would ever come. She’d been trapped\nso long in this class, with these girls. In one more year, she’d be finished. In\nfact, she’d mastered enough drafting that she could take the final\nexamination right now and pass easily. She hadn’t because there was\nnothing good waiting for her when she finished. A terrible position\ndecoding official, non-secret communications for the Ruthgari noble who\nheld her contract.

It was an investment every satrapy gladly made because drafters\nwere so vital to every part of their economies, their armies, their\nconstruction, their communications, their agriculture. But Tyrea had\nnothing. The corrupt foreign governors of Garriston sent a pittance every\nyear. Those students who came from Tyrea mostly had to pay their own\nway. The Danavises’ wealth had been stolen during the war, so Liv had\nneeded to pledge her services to a Ruthgari patron just to stay at the\nChromeria.\nIf Liv were from any other satrapy, her ambassador would have forced\nher patron to pay for bichrome training for her or surrender her contract.\nBut there was no Tyrean ambassador anymore. There was an official\nbursar’s purse for “hardship” cases like hers, but it had long ago become a\nslush fund for bureaucrats to reward their favorites. Tyrea had no voice, no\nplace.\n“Liv asked because she’s a yellow/superviolet bichrome,” Vena said.\nGavin turned and looked at her. Vena was an artist and dressed like\none. Boyishly short hair, artfully disheveled, lots of jewelry, and clothing\nshe’d tailored for herself. Half the time you couldn’t even tell what\ncountry’s style she was borrowing from, if any. But despite not being pretty,\nshe was always striking and—in Liv’s opinion anyway—looked great.\nToday, Vena wore a flowing dress of her own invention, with silver\nembroidery at the hem reminiscent of the Tree People’s zoomorphic\ndesigns. The designs in the visible spectrum were echoed cleverly in the\nsuperviolet.\n“What a marvelous young woman you are,” Gavin said to Vena. “And\na good friend. I love your dress.” As Vena blushed crimson, Gavin turned to\nLiv. “Is this true?”\n“No, it’s not,” Magister Goldthorn said. “Liv’s Threshing was\ninconclusive, and since then she’s shown no further abilities.”\nLiv pulled out the broken yellow spectacles—really only a monocle—\nthat she’d bought secretly two years before. She held it up, squinted through\none eye, and stared at the white stone of the Prism’s Tower. In a moment,\nyellow luxin filled her cupped hands.\nIt sloshed like water. Yellow luxin’s natural state was liquid. It was the\nmost unstable of any luxin, not just sensitive to light but also to motion. At\nits best, it could be used mainly for two things: if held with will in liquid\nform, it made great torches. Or, in a thin, sealed sheet, it would slowly feed\nlight to other luxins, keeping them fresh the same way that lanolin and\nbeeswax rejuvenated leather.\nLiv threw the cupped liquid aside. It didn’t even make it to the ground,\ninstead flashboiling in midair into pure yellow light.\nMagister Goldthorn spluttered, “This is outrageous! You are forbidden\nto draft—”\n“You are forbidden,” Gavin interrupted her, “to squander the gifts\nOrholam has given you. You’re Tyrean, Aliviana?”\nMagister Goldthorn stopped cold.

It was considered a very long\ntime.\nHe looked hard at her. Then his expression softened. “As stubborn as\nyour father, I see. I barely made it past one. Well done. So… superviolet\nand yellow. Watch this.” He held out both of his hands.\nEvery girl’s pupils tightened to tiny apertures. Superviolet luxin was\ninvisible to normal sight. Even a woman who could draft superviolet\nwouldn’t see it unless she was looking for it. “Your normal lessons have\ncovered—doubtless to the point of your nausea—crafting missives with\nsuperviolet luxin.”\nHad they ever. Its invisibility was why superviolet drafters were used\nfor communications. But on top of that, every satrapy was also looking into\nciphers and methods of stacking, twisting, and obfuscating the superviolet-\nwritten messages, locking the messages into fragile loops that would be\nbroken by any but someone who knew the exact method to open and read\nthem. Fun, for a while. But they’d passed the fun place a long long time\nago.\n“You know what superviolet is great for?” Gavin asked. “Tripping\npeople.” Every girl in the class grinned guiltily. All had done that at one\ntime or another. “No, seriously. The pranks are where you learn to apply\nyour color in ways no one else has thought of. You have to be a little bad to\nmake history. Sealed superviolet isn’t as strong as blue or green, but it\nweighs almost nothing, and for Orholam’s sake, it’s invisible!” Gavin\ndrafted a hollow superviolet egg the size of his hand. He winced for an\ninstant, as if something was paining him. “The trick with yellow, Liv, is to\nunderstand how it releases its power. So, into the middle of this egg, draft\nliquid yellow.” He did. “The important bit is to leave absolutely no air\ninside the container. It has to be solid.” He closed it while looking at the\ngirls, not paying attention. He’d just left an air bubble in the egg. He hadn’t\nnoticed.\n“If it’s solid, totally airtight, then even if you shake it—”\nLiv raised her hand, opened her mouth, but she was too slow.\nGavin shook the egg. It exploded with a blinding flash.\nEveryone hit the ground.\nBefore Liv even opened her eyes, she heard Gavin laughing. Was he\ninsane? She looked up, but his hair wasn’t even ruffled. “Now,” Gavin said.\n“If that egg had been made of blue luxin, when it shattered we’d all have\nbeen cut to pieces. But as you all know in your heads—if not in your hearts\nor your bodies, apparently—sealed superviolet frays easily. Not that it can’t\nbe useful.” With a speed and facility that stunned Liv, he drafted another"

        "text": "or your bodies, apparently—sealed superviolet frays easily. Not that it can’t\nbe useful.” With a speed and facility that stunned Liv, he drafted another\negg and filled it with liquid yellow luxin.\n“Get up,” he told the class. Ana was crying quietly. She’d scraped her\nknee when she’d fallen, and it was bleeding. Served her right for wearing\nsuch a short skirt. The rest of the girls got up, righted their chairs, and sat.\nAna stayed on the ground. “Get up,” Gavin ordered her. “You’re going to be\na drafter in a few months. You want to act like a woman? You’re not even\nready to act like an adult.”\nThe lash of his words hit Ana hard, but every girl in the class felt the\nsting. His statement was as true for Liv as it was for Ana. She looked away\nfrom Ana, realizing how easy it would have been to be in her place right\nnow. She felt a momentary twinge of compassion for the girl, then irritation\nthat she was feeling that. Ana had made her life miserable.\nGavin promptly ignored Ana. He flung a strand of superviolet\nskyward. It was so light, it was caught in the wind and drifted to the west\noff the tower, but as long as he held the luxin open and supported it and\ndrafted more and more into it, he could send it higher, and he did, rapidly.\nThen he brought the yellow egg up to the thread of luxin, made loops to\nhold it on to the line, and then launched it into the air. His right hand\nsnapped down with the recoil of the launch.\nThe egg zipped along the invisible line, curving out over the tower. At\nits apex, two hundred feet out, it exploded with a sharp report. Far below,\nLiv heard people in the yard crying out in wonder and surprise.\n“Now, imagine I pointed that at a charging line of horses. It won’t kill\nanyone directly, but horses don’t like having things explode in their faces\nany more than prissy girls do.”\nBlanching and blushing filled the sudden, pained silence.\n“There’s a couple of other special ways you can use superviolet in\ndual-color drafting. Anyone?” Gavin asked.\nAna lifted her hand uncertainly. He nodded. “For distance control?”\n“That’s right. You have to leave your superviolet open, and the longer\nyou make the line, the harder it is to control. It’s like juggling when you\ncan’t see the balls. But…” He held out his hands, a swirl of colors went\nthrough his eyes, and he was holding a red ball, a yellow ball, a green ball,\na blue ball, and an orange ball. (Liv saw him wince again, as if he had a\npulled muscle in his back.) Then he started juggling. The girls—all of them,\neven Magister Goldthorn—gasped. First because the properties of the balls\nweren’t right. Orange was slick, oily. Red was sticky. Yellow was liquid.\nThen, of course, because it was a different kind of impressive to see\nsomeone juggle five of anything.\nOh. Liv got it. Every ball had a very thin blue luxin shell, filled with\nluxin of a different color.\nGavin closed his eyes and kept juggling. Impossible. Was he just"

No, he was showing off, but he was also still teaching.\n“Ah,” Liv said, pleased.\n“Someone got it,” Gavin said, opening his eyes. “With my eyes closed,\nhow am I juggling?”\n“You’re the Prism. You can do anything,” someone mumbled.\n“Thank you, my butt hasn’t been kissed all day, but no.”\nDid he just say that?! “You’re not juggling,” Liv said, recovering first.\nGavin took his hands away from the twirling balls. They kept going in\nthe same intricate pattern. Everyone tightened their eyes and saw the\nsuperviolet luxin connected in a track through the balls. The balls were\nsimply following the invisible track. “That’s right. If you give a visible\nreason, even if it’s astounding, you can hide an invisible phenomenon right\nunder people’s noses. That is the power of superviolet luxin. Tell you what,\nAliviana, will you do me a favor?”\n“Sure.”\nHe smiled. “Good. I’ll hold you to that.” He turned. There was a dark\nstain on the back of his shirt. Was that blood? Should Liv say something?\n“Magister Goldthorn, I’m sorry, but I have to leave. I still owe you half a\nclass, and I’ll make it up to you. In the meantime, if you’d notify the\nappropriate officials, Aliviana Danavis is hereby recognized as a\nsuperviolet/yellow bichrome. Her instruction will begin immediately. I\nwould be… disappointed if she were outfitted in a style less decent than the\naverage Ruthgari bichrome’s. Costs should be taken from Chromeria\nfinances. If anyone has a problem with that, direct them to me.”\nLiv forgot about Gavin’s shirt instantly. She couldn’t believe what\nshe’d just heard. With a few sentences, the Prism had changed everything.\nFreed her. A bichrome! In a word, she’d gone from a life writing letters for\nsome backwater noble to a life of only Orholam knew what. She thought\nshe was imagining it until she saw the exact same stunned expression on\nMagister Goldthorn’s face. It was real. The second part of what he’d said\ntook only a moment more to sink in. Liv was to be kept in a style equivalent\nto a Ruthgari bichrome at the Chromeria’s expense. And the Ruthgari kept\ntheir drafters in more lavish apartments than anyone. It was all part of their\nstrategy to attract the best talent.\nIf Liv played it halfway right, she could escape that hellstone harpy\nAglaia Crassos.\nGavin smiled at her, a roguish, boyish joy mixing with something\ndeeper Liv couldn’t read. Then he left.\nBut watching him jog down the steps out of view, Liv was filled with a\nvague unease. She’d gotten everything she hoped today, and everything that\nshe hadn’t quite dared to hope. But something more had happened.\nThe Prism had just bought her. She didn’t know why she was worth it,\nbut it didn’t strike her as a random gesture. She looked at Vena, who"

Gavin Guile had some purpose in mind for Liv,\nand she would perform it gladly. How could she not? But what was it?\nChapter 39\nThe cell’s blue was trying to sink into his brain, make him passionless,\nlogical. No room for hatred, for envy, for fury. The dead man was muttering\nin his wall.\nDazen stood and walked over to him. The dead man resided in a\nparticularly shiny section of the blue luxin wall. He was, of course, Dazen’s\ntwin.\n“The time has come,” the dead man said. “You need to kill yourself.”\nThe dead man liked to drop a fire in Dazen’s lap and see what he did\nwith it.\nDazen popped his neck left and right. The dead man popped his neck\nright and left. “What do you mean?” Dazen asked.\n“You haven’t been willing to do what you need to do. Unless you can\ncut deeper than Dazen, you—”\n“I am Dazen now!” Dazen snapped.\nThe man in the wall smiled indulgently. “Not yet, you’re not. You’re\nstill me. You’re still Gavin Guile, the brother who lost. Dazen stole your\nlife, but you haven’t taken his. Not yet. You’re not ready. Talk to me again\nin another year or two.”\n“You’re dead!” Dazen snapped. “You’re the dead man, not me. I am\nDazen!”\nBut his reflection said nothing.\nHis son was out there. His son, not the real Dazen’s. The real Dazen\nwas stealing his son. Just like he’d stolen his entire life.\nGavin had decided long ago that if Dazen was going to steal his life, he\nwould steal Dazen’s in return. His younger brother had always been the\nsmarter of the two, so the only way to escape would be to become Dazen—\nto outthink his brother, to dig a pace below the real Dazen’s deepest trap\nand spring it back on him. So far, it hadn’t worked.\n“It hasn’t worked because you’re not willing to risk everything to win.\nThat was Dazen’s genius,” the dead man said. “You remember the last time\nyou two fought?”\n“When he imprisoned me and stole my life?”\n“No, the last time you fought with your fists.”\nGavin couldn’t ever forget it. He’d been the older brother. He needed\nto win. He couldn’t even remember what they’d fought over. That hadn’t\nbeen important. He’d probably started it. Dazen had been getting too big for\nhis boots for a while, not giving Gavin the respect he deserved. So Gavin\nhad punched him in the shoulder and called him something foul.\nThough Gavin was older, Dazen had grown to be at least his size, if\nnot bigger. Most days, Dazen would take the abuse with a complaint and a\ncurse. Not that day. Dazen had attacked him, and suddenly Gavin had been\nstruck with the fear that had been sneaking up on him for quite some time.\nWhat if he lost?\nThey were struggling, trying to throw each other, raining punches to"

Many were blocked, but even those\nthat got through were more painful than damaging. Fighting your brother\nhad rules. You didn’t try to break bones, you didn’t hit in the face. It was\nabout submission and dominance and punishment.\nBut if Dazen won one fight, things would never be the same between\nthem. That couldn’t happen. In his fear and desperation, Gavin punched\nDazen in the face.\nIt rocked Dazen back on his heels, but more from shock than from the\npower of the blow. Dazen was usually pretty even-keeled, but as soon as\nGavin saw his face, he knew he’d made a mistake. A big one. The pain\ndidn’t matter. The dominance didn’t matter. Not to Dazen. He’d gone\nabsolutely crazy. He didn’t even need to draft red to utterly lose it. And lose\nit he did.\nDazen bulled into Gavin and swept him off his feet. Gavin tried to pull\naway, dance aside, pull loose. But Dazen wasn’t jockeying for position; he\nwas taking Gavin down. They fell. Gavin landed on top of Dazen,\nconnecting a good shot with his knee.\nIt didn’t matter. It was like Dazen didn’t even feel it. He just absorbed\nthe shot and pulled Gavin with the force of his fall. Abruptly Gavin’s little\nbrother was on top of him. Dazen grabbed his throat in both hands and\nsqueezed.\nGavin’s panic receded. They’d both been taught grappling. He slugged\nDazen across the jaw. Nothing. Dazen took it. The next punch Dazen\ndeflected with an elbow. He squeezed.\nThe panic came back with a vengeance. Dazen was going to kill him!\nGavin punched and punched and punched, but Dazen just took the\npunishment.\nGo ahead, hurt me, but I’m going to kill you.\nThe world was going dark when Dazen abruptly released Gavin. He\nstaggered to his feet as Gavin coughed himself back to life. By the time\nGavin stood, his little brother was gone.\nAfter that, they hadn’t fought again. It was enough. They’d known\nwithout saying a word that if they ever fought again, someone would likely\nget killed.\nAnd if I’d won at Sundered Rock, someone would have been.\nBut Dazen had let him live. It was like that moment when he’d had\nGavin’s throat in his hands. He could have crushed me. He could have\nkilled me, but he let me live instead. Because he was weak.\n“If Dazen’s weak,” the dead man said, “what does that make you? You\nlost to him.” He laughed.\n“Never again. It’s taken me this long, but I understand at last. I will\ntake this lesson from my brother: win at any cost. Be ready to pay it all, and\nyou won’t have to.” That was it. Simple. Now, now, Gavin was ready to\nbecome Dazen. He would take Dazen’s strengths and leave his weaknesses.\nHe reached out a hand and touched his reflection. “You really are a\ndead man now,” he said."

He would take Dazen’s strengths and leave his weaknesses.\nHe reached out a hand and touched his reflection. “You really are a\ndead man now,” he said.\nHis previous attempts to draft sub-red had failed because he couldn’t\nget enough heat. The only thing that generated heat down here was his own\nbody, and he’d nearly killed himself last time when he’d taken too much\nheat. He’d gone delusional, and still it hadn’t been enough. He hadn’t been\nwilling to risk everything. He hadn’t been willing to die, if it took that. He\nwas willing now.\n“Thank you, brother. Thank you, son,” he said aloud. He drafted a\nblade of blue luxin. It only held an edge if he concentrated hard, but over a\ncourse of days, he and the dead man shaved his long hair off. He would cut\noff a hank, separate the strands into narrow sheaves, and tie the ends of\nthose so they wouldn’t fall apart. When he had a good pile, smearing as\nmuch oil from his body on his makeshift yarn as he could, he began\nweaving. This had to be done first. Later he wouldn’t be in any shape to try\nit.\nFor once, the blue helped him. The old him—back when he was free,\nback when he was Gavin—could never have done this. Threading the hairs\nover, under, over, under, making mistakes, starting over, fumbling and\ndropping the whole unfinished thing, trying to catch it and losing a week’s\nwork in one second when his fingers pulled the threads loose—it all would\nhave driven him mad. But blue reveled in detail, in putting every hair in its\nplace.\nDazen didn’t even notice it at first, but one day he realized he had\nsomething he’d lost long long ago. He had hope. He would get out. He\nknew that now. It was only a matter of time. Vengeance was coming, and, if\nlong delayed, it would be all the sweeter for it. Dazen sighed, contented,\nand continued his work.\nChapter 40\nGavin tore off the stained shirt and grunted as he scraped the cloth across\nhis burn. Fifty danar shirt, and I ruined it in half an hour. Worse, he’d\nnoticed some of the girls glancing at the spreading stain. That wasn’t a\ndisaster. They wouldn’t ask about it. One of the Spectrum would. He liked\nto save up his lies for them.\nHe cursed under his breath.\nGavin knew that Marissia must have some sort of an organizational\nscheme to how she put away his clothing, but whatever it was, he’d never\npierced its logic. He rifled through stacks of shirts and pants and breeches\nand cloaks and habias and robes and thobes and petasoi and ghotras, most\nof which he didn’t think he’d ever worn. Orholam, he had a lot of clothes.\nAnd these were only his summer clothes. He supposed it was because, as\nPrism, he was supposed to be of all peoples, so if he met with an\nambassador or needed to suddenly visit Abornea, he would already have\nlocal clothing that fit him.\nHe was still standing bare-chested, ointment smeared on his burn—at"

Marissia slipped in quietly. She glanced at the burn on his ribs. Her\njade green eyes lit with anger, though Gavin couldn’t tell if it was at him or\nfor him. Maybe a bit of both. She grabbed the ointment from his table and\nsmeared more around to his back. Ouch. Apparently, he’d missed some\nspots. Then she bandaged him with a practiced hand. She wasn’t gentle.\n“Does my lord need assistance finding another shirt?” she asked.\n“Owww!” he yelped. He cleared his throat, lowered his voice an\noctave. “Please.”\nShe went to a stack he swore he’d searched thoroughly and\nimmediately plucked a shirt from its depths. He didn’t think he’d ever worn\nit before, but it was a style he liked, and dark enough that if the ointment\nsoaked through this one, no one would notice. Marissia had a certain magic\nof her own. He could swear that shirt hadn’t been there before.\nShe began whistling quietly as she dressed him and fixed his hair; it\nwas an old tune, pretty. Marissia was a good whistler.\nOh, the tune was “Little Lamb Lost.” A comment on not being able to\nfind his own clothes? Probably. He had bigger things to worry about. He’d\ndealt with his brother, how much trouble could the Spectrum be?\n“I’ll be leaving either in the morning or the next day,” Gavin said.\n“There’s a young man testing downstairs. Kip. He’s my, uh, natural son.”\nThere was no need to use the “nephew” euphemism with Marissia. Marissia\nknew that Gavin had imprisoned his brother, but even she didn’t know that\nGavin wasn’t Gavin. She hadn’t known either of them before the war, so\nshe didn’t need to know. He trusted her completely, but the fewer people\nwho knew that secret, the longer it would be before all this crashed down on\nhis head. “He’s sixteen—fifteen, I mean. Will you find appropriate clothes\nfor him and pack for both of us for two weeks?”\n“More for fighting or for impressing?”\n“Both.”\n“Of course,” she said flatly.\nOn his way out the door, Gavin grabbed his sword in its jeweled\nscabbard. He wasn’t nearly the hand with a blade that even the least of the\nBlackguard was. He had been quite skilled once, but once he’d realized he\ncould draft any combination of color and instantly have a weapon of\nwhatever kind he needed, he hadn’t practiced with plain steel as often as\nwas required to compete with professional warriors like the Blackguard.\nOf course, that assumed a fair fight, and there was no such thing with a\ndrafter.

It was his compromise with the White. He got\nto travel without the Blackguard when he thought it was absolutely\nnecessary—so, most of the time—as long as he agreed to have them around\nwhen he was in a place where assassination was more likely. The White\nwasn’t pleased with how he’d interpreted their agreement, but he clung\nferociously to what little freedom he had.\nHe strode quickly through the single hall that separated the halves of\nthis level. He and the White each had one-half of the floor. Because of the\nChromeria’s rotation, Gavin’s half was always pointed toward the sun. An\nodd irony that the White should be forever in shadow, though in her elder\nyears this White had appreciated it. It minimized the temptations of drafting\nand hastening her own death. Gavin wondered again how she did it.\nWithout drafting, he would feel empty, weak. Life wouldn’t be worth living\nwithout chromaturgy. It defined who he was. Surely it had done the same\nfor the White, and yet she lived on, her will still iron, her back unbowed.\nStepping past the Blackguards guarding her room, he knocked on her\ndoor.\n“She’s not here,” the man on the left said. “The White has gone to\nmeet with the Chromeria. She thought it would be rude to keep the full\nSpectrum waiting because of one man’s tardiness.”\nThis was how the Blackguards registered their displeasure. His own\nBlackguards knew where he was going as soon as he turned toward the\nWhite’s room rather than toward the lift, but they didn’t tell him. The\nWhite’s Blackguards knew where he was going as soon as they saw him,\nbut they didn’t tell him the White was gone until he knocked, causing him\nto waste more time and be even later. One man’s tardiness? What’s the\nSpectrum going to talk about without me? I called the meeting.\nAs was typical, the Blackguards were careful in showing their\nirritation. There would be no more trouble from them for a while, Ironfist\nwould see to that. If they peeved Gavin more than occasionally, he would\ndo more to avoid them and they wouldn’t be able to do their job of\nprotecting him. Still, they wanted him to respect them. Which he did, after a\nfashion.\nIt’s an odd person who volunteers to jump in front of an arrow when\nthey don’t even know if they’ll like the Prism or White that they’ll be\nassigned to guard. But he wouldn’t be chained. Power was freedom. Power\nhad to be maintained.\n“If you can’t serve me well,” Gavin said to his own two Blackguards,\n“you can’t serve me at all.” He turned on his heel and started walking\ntoward the lift.\nOf course they said nothing. They simply accompanied him on his left\nand right. Commander Ironfist trained them to ignore orders that put their\ncharges in danger.\nGavin waved his arms down, drafting bars of blue luxin strengthened\nwith yellow down to his left and right.

He kept walking, not even looking back as he threw up walls of\nsolid blue, red, green, yellow, and superviolet.\nIt satisfied a small part of him. His brother really had gotten under his\nskin. The bastard.\nBut at the same time, this was necessary. The Blackguard had to know\nthey couldn’t control him. That was how smart bodyguards worked: impede\nyour freedom a little, then a little more, and soon they had their way. Gavin\nwasn’t going to let that happen. If he had the Blackguard hovering around\nhim at all times—as they ultimately wished—they would learn not just his\nsecrets like the skimmer and the condor, but his final secret. What would the\nBlackguard do if they found out that Gavin wasn’t Gavin at all? They might\ndecide he was the de facto Prism and that was enough. Or they might decide\nhe was a threat to the real Prism. Or he might split the Blackguard into\nwarring camps. Pleasant thought, a bunch of elite warrior-drafters trying to\ndestroy each other. That was what made this necessary. The Blackguard\nmust be taught and taught again to accept the crumbs Gavin let drop: You\ncan protect me if you serve me wholeheartedly, and I’ll withdraw that\nprivilege whenever I please for any reason or none.\nAt first, years ago, Commander Spear had punished those Blackguards\nwho let Gavin escape them. When that didn’t work, he’d made the\npunishments public, shaming the Blackguards for that which wasn’t their\nfault. Gavin had felt awful, and had not changed a bit. Commander Spear\nhad escalated the punishments, publicly flogging several men, including a\nyoung Ironfist. Gavin had responded by yawning and not letting any\nBlackguards near him for a month. Then he’d walked through crowded\nmarkets, leaving bound and gagged the Blackguards that Commander Spear\nsent, and he’d done it in the aftermath of the war, when there had been not a\nfew men who would have gladly killed him.\nWhen there finally was an assassination attempt and no Blackguards\npresent, Commander Spear had discharged the six Blackguards who were\nsupposed to be protecting Gavin. The White had finally stepped in and\ndischarged Commander Spear instead. Gavin hadn’t felt sorry for the man.\nOnce he’d learned that using Gavin’s guilt against him wouldn’t work, he\nshould have tried something else. A man who couldn’t change tactics\nshouldn’t be in charge of the Blackguard in the first place.\nThe move hadn’t made Gavin any friends, but it had left him in charge.\nBesides, he didn’t need friends. The two Blackguards at the lift looked at\neach other as he approached. The woman on the left was short but as thick\nas a bull. She said, “High Lord Prism, I notice you don’t have an escort.\nMay I join you?”\nGavin grinned. “Since you ask so nicely,” he said.\nThey opened the lift for him, and in moments he was on the next level\nbelow his and the White’s floor.

The Colors were scattered around\nthe table.

Gavin found the last spot,\nbetween the Superviolet, a tall, skin-and-bones coal-black Parian woman\nnamed Sadah, and the soft, lighter-skinned Ruthgari man with the beaded\nbeard, Klytos Blue.\nGavin had told Kip that each Color represented a country, and that was\nmostly true. Each satrap or satrapah appointed one Color. It was the most\nimportant decision most rulers ever made. But the system had begun to\nbreak down even before the False Prism’s War, when Andross Guile had\nbribed and blackmailed his way into the Red seat, though the Blood Forest\nalready had one Color. He’d been so audacious, he’d stolen that seat from\nRuthgar, claiming that the Guiles’ sliver of swampland in Ruthgari made\nhim eligible for the Ruthgari seat.\nOf course, after the war, similar logic had been used to deprive Tyrea\nof a seat.\nThere were so many interlocking and overlapping layers of loyalty it\nwas dizzying. Both the Red and the Green were Ruthgari and thus likely to\nunite on any issue concerning Ruthgar. But the Green was also cousins with\nJia Tolver, an Abornean woman who was the Yellow. The Aborneans\nstrangled both Parian and Ruthgari trade through the Narrows, so anything\nto do with trade would see them at each other’s throats, but on anything else\nthey might try to form a bloc. The Sub-red was a Blood Forester, who were\nallies now with their stronger neighbors the Ruthgari, but her parents had\nbeen killed in the war by the Green’s brothers. And on it went. Every noble\nfamily in the Seven Satrapies did everything it could to get at least one son\nor daughter into the Chromeria, if for nothing else than to try to watch their\nbacks.\nIn turn, everyone in the Spectrum did all they could to protect\nthemselves. Family bonds, clan bonds, national bonds, color bonds, and\nideological bonds cut every which way. The Colors were political creatures\nas much as they were magical. To be named a Color took a certain amount\nof chromaturgical aptitude—the White saw to that—but after that bar was\nreached, not a few of these seats had found inhabitants at the same time that"

Let\nthe record show that all Colors except for Red are in attendance.” They\nhated that. Hated that they couldn’t get rid of Andross Guile. They hated\nthat in defiance of all convention, he hadn’t attended a meeting in five years\nbut still insisted that his votes be counted. They hated what his having his\nvote delivered by messenger said about how little he valued their opinions.\nNo eloquence would ever move Andross Guile. He would see and weigh\nevery issue alone, and decide, regardless of the mummery of these\nSpectrum meetings. But they feared him, too. The White said, “Lord Prism,\nyou have called this meeting, so I turn over the proceeding to you.”\nShe thought she was thwarting him. That he’d grown too independent.\nThat he might become dangerous if she didn’t yank the leash.\nCareful, Orea. When choked, dogs go docile—but wolves go wild.\nGavin’s relationship with the Spectrum had always been thorny. Of\ncourse, when he’d been recuperating after Sundered Rock, they’d stripped\nhim of his title of promachos, taking control of the armies away from him,\nas custom dictated. But they hadn’t known whether he would allow it. Still\nlearning his new guise, he had, but he didn’t care much for any of the\nColors personally. Nor did they care for him. He’d lived too long, become\ntoo powerful. He didn’t need them, and that scared them.\nThey hated his father. They hated the Guiles, and they stymied Gavin\nwhenever they could.\nPatience, Gavin. Plenty of time for purpose six. Plenty of room to\nmaneuver. You are Andross Guile’s son.\n“We need to release the city of Garriston immediately, pull out all of\nour men, and give it back to King Garadul,” Gavin said. “Preferably with an\napology that we didn’t do it sooner.”\nSilence. Followed by awkward silence.\nKlytos Blue chuckled uncertainly. When no one else joined him, he\nfell silent.\n“King?” the White asked.\n“That’s what he’s calling himself.” Gavin didn’t elaborate.\nSadah Superviolet said, “Surely you’re not serious, Lord Prism. The\ngovernorship transfers to Paria in a few weeks. It’s our right. People have\nmade plans. Ships are sailing already. If we must have this conversation, let\nus have it two years from now.”\n“Absolutely not,” Delara Orange said. She was a forty-year-old\nbichrome, with great sagging breasts and the red and orange in her eyes\npushing to the very edge of her irises. She was an Atashian. Atash got the\ngovernorship right after Paria’s. “Paria took the very first rotation, when\nthere were actually a few treasures left in the city.

We took only what was an appropriate\nrecompense.”\n“Stop,” Gavin said, before it could go any further. “You’re having the\nwrong fight. This isn’t about who has the governorship, in what order, or for\nhow long. It’s been sixteen years since we crushed Tyrea. They still don’t\nhave a representative in this room. There are fewer Tyreans in the\nChromeria every year. Why is that? Have they suddenly stopped bearing\ndrafters there? Or is it because we have demanded a tribute from them so\nruinous they can’t support their drafters, which in turn impoverishes their\nland further? Then we hold Garriston, their main port and their largest city,\nand your governors tax every orange and pomegranate and melon. I’ve been\nto Garriston, and it’s a shadow of its former greatness. The great irrigation\ncanals are full of sand. The fields are worked by women and children or no\none, and there’s not a drafter to be found.”\n“You pity them?” Delara Orange asked. “When my brothers rise from\nthe dead and the Castle of Ru is rebuilt, I’ll feel pity for Garriston. They\njoined Dazen. It was their war that killed tens of thousands. I saw them cast\nSatrapah Naheed’s two-year-old son down the Great Steps. I saw them cut\nopen her pregnant belly, take her babe, and make bets on how far down the\nsteps one of their men could throw the screaming child. They cut off the\nsatrapah’s nose and ears and breasts and arms and legs and threw her down\nafter. While we watched. The babe made it all the way to the last step, in\ncase you’re curious. I got some of its brain on my dress. I wanted to try to\ncatch it, but I didn’t move. No one did. Those are the people you wish us to\nhave mercy on? Or maybe it’s the people who sank the entire refugee\nflotilla, which had not a single drafter or armed man on board?”\nThat was Gavin’s fault. As Dazen. He’d sent a young, new general,\nGad Delmarta, who had always been efficient and direct. Gavin had told\nGad to secure Ru. General Delmarta had taken that to mean to secure it so\nthat there could never be any resistance ever again. He’d exterminated the\nroyal family—all fifty-six members of it and scores of their male retainers\n—publicly, one at a time, in the order of their succession, and burned down\ntheir great castle, the pride of Atash. When the people had fled, General\nDelmarta had sent fire drafters after the flotilla. Gavin had only found out\nabout it afterward, and then what could he do? It was war, and his general\nhad followed his orders, and when General Delmarta marched on the great\ncity of Idoss next, it had surrendered without a fight because of their fear of\nthe man, because of his cruelty.\n“Maybe,” Gavin said, “we could count how many children died when\nyou burned Garriston in retaliation and barred the gates so no one could"

I seem to recall that all the Tyrean drafters and all but two hundred\nof the Tyrean soldiers were a hundred leagues away at the time. How long\ndid it take for the river to clear of bodies? So many little corpses bobbing in\nthe water. Even with all those hundreds of sharks turning the bay to bloody\nfoam with their thrashing, it was weeks, wasn’t it?”\nGavin had never learned whose idea it was, but when Garriston had\nbeen burned, someone had stationed red drafters all around the walls.\nSoldiers shielded the drafters while they hurled red luxin back and forth in\nswathes throughout the city. Red luxin was used as fuel for lamps. Spread\nthroughout a city, it had made a hell for the residents of Garriston. Tens of\nthousands had jumped into the river, and thousands more had jumped in on\ntop of them. Their bodies themselves had almost been enough to dam the\nriver in places. And then some of his older brother’s cleverer drafters had\nfloated red luxin down the river in little boats of green or blue luxin, or\nmixed red and orange luxin to make a concoction so flammable it would\nburn even underwater, or mixed it with superviolet to make it float burning\non the very water itself. Between the fire, the smoke, the water, the press of\nthe crowds, the crushing deaths as whole buildings fell into the packed\nriver, and the fire floating down the river itself, there had been death on a\nscale no one had imagined before.\nBefore the war, Garriston had been home to more than a hundred\nthousand people. His own conscriptions had thinned that to perhaps eighty\nthousand. After the fires, only ten thousand remained, and after the first\nwinter, only five thousand.\n“Enough,” the Black said. Carver was no drafter, and so in some\nrespects he was the weakest member of the Spectrum. As the Black, he was\nresponsible for most of the mundane aspects of ruling Little Jasper:\nimporting food, managing trade, awarding contracts, recruiting and paying\nsoldiers, maintenance for buildings and the docks, building ships, and\neverything else that the White ceded to his control so she could focus on\nmanaging the Chromeria itself. But he was a formidable man, and Gavin\nrespected him. “We could list horrors all day, Lord Prism. What’s the\npoint?”\nThe point is, out of my five great purposes left, the only purely\naltruistic one is to free Garriston. Those people are suffering because of me,\nand you bastards have stopped every attempt I’ve made to help them.\n“The point is,” Gavin said, “that the Tyreans have as much reason to\nhate us as we have to hate them. We’ve been punishing them for the war for\nsixteen years. Most of the people paying the price now were children when\nthe war started. They see no reason they should continue paying for what\ntheir dead fathers did or didn’t do. They hate us, and the fact is, none of us\n—none of the Seven Satrapies—want to go back there with an army.”\n“What are you saying?” Luxlord Black asked. “Do you have specific"

He\nwas a coward in a dozen ways, but Ruthgar wasn’t going to give up\nGarriston easily, Gavin knew. “We’ve got a thousand soldiers and fifty\ndrafters there. The drafters alone could hold off whatever army this ‘King’\nGaradul could raise.”\n“Knuckling under to a rebel, a man who declares himself a king—it’s\nunthinkable,” the Orange said. “He deserves death.”\nOh, father, it’s too bad you never come anymore. You would enjoy\nthis. I can do one thing that you never could.\n“First,” Gavin said, “us leaving is the right thing to do. We’re\npunishing people who have suffered too much already, and they hate us for\nit. We’ve been planting the seeds of another war for the last sixteen years.\nThey started the war, yes. General Delmarta was born in Garriston, yes. But\nthat doesn’t excuse us from what we’ve done, which is not just wrong, but\nalso stupid.”\n“Excuse me?” Delara Orange said. Her predecessor to the Orange—\nher mother—had been the architect of the rotating occupation scheme.\n“You heard me,” Gavin said. “We get almost no Tyrean drafters. You\nthink that’s because none are born there anymore? Ha! What if, instead of\ntraining here, where they are poor and reviled and suspected as traitors,\nwhat if someone decided to train them closer to home? A new school, a\nChromeria dedicated to vengeance, started because of our pettiness and\nstupidity.”\n“Nonsense,” Delara said. “We would have heard of such a thing.”\n“But what if you hadn’t?” Gavin asked. “The quality of instruction\nmight not be as good as ours. I hope it wouldn’t be. But even with a few\nrudimentary fire spells, how long could your fifty drafters stationed in\nGarriston hold out against several hundred? How long could your soldiers\nhold out against thousands of rebels who could hide in plain sight among\nthe locals? The fact is, King Garadul will take Garriston. He will demand it,\non terms that he knows are insufferable, and then he will seize it. The only\nquestion is, will we lose and lose face and make King Garadul seem like a\nwinner, and finally get drawn into a war your satrapies don’t have the\nstomach for, or will we forgo a tribute which—after it’s divided six ways—\nis insignificant, and give away that which we can’t keep?

If\nwe give him an apology, we look moral, and if we do both before he asks,\nwe deprive him of a victory and a cause.”\n“Do you have evidence of all this?” Delara asked. She was slippery, as\noranges tended to be, but drafting red luxin made a drafter more aggressive\nand reckless over time, too. “Because it seems to me that you would like us\nto give away an entire city for little reason otherwise. We don’t know this\nnew King Garadul. He has only recently taken power. He hasn’t sent us a\nsingle emissary, much less made demands.”\n“You’re telling me none of you have spies at Garadul’s side?” Gavin\nshot back.\nA few sardonic smiles and silence. No one was going to admit that, of\ncourse. They didn’t trust each other enough. There had been no wars in the\nlast sixteen years, but that didn’t mean that everyone’s interests were\naligned. The Chromeria and every capital was as full of spies as it had ever\nbeen.\n“If you don’t,” Gavin said in an imperious tone sure to needle them,\n“get some.”\n“High Luxlord, we take your advice to the satrapies very seriously, of\ncourse—” Klytos Blue started to say. The Ruthgari hated Gavin, and had\nsince he’d ended the war with the Blood Forest.\nGavin cut him off. Time to play the hothead. “Listen, you morons. I\ndon’t know how you didn’t see this coming. Or maybe some of you did.\nYour loyalty is noted. The fact remains, this is rebellion and it’s heresy.\nKing Garadul is talking about overthrowing the satrapies and the worship of\nOrholam himself. I would have thought Orholam would command better\nservice from his Colors.”\n“Enough! Enough, Lord Prism!” the White barked. She looked at\nGavin like she couldn’t believe what he’d said.\nNothing like calling powerful men and women idiots, ingrates,\ndisloyal, and impious all at once. Looking around the room, Gavin saw\nshock on some faces and hatred on others.\nIn the silence, Klytos Blue spoke first. He was a blue. It was only\nnatural he should think things through faster than anyone else. “I believe\nthat we should take the Lord Prism seriously. It’s only prudent that we serve\nthe satrapies and Orholam as zealously as he does every day.” The words\nwere delivered straight, but the malice couldn’t have been more evident. “I\nmove that we send a delegation to Garriston, to assess the threat from the\nalleged rebel Garadul and report back to us directly.”\n“A delegation?! Are you blind or stupid or corrupt?” Gavin demanded.\n“By the time they—”\n“Gavin!” the White said. “Enough!”\nShe took the vote for a delegation to be sent and report back in two\nmonths’ time. It passed, five to zero, with two abstentions.\nGavin sat back in his chair, as if stunned, defeated. In the silence\nbefore anyone stood to leave, he shook his head. Said grimly, “I ceded"

Not to celebrate, not because she was impulsive, but because her\ncourage had been fading with every passing second. She’d been to half the\nmoneylenders on the islands before she found one willing to do business\nwith her.\nStepping inside her new room, she found that the tower’s slaves had\nbrought all her meager belongings over from the closet she’d called home\nfor the last three years. And there was a woman sitting on her bed.\n“Salvé, Liv, been out celebrating?” Aglaia Crassos asked.\n“What are you doing in my apartments?” Liv asked. “How’d you get\nin here?”\n“It’s not good to forget your friends, Aliviana.” Aglaia stood and came\nto stand a hand’s breadth from Liv’s face.\n“What? You’re here to threaten me? I’m shaking.”\nSomething ugly crossed Aglaia’s face, but then was replaced by that\nsmooth mask again, and that disingenuous laugh. “Careful with that sharp\ntongue, girl. You may cut your own throat.”\n“I’m done,” Liv said. “Gavin Guile has—”\n“Bought you to be his bed slave. I heard.”\n“Go to hell!” Liv said.\n“You’re the one who’ll do that, seeing how you’re throwing yourself at\nthe man who murdered your mother and destroyed your country.”\nIt was a tremendous slap. Liv took a step back.\nAglaia had made a reference to the burning of Garriston before, but\nLiv had never heard anything remotely like that. In truth, Liv had no idea,\nbut considering the source, she was willing to bet it was a lie. “The Prism\ndidn’t have anything to do with that.”\n“And you know that because he said so? Your mother died in those\nfires. Your father led the fight against Gavin Guile.”\n“What do you care about Garriston? Ruthgar fought on the Prism’s\nside. Your father fought beside Gavin.”\n“And my brother is the governor of Garriston, so I’m in a position to\nknow things,” Aglaia said. She lowered her voice and leaned in. “And\nmaybe now you are too.”\nSo that was what this was about. “No,” Liv said. “I’m finished with\nyou, with Ruthgar, and with your lies.” Fealty to One. That was the Danavis\nmotto, with strong suggestion that it was fealty only to one. And Liv wasn’t\nabout to serve this one.\n“Welcome to your new life, Liv. You’re important now.

The\ngood life can be yours.”\n“You can’t buy me,” Liv said.\n“We already did.”\n“Things are different now. By the Prism’s own command.”\nAglaia’s eyebrows rose slowly, making her horsey face seem even\nlonger. It was a practiced gesture, but then, nothing about her was genuine.\n“I’ve been working with you for, what, three years now? And I went back\nthrough my notes. I never thought you were a thief, Aliviana Danavis. But\nnow you’re abandoning your duty after three years of schooling. Three\nyears we’ve supported your every need—”\n“Oh so generously, too!” Liv said.\n“If it had been more generous, your debt would be that much greater\nnow. Here’s my question, Liv. What kind of woman are you?”\nIt was the same question that had put a quill in Liv’s hand to sign away\na fortune. With her new friendship with Gavin, she could probably tell the\nRuthgari to go bugger themselves. What could they say against the Prism’s\ndecision? And though Liv had gone from a nothing—a monochrome\ntalented in a minimally useful color—to a bichrome, she still wasn’t worth\nfighting over. Plenty of each nation’s investments went bad. Drafters died or\nburned out, or switched loyalty in the last year of their training. Every\nnation tried to steal drafters, and the Ruthgari were more successful at it\nthan anyone else, so surely they wouldn’t fight too hard to keep Liv.\nBut to be a Danavis was to act with honor. Always.\n“What do you want?” Liv asked.\n“You’ve been an embarrassment to me, Liv. The hardly talented\ndaughter of a rebel general. But now you’re going to be a jewel in my\ncrown. You will be my vengeance on those who thought to slight me. And\nfor that, I need you to be a success. You’ll already be collecting a generous\nallowance from the bursar out of the Chromeria’s general fund. Keep that,\nand we’ll pay you double as well. We’ll forgive your debt and the years of\nservice you already owe us. Hell, if you play your cards right, you can draw\nallowances from three or four nations before you leave the Jaspers. Indeed,\nyou won’t need to leave the Chromeria at all, if you serve us well. Think\nabout that: you can have a life here, at the center of the world, where\neverything important happens. Bed who you want, marry who you want,\ngive your children every advantage you were denied. Or you can go serve\nsome lordling somewhere, writing letters and examining his wife’s bed to\nsee if she’s faithful to him, hoping he’ll give you permission to marry\nsomeone you can tolerate.

Do you want me to betray him\nto hurt him, or it’s not really a betrayal at all because you aren’t going to\nhurt him?”\n“Well said,” Aglaia said. But then she continued, unflappable, “The\npoint is, you may be able to damage the man personally who is responsible\nfor so much havoc in your country, but your interference, your betrayal—\nperverse girl, insisting on calling the service of your own country a betrayal\n—your ‘betrayal’ won’t result in war. These lands have seen enough of\nthat.”\nIt took Liv a moment to digest. It did make sense. In a way.\n“But this is impossible. I don’t know the Prism. He’s talked to me\nonce. Once.”\n“And he liked you.”\n“I don’t know that I’d go that far.”\n“Do you have any idea how hard it is to get someone next to that man?\nWe’re going to give you all this just for trying. Besides, we know he has a\nweakness for Tyreans.” A tiny, quick lift of her eyebrows showed that she\nwas honestly surprised that the Prism would have such bad taste. “Maybe\nyou can use this son of his to get close to him. We don’t care.”\nIt was bad enough to be asked to betray the Prism, but to use Kip to get\nto him? No. Kip was a good boy. Liv wouldn’t do it. There was only one\nway out of this, and she’d known it all along.\nLiv pulled out three coin sticks. “This is how much the Ruthgari\ngovernment has spent on my upkeep for the last three years. With interest.\nHere, take it. I’m done with you. I’m free. I don’t owe you anything.”\nAglaia Crassos didn’t even look at the coins. She didn’t ask how Liv\nhad gotten so much money. In truth, it had taken signing over a writ to an\nAbornean moneylender that would allow him to receive her allowance\ndirectly, and a ruinous interest rate. Liv was a pauper once more. She’d\nhave to sell some of the marvelous dresses they’d given her just to stay\nafloat. “Liv, Liv, Liv. I don’t want to be your enemy.

A nobleman’s slave?\nThe slave handed Liv a note. “Mistress,” she said. “From the High\nLord Prism.”\nLiv Danavis stared at the note, feeling stupid, off balance. It read,\n“Please come see me at your earliest convenience.” Her heart leapt into her\nthroat. A summons from the Prism. So here it was, the beginning of her\npaying her debt to Gavin Guile. She didn’t fool herself by hoping it would\nbe the end of it, too. When you owed a luxlord, you owed them forever.\nShe just hadn’t thought he’d ask for her so soon.\nOddly, the first thing she thought of was, What do you wear for an\naudience with the Prism? Liv didn’t usually pay much attention to her\nchoice of clothing. Maybe that was because when you only have a few\nchanges of clothes, you wear what’s clean and despair of ever wearing\nwhat’s fashionable. That, of course, had changed instantly. Gavin had\nordered that she be kept in an equivalent fashion to a Ruthgari bichrome,\nand that meant lots of clothes, a few jewels, and this huge apartment—\nliterally five times larger than the one she’d lived in for the last three years.\nAnd though she might not have any money, now she had makeup. Now she\nhad options, and she wasn’t sure she liked it. The idea of turning into a\nprissy girl like Ana made Liv’s stomach turn.\nThe slave was still standing at the door, waiting to be dismissed with\nthe pleasant, neutral expression of a woman ignoring the cluelessness of her\nsuperior.\n“Pardon me, caleen,” Liv said, “but would you help me?” Liv always"

No one in Rekton had\nbeen rich enough to afford one, and the few slaves that came through\nworking with the caravans were treated the same as other servants. Things\nwere more formal at the Chromeria, and most of the other students had\ngrown up having slaves or at least being around them, so Liv always felt\nlike everyone else knew what to do, while she was all thumbs. She still felt\nweird calling a woman ten years her senior by the diminutive “caleen.”\nOf course, now that Liv was a bichrome, she was going to have to get\nused to it fast, or she was going to look like an idiot even more often than\nusual.\nThe slave cocked an eyebrow like any twenty-eight-year-old would at\nany seventeen-year-old being foolish.\n“I don’t know what to wear,” Liv said in a rush. “I don’t even know\nwhat ‘at your earliest convenience’ means. Does that mean actually at my\nearliest convenience, or does it mean go right this moment, even if I were\njust wearing a towel?”\n“You can take a few minutes to dress appropriately,” the slave said.\nLiv stood paralyzed. Was what she was wearing now appropriate?\n“Most women called to the Prism’s room wear something more…\nelegant,” the slave said, eyeing Liv’s plain skirt and blouse.\nMaybe the fitted blue dress, then. Or that odd Ilytian black silk sheath.\nBut that was more of an evening dress, wasn’t it? Or should she wear the\nshockingly small… Liv wrinkled her nose. There was something about the\nslave’s statement that made her nervous. She could just imagine a\nprocession of beautiful women queued up outside the Prism’s door. Liv had\nnever heard any gossip about who the Prism took to his bed, but she wasn’t\nexactly in the middle of the juicy gossip circles, and she could certainly\nimagine more than a few girls willing to dress or undress any way the Prism\nwanted. In addition to basically being the center of the universe, he was\ngorgeous, commanding, witty, smart, young, rich, and unmarried.\nWhoever had packed her drawers with cosmetics had bought mostly\nskin lighteners or darkeners. But with Liv’s kopi-and-cream-colored skin,\nshe didn’t have a hope of looking as light as a west Atashian. Her eyes were\ntoo dark anyway. And with wavy hair, even with a darkener on her skin, she\nwasn’t going to look Parian. There was no hiding that she was Tyrean.\nAll those other girls and women would look fantastic in their fancy\ndresses and perfect makeup. They’d feel comfortable, beautiful. Liv would\nfeel like a fool and look like a tramp.\nHow many of the women called to the Prism’s room had gone with\nulterior motives? How many had been acting for one country or another?\nHow many of the ones who hadn’t been co-opted had gone with their own\nagenda anyway? All of them? She wasn’t going upstairs to seduce Gavin\nGuile—to hell with Aglaia and her ilk—so why should she make herself\nlook like she was?"

She wasn’t going upstairs to seduce Gavin\nGuile—to hell with Aglaia and her ilk—so why should she make herself\nlook like she was?\n“To hell with it,” Liv said. She didn’t swear much, but it felt good right\nnow. She threw down a dress that probably cost as much as she’d spent all\nlast year. “It’s convenient for me to go right now.”\nThe slave looked like she wanted to speak, but she stopped herself.\n“This way, ma’am.”\nAfter they headed up the luxlords’ lift, the slave led Liv to the\nBlackguards stationed there. The woman of the pair searched Liv for\nweapons. Thoroughly.\nLiv couldn’t help but feel a little violated. “They take their job\nseriously, don’t they?” she said as they finally led her to what Liv assumed\nwas the Prism’s door.\n“Do you have any idea what it would mean for the world if the Prism\ndied? He’s not always an easy man, but he’s a much better man than Prisms\nusually are. And there are many of us who would do anything for him.\nAnything. Remember that… ma’am.”\nOrholam’s prickly beard, but the slave woman was protective.\nThe slave stopped at the door, knocked three times, and opened it. Liv\nstepped into the Prism’s room and found him sitting behind a desk, staring\nat her. His eyes were entrancing. Right now, they looked like diamonds,\nscattering light everywhere. He gestured to the chair across from him, and\nLiv sat.\n“Thank you, Marissia, you may go,” Gavin said to the slave. Then he\nturned his diamond eyes on Liv and said, “It’s time for that favor.”\nChapter 42\n“Scout!” Corvan called. “She’s seen us. Sonuvabitch!”\nAfter Rekton, Corvan and Karris had decided to travel together. Both\nwanted to go after King Garadul’s army, if for different reasons: Karris to\njoin it somehow, and Corvan to see if he could find some way to exact\nvengeance. It was a risk to trust Corvan Danavis, of all people, but he had\nsaved Karris and his reputation from the war was sterling. Truth was, it was\nmore dangerous to travel alone.\nThey’d been following King Garadul’s army south for days, and not\nonce had he put out scouts. He’d seemed so careless that now Karris and\nCorvan had walked right past a scout in a tree stand.\nAs they stood at the edge of a wood, half a league behind the rear\nguard, the scout was sprinting to the east, down a slight hill, rather than\ngoing straight for the rear guard.\n“She’ll have a horse down in the gully there. You might be able to cut\nher off,” Corvan said. He was unslinging his great yew bow. “Shot’s too far.\nBut I might get lucky.”\nKarris was already running. Away from the Umber River, Tyrea had\nrapidly become a scrub brush desert. In a few spots fed by underground\nsprings, there were clumps of pine trees like the one she and Corvan had\njust left, but for the most part this land was rolling hills, often broken,\nsomething between a desert and a badland.

It had made their pursuit of\nKing Garadul’s army more and more difficult, because even though they\nwere traveling by foot and thus didn’t kick up the huge quantities of dust\nthat Garadul’s men and wagons did, they still could be seen. They had to\ndecide at every hill whether they should go straight over and risk being\nseen, or go around and lose even more ground. An army didn’t travel fast,\nbut it did travel straight.\nThe scout was a good two hundred paces in front of Karris. Judging\nfrom the slight slope of the hill, and making a guess, Karris angled off to\nthe right. Probably the scout would make it to her horse, but if Karris were\nwithin a hundred paces when the scout mounted, she wouldn’t be mounted\nfor long.\nSomething dove out of the sky and pierced the ground not five paces\nbehind the fleeing scout. She didn’t even notice. Damn. Corvan had nearly\nhit a sprinting target at two hundred fifty paces. That close and he couldn’t\nhave gotten just a little closer?\nThe woman turned and angled more to the right. Corvan’s second\narrow missed by a good fifteen paces, flying where she might have been if\nshe’d run straight.\nKarris barreled on, heedless of the ground, hurdling tumbleweed and\npraying that she not step on the infrequent tough cactus that grew so low to\nthe ground here that you never saw it until its spines stabbed through your\nshoes. And that wasn’t as bad as the rattling snakes. At the speed Karris was\nrunning, of course, there would be no warning rattle, just a strike. She\npushed harder. Maybe if she ran fast enough, even a striking snake might\nmiss her.\nOut of the corner of her eye, she saw Corvan’s next arrow streak into\nview. The shot was more than three hundred paces now, albeit with no\nwind, so Corvan was having to shoot halfway between the horizon and\nvertical simply for the arrows to make the distance. But this shot looked\nperfect.\nIt dove and the scout crashed into the ground, full speed. Karris\ncouldn’t believe her eyes. An impossible shot. Three hundred paces at a\nrunning target? She cut left, heading straight for the woman.\nAlmost as soon as Karris turned, she saw Corvan’s arrow. Sticking out\nof the ground. Back where the scout had fallen. It hadn’t impaled her. It had\ntripped her.\nEven as Karris saw it, she saw the woman standing, her head swiveling\ntoward Karris. She looked shaken, her palms bloody, a cut down the side of\nher face, but the woman started running regardless.\nKarris had easily covered a hundred of the two hundred paces between\nthem, and as the scout had to go from a dead stop to sprinting, Karris made\nup more than half of that. She wasn’t even thirty paces back.\nNo more arrows fell. They were out almost four hundred paces now.\nEven with a yew longbow this was an extreme distance. There was no way\nCorvan would risk an errant shot with Karris so close to their quarry."

There was no way\nCorvan would risk an errant shot with Karris so close to their quarry.\nKarris fumbled with her necklace, trying to grab her eye caps. Even\nbreaking stride that much gave the scout an edge, and she pulled away.\nCurse her, the woman ran like an antelope. But with the patience born of\nexperience, Karris let her take the extra distance. Once she got the green-\nand-red eye caps on, the fight was over.\nShe cracked apart the appropriate link of her necklace, watching the\nground in front of her, ripped the luxin off, and slowed for a few steps to get\nthe caps stuck perfectly around each eye socket.\nThe scout cut hard left as the hill descended rapidly, shouting. Karris\ncame after her, filling her right arm with red luxin and her left with green as\nshe ran.\nThe scout was shouting? To whom?\nMaybe she was shouting to her horse.\nSure she is, Karris.\nIn an instant, Karris was over the hill and barreling down the steep\npath straight into a camp. There were a dozen men waiting for her. At least\ntwo with nets. Two with catchpoles. Cudgels, staves. Swords sheathed. Not\nwanting to kill, but capture. A trap.\nKarris felt sick horror, the shot like a fist in her gut. Like she was\nsixteen again, her father dragging her to a boat, sailing away from Big\nJasper. Her father’s boat had sailed past the family mansion, where she’d\nsecretly—she thought—agreed to meet Dazen. Her brothers were there,\nlying in wait. They’d said they were going to teach Dazen a lesson for\ntrying to destroy their family. But she’d seen murder in their eyes.\nShe had been standing on the deck when an explosion had blown out\nall the windows of her room on the second floor of the mansion. She saw\nfigures limned in fire, fighting.\nSomething ripped off half the roof and explosion followed explosion.\nBodies were hurled a hundred paces out into the water. Standing next to her\non deck, her father paled. “You said he was coming alone, you stupid slut.\nLook what you’ve done! He must have brought an army!” Her father didn’t\nstrike her, just grabbed her head and made her watch what she couldn’t\nhave torn her eyes away from if she tried. In minutes, the only home she’d\never known was engulfed in flames.\nShe’d been a child then. She’d been unable to think, unable to act. She\nwasn’t a child any longer, and she had pools of rage to draw from that that\ninnocent hadn’t known.\nKarris used the height disparity of coming down the steep trail to leap\nat the first of the two horsemen who were side by side. He was holding a\ncatchpole in both hands and he brought it up sideways, trying to block. He\ncaught her extended foot, but she just let her kick collapse and slammed\ninto him with both knees.\nRibs crunched as she swept him out of his saddle. She rolled as she hit\nthe ground, but had to catch herself with her right hand, which was holding\nher narrow ataghan, so she drafted a thin blade of green luxin from her left"

The blade passed through its\nbelly easily.\nKarris was on her feet before the horse even reared in pain. She let the\ngreen luxin disintegrate as she charged one of the net men, switching her\nsword to her left hand. He was too stunned. He didn’t move, not even as she\nlunged full length, stabbing at his face, her right hand flinging a weak arc of\nfire behind her for distraction. The net man still didn’t move, and her lunge\nconnected. The blade caught him between the eyes, skidded off the bone,\nand dove deep through his eye.\nTurning to follow the arc of fire she’d thrown, Karris saw a weighted\nnet spinning toward her just as the arc of fire faded from the air. Perfect\nthrow.\nBut she waited, waited, switching sword hands again, until the net was\nbetween her and a man swinging a staff overhead at her.\nWith a snapping pop-pop, Karris shot out two horseshoes of green\nluxin. One whistled harmlessly through the twisting, expanding net. But\nthough it missed the net, the horseshoe did catch the staff-swinger in the\ncheek, blasting him off balance. The second horseshoe snagged the net as it\npassed through and whipped it back into several men, its leaden weights\nsuddenly becoming a flail.\nThe horse was rearing now, screaming in pain, a hideous sound. Its\nentrails spurted out in a bloody, ropy mass. But Karris barely heard it,\nbarely saw it. She saw only chaos, and chaos was her friend, chaos was her\nadvantage when fighting these odds.\nMen were falling away from her on every side. Karris flung little balls\nof fire at the tents nearest her, blocking her view, curse being short! Where\nwas the man shouting orders? The tents went up in flames, but it didn’t\nseem to faze anyone but Karris. Everyone was fleeing.\nShe was just beginning to get a sense of how many men were in this\ncamp—there were dozens of tents, maybe a hundred men? Orholam, she\nhad to get out! Then she heard a thunderous roar. The ground around her\nfeet jumped into the air as musket balls struck and the concussion of their\nfire rolled over her.\nShe looked up and saw a wide half-circle of musketeers, at least forty\nof them. Half were reloading in smooth, practiced motions. Unhurried. Well\ntrained. The other half had their muskets, still loaded, trained on Karris.\n“The next volley takes your life, Karris White Oak!” a man shouted.\nHe was lean, mounted, wearing rich garments that announced he was King\nRask Garadul, if the smug expression on his face hadn’t. “The sword and\nthe luxin. Now,” he said.\nKarris looked at the semicircle of blasted dirt in front of her, trying to\ngauge the accuracy of the king’s musketeers. Pretty damn good. They were\nonly twenty paces away.

King Garadul’s armor\nwas, of course, mirrored, and he had Mirrormen and drafters to his left and\nright. What about Corvan?\nIf Corvan ran as fast as she had, he might get here at any time—Karris\nalways lost track of time once fighting started. Maybe he’d already seen\nwhat she had gotten into. Either way, not even he could do anything against\nthese odds. He certainly couldn’t save Karris from twenty musketeers with\nan easy shot at her.\nKarris pulled off her eye caps and dropped them and threw her sword\naway and let the green and red dribble from her fingertips. Usually, when\nshe let the luxin go, she felt less wild, less angry. Not this time.\n“Galan?” King Garadul said, gesturing to someone behind her.\nKarris was starting to turn when something heavy cracked her over the\nhead.\nChapter 43\nKip followed Commander Ironfist up another flight of steps, which\ndisgorged them in front of the biggest double doors Kip had ever seen. The\ndoors were a slightly smoky glass filled with slow waves of every hue, a\ngreat lake of color.\nCommander Ironfist lifted one great silver knocker and pounded it\nonto the door three times. It was as if he’d thrown three rocks into a pond of\nlight. Though the door itself didn’t move, the light within it cratered and\nthrew ripples out in every direction. It took Kip’s breath away. He put a\nhand on the door, and where his fingers touched, tiny ripples formed.\n“Don’t touch,” Ironfist barked.\nKip pulled back his hand as if burned.\n“There are a few things you need to know before you go in, Kip,”\nIronfist said. “First, it’s all real. We lose one out of every ten supplicants.”\n“Lose as in…”\n“They die. Second, you can make it stop whenever you want. There\nwill be a rope put in your hand. Pull the rope, and it will ring a bell. They’ll\nstop immediately. Third, if you quit, you’re finished, you can’t stay. It costs\na lot of money for a satrap to maintain a drafter, and not one of them will\nwaste money on a coward. Gavin has instructed me that should you fail, I’m\nto give you enough silver to buy a small farm and put you on a ship to the\ndestination of your choice. It’s better than most failures get, but you’ll not\nbe allowed to return here ever again. You’re a shame enough as it is.”\nApparently tact wasn’t part of the test. “I’m shameful?” Kip asked, a\nlump rising in his throat. Gavin hadn’t treated him like that.\nIronfist blinked. “The life of a drafter is hard and short. I don’t have\ntime for lies, no matter how comforting. You’re a bastard. That’s a common\nenough shame for a great man, but it’s a shame nonetheless. Anyone who\ncan do simple arithmetic will know that you were sired while the Prism was\nbetrothed to Karris White Oak, a woman most of us hold in high regard."

Not only would he shame the\nman who’d saved his life, but he would lose his only chance for retribution\non the man who’d taken his mother’s.\nKip wasn’t going to fail. He’d die first.\nIronfist saw the look on his face. “Good.”\nThe great doors in front of Kip rippled once more, the molten\niridescent hues undulating gently and then seeming to spill left and right. It\nwas as if something huge were surfacing from unimaginable depths. Kip’s\nheart seized as a great face appeared, so fast he couldn’t even comprehend\nall the details, just white hair, eyes like stars, and water of every shade\nbursting away from his features as he burst free—and opened his mouth, a\nyawning cavern of blackness that overwhelmed the doors. Kip flinched as it\nseemed the mouth would swallow him.\nThe doors burst open from within as if a giant had smashed them. A\ngust of air rushed over Kip.\n“Enter,” Ironfist commanded.\nKip walked in alone to a round chamber. The walls and floor were the\nsame smoky-clear crystal as the door. Seven figures stood in a crescent\naround a black disk inlaid in the floor. Kip hesitated, and none of them\nmoved. No one told him where to go.\nThe figures were robed, one for each color. The superviolet wore violet\nrobes and sub-red wore deep red robes for the benefit of those who couldn’t\nsee into their spectra, but as Kip widened and then tightened his eyes, he\nsaw that the sub-red was indeed radiating heat and the superviolet was clad\nin his color, hard pieces of superviolet luxin hooked together like rings of\nmail.\nStill uncertain, Kip walked toward them. As he got closer, he could see\nbeneath their hoods. His fists balled. The sub-red had blackened skin. No\neyebrows. No hair. Little flame wisps escaped from its head. The green’s\nface was gnarled as an old oak, its eyebrows like moss, hair strung with\nlichen. The blue looked like cut glass, features either smoothed out to\nplanes or sharpened to jewel-like points.\nDear Orholam, were these all color wights? Then, from within his\nsleek goo, the orange blinked. Kip noticed the eyes. All of their eyes.\nThese were drafters in masks and makeup. They represented the\nwights of each color. Seven different varieties of death and dishonor. Kip\nstarted breathing again, though he couldn’t control a little tremble. He\nstepped onto the black disk facing them."

But the hole was too narrow.\nHis fat caught on the sharp sides of the floor. He had to shimmy just to fit,\nand as the hole deepened, either his stomach or his butt was pressing\nagainst a wall.\n“Raise your right hand,” the superviolet said.\nAs Kip did, swallowing convulsively, he saw a rope dropping all the\nway from a ceiling so high above that he couldn’t see past the glare of its\nbrightness.

Kip\ncould see nothing.\nHe tried to take a deep breath, but the chamber was so tight he couldn’t\neven draw a full breath.\nThere were whispered voices above him. “Dees, will you run this test\nfor me?”\nA man’s voice replied, awkward, “I’ve never run one before, my lord.\nYou know, I think we set the tube too narrow.

It ran down the back of his neck\nto where his back was pressed tight against the walls. The walls around him\npulsed an intense blue. Dear Orholam, they were going to kill him to get\nback at his father. Just like Gavin had warned him.\nThe water pooled around his middle.

The pooled water poured\ndown to his feet. But it kept coming from above.\nFor a few moments, he was able to intermittently push against the wall\nand make it drain once more, but soon he was awash, nearly floating. He\npushed against the wall again, and the water didn’t drain at all. There was\nnowhere for it go.\nThe water rose once more to his left shoulder, which was trapped down\neven as his right was trapped up. Then up to his neck. His left ear.\nHe didn’t notice when the walls pulsed superviolet, but then they\npassed through blue, to green as the water rose to his chin, to yellow as it\ntouched his lips, orange as it covered his lips—was the water falling more\nslowly on his head now? He took deep breaths through his nose, wriggled\nto try to use his body’s wedged-in position to climb higher in the tube, and\nfound that there were straps above his shoulders, keeping him down.\nThis was insanity. Someone was trying to kill him. Kip had to ring the\nbell. His fingers were claws around the rope. He could try again when there\nwasn’t a murderer around.\nNo. Quitting meant being put out. It meant failing.\nThere was barely time to take one last deep breath before the water\ncovered Kip’s nose.\nThe falling water pelting his head abruptly ceased. Kip could imagine\nit now: “He was so fat, he trapped the water. It wasn’t supposed to be that\nhigh. We didn’t put too much water in… he just panicked. You know, a\nchild, trapped and afraid. He must not have even thought to pull the rope.”\nSo that was it. He either quit and shamed his father more than his very\nexistence already did, or his father’s enemies did their best to kill him.\nHolding his breath, his lungs just beginning to burn, there was a\nsudden, stark clarity to the world: pull the rope, go home.\nBut, there was no home. So, pull the rope, and go farm… somewhere.\nOr stay, and maybe die. Fail here, and he failed his father and his mother.\nFail here, and he was a failure forever.\nI’m not pulling the rope.\nThe chamber went black. The water got hot from the sub-red light, but\nthen even that faded.\nI don’t like farming. Kip coughed out some of his air, laughing, the\nthought was so inane. But the pain rapidly squelched wry humor. He\ncouldn’t make his heart slow. He couldn’t stop his throat from swallowing\nconvulsively, his chest from pumping on nothing. I’m not pulling the rope,\ndamn you. I’m not pulling the rope.\nSomething shifted. At first, Kip thought it was the water pouring out,\nbut it wasn’t. The ground below him was rising, but the stops above his\nshoulders stayed in place, crushing him in place. The water, far from\ndraining, simply rose up his raised arm. In moments, he squatted down,\npushed against his own knees. It squeezed him and he coughed, the last of\nhis breath bubbling out."

It squeezed him and he coughed, the last of\nhis breath bubbling out.\nHe was trying to hold on to nothing. Breathing the water in would be\nworse than breathing nothing at all, he knew it. He knew it and yet his body\noverwhelmed him and he sucked a breath in. The water was hot, sharp,\nacrid in his lungs. He gagged, hunched even tighter against his own knees,\nhis body ripping itself apart. He coughed and, miraculously, water shot out\nof his mouth into air, blessed, glorious, free, beautiful air!\nGasping, spitting, retching, and still compressed into a ball, Kip\nbreathed. He could breathe! Mostly. His knees hurt from being squashed\ntighter than his not-so-flexible joints would allow. His back hurt. His ribs\nhurt. But Orholam, the air was good. If only he could get a full breath.\nNothing happened. It was still utterly black. Kip was sweating now. He\nwas packed in here. It was getting hotter by the second and he was still\ndripping wet. The colors flashed past him, through the whole spectrum\nagain.\nSo that’s how it was. They saw that he wasn’t going to quit, so they\nweren’t going to give him another chance with the colors.\nIt didn’t matter. I’m not pulling the rope. “I’m not pulling the rope!”\nKip shouted. Or tried to shout; he wasn’t very loud with only a half a\nbreath.\nIn response, the floor rose even more, crushing him harder against the\nstays on his shoulders. Kip screamed. He sounded like a coward.\nHe couldn’t even push back against the stays. His knees were bent too\nfar to get him any leverage. If he just pulled on the rope a little, he could get\na breath, and then he could go on fighting.\nNo! Kip deliberately relaxed his fingers, his arm. He concentrated on\nbreathing. Tiny, quick little breaths.\nIt was enough. It would be enough. He was making it enough.\nA succession of colors blurred past. Kip didn’t care. Was he supposed\nto do something? What? Draft? Right. Go bugger yourselves.\nThe pressure eased suddenly and the floor dropped. Then the walls\neased wider. Kip almost fell, but after a moment his rubbery legs were able\nto take his weight. The walls pulled back farther, farther. He tried to take a\nwider stance, but there was nothing beyond his little disk except air.\nReaching one hand out, Kip couldn’t feel the walls at all. A breeze\nblew across his skin, giving him the sensation that he was standing on some\nhigh place. It had to be an illusion, though, he was in the middle of the\nschool. No way was there a big hole here.\nColors flashed through distant walls, illuminating the chamber for a\nbrief, terrifying moment. Kip stood over an abyss. His disk was the tiny\nround top of a pillar: a pillar standing alone in the middle of nothingness.\nThe walls were thirty paces away. The ceiling over his head had a single\nhole, through which only his hand was poking."

The ceiling over his head had a single\nhole, through which only his hand was poking.\nWind buffeted him, and Kip felt his grip go white-knuckled on the\nrope. He clamped his eyes shut, but then he couldn’t tell if he was swaying\nwith the wind or against it or staying still. His heart was beating so hard he\ncould hear his own pulse in his ears between gasping breaths. He screamed\nwords, but he didn’t even know what they were.\nAfter an eternity, the walls came back. They closed firmly around him,\nbut comfortably now, and he felt a surge of relief. He’d made it. He’d\npassed. He hadn’t given up. He’d hadn’t pulled the—Something touched his\nleg.\nWhat was that?\nIt curled around his ankle, twisted around his calf. A snake. Kip looked\nup and some many-legged thing dropped on his face.\nHe reached a spastic hand up to sweep a spider away, but felt a\nmanacle snap over his wrist and pull his left arm away, lock it into place.\nHe tried to kick the snake away from his feet. Snap, snap. Shackles closed\naround his feet and yanked them wide apart.\nKip screamed.\nThe spider fell into his mouth.\nBefore he even knew what he was doing, Kip bit down fiercely on it,\ncrushing it in his teeth, sour goo squirting into his mouth. He screamed\nagain, sheer defiance. Something landed in his hair. Dozens of slithering\nthings roped around his feet, climbed his legs. He was going crazy.\n“I’m not pulling the rope!” he shouted. “You bastards, I’m not pulling\nthe rope!”\nKip convulsed. Orholam have mercy. His whole body was covered\nwith loathsome things. He was weeping, screaming—and salvation lay in\nhis hand. There was nothing wrong with farming. No one would hold\nfailure against him. He didn’t need to see these people ever again. And what\ndid he care what they thought of him anyway? The whole game was stacked\nagainst him. He was finished. It was over.\nWith an inhuman cry, Kip took the rope, with all his loathing and fury\nand despair rising in him, totally overwhelming him, failure calling his\nname—and threw it out of the hole. He sank against the wall, burying his\nface in the rock, crying.\nColors flashed past once more, but the snakes and spiders didn’t go.\nThey covered his body.\nStill the oppressive darkness continued. Something heavy and hairy\nlanded on his back. Little claws stabbed him through his shirt. A rat. Then\none on his thigh. Another landed on his head, scratching him as it slid off\nhis wet hair.\nKip froze. Fear like lightning flashed through his entire body. He was\nin a cupboard, helpless, starving, parched. He shivered uncontrollably.\nHis motion disrupted the nasties and something bit him. He yelped,\nhumiliated, furious. He twisted. More prickly bites, stinging bites, savage\nbites covered his arm, his legs, his groin, his back. Kip thrashed, throwing\nhimself against one wall and then the other, trying to crush the beasts.

Rats\nwere climbing up his body on every side, and they refused to let go. He was\nweeping. He was so ashamed. There was something about the spider. The\nspider he’d bitten.\nIt was too much. He couldn’t take it anymore. He was finished. Kip\ncouldn’t stop himself. He reached for the rope. He was a failure, a shame, a\nfat, blubbering coward. A nothing.\nHe felt the rope pressed back into his hand. “Here you go, Tubby,” a\nsatisfied voice whispered. The taste, Kip. The taste was wrong, a kind voice\nsaid.\nWhat the woman had said didn’t quite register. They were all over him.\nKip pulled the rope. Failure.\nA distant clang, high overhead. At once, the stinging ceased. Every\nslithering, crawling, clinging, stinging thing evaporated, disappeared. They\nweren’t real. They hadn’t been real rats. Kip should have known from the\nspider he’d bitten. Would have known, if he hadn’t been such a coward.\nThat goo inside hadn’t been guts, it had been luxin. It was all illusions, fake\nfears. He’d been tricked.\nHe’d failed. As the platform rose, Kip’s brain—no longer fogged with\nterror—realized what the woman had called him: “Tubby.” It was what\nRam used to call him. Kip died a little. He’d proved Ram right. Again.\nAs he emerged, though, the men and women were now dressed in\nfestive robes of their own colors, dazzling sapphire blues, emerald greens,\ndiamond yellows, ruby reds. They appeared jubilant.\n“Congratulations, supplicant!” Mistress Varidos said, coming to join\nthe circle.\nKip stared at her, dumbfounded.\n“Four minutes and twelve seconds. You should be very proud. I’m sure\nyour father will be.”\nShe was speaking some language Kip didn’t understand. Proud? He’d\nfailed. He’d shamed himself, shamed his father. He’d given up. The rage\nand frustration that had been building up suddenly had nowhere to go,\nleaving him feeling stupid.\n“I failed,” Kip said.\n“Everybody fails!” the incredibly muscular superviolet said. “You did\ngreat! Four minutes twelve! I only lasted a minute six.”\n“I don’t understand,” Kip said.\nThe nymphish yellow laughed. “That’s how the test is designed. We all\nfailed.”\nThey surrounded him, men pounding him on the back, women\ntouching his arms or shoulder, all congratulating him. It was a bit\nintoxicating to be so wholeheartedly welcomed by people who were so\nbeautiful. Now that his brain was working again, he noticed that they hadn’t\nnecessarily chosen men to represent the old gods and women for the\ngoddesses. Was that because they’d come so far that it simply didn’t matter\nanymore, or was it deliberate disrespect?\n“Is it true?” Kip asked Mistress Varidos, who had stood back some lest\nthe jostling crowd knock her over. “Everyone fails?”"

It’s not to see if you can make it\nthrough the test, it’s to see what kind of a person you are. And fear widens\nyour eyes. Those colors you saw flashing past were the real test. Those will\ntell us what you can draft. Are you ready to see your results?”\n“Wait. ‘Almost everyone’? Who doesn’t fail?” Kip asked.\nThe jubilant men and women quieted.\nThe old woman said, “The only person in my lifetime who didn’t take\nthe rope was…”\nGavin. Kip knew it. Of course. His father had been the one man who\ndid what no one else could do, what no one else had ever done. Kip had\nfailed him.\n“Your uncle,” the mistress said.\nMy “uncle” Gavin, or my uncle Dazen?\nApparently registering his confusion, she said, “Your uncle Dazen\nGuile, who nearly destroyed our world. Good footsteps not to follow, hm?”\nShe was speaking that other language again. After all Kip had seen\nGavin do, it was Gavin’s brother who’d passed?\n“Four minutes is wonderful, Kip, but that’s just bragging rights. Are\nyou ready to see your colors?”\nChapter 44\nLiv dropped into a curtsey, glad for the excuse to break eye contact with the\nPrism. When she straightened, Gavin Guile was looking at her critically.\nObviously she’d been right, not many women answered his summonses in\ntheir work clothes and no cosmetics.\n“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a proper Tyrean curtsey,” the\nPrism said.\nAfter your armies left, there weren’t many women left to curtsey.\n“How may I serve you, High Luxlord Prism?” Liv asked instead.\n“Lord Prism is sufficient,” Gavin said.\n“Thank you, Lord Prism.”\nHe was obviously weighing her, thinking. But thinking what?\nWhatever else that wretched woman Aglaia Crassos had done, she’d made\nLiv think of the Prism as Gavin Guile—a man, and a good-looking one at\nthat. His eyes were—quite literally—the most entrancing eyes in the entire\nworld.\nMagister, Liv. Tutor. Lord. Luxlord. Noble. General. Twice as old as\nyou. Way too old for you. Not a broad-shouldered, muscular man—just\nanother magister. You can go to hell, Aglaia Crassos.\n“Have you chosen who you want to be your magister in yellow?” he\nasked.\nThank you!\nSee, I’m a disciple. Purely academic. A child in comparison to him.\nHopelessly young and ignorant. She pursed her lips. “Honestly, I’d like to\nstudy under Mistress Tawenza Goldeneyes.” She could barely believe she’d\ndared say it out loud. The woman only took three disciples a year—and she\nalready had three. The three best yellow disciples in the Chromeria.\nGavin laughed. “That prickly she-bear? A bold choice. She’s the best,\nand she probably won’t hate you as much as you think she does for the first"

I’d have you send my compliments to her when I assign her a fourth\nstudent, but she’d doubtless take it out on you. Consider it done. How are\nyour apartments?”\nShe paused. It was almost a personal question. No, he’s simply worried\n—no, not worried, he’s checking that his orders have been carried out.\nGenerals do that sort of thing. “They’re better than anything I thought I’d\never have, Lord Prism. And the clothes? I used to have three dresses. Now\nI’ve got more than fifty and my worst is nicer than my old Sun Day best.”\nWait, maybe clothes weren’t the best topic.\n“And yet you decided to come in this,” Gavin said, noticing. Oops. His\nvoice didn’t intone disapproval. If anything, there was a thin thread of\namusement. But his face didn’t give her any expression to know if he was\nirritated. She should have listened to that slave, Marissia. It wouldn’t have\nkilled her to freshen up a little. He glanced past her, and she followed his\ngaze, but the room was empty except for the two of them, and there were no\nunusual decorations on the walls, just the normal testing crystal.\n“You said to come at my earliest convenience.” She couldn’t keep a\ndefensive tone out of her voice. “I thought you’d not want to be kept\nwaiting.” That was better. Nicely assertive, Liv.\n“I think you’ll do perfectly.”\n“Lord Prism?”\n“You’re perfect because you refuse to be impressed, Aliviana. I like\nthat. It—”\n“I wouldn’t exactly say I’m not impressed!”\nHe grinned. “You say, interrupting me.”\nAnd proving his point.\nLiv decided to shut up. Maybe differentiating herself from all the other\nwomen who came here—and were unsuccessful in their attempts to seduce\nGavin—had not been a good plan.\n“It seems every time I summon a woman between the ages of thirteen\nand sixty, she comes dressed like a Ruthgari courtesan, either overly eager\nor completely terrified. Like I run a brothel up here.”\nOh, Orholam strike me, what if I’ve done the one thing that makes me\nmore attractive to him? “You’re Gavin Guile,” Liv said, like that explained\neverything. It did. Not only would snaring the Prism totally change a\nwoman’s own life, but it would change her entire family’s life. Immediately\nand for generations to come, and for the better. Add gorgeous and virile to\n“Prism,” which already meant powerful, respected, and rich, and Liv had no\ndoubt that hemlines soared and necklines swooped. It was a wonder that\nwomen didn’t come to the Prism naked. How much would Ana have worn if\nthe Prism had summoned her?\nOn second thought, Liv didn’t want to think about that.\n“Yes, I am,” Gavin said, smirking as if at some private joke. “And I\nneed your help, Aliviana.”\nLiv swallowed. The truth was, he could ask anything, and there was no\nway she could say no. “Liv, please.”"

Why is he clearing his throat? He\nfeels awkward? Does he feel awkward starting an affair with a girl half his\nage?\nGavin glanced over Liv’s shoulder again. “A number of years ago—it\nfeels like quite a number of years ago… I have a… nephew. His mother was\nTyrean. I want you to tutor him. It might make him feel more comfortable\nto learn from another Tyrean. I know you Tyreans don’t have it easy here.\nWhat do you say?”\nLiv spluttered. A “nephew”? A tutor? Kip! Of course! Orholam, she’d\ngone completely the wrong direction! Idiot! The Prism hadn’t even been\nthinking anything remotely…“W-well, of course, Lord Prism. Is there…\nwhy do…” What was she saying? She’d already been impertinent enough.\nAsking the wrong question about a man’s bastard might be a good way to\nruin everything. “What color is he gifted with?” She only remembered at\nthe last second to say “he” and not “Kip.” She wasn’t supposed to know\nKip was the Prism’s bastard at all.\nI would make a lousy spy.\n“Green. Possibly blue. He’s being initiated right now.”\n“Right now?” Liv asked. The year’s initiations had been completed\nlong ago. Liv had never heard of someone being initiated at any other time\nof year. “How long has your—how long has he been here?”\n“He arrived yesterday.”\n“And he’s being initiated already?!” Liv asked. Poor Kip.\nGavin glanced behind her again. This time, she knew what he was\nlooking at. Throughout the tower, for reasons Liv had never comprehended,\nthere were plain crystals set into the walls. For the whole year, they simply\nsat and sparkled, dully refracting whatever light they caught from their\nsurroundings, but during initiations at the beginning of each year, they\nglowed brilliantly. As the supplicants passed through the Thresher,\ninvariably there was the wash of one color after another as each test\nprogressed, the same wash each supplicant saw. As soon as they drafted, the\ncrystal turned a brilliant hue in whatever color they drafted. For Liv it had\nbeen superviolet first, then yellow weakly.\nThe whole time Liv had been here, the Prism had been watching to see\nhow his bastard son was doing.\nCome to think of it, if the test had been going on since the first time\nGavin Guile had glanced behind Liv, it was taking a really long time.\nUsually it took less than a minute.\nThey both turned to look at the crystal. “What did the tester say when\nthey lowered you into the Thresher?” Gavin asked.\n“He said something about the only good rebel being a dead rebel, and\nhow he still owed my father blood,” Liv said. The point had been, as it\nalways was, to scare the person being tested. Fear made the eyes dilate.\nFear made a supplicant draft to the utmost of her abilities. It also helped\neven the most arrogant young lady or lordling begin their studies with a bit\nof humility."

Neither of them turned from the crystal.\n“Something about my brother,” Gavin said. “Turned out to be more\nright than they knew.”\n“I’m sorry,” Liv said. She wasn’t sure if she was apologizing for\nasking, for the tester, or for the real-life nightmare Gavin had gone through\nlater in having to kill his own brother.\n“I never liked that part, scaring them. The chamber is terrifying\nenough, and the thought of failing is scary enough. They don’t have to\nmake supplicants think they’re really going to die. It breaks people. It\nbreaks children.”\nLiv had never thought about it that way. The Thresher just was.\nEveryone went through it. It was inextricable from drafting, from the\nChromeria. If nothing else, every drafter had the Thresher in common.\n“The noble girls all knew what was coming,” Liv said. “Unlike the rest\nof us. They knew the test itself wouldn’t hurt them, so that bit of talking\noutside the test was the only thing that made them afraid. Because even if\nthey’d been warned, hearing a tester who claims to belong to your enemy’s\nfamily say that accidents happen is terrifying.”\n“Hadn’t thought of that,” Gavin said. “All my friends were nobles. I\nthought everyone knew what was coming.”\nOf course you did. It’s just another way the Chromeria’s stacked to\nfavor your kind.\nGavin cleared his throat. “Liv, my son might be special, really gifted.\nWe’ll find out presently, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s a polychrome.\nHe’s Tyrean, his mother just died, he’s going to face false friends and\nunearned enemies just for being my son; he won’t fit in anywhere and yet\npeople are going to be watching him all the time. If he’s truly powerful on\ntop of that… he could turn into a monster. He wouldn’t be the first in my\nfamily to handle great power poorly. The gift isn’t a pure gift, you know.”\n“What do you want me to do?” Liv asked. Was she really going to be\ntutoring the Prism’s son? Bastard son, but still. She felt like a huge weight\nhad been lifted off of her. The Prism was just the Prism—well, maybe there\nwas no such thing as being just the most powerful man in the world—but he\nwas a lord to whom she owed service. Normal service. Something not\nterribly hard, given how completely he’d changed her life.\n“Maybe he’ll be a monochrome. Probably will be. I’m getting ahead of\nmyself,” Gavin said.\n“But if he’s not?” You’ve got to let me know what your expectations\nare or I’m going to fail—and then you’ll be mad at me for that. Typical\nnobleman. Liv felt good that she was able to be irritated. She was regaining\nher bearings.\n“Pretend he’s normal. In all ways. I know he’d figure it out pretty\nquickly if we stay, but I’m going to take him away from here as soon as I\npossibly can. Until then, give him some normalcy. If he makes you mad,"

She hadn’t really\nmeant to say it out loud, but Gavin was being ridiculously idealistic. Of\ncourse who he was and how much he could draft mattered. Maybe when\nyou were born on the top of the mountain you could pretend the mountain\ndidn’t matter, but those who climbed it and those born at its base who could\nnever climb at all knew differently.\n“Me and Orholam,” Gavin said, ignoring her tone. “If we’re the only\nones whose approval he cares about, he’s got a chance.”\nLiv didn’t know if that was the most arrogant or the most profound\nthing she’d ever heard. Maybe both. Whatever else it did, though, it\nreminded her who and what Gavin was. By Orholam’s scowling brow,\nshe’d been glibly sarcastic to the Prism, the man closest in all the world to\nOrholam himself. And thank Orholam that Liv had turned down that awful\nwoman. Even if it was going to cost her dearly. Spying on the Prism\nhimself? It was practically sacrilegious. As bad as Liv’s stupidity and\nawkwardness and horrifying sliver of infatuation was, how awful would it\nhave been to be a traitor too? She swallowed. “I’m sorry, Lord Prism, I was\nout of—”\nGavin raised a hand and stood abruptly.\nLiv glanced at the crystal but saw nothing. The crystal hadn’t changed.\nShe looked over at Gavin in time to see the Prism blanch—then his face\nwas lit up like the sun had just come out from behind the blackest clouds.\nA wash of colors flashed through his skin and he threw out a hand\ntoward the crystal. A crackling, shimmering tube of luxin shot from his\nhand and stuck to the crystal on the opposite wall like an iridescent\nspiderweb on fire. More and more gushed out of the man, pushing deep into\nthe crystal.\nAnd then, as abruptly as he started, Gavin stopped. A moment later, the\ncrystal glowed a brilliant jade green, and then a less intense blue.\nGavin sighed with relief.\n“What was that?” Liv asked.\n“A secret!” Gavin barked. He gestured, and Liv felt a gust of cold wind\nand heard the windows drop heavily into their slots.\n“Come here,” the Prism ordered. His body filled with every color in\nthe rainbow and beyond. A rope of green luxin wrapped around a chain of\nyellow-infused blue ran from his hand. “Now, girl! I have to be there first to\ncontain this, and he’s going to need you.”\nIn a daze, Liv hurried over to the Prism. She didn’t even know what he\nwas talking about.\n“Get on my back,” he said.\n“What?”\n“On my back, now! Hold on tight.”"

Gavin took a run toward the window and\nleapt.\nLiv’s view, at first, was only of the luxin spooling out of Gavin’s hand\nlike spider’s silk, perfectly matching the rate at which they were falling. She\nrealized she had no idea how far exactly they would have to fall to get to\nthe level of the Threshing Chamber, or how Gavin would know when to\nstop them. For that matter, how did he mean to get back into the tower from\nthe outside? Hope someone left a window open?\nOh, dear Orholam!\nThey were falling an awfully long time. Liv’s eyes disobeyed her and\njumped from the luxin above to the ground below. It was rushing up at them\nwith incredible speed.\nThen she was crushed into Gavin’s back as he solidified the rope. The\npressure threatened to sweep her off of him and straight into the courtyard.\nThey whipped around backward and she saw the rope-chain spooled out to\nthe distant top of the Prism’s Tower, and the tower itself was looming\nbigger and bigger as as they swung back toward its sheer, unbroken face.\nThree sharp jerks pushed her and Gavin backward, but with nowhere\nnear enough force to slow them down. Briefly, Liv saw three missiles\nstreaking out from Gavin’s outstretched left hand toward the tower in front\nof them.\nShe didn’t see what the missiles did, because whatever else they\naccomplished, with Gavin shooting them out of his left hand while his right\nheld the rope, he absorbed the recoil with his left arm. So as soon as the\nmissiles were out of his hand, Gavin and Liv were sent spinning sharply\nwiddershins.\nGlass and stone exploded on every side around Liv. She was sliding\nalong a floor, zipping straight and smooth for a fraction of a second,\nabruptly cut away from the Prism. Then something caught the hem of her\nskirt. Her momentum and the friction with the floor yanked it up hard, and\nthen her bare skin squeaked on naked stone. She flopped over sideways and\nrolled a few times. When she stopped against the wall, all she could think\nwas that she couldn’t believe she was still alive.\nThere were half a dozen drafters in the suddenly breezy hallway,\nlooking at the Prism and her in disbelief. The Prism was already up, giving\nsharp orders.\nWhy is my butt cold? Liv followed the drafters’ stares and looked\ndown. Her skirt was bunched around her waist from the slide, exposing her\nto all the world. She squeaked, yanked her skirt down, and jumped to her"

Tell him I want this repaired. Today. Go\nimmediately. You, take the names of everyone in this hall and everyone in\nthe testing chamber,” the Prism was saying. Liv, seeing everyone’s attention\nwas on the Prism, shifted her hips. She hadn’t noticed until after she jumped\nup, but her butt cheeks had been cold because her underclothes had been\nyanked up too. Now they were cleaving the moon in a serious way. She\nshimmied, trying to fix her underclothes without fishing after them with a\nhand. “Aliviana, what are you doing?” the Prism asked.\nLiv froze, transfixed.\n“Never mind, stay here. I’ll call for you in a moment.” Gavin opened\nthe door to the testing chamber and slipped inside. All the drafters in the\nhall, including one of the best-looking young magisters in the whole\nChromeria, Payam Navid, turned to look at Liv, obviously wondering why\nshe was so important—and killing her chance to quickly tug her\nunderclothes down. Not having any idea what she was going to find or what\nthe Prism was going to expect of her, she smiled nervously at the young\nmagister.\nChapter 45\nGavin moved quickly, hearing the old bichrome say, “Are you ready to see\nyour colors?” to Kip.\n“I know I am!” Gavin said. “Mistress Varidos, may I?” Family\nmembers of supplicants weren’t allowed in the testing chamber for fear that\nit would lead to cheating. The rule, at least theoretically, even applied to the\nPrism. There’s a reason theory and practice are two different words.\n“I wasn’t even aware that you’d begun your testing. How long did they\nsay you lasted?” Gavin asked.\n“Four minutes, I guess,” Kip said.\n“Four twelve,” the old mistress said.\nGavin physically stopped. It had seemed like a long time up in his\nroom, but he’d supposed it had only seemed long. Four minutes was\nastounding. Passing had only taken him five.\nMistress Varidos drew close to Gavin and whispered, “There was some\nirregularity that I think you should know about.”\nGavin smiled at Kip. “Well done, we’ll just be a moment.” He came\naside, leaving Kip with the men and women who were asking him which\npart he thought was hardest, how he’d managed to hold out so long, and\ngenerally treating him like the center of the world. It was pretty intoxicating\nfor a young drafter, and it was supposed to be.\nGrinning, Gavin walked toward the tester’s table with Mistress\nVaridos. They came to stand right over the stone table. A black samite cloth\nwas spread over a hole in the middle of the table. The testing stone would\nbe right in there. Gavin tried to remember exactly how it was positioned.\nHe’d only get one shot at this. “What was the irregularity?” he asked. The\nsamite blocked out any outside light that would interfere with the testing\nstone.\nThe old woman exhaled slowly. “He threw the rope out of his hand at"

Before I could stop her, one of the women put it back in\nhis hand.”\n“Are you joking?” Gavin said.\n“They send the beautiful ones for the testing. Half of them barely have\nthe brains to remember their lines, much less remember some of the more\nobscure rules governing situations that have never arisen in living memory.\nEven Dazen didn’t throw the rope aside.”\n“Which one did it?”\n“The green.”\nOf course it was the green. Wild, unpredictable, chafing at the slightest\nrestriction. “Get her over here!”\nThe green tester saw the mistress’s summons and walked right over.\nAll the testers were beautiful, and if being light-skinned was a detriment on\nthe battlefield, it was favored for this and a few other ceremonies. The\nvisual effect of a man or woman whose skin was green or blue or red was\nmore muted the darker their natural skin tone. Even the Parians chose\ncoastal, lowland, or mixed-blood countrymen to represent them in this\nceremony. This woman was Ruthgari, and light-skinned even for them. She\nmoved with the easy grace of a dancer. Her thin green robe, thrown on\nduring the ceremony so that all the testers would be clad in their colors\nwhen the supplicant emerged—which might be only ten or fifteen seconds\nafter their testing began—was, in her case, open deep between her large\nbreasts. She walked up eagerly, throwing her hair back, back straight,\nstanding just on the other side of the table.\nThe nudity and near-nudity of some of the ceremonies were shrouded\nin religious and cultural symbolism that made them almost non-erotic.\nAlmost, because no matter how high-minded you might be, you couldn’t\ncompletely ignore the fact that you were looking at someone who was\nnaked and astoundingly attractive. But the parties afterward, especially at\ninitiations, were always a gray area. Everyone beautiful, everyone half-clad,\neveryone with the fresh memory of everyone else stark naked, the\natmosphere jubilant, the wine flowing freely, and the somber ceremonialism\nsuddenly removed.\nThis green knew exactly what she was doing. Gavin was taller than the\nwoman, so he could barely help but stare down her barely closed robe.\nInstead, he looked at her heart-shaped face, hazel eyes, the pupils barely\nhaloed in green. She looked familiar.\n“Over here,” he said, pointing next to him, between himself and\nMistress Varidos. She stepped around the stone table to where he’d pointed,\nbut closer in than necessary.\n“Who are you?” he asked, his voice cool.\n“My name’s Tisis,” she said, her smile showing off great dimples.\n“Tisis what?”\n“Oh,” she said, as if she didn’t have a thought in her head. “Tisis\nMalargos.”\n“What happened, Tisis?” he asked, pretending not to recognize the\nname. Her father and uncle had been his friends—that was, his Dazen’s.\nThey’d disappeared after the war. Killed by bandits or enslaved by pirates,\nmost likely. She had the family look.

She’d seen\nthat Kip had a chance of passing the test, so she’d sabotaged him. Gutsy.\nFoolish and infuriating, but gutsy.\n“The supplicant cheated,” she said. “He threw out the rope. I put it\nback in his hand.”\n“You’re not to touch the supplicant in any way during the testing. Is\nthere something about that rule that’s unclear?”\n“I didn’t touch him—Pardon me, High Luxlord Prism, I put the rope\nback in his hand without touching his skin. I was trying to preserve the\nintegrity of the test.”\n“Malargos,” Gavin said. “You’re Ruthgari, right?”\n“Yes, Lord Prism.”\nGavin looked at her flatly. “When your own Blessed Satrap Rados\ncrossed the Great River to fight the Blood Foresters who outnumbered him\ntwo to one, do you remember what he did?”\n“He burned Rozanos Bridge behind his army,” she said.\n“Was that cheating?”\n“I—I don’t follow,” she said.\n“He burned the bridge so his men knew they couldn’t flee. He gave\nthem no way out. Every last man knew he had to win or die. It’s where we\nget the expression ‘burning your bridges behind you.’ ”\n“But I saw him reaching for the rope,” she complained weakly. She\nswallowed, suddenly unnerved to have contradicted the Prism to his face.\n“And you gave it back to him.”\n“Of course.”\n“So you would have built a new bridge behind Blessed Satrap Rados?”\n“Of course not, that would be…”\n“And doomed him. How long did you last before you pulled the rope?”\nGavin asked.\nShe flushed and looked away. “Seventeen seconds.” She pulled her\nrobe tighter around herself, finally covering up.\n“And you destroyed a young man’s chance at passing.”\n“We could retest—” she started.\n“You know we can’t. Once supplicants know it’s not real, the Thresher\ndoesn’t work. Everyone would say it was because he got special favor for\nbeing my nephew—”\n“I didn’t mean—”\n“And you know it!” Gavin said, only keeping his voice down with\neffort.\n“It doesn’t matter what you meant,” Mistress Varidos hissed.\nWhile the mistress was speaking, Gavin split some superviolet from\nthe light of the torches. Just a little. The beauty of superviolet was its\ninvisibility. Even though there were at least half a dozen people in this room\nwho could see superviolet luxin if they tightened their eyes, Gavin was\nbetting that none of them was tightening her eyes at this very moment. And\neven if someone was, what Gavin was about to do was so small and so\nquick that even someone looking might miss it. Magical sleight of hand.\nThe superviolet settled into his fingertips.\n“You broke the rules, Tisis,” the mistress said. “You botched your\nduties, and you may have destroyed a young man’s future.”\n“But nobody passes!” the young woman protested. It had become a\nmark of pride just to hold on for a long time. Conspiracies, the dark, tight\nspaces, heights, spiders, snakes, rats—the Thresher hit all of the most"

Usually, believing that failure would mean the loss of\neverything and with their eyes dilated from fear, the applicant drafted any\nand all colors before they pulled the rope. It wasn’t perfect, of course, but it\nwas the best test they had.\n“Get out of my sight,” Gavin said.\nShe went, huffing, furious, crossing between Gavin and the mistress,\njust as Gavin had planned. He pulled a stone from his pocket, holding the\nshort rod behind his wrist, slid the samite off the hole, flicked invisible\nsuperviolet out of his fingertips and used it to snatch the testing stone out of\nits grooves. He snapped the luxin back to his wrist, binding the testing stone\nto his forearm with bands of superviolet, and with the last of the superviolet\nin his finger dropped the false testing stone into place.\nIt had all taken less than a second, and Gavin hadn’t so much as leaned\nover. “Well, let’s see what we have, shall we?” he said, still drawing the rich\nsamite cloth away from the hole.\nIn full view of Mistress Varidos, Gavin set the samite aside and\nreached into the receptacle, leaning over, grabbing the testing stone, and\npulling it out. The testing stone was an ivory bar—either from sea demon\nwashed ashore or from elephants deep within Ruthgar—tipped on each end\nwith obsidian. The ivory was precious, but the obsidian was the real\nwonder. No one knew where the obsidian extant in the world had been\nharvested, or mined, or made. Obsidian was rarer than diamonds or rubies,\nso after every testing the obsidian ends of each testing stone were removed\nto be reused.\nThe superstitious called it hellstone. Most drafters were just happy that\nit was rare, because it was the only stone that could draw luxin directly out\nof a drafter. Gavin had heard that in the ancient world kings and satraps—\nand in more mythic tales, the assassins of the Broken Eye—had created\nentire daggers or even swords of obsidian. But obsidian only evinced its\nmagical properties when two very special conditions were met. First, it had\nto be in near-total darkness: that is, a total lack of light in the visible\nspectrum—for some reason superviolet and sub-red didn’t interfere with it.\nSecond, it needed the drafter’s blood, an open cut at that. There had to be a\ndirect physical connection between the obsidian and the luxin for the luxin\nto be drawn out of the drafter. When that connection was made, however,\nthe pull was quite strong. Cut a drafter’s shoulder with obsidian while he\nwas holding luxin in his hand and hold the stone against the cut, and within\nmaybe ten seconds the luxin would be gone. Scholars speculated that was\nbecause drafters had luxin throughout their bodies at all times, so the\nconnection was direct, even if it was distant within the body.\nBecause the rates at which obsidian pulled colors out of a person were\ndifferent for the different kinds of luxin, they made nice lines as they were"

If a color formed and stayed and\nwas thick enough, the supplicant was deemed worthy of receiving training\nin that color. If there were two colors, of course, the supplicant was deemed\na bichrome, and more than two made them a polychrome.\nGavin took the testing stone. He caught a faint whiff of cloves that was\nthe scent of superviolet luxin. He held it for just a moment, willing the scent\nto disperse, and handed the stone to Mistress Varidos. As the head tester, it\nwas her place to declare the findings. As he did, everyone else gathered\naround. She carefully removed the obsidian tips and stowed them in a\nspecial box, and then held the testing stone over her head. There was a\nclear, thick green bar, peaking toward the blue side, and next to it a less full\nblue. Yellow was faint. There was a tiny bit in the superviolet. It was a\nclassic bell, the most common pattern in drafters.\nThe mistress said, “I hereby declare Kip of Rekton gifted of Orholam\nin the colors green and blue, with superviolet undecided and to be tested\nfurther at a later date. Kip, congratulations, you’re a bichrome.”\nA cheer went up.\nOnly Kip still looked confused.\nGavin walked around the table, put an arm around Kip’s shoulder, and\nsqueezed. “Well done, Kip.”\nKip was limp in Gavin’s embrace. “So I passed?” he asked quietly.\n“You passed. You made me proud.”\nAnother cheer went up, and within no time, wine and brandy and\nspecial cakes and fruits and meats and sweetmeats were being produced by\nslaves who flooded the chamber.\nGavin released the boy, who was looking at him like he was utterly\nbefuddled, like he couldn’t believe the words Gavin had just said. Some of\nthat, too, was the magic. The emotional effects of every part of the spectrum\nhad just passed through Kip for the very first time. He didn’t know yet what\nto do with the residue. It took time. Gavin gestured toward the door,\nbeckoning Aliviana.\n“Kip,” Gavin said. “I’ve brought you someone special. A surprise for\nyou. She’ll be your mentor. She’ll explain how things work and teach you\nsome of the basics until we leave. Kip, may I present—”\n“Liv?!” Kip said as the girl stepped out from behind Gavin.\n“Kip!”\n“Why don’t you go ahead and take him up to his room, Liv,” Gavin\nsaid. “And remember what I said.”\nKip was still in a daze, so Liv took his hand and turned to lead him\ntoward the main door. There would be a crowd there, no doubt. No need for\nKip to think anything was out of the usual.\n“Why don’t you go the back way?” Gavin said. He turned and flung\nsuperviolet at the opposite wall. A section of the wall popped open on\npreviously hidden hinges.\nLiv took Kip out the back door."

He walked toward the back door himself. He\nneeded to get Kip now. He should have commanded the boy to wait outside\nthe room instead of sending him upstairs.\nGavin stepped through the back door, already composing the letter he\nwould leave for the White, and almost ran over a dark, demure little man in\na slave’s robe. He recognized the man and his heart dropped.\n“Greetings, Lord Prism,” the little man said, his headscarf so starched\nit barely moved as he bobbed his head. He’d been a Parian legalist before\nbeing captured by Ilytian pirates, enslaved, and eventually sold to Andross\nGuile. Brilliant and discreet, he’d been Andross Guile’s right hand for\ntwenty years. “Your father tires of your delays. He demands you come to\nhis chambers immediately.”\nWith Andross Guile, “immediately” meant yesterday. Gavin cringed\ninside, popped his neck right and left, and said, “Take me to him.”\nChapter 46\nKip followed Liv Danavis through a narrow hall and then out to a lift. His\nhead was still awhirl and his emotions were a riot that seemed not\ncompletely internal, as if somehow, additional emotions were being pressed\nonto him. It felt alien. Maybe it was just seeing Liv. He’d known she was at\nthe Chromeria, and he’d hoped to see her ever since he’d known he was\ncoming here, but actually seeing her was different.\nMaster Danavis had shared many of Liv’s letters with Kip, so in some\nways it didn’t feel like it had been two full years, but she’d been fifteen\nthen. He’d been thirteen. Apparently, he’d grown since then, because he\nwas finally taller than she was. Of course, he was still also about three times\nwider than she was. If anything, she was even more beautiful than she had\nbeen.\nAs she led him through a hall and finally to a lift, she didn’t say\nanything. Kip was glad for the silence. He didn’t think he could have found\nhis tongue. An odd, quiet joy and peace settled over him at seeing her. He\nremembered when she was fourteen years old and the rumor had run around\ntown that she was going to be betrothed to Ged, the alcaldesa’s son. Shortly\nthereafter, she’d left for the Chromeria. Kip had been relieved. She’d\nseemed too good for little Rekton. But though he was sure she hadn’t\nthought of him since, he’d missed her. She had been like the sun passing\noverhead, and he’d turned his face as she passed, warmed by her presence,\nbut never daring to hope for more. When Master Danavis had shared that\nLiv was having a hard time with some girl at the Chromeria, Kip had\nwanted to leave immediately and kill the offender, then come home.\nSeeing her wavy hair swish and bounce around her shoulders as she"

Kip\ndidn’t want words. Once he opened his big mouth, he’d surely spoil\neverything. He just watched her walk, hiking up his own pants gracelessly\nas she strode ahead, purposefully, at home, at ease, in command of her\nenvironment.\n“I think I’m lost,” Liv said. She looked to each side, down halls that\nlooked exactly the same. She bit her lip.\nEyes locked on that full, slightly moist lip, Kip gulped.\n“Kip?” she said. “No, never mind, of course you wouldn’t.”\nShe headed off again, and Kip followed. Liv had turned into a woman\nin the time she’d been away. She was as slender as he was fat. Her eyes\nlarge lucid brown, her skin smooth and clear where his was cursed with\npimples around his neck and jaw as his beard was only just coming in.\nThank Orholam, at least her chest was bigger than his.\nKip barely glanced there, though, and now as he followed her, he\nbarely looked at her body. Her skirt did swoosh back and forth in a most\npleasing manner as she walked, revealing slim, well-turned calves. But\naside from a glance or two, or maybe three—Kip glanced again. Ah! Four.\nAside from that, he didn’t look at her the way he’d look at some other\nbeautiful woman. It just didn’t seem respectful.\nOops, five.\nShe stopped when they got into the lift. “I just realized,” she said,\nlaughing at herself, “that I have no idea where I’m supposed to take you.\nUh, tell you what. You can come to my room until I get this figured out. If\nyou’re like I was after the Threshing, you’ll probably need to go straight to\nbed. Right?”\nKip wasn’t sure how he hadn’t noticed before, but he was tired. He felt\nas if someone had taken the bottle of his energy and shaken it all out. He\nnodded his head.\n“Don’t feel like talking?” she asked, giving him a little grin. It was the\nkind of grin you gave a little child who’d missed nap time and was fighting\nto stay up to get dessert. But Kip couldn’t even summon the passion to\ndespair at seeing that indulgent grin on her.\nI’m cute to her. Cute. Ugh.\nShe set the counterweights on the lift, paused for a moment—she must\nhave been surprised how much weight she needed to add to account for Kip\n—and added more. In moments, they were speeding up the tower, passing\nother students going both up and down. They stopped and stepped into a\nwide lobby area that dimpled out to one of the clear tubes that connected\nthe central tower to all the others.\nKip looked at Liv, eyebrows up.\n“My apartments are over in yellow.

They\ndon’t have the space for those in the Prism’s Tower. Are you afraid of\nheights?”\n“Not usually,” Kip said uneasily.\n“Oh, so you can talk!”\n“I can fall too,” he mumbled.\n“You’ll be fine, I promise,” she said. She walked out into the tube. It\nwas four paces across and enclosed with blue luxin so thin it was almost\nclear. The bottom of the walkway was thicker blue reinforced with thin bars\nof yellow. It looked impossibly thin. As Kip had seen from far, far below,\nthe walkway attached to the Prism’s Tower only at two places: on the east\nside and here, on the west. After going straight out about halfway to the\ngreen tower that was directly west of the Prism’s Tower, this walkway met a\ngreat almost clear luxin circular walkway. From that circle, there were\nspokes out to each of the six towers.\nLiv led Kip out to one of those intersections between circle and\nspokes, the point farthest from any support. She jumped up and down. “See,\ntotally safe.” She laughed. “Now you try it.”\n“I don’t know,” Kip said. If he could ever overcome his fear, the view\nfrom up here was magnificent. Of course, it was hard to look at mere magic\ntowers when he had Liv right here. “Okay,” he said weakly. He didn’t want\nto let her down.\nOf course, if I break this spindly walkway, I’ll be letting us both down.\nThe quick way.\nTrying to be a good sport, Kip hopped a little, landing as lightly as\npossible on his toes and absorbing all the shock in his knees.\n“Oh, seriously,” Liv said.\nKip sighed and jumped so high he thought he was going to touch his\nhead on the canopy. As he landed, he heard a loud crack.\nHe threw his hands out looking for something to grab, his heart seizing\nup. He was about to throw himself at the handrail when he saw Liv’s face.\nShe laughed and covered her mouth. “I am so sorry,” she said. “I\nshouldn’t have. It’s kind of a tradition for new students, and the Prism\nwanted me to give you the whole experience.” Kip looked at her hands.\nThey seemed to be clenched around something invisible. He tightened his\neyes, and sure enough, she had a bar of superviolet luxin snapped in her\nhands.\nKip chuckled. It only sounded a little forced. “Give me the traditional\nmop, would you? I think I left a traditional puddle.”\nShe laughed. “Thanks for being a good sport. If it makes you feel\nbetter, I almost fainted when my magister did it with our whole class. Come\non, it’s just a little farther now.”\nThey walked together around the spindly circle, then turned toward the\nyellow tower. The yellow tower had been at the back right when Kip had\nentered the Great Yard, so he hadn’t really seen it. Now it loomed both\nabove and below.\n“I think my eyes are full,” Kip said.\n“What?”"

Either this is just not as\nimpressive, or I’ve lost my ability to be amazed, because to me, this looks\nlike a plain yellow tower. No flames, no jewels, no twisty movement.” The\ntower was luminous, but otherwise it looked like cloudy yellow glass,\ntranslucent, but not transparent. Maybe it was hard to see because the sun\nwas going down beside the tower.\nLiv smiled. He didn’t know how he’d forgotten her dimples. “The\nyellow is amazing because it’s made entirely of yellow luxin.”\n“And the others aren’t,” Kip said, not understanding. He blinked. “I\nmean, they’re not made of their own colored luxin?”\n“No, no, no. The others have magical façades built over traditional\nbuilding materials. The yellow is made entirely of yellow.”\nFrom his admittedly brief instruction with the Prism, Kip thought that\nyellow was used like magical lanolin or something—it nourished other\nluxin, but otherwise degraded back into light easily. “Uh, I thought yellow\nwas kind of a bad choice for a building material, being unstable and all.”\nKip was just remembering why he had been keeping his mouth shut. The\nmore he talked with Liv, the more natural it would be for him to talk about\nhome. And the more unnatural for him not to say anything about home. The\nmoment they went there, he was going to have to tell Liv her father was\ndead, and the pleasant ease of being in her company would be shattered.\nShe would go from this bright, glowing, dimpled young woman to a\nbereaved orphan.\n“It is a bad choice,” Liv said. “That’s why this is so amazing.” She\npulled him toward the tower’s entrance. Suddenly Kip didn’t know if he\nwanted to leave the solidity of the blue-yellow spindles.\nSure, a minute ago, I was worried to step out on these, and now I don’t\nwant to leave.\n“Yellow is usually the least stable luxin. It shimmers right back into\nlight at the least movement, like water boiling away in a moment. That’s\nwhy they call it brightwater. But do you remember when that harper played\na few years ago back in Rekton, and he stopped between every song to\nretune his harp?”\nKip nodded. “It didn’t seem to make any difference to me.” Dangerous\nground, talking about anything back home, but if he could keep her talking\nuntil he collapsed from exhaustion, he might avoid telling her the news for\none more day.\nLiv said, “The thing was, he could tell when his harp was even a\nfraction out of tune. No one else could, though. There are people who can\ndo that with light. To make luxin of any color, you have to hit the right note\nwithin the color or the luxin won’t form. If you are only approximately on\npitch, the luxin is much more likely to fail. You can cover some mistakes\nwith more will, but you need someone really special to do work like this.”\n“Does this have something to do with superchromats?” Kip asked. He\nfelt like he was finally starting to put together some pieces."

He\nfelt like he was finally starting to put together some pieces.\n“Yes.” She seemed surprised that he’d heard of that. “You’re not really\ngoing to stand out there all night, are you?”\n“Oh.” Kip followed her into the tower.\n“Superchromats can see finer gradations in colors than most people.”\n“Are you one?” Kip asked.\n“Mmm-hmm. About half of all women are.”\n“But not that many men.”\n“There are only ten male superchromats in the entire Chromeria.”\nAh, thus Mistress Hag calling Kip a freak. “That doesn’t seem fair,”\nKip said.\n“What does fair have to do with it? Because you’re blue-eyed you’ll be\nable to draft more than I can. It’s not a matter of fair.”\nKip frowned. “So you’ve got to be a superchromat to make yellow\nstay?”\n“Short answer? Yes. In truth, even superchromacy has degrees to it.\nYou took that superchromacy test and there were maybe a hundred blocks\nwith fine gradations? Imagine there were a thousand blocks, with the\ngradations of color that much finer. To make solid yellow that will stay,\nyou’d have to pass that test—and then have the control to draft yellow in\nthat tight, tight spectrum. The result, though, is the strongest of any luxin.”\n“Can you do it?” Kip asked.\n“No.”\n“Uh, that was probably a rude question, huh?” Kip asked, wrinkling\nhis face.\n“I’m the last person here who’s going to hold the minutiae of tower\netiquette against you.”\n“Which is a yes.”\n“Yes,” she said, smiling. Why were dimples so beautiful, anyway? “I\nstill can’t believe you’re the Prism’s… nephew, Kip.”\n“You’re not the only one,” Kip said. So Gavin had been right. They all\ndid pause before they said nephew. He guessed it should have felt better\nthan hearing that he was a bastard all the time. It didn’t.\nThey got on another lift and went down. Apparently there was some\nsort of order of precedence for who got what rooms. When they got into\nLiv’s room, Kip was surprised. It was not only large, but it was a suite of\nrooms—and facing the sunset. This had to be the kind of room most drafters\nwould kill for.\n“I just moved here,” Liv said apologetically. “I’m a bichrome. Barely.\nI’m sure you’re exhausted. You can sleep in my bed.”\nKip looked at her, flabbergasted, sure that she wasn’t saying what he\nthought she was saying, trying not to let his expression say anything at all.\n“I’ll sleep in the next room, silly. These new carpets are so thick I can\nsleep on them like a Parian.”\nKip swallowed. “No, I didn’t think you were—I mean, I was just—um,\nI was thinking I shouldn’t take your bed. I should sleep in the next room.”\n“You’re my guest, and you’ve got to be exhausted. I insist.”"

At least they’d been treating her well.\n“The Thresher does that to people. I’ll get you a basin and you can\nsponge off a little before you pass out, but really, I insist.”\nLiv disappeared into the next room. Kip felt a lump growing in his\nthroat. He hadn’t said anything so far about her father, but he could\npractically feel the subject growing between them. Liv came back in the\nroom with steaming hot water, a sponge, and a thick towel. She set them\ndown and then sat in a chair, facing away from Kip.\n“You don’t mind if I sit here and chat while you wash, do you?” she\nasked. “I won’t turn around, swear.”\n“Uh.” Of course he minded. She’d turn around when he was half\nnaked and run screaming from the room, for Orholam’s sake. It was one\nthing for someone to know you were rotund, but it was something else\nentirely for them to see your fat rolls. At the same time, he was her guest\nand she hadn’t asked anything else of him. And he’d been rude.\n“So, Kip… how’s my father? You haven’t said anything about home.”\nFor a long moment, Kip couldn’t say anything. Just start talking, Kip.\nOnce you start, you’ll be able to tell her everything.\n“You’re sighing,” Liv said. “Is something wrong?”\n“You know how the satrap would send messengers to Rekton every\nyear asking for levies?”\n“Yes?” Liv said her voice rising more with concern than asking a\nquestion.\n“You can turn around, I’m not naked.”\nShe turned.\n“When Satrap Garadul’s son Rask took power, he declared himself\nking. He sent another messenger. The town sent that one away empty-\nhanded too, so he decided to make an example of us.” Kip heaved a deep\nbreath. “They killed everyone, Liv. I’m the only one who got away.”\n“My father? What about my father?”\n“He was trying to save people. But Liv, they completely surrounded\nthe town. No one got out.”\n“You got out.” She didn’t believe him; he could see it on her face.\n“I was lucky.”\n“My father is one of the most talented drafters of his generation. Don’t\ntell me that you made it out and he didn’t.”\n“They had drafters and Mirrormen, Liv. I watched the Delclara family\nget run down. All of them. The whole town was on fire. I watched Ram and\nIsa and Sanson die. I watched my mother die.”\n“I don’t care about your drug-addled mother. I’m talking about my\nfather! Don’t you tell me he’s dead. He’s not, damn you. He’s not!”\nLiv left the room in a whirlwind and slammed the door behind her.\nKip stared at the door, his shoulders slumped, tears that he didn’t even\nunderstand in his eyes."

A seven count, each color in turn,\nfrom sub-red to superviolet, feeling the little thread of emotion from each.\nFor Orholam’s sake, I’m the Prism. I am the whole man. Master of all\ncolors. In my prime. Stronger than any Prism in living memory. Maybe the\nstrongest for hundreds of years. Most Prisms only lived seven years after\ntheir ascension. Only four had made it to twenty-one years. Always in\nmultiples of seven—of course, they could be killed or die of natural causes\ntoo, but none burned out except on the multiple years. Gavin had made it to\nsixteen, so he had at least five years left. In fact, if any Prism could make it\npast twenty-one years, he would be the one to do it. He felt strong. He felt\nstronger and more in control of his colors than he had in his whole life.\nOf course, it could all be an illusion. He’d been exceptional in other\nways; perhaps he’d pitch over and die tomorrow.\nHe felt that familiar tightness in his chest again at the thought. He\nwasn’t afraid of death, but he was afraid of dying before he accomplished\nhis purposes.\nHe stood outside his father’s apartments in the Prism’s Tower. His\nfather’s slave—Gavin knew the man’s name was Grinwoody, though it was\nrude to use a slave’s name if they didn’t reveal it to you themselves—was\nwaiting, holding the door open. It was a door into darkness of more than\none kind. There was sharp pain in Gavin’s chest. It was hard to breathe.\nAndross Guile didn’t know Gavin wasn’t Gavin. He didn’t know his\nelder son was rotting under the Chromeria. He thought Dazen was dead,\nand he’d never seemed concerned about it, much less sorry. Traitors were to\nbe dismissed and never spoken of.\n“Lord Prism?” the slave asked.\nGavin shook the last tendrils of luxin from his fingers, the waft of\nresinous smells a small comfort.\nAndross Guile’s room was kept completely dark. Thick velvet drapes\nhad been hung over the windows, then the whole wall hung with more of\nthe same in layers. An entry chamber had been erected around the entrance\nso that light from the hallway wouldn’t come in with his few visitors. Gavin\ndrew in superviolet light and then stepped into the entry.\nGrinwoody pulled the door shut behind them. Gavin drew a little ball\nof superviolet into his hand, drafted imperfectly so it would be unstable.\nThe instability caused it to slowly disintegrate back into light of its own\nspectrum. For a superviolet drafter, it was like carrying a torch whose light\nwas invisible to everyone else. Neither Grinwoody nor Andross was a\nsuperviolet, so Gavin could have as much of the eerie violet light as he"

Neither Grinwoody nor Andross was a\nsuperviolet, so Gavin could have as much of the eerie violet light as he\nwanted.\nAs Gavin watched, Grinwoody pushed a heavy pillow in front of the\nslight crack at the bottom of the door behind them. The man paused, letting\nhis eyes become used to the darkness. He wasn’t a drafter, so he couldn’t\ndirectly control his eyes. In darkness, it took a dull—a non-drafter—half an\nhour or more to reach full sensitivity to light. Most drafters naturally could\ndo it in ten minutes, just from spending so much time attuned to light. A few\ncould reach full light sensitivity in seconds. But Grinwoody wasn’t trying to\nsee. He had obviously memorized the layout of the room years ago; he was\nsimply making sure he wasn’t allowing any light into High Master Guile’s\nchamber. Finally, satisfied, he opened the door.\nGavin was glad to be holding superviolet. Like all drafters, he’d been\ntaught not to rely on colors to change his moods. Like most, he failed often.\nIt was a particular temptation for polychromes. There was a color for every\nfeeling, or to counteract every feeling. Like right now. Using the superviolet\nspectrum was attended by a sense of remove or alienation or otherness.\nSometimes it seemed ironic or cynical. Always it was like looking down at\nhimself from above.\nYou’re the Prism, and you’re afraid of an old man.\nIn the superviolet light of his torch, Gavin saw his father sitting in a\nhigh-backed padded chair turned toward a covered, boarded-up window.\nAndross Guile had been a tall, powerfully built man. Now his weight had\ndropped from his broad shoulders to form a little ball in his paunch. He\nwasn’t corpulent; it was just that what weight he had was in his gut. His\narms and legs had grown thin from years spent hardly moving from that\nchair, his skin loose and spotted already at sixty-five.\n“Son, so good of you to come visit. An old man grows lonely.”\n“I’m sorry, father. The White keeps me very busy.”\n“You shouldn’t be so supine with that wheeled wench. You should\narrange for the hag to join the Freeing this year.”\nGavin let that pass without comment. It was an old argument. The\nWhite said the same things about Andross, minus the derogation. Gavin sat\nbeside his father and studied him in the eerie superviolet light of his torch.\nDespite the absolute darkness of the room, Andross Guile wore\nblackened spectacles molded tight around his eye sockets. Gavin couldn’t\nimagine living in utter darkness. He hadn’t even done that to his brother.\nAndross Guile had been a yellow to sub-red polychrome. Like so many\nother drafters during the False Prism’s War, he’d pushed himself to his\nabsolute limit. And beyond. He’d fought, of course, for his eldest son.\nUsing too much magic, he’d finally destroyed his body’s defenses against it.\nBut after the war, when so many drafters had taken the Freeing, Andross\nhad instead withdrawn to these rooms. When Gavin had first come to visit\nAndross here, there had been blue filters set on the windows. With his own"

With his own\npower at the opposite end of the spectrum, Andross had felt safe with blue\nlight. Since then, the chirurgeons had told him he needed complete darkness\nif he was to keep fighting the colors. If he was taking such extreme\nprecautions, he must be very close to the brink indeed.\n“I hear you’re trying to start a war,” Andross said.\n“I rarely try without succeeding, I’m afraid,” Gavin said. He didn’t\nbother marveling that his father already knew. Of course Andross Guile\nknew. The man owned the loyalty or the fear of half of the most powerful\nwomen and men in the tower.\n“How?”\n“I received a letter that I had a natural son in Tyrea. When I arrived,\nthe town was burning. I stumbled across some Mirrormen about to murder a\nchild and I stopped them.”\n“Killed them.”\n“Yes. The child turned out to be my natural son, and the men turned\nout to be Rask Garadul’s. He was making an example of the town for\nrefusing to send levies. He claimed a special interest in the boy, but I’m not\nsure if that was just because he thought it would hurt me.”\n“A special interest? I thought he was there to punish the village.”\n“He said Kip had stolen something from him.”\n“And had he?”\n“The boy claimed his mother had given him a jewelry case just before\ndying from injuries she took during the attack. He didn’t steal it, though.”\n“But you have the dagger? Is it the white luxin?”\nA chill shot down Gavin’s spine. He’d thought the worst part of this\ninterview would be his father picking through the details of affairs that\nGavin hadn’t actually had and thus couldn’t remember. A white luxin\ndagger? White luxin wasn’t possible, and for Andross Guile to speak about\nit like this meant he thought that it was. Or knew that it was. That he’d seen\nsuch a thing, and that he thought Gavin should know what he was talking\nabout.\nHis brother had mentioned a dagger too. Gavin’s chest tightened.\nIf he wasn’t very careful, he was going to ruin his disguise. This was\nwhy he avoided his father as much as possible. Andross Guile was one of\nthe few people who would know exactly which memories Gavin would\nhave and which Dazen would have. Others who knew had been alienated or\nkilled during the war. The feeble excuse that the severity of the brothers’\nfight to the death had made Gavin forget things would only go so far.\nAndross, in particular, might forgive him for misremembering things that\nhappened in the run-up to the final battle, but surely Gavin would remember\nthings that had happened years earlier, wouldn’t he?\n“I didn’t see the dagger,” Gavin said. “It was in a box. It didn’t even\noccur to me it might be the white luxin.” White luxin was impossible.\nGavin would know. He’d tried to make the mythic material himself—and as\na Prism, he would be the one who was able to do it if it could be done at all.\n“Idiot boy, I don’t know why I always favored you.

The first kind word he’d heard\nfrom his father about himself in years, and it was delivered as a rebuke.\n“Are you nodding your head or shaking it? In case you’d forgotten,\nI’m blind,” Andross said bitterly. “Never mind. I understand your own\nsecrecy in hunting the dagger—even my spies haven’t heard of you\nbumbling about, so bravo for that—but when you stumbled across a\nsuspicious dagger that some halfpenny king wanted badly, that didn’t send\nshivers up the back of your neck?”\n“I was surrounded by thirty hostile drafters, Mirrormen, and an\nextremely put-out king. I had plenty of shivers.”\nAndross Guile waved his hand, like none of that was worth\nconsidering. “With no Blackguards guarding you, I suppose. Stubborn, fool\nboy. What was the box made of?”\n“Rosewood, maybe?” Gavin said honestly.\n“Rosewood.” Andross Guile sighed deeply. “Alone it proves nothing,\nof course. But it tells you what you have to do.”\n“I was planning to rally the Seven Satrapies, speak to each directly, see\nif I could sway them,” Gavin said. “The Spectrum, of course, will do\nnothing.” He knew how this went. His father would announce what Gavin\nwould do and run right over everything Gavin threw in his path. For\nOrholam’s sake, I’m the Prism.\n“And by the time you’ve done that, King Garadul will have taken\nGarriston. You were right in everything you told the Spectrum, though you\ndrew the wrong lesson and the wrong course of action. Which is why you\nhave me. If you’d spoken with me as soon as you returned, I’d have told\nyou this. By withdrawing unilaterally and giving a jewel into Tyrean hands\n—”\n“Hardly a jewel, father—”\n“You dare interrupt! Come here.”\nWoodenly, Gavin sat across from his father. Andross Guile extended a\nhand and found Gavin’s face. He traced Gavin’s cheek almost gently. Then\nhe drew his open hand back and cracked it across Gavin’s cheek.\n“I am your father, and you will give me the respect you owe me,\nunderstood?”\nGavin trembled, swallowed, mastered himself. “Understood, father.”\nAndross Guile’s chin lifted as if he was sifting Gavin’s tone for\nanything displeasing. Then, as if nothing had happened, he continued.\n“Garadul covets Garriston, so even if it’s a tower of feces built on a plain of\nordure, giving it to him is weakness. The right course would be to raze the\ncity, enslave the inhabitants, and sow the fields with salt—and leave before\nhe arrived. But you’ve destroyed that option with your incompetence. And\nonce King Garadul holds Garriston with twenty thousand men, you’ll find it\na lot harder to take back than he’s going to find it to take when only a\nthousand are holding it.”"

It was less than a skeleton crew. If he hadn’t been in such a hurry\nwhen he sculled through Garriston, he surely would have noticed.\n“Troubles with the Aborneans hiking the tariff to travel through the\nNarrows again. The Ruthgari are making a statement with a show of force.\nThey pulled the ships and most of the soldiers from Garriston.”\n“That’s moronic. They have to know Garadul is massing troops.”\n“I agree. I think the Ruthgari foreign minister has been suborned. She’s\nsmart, she must know what she’s doing. Regardless, you must go to\nGarriston. Save the city, kill Rask Garadul, but even if you fail those, get\nthat dagger. Everything rests on that.”\nWhat “everything”? Here was the problem with pretending to know\nsecrets you didn’t know. Secrets, especially big, dangerous secrets, tended\nto be referred to obliquely. Especially when the conspirators knew spies\nwere frequently eavesdropping on them.\nMaybe I should have taken my chances with claiming to have\nforgotten what the dagger was.\nThere had been a time when Dazen had known all of Gavin’s secrets,\neven those that were supposed to be just between Gavin and their father.\nDazen and Gavin hadn’t just been brothers. They’d been best friends.\nThough Dazen was two years younger, Gavin treated him like an equal.\nSevastian was younger; they made him stay home. Gavin and Dazen had\nthe same friends. Together, they won and lost fistfights against the White\nOak brothers. Gavin missed the simplicity of those fights. Two sides, lots of\nfists, and once one side started bleeding or crying, the fight was over.\nBut Gavin had changed on the day he turned thirteen. Dazen was not\nyet eleven at the time. Andross Guile had come in his dress robes, looming,\nimpressive in red-gold brocade and red-gold chains around his neck. Even\nthen, after having been a member of the Spectrum for a decade, Andross\nGuile had always been referred to as Andross Guile, never Andross Red.\nEveryone had always known which was the more important. Andross had\ntaken Gavin away.\nWhen Gavin came back the next morning, his eyes were swollen like\nhe had been crying, though he angrily denied it when Dazen asked.\nWhatever had happened, Gavin was never the same. He was a man now, he\ntold Dazen, and he refused to play with him. When the White Oak brothers\ntried to pick a fight, Gavin filled himself with such deep sub-red that the\nheat emanated from him in waves, and he quietly told the brothers that if\nthey attacked him, the result would be on their own heads.\nIn that moment, Dazen knew Gavin really would have killed them, too.\nFrom then on, Gavin had spoken to their father as a confidant. Dazen\nhad been left to fall by the wayside. For a time, he’d played with Sevastian."

When it came time for it to be divined\nwhom Orholam had chosen to be his next Prism, all of Big Jasper and Little\nJasper was a whirl of speculation, but Dazen knew his older brother was the\none.

There was\nsomething particularly jarring in the sight of young lovers when she was\nfeeling so isolated.\nShe left, her emotions tumbling over each other, sorry she’d been so\nrude to Kip, certain she was right that her father was still alive, and scared\nto death she was wrong. Lonely, scared of her future, and now—hit in the\nface with how easy everyone else seemed to find it to find someone who\nliked her—lonely for a boy. Any boy. Well, practically.

The one\nboy she’d thought really cared for her had invited her to the Luxlords’ Ball\nand then had stood her up and gone with another girl. Apparently it had\nbeen a prank. The next year she’d briefly become the object of a\ncompetition between some of the most popular boys. For two weeks, it was\nglorious to be the center of attention. She’d felt like she’d finally broken\nthrough, that people were finally accepting her. One of them invited her to\nthe Luxlords’ Ball.\nThen she overheard one of the others talking about a wager they had to\nsee who could swive her first. Her revenge had been swift and terrible.\nShe’d promised the boy escorting her to the ball—the leader of the group, a\nyoung noble named Parshan Payam—her maidenhead if he helped her\nfulfill a naughty dream of hers. He’d practically drooled.\nAt the Luxlords’ Ball, they’d met in a darkened nook just off the main\nhall. She’d convinced Parshan to remove all of his clothes first, despite the\nproximity of practically the entire Chromeria dancing, talking, and drinking\nmere paces away. Then, pausing from kissing him while his loathsome\nhands wandered over her body, she asked how much he was going to win\nfor winning the contest.\n“You know? You’re not mad?” he asked.\n“Why would I be mad?” she asked. “Close your eyes. I’ve got a\nsurprise for you.”\n“A good surprise?” he asked.\nShe trailed her fingernails down his belly. Looked down. Licked her\nlips. “It’ll take your breath away. Promise.”\nHe closed his eyes. She grabbed all of his clothes and stormed out into\nthe party. He came after her with a yelp, rushing naked into the party. “This\nis what you get for your contest, Parsham Payam!” Liv shouted, just so that\nanyone who hadn’t immediately seen the naked young man would notice\nand know who it was.\nThe dancers stopped. The musicians quit playing. A hundred\nconversations ceased. “Wagering with your friends on who can take my\nvirginity?! You’re despicable. A cad and a liar. You disgust me. You’re not\nsmart enough to fool me, you’re not clever enough to deceive me, and\nyou’re not man enough to take me.” She plunged his priceless clothes into\nthe punch bowl.\nNervous titters broke out everywhere. Parshan froze. With his clothes\nsoaking in punch, it was pointless to retrieve them to cover himself. He did\nhis best to cover himself with his hands.\nAmid silence punctuated with scattered applause, Liv stormed out of\nthe hall and straight into Chromeria legend. Unfortunately, passing into\ntower lore for wreaking vengeance on a boy who’d taken a romantic\ninterest in you—regardless of how ignoble that interest was—was not a\ngood way to encourage interest from others. All the other boys were\nterrified of her.\nWhy am I thinking about boys? My father’s dead.\nNo, he’s not. Father’s gotten out of worse things. He wouldn’t allow\nhimself to be trapped. He’s smarter than that."

He’s smarter than that.\nStill, it would be nice to have someone to talk to. Honestly, a good cry\nwould make her feel a lot better.\nLiv trudged down to Vena’s room, but when she got there, Vena was\ncrying. It broke Liv out of her own self-pity instantly. Vena wasn’t just\ncrying; she was bawling. Vena’s usually artfully disheveled boyishly short\nhair was smashed down on her head as if she’d been holding her head in her\nhands. Her eyes were swollen.\n“I can’t believe it, Liv! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Liv!”\nVena said. “It’s a disaster. Orholam, Liv, I’m being sent home!”\nLooking around the room, Liv saw that all of Vena’s stuff was already\npacked up and in large trunks. With how much stuff Vena owned and all the\ndecorations she’d strewn over every open space in her little room, Liv knew\nshe couldn’t have packed it all herself.\n“What’s going on?”\nIt took a few minutes to get it all out in some sort of sensible order,\neven though the story was simple: Vena had lost her sponsorship. The\nAbornean lord who held her contract had lost a fortune in some business\nventure and needed to cut his expenses. Apparently he’d shopped Vena’s\ncontract around and found no buyers. Some other, younger drafter’s lord\nhad bought Vena’s room from him, though. She was to vacate it\nimmediately. Vena had been purchased passage home, tonight. She would\nhave to meet with her sponsor to determine how he could best make back\nhis investment from her.\nVena could end up as a serving girl, but she feared her lord might sell\nher to slavers. It was illegal—a drafter’s indenture was a far cry from\nslavery—but there were always stories of such things.\n“Liv, could you loan me some money? I could run away.”\n“I can’t—”\n“Please, Liv, I’m begging you. I know it’s not a loan. I’ll never be able\nto pay you back, but I can’t face going back. Please.”\nLiv’s heart dropped. If she’d waited just one week to meet the\nmoneylenders, she’d have drawn one more installment of her allowance,\nand she’d have ample money to help out her friend. “I just paid off a debt,\nVena. I’ve got nothing left. It cost me everything.”\nVena wilted.\n“Wait, we could sell some of my dresses. If you can wait until morning\n—”\n“No, forget it. They’ll be looking for me by then. And they know\nyou’re my only friend. They’ll be watching you. It was a stupid idea. I need\nto go face this.”\nA knock on the door. “Miss?” a man’s voice called out.\nVena opened the door and four men in slaves’ clothes came in and\npicked up the trunks. Vena picked up her own bag. “Walk me to the docks?”\nshe asked Liv, putting on a brave face.\nStill horrified, disbelieving, Liv nodded."

Vena picked up her own bag. “Walk me to the docks?”\nshe asked Liv, putting on a brave face.\nStill horrified, disbelieving, Liv nodded.\nThey walked slowly, as if they could postpone the inevitable forever.\n“This really is a great place,” Vena said, as they crossed the bridge for\nthe last time together. “It’s a marvel. And I was here. For a while. My father\nwas a servant; my mother was a servant. There’s nothing wrong with going\nhome and serving. I’m not better than they are. And you know what? I met\nthe Prism!” Her eyes were gleaming. “He called me marvelous! He\ncomplimented my dress. Me. He noticed me, Liv, with all those beautiful\ngirls there. No one can take that away from me. How many people—how\nmany drafters never get that much in their whole lives? The Prism himself!”\nHer bravery made Liv tear up. She studiously avoided looking at Vena,\nsure she’d lose control if she did.\nBut all too soon, they were at the docks. They said their goodbyes\ntearfully, promising to write, Liv promising that she would use any\nconnections she could make to get Vena reinstated. Vena smiled sadly,\nresigned.\n“Come on, ladies,” the captain said. “Time and the tide wait for no\nman, nor for blubbering girls, neither.”\nLiv hugged Vena one more time and left. She’d barely stepped off the\nwood of the dock when she saw a familiar figure lurking in the shadows\nlike a spider. Aglaia Crassos.\n“You!” Liv said. “This is your work!”\nAglaia smiled. “I wonder, Liv, do you think we owe a debt to our\nfriends? A debt of love, or duty?”\n“Of course we do.”\n“But apparently your duty to your friend isn’t as important as your\nneed to defy me.”\n“You bitch,” Liv said, quivering.\n“I’m not the one who’s letting her friend pay for my pride. It can stop,\nLiv, or it can get worse.”\n“You still want me to spy on the Prism.”\n“Vena’s not going home, just so you know. I own her contract already.\nAnd I’ve got a deal with a rather… dubious Ilytian. He’s willing to give me\na good price for Vena. Most people have scruples about selling drafters. Of\ncourse, she’s not a full drafter, so she won’t be entitled to any of a drafter’s\nnormal privileges. But, hey, Vena loves sailing, right? Not many women on\nthe galleys. They don’t usually last very long, nor do the other slaves treat\nthem well, so owners usually put women to other work. But I can arrange\nit.”\nNot just a slave. A galley slave. The worst of the worst. Liv wanted to\nvomit. She wanted to murder Aglaia. Orholam save her.\n“Or…” Aglaia said, “you give me the word.” She nodded toward a\nmessenger standing across the street. “And he runs to the captain with a\nmessage, saying it’s all a mistake, Vena’s been reinstated, and so forth.\nWonder of wonders. You are my own special project, Liv. You have my full\nattention.”"

You have my full\nattention.”\nLiv looked at the boat, despairing. It was true. She had no friends, no\noptions, no choices. How could she fight Aglaia Crassos, with all her wealth\nand power? If she asked the Prism for help, he’d ask questions. He’d think\nshe’d been spying all along. Every part of the Chromeria and the satrapies\nwas corrupt; they were all turned against her.\n“Hurry, Liv, the tide’s turning,” Aglaia said.\nThere was no way out, no time to try to come up with a third way.\nMaybe her father would have said no and spat in Aglaia’s ugly face and\nheld on to his honor. Liv wasn’t that strong. The sharks and sea demons had\nher. “Fine,” she said, her heart failing within her. “You win. What do I have\nto do?”\nChapter 49\nGavin hadn’t even gotten fully out of his father’s apartments when he saw\ntrouble coming. His mother’s apartments were right beside his father’s, and\nthere was no way he could leave without passing in front of her doors—and\nher doors were open.\nEvery time. Every burning time. If his father’s windows hadn’t all\nbeen bolted shut and covered with layers of fabric, Gavin would have\njumped out of a window. In fact, it was just during one of these sorts of\nsituations that he’d first drafted a bonnet. Every time he came back from\neven the shortest trip, it seemed he spent all day meeting with one important\nperson after another. All he did was meet with people—and every one of\nthem had demands of him.\nNonetheless, Gavin turned in as he went past his mother’s open doors.\nThe room slave was a young Tyrean girl, judging from her dark eyes and\nhair and kopi-colored skin. Gavin motioned to her as he passed that she\ncould close the doors behind him. His mother had a talent for training\nslaves: even a girl barely in her teens like this one would wait attentively\nand respond to the smallest signal. Of course, Gavin wasn’t so much\ndifferent, was he?\n“Mother,” Gavin said. She stood as he came close. He kissed her\nmany-ringed fingers, and she laughed and embraced him, as she always did.\n“My son,” she said. Felia Guile was a handsome woman in her early\nfifties. She had been a cousin of the Atashian royal family, and in her youth\nthe Atashian noble families rarely married foreigners. Andross Guile, of\ncourse, had been a special case. He always was. She had the classic, striking\nAtashian pairing of olive skin and cornflower blue eyes, though her blue\neyes bore a wide halo of dull orange around the iris. She had been an\norange drafter—though she wasn’t greatly talented, Andross would never\nhave married a woman who couldn’t draft. Slim despite her age, Felia was\nregal, fashionable, comfortable in herself, commanding without being\ndomineering, beautiful, and warm.\nHe had no idea how she could stand being married to his father.\nShe flicked two fingers of her left hand, dismissing the room slave"

How fast did word travel in this place,\nanyway? He looked around the room. The slave was gone. “That’s correct.”\n“A natural son,” Felia Guile said, her lips pulling taut momentarily.\nShe would never say “bastard.” With her huge palette of facial expressions,\nshe didn’t have to. Over the years, orange had made her both more\nempathetic and more suspicious. With her natural intuition and intelligence,\nit made her quite formidable.\n“That’s right. He’s a good young man. His name’s Kip.”\n“Fifteen years old?” She didn’t say, So you cheated on your fiancée,\nwhom I’ve been urging you to marry for the last sixteen years. Felia loved\nKarris. Andross Guile had been dead set against Gavin marrying a woman\nwhose family had nothing, like Karris’s, after the war. It was one of the few\nareas where Gavin’s mother had continued to defy his father. Usually when\nthey disagreed, she would let her objections be known with force and\neloquence, and then concede to whatever Andross decided. Not a few times,\nGavin had seen Andross change his mind after his mother so artfully\nsurrendered. The disagreement over Karris White Oak, however, had\ninvolved screaming, shattered porcelain, and tears. Gavin thought\nsometimes that if he hadn’t been present during that fight, Andross would\nhave given in, but the man couldn’t lose face in front of anyone, much less\nhis boundary-pushing son.\n“He is,” Gavin said.\nFelia folded her hands and studied his face. “So, is his existence as\nmuch of a surprise to you as it is to everyone else, or more?”\nA shiver shot down Gavin’s spine. His mother was no fool. She was as\ncareful to guard against eavesdroppers as anyone, but she had ways of\ngetting to exactly what she meant. After Sundered Rock, when Gavin had\nstaggered alone out of the magical conflagration, wearing his brother’s\nclothing and his brother’s crown and his brother’s scars under layers of soot\nand blood, everyone else had taken him to be Gavin unquestioningly.\nDespite the age difference, the brothers had been mistaken for twins dozens\nof times, and their mannerisms were uncannily similar. And Gavin had been\ncareful to emulate his brother’s idiosyncrasies of vocabulary and\nexpression. Any differences that had emerged after the war ended had been\nwritten off as Gavin having been changed by having to kill his own brother.\nBut Gavin woke the morning of his first night back at the Chromeria to\nfind his mother sitting on the foot of his bed. Her eyes were red and puffy\nfrom weeping, though her cheeks were dry. She’d been careful to do her\nweeping before he woke.\n“Did you think I wouldn’t know my own boy?” she had asked. “You’re\nthe blood of my blood.

I expected any of a\nhundred people to see through this farce, but what else can I do?”\n“I understand why you’ve done what you’ve done,” she said. “I just\nhad braced myself against your death, not your brother’s, and now to see\nyou… It’s like having to choose which of my remaining sons I’d prefer to\ndie.”\n“No one’s asking that of you.”\n“Just tell me this,” she said. “Is Gavin dead?”\n“Yes,” he’d said. “I didn’t want… He gave me no… I’m sorry.”\nHer eyes had streamed tears, but she ignored them. “What do you\nneed, Dazen? I’ve lost both of your brothers; I swear to Orholam I won’t\nlose you.”\n“Tell them I’m convalescing. Tell them the battle nearly killed me.\nWhen the time is right, tell them it changed me. But don’t make me look\nweak.”\nAnd so she’d become his only true ally in the Chromeria. And after she\nleft, he’d barred the door and opened the chest where his drugged brother\nlay, not a foot from where their mother had stood. He studied the\nunconscious figure minutely, and then himself in a mirror. Taking note of\nevery difference, he set to work. His brother’s hair had a cowlick that stuck\nout whenever he cut it short; the new Gavin would have to wear his hair\nlong so no one noticed this disparity. Gavin was a little shorter than Dazen,\nand had liked to wear boots with more heel; the new Gavin would wear\nflatter shoes. He began writing lists of his brother’s mannerisms, the way\nGavin liked to pop his neck to the left and right. Or was it right and left?\nDamn it, Dazen didn’t even know how to pop his neck. Gavin liked to\nshave every day, even twice a day, to keep his face smooth; Dazen had\nshaved a few times a week, finding it too much bother. Gavin always wore a\nparticular scent; Dazen had never bothered. He’d have to send a servant to\nfetch it. Gavin cared about his clothing and made sure he was at the\nforefront of every trend; Dazen didn’t even know how he did that. He’d\nneed to look into it. Had Gavin plucked his eyebrows? Dear Orholam.\nOther changes were harder to make. Dazen had a mole on the inside of\none elbow. Grimacing, he sliced it off. It would become a little scar. No one\nwould notice.\nHis mother helped, coming every day, handkerchief in hand for her\nsilent tears, but back ramrod straight. She pointed out quirks Dazen never\nwould have remembered, like the way his brother stood when he was\nthinking, and what foods Gavin loved and what he hated.\nBut the biggest reason for his success had been the real Gavin himself.\nGavin had painted Dazen as a False Prism. He’d sworn that Dazen deceived\nhis retainers with parlor tricks that would never convince anyone who\nwasn’t criminal or insane or who stood to benefit by standing with a False\nPrism.

Everyone knew there was only ever one Prism every generation, so\nthey’d believed the old Gavin implicitly. So from their first glance at\nDazen’s prismatic eyes, they knew he was Gavin. Those who knew better,\nwho knew that Dazen had never needed parlor tricks, who knew he was as\nmuch a Prism as Gavin—in other words, Dazen’s closest retainers and\nfriends—had been scattered to the four winds after the Battle of Sundered\nRock. He’d betrayed them, and if it was a betrayal for the greater good, it\nstill kept him up nights to know that Ilytian pirates were selling his people\nfor slaves in a hundred ports. He drew up his first list of seven great\npurposes, and he did what he could.\nAnd through it all, his mother had saved him a dozen times. She\ndeserved the truth.\n“More,” he told her now. It was more of a surprise to him than to\nanyone that he had a son. He and his men had been living in caves and on\nthe run, and even if he’d had the energy for entertaining some of the camp\nfollowers, he’d been heartsick over Karris’s engagement to Gavin. Dazen\nhadn’t slept with anyone during the war.\nShe stood and walked to the door, opened it to see that no one was\neavesdropping, and returned. Quietly, she said, “So you’ve adopted your\nbrother’s natural son. Why?”\nBecause you’re always bothering me about giving you a grandson, he\nalmost said, but he knew that would wound her. Because it’s the right thing\nto do? Because Gavin would have? No, he wasn’t sure that Gavin would\nhave. Because the boy had nothing and he deserved a chance? Because\nKarris was there watching and there was something perversely pleasurable\nabout wounding her by doing what was right? “Because I know what it’s\nlike to be alone,” Gavin said. He was surprised that it was the truth.\n“You don’t give Karris enough credit,” his mother said.\n“What’s she got to do with anything?”\nHis mother just shook her head. “She didn’t take it well?”\n“You might say that,” Gavin said.\n“What are you going to do if your father refuses to recognize the boy?”\n“He’s not moving me on this, mother. I don’t do very many things that\nare right. He’s not taking this one away.”\nShe smiled suddenly. “Did it make your list of seven purposes this\ntime? Defying him?”\n“My list only has things that are possible.”\n“So it’s harder than stopping the Blood War? Harder than destroying\nthe pirate lords?”\n“Twice,” Gavin said. “And yes.”\n“You get that from him, you know.”\n“What?”\n“Your father always made lists, goals to check off. Marry a girl from\nthe right family by twenty-five, join the Spectrum by forty—he made it by\nthirty-five—and so on. Of course, he never had to organize his life in seven-\nyear blocks.”\n“Did he never want to be Prism himself?” Gavin asked.\nShe didn’t answer right away. “Prisms usually only last seven years.”\nNot long enough for my father.

I see. “He wanted more sons and\ndaughters, didn’t he?” Even after Sevastian. More tools. More weapons, in\ncase more went bad.\nShe said nothing. “I want to go home, Gavin. I’ve wanted to join the\nFreeing for years. I’m so tired.”\nFor a moment, Gavin couldn’t breathe. His mother was the very\nquintessence of life. Beauty, energy, cleverness, good nature. To hear her\nspeak as if she were broken down, as if she wanted to quit, was like a blow\nto the stomach.\n“Of course, your father will never allow it,” she said, smiling sadly.\n“But whether he allows it or not, sometime in these next five years, I’m\njoining. I’ve buried two sons. I will not bury you.” So she was just giving\nhim warning, giving him time to prepare. Dear Orholam, he didn’t even\nwant to think about it. His mother had been his only companion, his best\nadviser, the one person who sniffed out threats from leagues away and\nloved him no matter what.\n“So, what were your seven purposes? Accomplished any of them yet?”\nshe asked, bringing the conversation back to safe ground, even though she\nknew he would dodge.\n“I learned to fly. Took me most of the last year.”\nShe looked at him like she couldn’t tell for once whether he was\njoking. “That could prove handy,” she said carefully.\nGavin laughed.\n“You’re serious,” she said.\n“I’ll have to take you for a ride—a flight?—sometime,” Gavin said.\n“You’ll love it.”\n“And you think the idea of that is a good enough distraction to\nsidetrack me from getting the rest of your goals out of you?”\n“Absolutely,” Gavin said, in mock seriousness. “I learned from the\nbest.”\n“Very well,” she said. “Now get out of here.” He was halfway out the\ndoor when she called. “Gavin!” She called him Gavin now, always, even\nwhen her eyes called him Dazen. “Be careful. You know how your father is\nwhen someone won’t do what he wills.”\nChapter 50\nKip woke with a dead arm from a dream about his mother holding his head\nin her lap. It wasn’t a dream; it was half memory. He’d been young. His\nmother was running her fingers through his hair, her eyes red, swollen. Red\neyes usually meant she’d been smoking haze, but this morning she didn’t\nsmell of smoke or alcohol. I’m sorry, she said, I’m so sorry. I’ve quit. It’s\ngoing to be different from now on. I promise.\nHe cracked open one sleep-snot-encrusted eye and moaned. That’s\nnice, mother, can you just get off my arm? He rolled over. He’d slept on the\nground? On a carpet? Oh!

Maybe the opening\ndoor had woken him. Liv must have slept elsewhere. The covers of the bed\nweren’t even disturbed.\n“Good morning, Kip,” the woman said. She was a dark woman, with\nheavy eyebrows, frizzy hair, and a flamboyant gold scarf around her neck.\nShe was thick, hugely tall, with great heavy shoulders and a bold-patterned\ngreen dress draped over her like a sheet over a galleass. “It’s dawn, and\ntime for your first lesson. I’m Mistress Helel.”\n“You’re my magister?” Kip said, still rubbing his hurting arm.\n“Oh yes.” She smiled, but the smile didn’t touch her eyes. “And you’ll\nremember today’s lesson for the rest of your life. Get up, Kip.”\nKip stood. She walked past him and opened a door to a small balcony\noutside Liv’s room.\n“Come quickly,” she said. “You need to see this before the sun is fully\nover the horizon.”\nHair squashed, mouth full of cotton, breath foul, arm throbbing, Kip\nlicked his dry lips and stepped past Mistress Helel. Her eyes were dark and\nintense—so dark that he couldn’t even tell what color of a drafter she was.\nWeird. Here I’m supposed to see minute differentiations in colors\nundetectable to most people, and I couldn’t even see the color in her irises.\nHe stepped onto the pure yellow luxin balcony. Aside from streaks of water\nor dirt, the entire thing was eerily clear.\nDespite his experience yesterday learning that the yellow was one of\nthe strongest materials known, Kip tested his weight on the balcony\ngingerly. It was, of course, solid. Due to the way the towers all leaned out,\nas if blossoming, if Kip fell from here, he’d smash on the rocks several\nhundred feet below, just shy of the water. It was even worse for the floors\nabove them, which leaned even farther out. He gulped and tried to pay\nattention to the rising sun.\n“We don’t have all day, Kip,” Mistress Helel said. There was\nsomething in her voice, a tension.\nKip turned as she stepped out onto the balcony with him. At first he\nthought she was tripping, because she lunged forward so suddenly. He\nmoved toward her to catch her. If there was one thing good about being fat,\nit was that he could stop big weights.\nBut Mistress Helel extended both of her hands like battering rams.\nKip’s move forward brought him between her arms. Her thumbs scratched\nacross his chest and off both sides. She cursed as they crushed together in\nan awkward hug.\n“I’ve got you,” Kip said. “Don’t worry, you’re not going to—”\nThe big woman stood to her full height, regaining her balance. She\nwas much taller than Kip, and the move pressed big flat breasts onto either\nside of his face. Somehow his chin got caught in her dress’s gaping neckline\nas she stood and for a brief—but not nearly brief enough—moment, Kip’s\nface was fully engulfed in flabby cleavage."

Somehow his chin got caught in her dress’s gaping neckline\nas she stood and for a brief—but not nearly brief enough—moment, Kip’s\nface was fully engulfed in flabby cleavage.\n“Gah!” Kip blurted.\nMistress Helel was already bending over, mercifully freeing her\nneckline of Kip’s chin, but then bending farther, her body pressing against\nhis. After an experience that he was doubtless going to relive in dreams—\nand not the good kind—he sidled out of the way.\nThe woman’s big meaty hands slapped on Kip’s right and left legs. His\nmove to the side made her left hand slip off his right leg, though. Then she\nlifted.\n“What are you—” Kip stopped as soon as he saw her eyes.\nDead concentration, complete lack of emotion. She pushed forward\nhard into Kip, lifting. He put it all together far too slowly.\nThe intensity, the story, the lack of color in her eyes, the stumble that\nhadn’t been a stumble. It had been a lunge. The lack of embarrassment at\nKip being pressed against her breasts—because you don’t let the touch of a\nlittle flesh deter you. Not when you’ve come to kill.\nKip’s hands slapped against the edge of the balcony behind him. With\nonly one leg in her hands, Mistress Helel lifted sharply. She was so strong\nthat Kip’s weight was no problem for her.\nIf he’d been a brave man, Kip would have fought her. If he’d been\nflexible, he would let her pick up the one leg while he stood on the other\nand beat her to a bloody pulp. Instead, Kip took the fatty’s way. He went\nlimp, floppy, making all his weight dead weight, seeking the ground the\nway he’d done when Ram would try to show off by picking him up and\nthrowing him on the ground. If Kip collapsed, Ram could never lift him,\nwhere if he held himself rigid, Ram could hold his weight easily.\nMistress Helel brought one hand off Kip’s left leg, seeking a grip\nanywhere on his round body. Kip wriggled like a fish, pushing off the\nbalcony, trying to push himself back into the tower. She pinned him against\nthe corner of the balcony with her own substantial weight and drew back\nher left hand to punch him.\nBut the floor called him, and without her strong arm to hold him, Kip\nanswered. Her fist descended and landed a glancing blow, but Kip fell. She\nlost her hold and he went turtle, barely keeping a grip on his pant leg.\nCursing, she tried to lift him by that alone.\nHis pants ripped, and then slipped off his waist.

Then she angled her fall so she crushed and\ntrapped him. Apparently Kip wasn’t the only one who knew how to use his\nweight to good advantage. She landed with her head toward his feet.\nShe trapped one of Kip’s legs in one iron hand. Then she punched his\nthigh. She caught it dead center. It was like being kicked by a horse. He\nscreamed. Then she grabbed his other leg. No amount of thrashing could\nbreak her grip. It was hard to even breathe with her on top of him, her legs\ncrushing his face. She pummeled his other leg, and it too went dead. She\npushed herself up and punched him in the groin.\nStars flashed in front of Kip’s eyes. Any thought of counterattack fled.\nHe just wanted to curl into a ball. Her weight shifted, crushing him again,\nand then she stood. She had one of his ankles in each of her hands, and she\nlifted him easily. She was going to toss him over the balcony, dear Orholam.\nThere was nothing he could do to stop it.\nEyes squinted in pain, weakly thrashing, Kip saw a thin beam of\nsuperviolet luxin stick to the assassin’s head.\n“Stop it! Drop him now!” a young woman screamed from inside the\nroom. Liv?\nThe assassin snarled a curse and turned toward Liv just as a yellow\nluxin ball blasted from her hands, zipped along the superviolet line, and\nexploded in a blinding flash against the assassin’s face. Mistress Helel\ndropped Kip, lifting a hand to protect herself too late, and staggered\nbackward.\nShe was so tall that the rail of the balcony caught her below the waist.\nShe hit it hard and tottered. Her meaty hands slapped onto the rail as she\nwent on tiptoe, feet seeking purchase. Kip, lying on the ground, slid a hand\nunder her foot and lifted. Not hard—he was in so much pain he could barely\nmove—but it was enough.\nThe assassin felt herself going over the edge and scrambled. She fell—\nand caught herself on the rail of the balcony. Through the clear yellow of\nthe balcony, she swung face-to-face with Kip. Each balcony had a small gap\nfor rainwater to sluice off so it wouldn’t fill with water, and the big\nwoman’s face was barely a foot from Kip’s own.\nKip looked at her. He knew how this ended. Some skinny woman\nmight be able to pull her weight up, but not a woman this size. Kip was\nstrong—he could lift heavier things than Sanson or even Ram—but when\nyou were really big, heaving your entire weight over a ledge was\nimpossible. And this woman was much bigger than he was. Mistress Helel\nheaved, and for one terrifying moment Kip thought he was wrong. Her\nelbows bent and her body lifted. She swung one heavy leg to the side,\ntrying to reach it high enough to reach the rain-gap in the balcony.\nThen her strength gave out and she swung back to vertical. She was\nfinished. Kip could see it in her eyes. “Light cannot be chained, Little"

Atirat spit on your mother’s grave. Ferrilux\ncorrupt your father’s—”\nKip punched her through the rain-gap. Her nose crunched in a spray of\nblood. She must have been expecting the blow, because she tried to snag his\nfist—but missed.\nShe fell, flailing all the way, screaming something, but Kip couldn’t\nmake out the words. She slammed into a sharp boulder not five paces from\nthe crashing waves of the Cerulean Sea, and her body actually burst\nasunder, a piece—a leg?—shearing off and flying to splash into the water as\nthe rest of her crunched in one long bloody smudge.\nIt didn’t seem real. Part of Kip knew that could have been him, maybe\nshould have been him, but he was suddenly aware of Liv standing just\ninside her apartments. “Kip, Kip, we killed her,” Liv was saying. Kip was\nmore aware that his balls were aching and he was pretty much naked in\nfront of the only girl he knew, and he was fat and gross and should cover\nhimself immediately.\nHe’d barely hiked up his pants by the time Liv lurched to the balcony\nrail and vomited. Kip hated throwing up. He hated himself throwing up, and\nhe hated other people throwing up. But worst, he discovered, as the wind\nblew across the yellow tower and carried mist through the rain-gap, Kip\nhated being thrown up on. Little misty wetness stuck to his face and in his\nopen mouth.\nHe rolled over, spitting and coughing and slapping at his own face to\nwipe off puke-mist. He rolled to his feet, balls still aching, face scrunched.\n“Oh no,” Liv said, her face gray and mortified, realizing she’d thrown\nup on him. She looked from him, to his crotch where his pants were torn,\nand then to the rocks so far below. She struggled for words and found none.\n“You know, I’m glad things aren’t awkward between us,” Kip said.\nDid I really just say that? It was like part of him couldn’t help being totally\ninappropriate. He’d just killed someone, and he was so terrified and pained\nand embarrassed and mortified and thankful to be alive and he didn’t even\nknow what all else, he couldn’t help himself.\nLiv’s mouth twitched up for half a moment, and then she leaned back\nover the rail and vomited again.\nAlways something to say, never the right thing. Well done, Kip.\nChapter 51\n“Midsummer is coming,” the White said. “Sun Day.”\nGavin stood in front of her on the top of the Chromeria. Together, they\nwere waiting for the sun to rise. Midsummer, as far as Gavin was\nconcerned, was always coming.\n“I’ve started preparations for the Freeing,” she said. “Do you think\nyour father will commune this year?”"

Not ever.” He rubbed his temples. He\nhadn’t slept.\n“It’s not natural,” the White said quietly. “I used to marvel at his self-\ncontrol, you know. Living in that awful room, keeping his mind sharp,\nkeeping the nightmares at bay.”\n“Nightmares have to keep him at bay.”\n“I live half in darkness, Gavin,” the White said as if he hadn’t\ninterrupted. “That’s how it feels to live without drafting. But to live fully in\ndarkness? Is that not a denial of Orholam himself? ‘They love the darkness,\nfor their deeds are dark, and the light shames them.’ ”\n“I leave the state of my father’s soul to my father. Are we not to honor\nour fathers, rendering obedience unto the authority the Father of All has\nentrusted to them?”\n“You’re not just a son, Gavin. You’re the Prism. You should honor\nOrholam by practicing the authority he’s given you, not just the power.”\n“Maybe it’s time for you to be Freed,” Gavin said bitterly. He had\nthese conversations at least once a year. He was sick of it. The White asked\nafter his father, his father suggested the White go first. Both pressured him\nto pressure the other.\nThe White held her hands out, palms up. “If you command it, my\nPrism, I will join the Freeing. Gladly.”\nHer words stopped him cold. She meant it.\n“I also obey,” the White said. “It might surprise you to learn it, Gavin,\nbut I drew the straw to become the White before I began to understand what\nit was to even be a drafter, much less a Color, much less the White. But\nperhaps it is not a lesson that can be taught, only learned.”\n“What are you talking about?” Gavin asked.\n“Do you know why faith is harder for us, my Lord Prism?” The White\ngrinned. Sometimes despite her years, she seemed a mischievous girl.\n“Because we know Orholam sleeps a hundred years for every day he\nwakes?” Gavin asked. He was tired, and not just from the insomnia.\nShe refused the bait. “Because we know ourselves. Because others\nobey us as though we were gods, and we know we’re not. We see the\nfragility of our own power, and through it we see the fragility of every other\nlink. What if the Spectrum suddenly refused my orders? Not hard to\nimagine, when you consider the scheming and lust for power it takes to\nbecome a Color. What if a general suddenly refuses his satrap’s orders?\nWhat if a son refuses his father’s orders? What if that first link in the Great\nChain of being—Orholam Himself—is as empty as every other link before\nhim? Seeing the weakness of each link, we think the Great Chain itself is\nfragile: surely at any moment it will burst if we don’t do everything in our\npower to hold it together.”\nGavin swallowed involuntarily. He’d never really universalized the\nthought as she was doing, but he always thought his whole life was like\nthat. His deceptions, his authority, his imprisoned brother, his relationships."

His deceptions, his authority, his imprisoned brother, his relationships.\nA chain of wet paper, drooping under its own sodden weight. A chain to\nwhich he added new weight every day.\n“Here’s what I’ve learned,” the White said. “Orholam doesn’t need\nme. Oh, I can do good work for him, work that pleases him, and if I foul it,\nothers will suffer. You see, what I do still matters, but in the end, Orholam’s\nwill prevails. So I think I still have work to do. I see unfinished business\neverywhere I look. But if you tell me that I should be Freed this\nMidsummer’s, I will do so gladly, not because I have faith in you, Gavin—\nthough I do, more than you know—but because I have faith in Orholam.”\nGavin looked at her like she was a visitor from the moon. “That was\nvery… metaphysical. Can we talk about the Freeing now?”\nShe laughed. “Here’s the thing, Gavin. You remember everything. I\nknow you do. You think I’m crazy now, but you’ll remember this, and\nsomeday it might make a difference. And with that, I can be content.”\nMadwoman or saint—but then, Gavin didn’t think there was any\ndifference.\n“I’m going to Garriston,” he said.\nShe folded her hands in her lap and turned toward the rising light.\n“Let me explain,” Gavin rushed to say. Then he did, ignoring the\nbeauty of the sunrise. Ten minutes later, he was almost finished when the\nWhite raised a finger. She held her breath, then sighed as the sun itself\nmastered the horizon. “Do you ever watch for the green flash?”\n“Sometimes,” Gavin said. He knew people who swore they’d seen it,\nthough no one could explain what it was or why it happened, and he knew\nothers who swore it was a myth.\n“I think of it as Orholam’s wink,” the White said.\nIs everything about Orholam with her? Maybe she is fading.\n“You’ve seen it?” Gavin asked.\n“Twice. The first time was… fifty-nine years ago now? No, sixty. It\nwas the night I met Ulbear.” Gavin had to reach to remember the name. Oh,\nUlbear Rathcore, the White’s husband and quite a famous man in his day.\nDead now twenty years. “I was at a party, quite disgusted with the drunk\nyoung gentleman who’d escorted me there and most certainly wasn’t going\nto be escorting me home. I went outside to get some air. Watched the sun\nset, saw the green flash, and was so excited I jumped. Unfortunately this\nvery tall fellow was leaning over me to grab his wineglass that he’d left on\nthe balcony, and I broke his nose with the back of my head.”\n“You met Ulbear Rathcore by breaking his nose?”\n“The woman he was escorting that night was none too pleased. She\nwas beautiful, graceful, prettier than I was by half, and somehow she\ncouldn’t compete with little clumsy me. Though I can’t imagine she would\nhave been happy if she’d married Ulbear, your grandmother didn’t forgive\nme for two years.”"

So there’s only one\noption: I’ll send all those to be Freed to Garriston. I’ll have to send our\nfastest ships to intercept theirs so they can arrive in time.”\n“We’re talking about war,” Gavin said.\n“And?”\n“What do you mean ‘and’?” he demanded. “I’m not going to have time\nto throw parties and set off fireworks and give speeches.”\n“The list I have so far is only perhaps a hundred and fifty drafters. Not\na large flight this year. A good proportion of those definitely won’t make it\nto next year. You want another eighty or ninety color wights?”\n“Of course not.”\n“The parties are nice, Gavin, but understand what you are. This is the\nflip side of your first purpose.” She’d figured out that he’d sworn to wipe\nout color wights because of Sevastian. Like everything she learned, she\nused it to control him. “Even if you don’t believe the Prism is Orholam’s\ngift to mankind, they do. The minutes each drafter spends with you being\nFreed are the holiest moments of her life. You can take that away, but it\nwould be the worst thing you could do. I for one can forgive you much, but\nI’d never forgive you that.”\nThat stung.\n“Now, tell me how you dropped off Karris in Tyrea, killed a giist, and\nbrought back a son, all within a few days. The trip alone should have taken\nyou two weeks.”\nWell that was quick. He’d known she would learn of the skimmer and\nthe condor as soon as he’d shown Karris, but he hadn’t been able to stop\nhimself. Maybe he was impulsive. So he told her about the skimmer and the\ncondor. Her eyes lit up. “That would be something to see, Gavin. Flying!\nAnd the speed! I suppose you’ll want to go back to Garriston the same\nway?”\n“Yes, and I’m taking Kip with me.”\nAgain she surprised him and didn’t protest. “Good,” she said. “It will\nbe good for you to learn about a father’s love.”\nBecause I sure as the evernight didn’t learn about that from my own\nfather. Then Gavin realized that was exactly what she meant, and he\nbristled. But there was no point fighting over his father again.\n“So what was the second time?” he asked instead.\n“Second time?”\n“The second time you saw the green flash. The second time Orholam\nwinked.” He kept the sarcasm out of his voice. Mostly.\nShe smiled. “I look forward to the day when I tell you that, my Lord"

I thought I stopped it in time.”\n“Old? Yes. Addled? Not yet.”\n“You want to hear me admit it? Kip nearly broke the test,” Gavin said.\n“Like Dazen did.”\n“Or worse, passed it,” the White said.\nChapter 52\nKarris knew she was even deeper in trouble than she’d feared within five\nminutes of being captured. King Garadul’s Mirrormen walked her at\ngunpoint over to a wagon. They didn’t bind her hands, which she thought\nwas curious and gave her a momentary hope. Then the Mirrormen handed\nher off to half a dozen drafters, all women. Two Mirrormen stayed, their\npistols leveled at her head, barely blinking.\nThe women—two reds, a green, a blue, and a super—stripped her\nnaked and searched her and her clothes, quickly finding her eye caps. The\ntwo Mirrormen barely even glanced at her body, and though men around the\ncamp turned to see whatever they could between all the drafters\nsurrounding her, there wasn’t a single ribald comment.\nDisciplined. Damn it.\nCrossing her arms over her breasts, Karris looked down, feigning\nembarrassment. Well, maybe not completely feigning.\n“Eyes up!” one of the reds commanded.\nKarris looked up. They wanted to see her eyes so they would know as\nsoon as she tried to draft. Smart too, damn it twice.\nIn rapid order, they went through all her clothing, scrunching every\nseam to look for hidden pockets. Then they went through her bag, one\ncarefully cataloguing all the items in a codex. After they’d found\neverything, Karris hoped they’d give her back her clothes.\nNo such luck. Instead, they opened the door of the wagon and threw a\nviolet dress and shift inside.\n“Get in,” the same red who’d spoken before said.\nKarris got in and the door slammed behind her. She heard a bar being\nlowered and chains pulled into place. The inside of the wagon was fairly\nspacious. There was a pallet to sleep on, a chamber pot, a cup of water,\nseveral blankets and pillows—all violet, the deepest into the blue spectrum\nthey could find. And from the noxious smell, all freshly painted. The\nwindows were fitted with bars and violet glass, draped on the outside with\nviolet cloth. Apparently they were taking her drafting seriously, and from\ntheir study of her eyes and the mag torches, they knew she could draft green\nand red. Rather than risk a color that was between her colors, they’d picked\nthe one farthest to the end of the spectrum she didn’t draft.\nIt was a strange kindness. They could have just blindfolded her, of\ncourse, but blindfolds slip. But most captors would have painted the wagon\nblack and made her live in darkness. This was just as effective, but a lot"

If a drafter couldn’t see her color, or didn’t have lenses and\nwhite light, she couldn’t draft. Karris was about as close to helpless as she\ngot. She hated the feeling with a passion.\nShe threw on the slip and the shapeless violet dress, and immediately\nscratched the paint. It had been heat-dried by a sub-red. She would be able\nto chip it eventually, but with the only light coming in through the violet\ncurtains and violet glass, it wasn’t going to matter anyway. Still, she tried.\nShe couldn’t help herself. Under the layer of violet paint was a layer of\nblack. Under that, the wood was a dark mahogany. No luck.\nThe wagon began rolling within minutes.\nThat night, after she was fed a hunk of black bread and given water in\na blackened iron cup, two drafters came in, their skin already full of red and\nblue luxin respectively. Behind them came, of all things, a tailor. She was a\ntiny woman who barely came up to Karris’s shoulder. She took Karris’s\nmeasurements rapidly, never writing them down, just committing them to\nmemory. Then she stared at Karris’s body for a long time, studying her like\na farmer studying a rocky sidehill that he needed to plow. She double-\nchecked her measurement of Karris’s hips, and then left without a word.\nOver the next five days, Karris learned little. Apparently her wagon\nwas close to the cooking wagons, because all she heard all day was the\nrattle of pots at every bump in the road. The shadowy figures of horsemen,\nmaybe Mirrormen, sometimes passed close enough to her covered windows\nfor her to see their silhouettes. If they spoke, though, she could never make\nout the words. At night, she was given food in a blackened iron bowl, with a\nblackened iron spoon and black bread and water, never wine—damn them,\nthey even thought of the red of wine. A Mirrorman accompanied by a\ndrafter took her chamber pot, bowl, spoon, and cup each night after sunset.\nWhen she kept the spoon one night, hiding it under a pillow, they didn’t say\na word. Neither did they give her water the next day. When she surrendered\nthe spoon, she was given water again.\nThe boredom was the worst. There were only so many push-ups you\ncould do in a day, and anything more strenuous was impossible. There were\nno musical instruments, no books, and certainly no weapons or drafting to\npractice.\nOn the sixth night, two blues came in. “Choose a position that’s\ncomfortable,” one of them said. Karris sat on her little pallet, hands folded\nin her lap, ankles crossed, and they bound her arms and legs in about five\ntimes the amount of luxin necessary. Then they put violet spectacles over\nher eyes and left.\nKing Garadul entered the wagon, carrying a folding camp chair. He\nwore a loose black shirt over his shirt, which Karris could barely see, and\nvoluminous black pants over his pants. Karris understood being careful\naround her, but this was ridiculous.

Of course, I was just a boy, three years younger than you, and you\nwere already head over heels for… well, one of the Guile boys, I can’t\nremember which. Maybe you can’t either. There seemed to be some\nconfusion for a time, wasn’t there?”\n“You’re a real charmer, aren’t you?” Karris asked.\n“You might be surprised,” he said. He shook his head. “I always\nthought you were a beautiful girl, but the stories of you took on a life of\ntheir own. A tragic love triangle between the two most powerful men in the\nworld sort of demands a beautiful girl, doesn’t it? I mean, otherwise, why\nwould two men tear the world apart? For her insights about history? Her\nwitty repartee? No. You were a pretty girl made beautiful by the bards’ need\nto make some sense of what you wrought. Don’t get me wrong,” he said, “I\nwas so in love with you it kept me up nights. You were my first great\nunrequited love.”\n“I’m sure you’ve had many. Or do women pretend to find you\nattractive, now that you’re king?” Karris asked.\nTemper, Karris, temper. But the truth was, it wasn’t the red that made\nher say that. She’d always hated to perform for others, to do just what they\nwanted.\nHe scowled. “The shrewish tongue somehow was omitted from the\npanegyrics. Or is that a new addition?”\n“I feel a bit freer to speak my mind these days. I already destroyed the\nworld, what’s one man’s ego?” Karris said.\n“Karris, I was on my way to pay you a compliment before you made\nus descend to this unpleasantness.”\n“Oh, dear. Please do go on then, there’s nothing that would mean more\nto me than to hear praises from the Butcher of Rekton.”\nHe rubbed his palms together thoughtfully. “I’m sorry you had to see\nthat, Karris.” He kept using her name. She didn’t like it. “I hope you know I\ntook no joy in what I ordered there, but I also hope you understand that that\nsmall monstrosity will forestall larger ones in the future. You’re familiar\nwith the manuscript called The Counselor to Kings?”\n“Yes,” Karris said. “Loathsome advice and cruelty that not even he had\nthe stomach to countenance, when he himself ruled.” The Counselor asked\nwhether it was better for a ruler to be loved or feared. Both was best, he\ndecided, but if a ruler had to choose, he should always choose to be feared.\n“His advice was good. He was simply personally weak. I don’t hold\nthat against him. The fact is, Karris, when kings aren’t feared, they end up\nhaving to instill fear eventually, at grievous prices. That’s what happened at\nRu. That’s what happened at Garriston.

So tell\nme, how can you hold the death of a thousand against me, but not the death\nof tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, against them?”\nKarris hadn’t been allowed to see the royal steps at Ru, stained with\nthe blood and shit of hundreds murdered coldly one at a time and thrown\ndown the steps to the gaping, horrified crowds below. She’d been kept from\ngoing to Garriston even after the war, where tens of thousands—they didn’t\neven know how many—had perished in the red luxin fires of the besieged\ncity. That was Gavin’s and Dazen’s doing. Somehow, it had never seemed\npossible that men she knew so well would have done such things. Men she\nthought she knew so well.\n“The people of this land are my people. I am no mere satrap, no\nguardian of some other man’s land; I am king. These people belong to me.\nTo kill a thousand of my own was to cut a chunk out of my own flesh. But\ncancers have to be cut out. I am this land. My people work this land and\nbring forth crops at my good pleasure. I protect them and provide for them,\nand they in turn must render to me of their crops and of their sons. Those\nwho would not are rebels, traitors, thieves, and heretics, apostates. They\ndefy the holy compact. To defy me is to defy the gods’ order. I had to do\nthis because my father wouldn’t. If he had hanged half a dozen mayors\nwhen they first defied him and refused to send levies, that thousand would\nbe alive now. He was weak and wanted to be loved. No one may\nacknowledge it during my life, but by killing that thousand in Rekton, I\nsaved many more. This is what it is to be a king.”\n“You’re awfully passionate in your defense of decapitating babies and\nstacking their heads.” The gods’ order, not Orholam’s?\n“Karris, you’re making me understand why men beat their wives.”\nKing Garadul rubbed his black beard, but made no move to strike her. “By\nmaking the display so awful, I ensured it would be seared into every mind\nthat saw it. Do you think the dead care what happened to their bodies?\nBetter that their example save the living than that I bury them all in a hole\nand my descendants have to kill their descendants. That monument will stay\nfor a dozen generations. That is the legacy I will leave to my children’s\nchildren, a secure rule, without the need to commit such massacres\nthemselves. And the reason I tell you, Karris, is that I had hoped you of all\npeople might understand. You’re a woman now, not some frightened little\ngirl surrounded by great men. You’re a woman who’s seen great men and\nterrible deeds. I had hoped you might understand the burdens of greatness.\nAt least a little. Perhaps I give you too much credit.”\nKarris swallowed, trembling with rage and maybe a little fear. There\nwas a sick logic to everything he said, but she had seen the bodies. The\nblood.

You look better at thirty than you did at twenty,\nand I wouldn’t be surprised if you look better at forty than you do now. Of\ncourse, I’m sure it helps that you haven’t squeezed six or ten brats out of\nyour crotch. Most pretty girls do manage to find a husband before they get\nso old, but let’s not look a gift horse in the mouth.”\nReal charmer. What was it with King Garadul, did he just say\neverything that popped into his idiot head?\n“Yours is, indeed, a face to inspire poets. This, however”—he gestured\nto her vaguely, she wasn’t sure what he meant—“this must change. You\nhave shoulders like a man.” The bastard! How did he know how much she\nhated her shoulders? Whenever the fashions were such that she could hide\nher shoulders, they showed off her upper arms, or vice versa. And he’d said\nexactly what she said to herself at least once a week: I have shoulders like a\nman. But the king wasn’t done. “Your ass looks like a ten-year-old boy’s.\nMaybe it’s that dress. We’ll hope so. And your breasts. Your poor\nmagnificent breasts. Where have they gone? They were bigger when you\nwere fifteen! Your training ends now. I’ll allow you to resume dancing and\nriding when you no longer resemble a starved Dark Forest pygmy.”\n“I won’t be here that long,” Karris said. She frowned. Had she just\nadmitted she looked like a starved pygmy?\n“Karris, my dear. I’ve waited for you for fifteen years. And whether or\nnot you know it, you’ve been waiting for me, too. You and I don’t settle for\nsecond best. Why else would you still be unmarried? So we can wait a few\nmonths. I’ll come visit you when your dress is done.” He glanced around.\n“Oh, and I noticed you’ve nothing in here to entertain you. It must get\nboring. It’s good for a woman to excel in the pleasant arts. I’ll have my\nmother’s psantria brought in for you. That’s what you play, isn’t it?” He\nsmiled and went out.\nThe worst part of it was that Karris did feel thankful. A little. The\nbastard.\nChapter 53\nKip and Liv went straight to the Blackguards watching the lift. “We need to\nsee the Prism,” Liv said.\n“Who’re you?” the man asked. He was short, Parian of course, and\nbuilt like a cornerstone. He looked at Kip. “Oh, are you the Prism’s bas—”\nHe coughed. “Nephew.”\n“Yes, I’m his bastard,” Kip said angrily. “We need to see him now.”"

Stump? The short\nBlackguard’s name was actually Stump? Because the Blackguards were\nboth Parian, who traditionally had descriptive names like Ironfist, Kip had\nno idea if that was a nickname or really his name.\n“He took third watch last night,” Stump said, his mouth twisting.\n“Stump.” Pulling rank.\n“Awright, awright. I’m going.”\nStump left and the taller Blackguard turned and rapped on the door,\nthree times, pause, two times. Then, after five seconds, he repeated it.\nA room slave opened the door almost before the Blackguard finished\nknocking. A pretty woman with the unsettlingly pale skin and red hair of a\nBlood Forester, she was fully dressed and alert despite the early hour and\nthe darkness of the chamber behind her.\n“Marissia,” Liv said. “So good to see you again.” Her voice didn’t\nsound totally sincere.\nThe slave appeared none too pleased to see Liv. Kip wondered why\nLiv had used the slave’s name, then. He thought you were only supposed to\ndo that with slaves with whom you were friendly.\nFrom deep in the chamber, they heard Gavin’s voice, deep and\nscratchy from just waking, “Ummgh, give me a—” Whatever else he said, it\nwas lost in bass and pillows. A moment later, all the windows banged open\nand light streamed in from all sides, nearly blinding everyone, and eliciting\na loud groan from the Prism on his bed.\n“That’s brilliant magic!” Liv said. “Look at that, Kip!” She pointed at\na dark purplish-black strip of glass around the glass walls that encircled the\nwhole chamber.\n“What are you—Are you forgetting why we’re here?” Kip asked.\n“Oh, sorry.”\nGavin was squinting at them. “Marissia, kopi, please.”\nThe woman bobbed. “First closet, third from the left.” Then she left.\n“Kopi’s in the closet?” Gavin asked. “What the hell? Who puts kopi—\nand why aren’t you serving me?” The door closed behind her. “And where’s\nmy favorite shirt—oh, closet. Damned woman.”\n“Clearly a morning person,” Liv said under her breath.\nKip snorted before he could stop himself.\nGavin had been looking down as if feeling trapped, but now he shot\nKip a look. “This had better be important.” He threw off his covers and\nwalked toward the closet.

He wasn’t wearing anything.\nKip had seen Gavin’s forearms, with hemp ropes for muscles, and he’d\nknown his father was lean, but seeing his whole body was half awe-\ninspiring and half a slap in the face. Kip’s shoulders were as broad as\nGavin’s, and his arms were probably as big around as Gavin’s, but even\nnow—not after exertion, not filled from hard labor—but now, after\nsleeping, Gavin’s body was one smooth curving muscle meeting another,\nover and over, without an ounce of softness anywhere. Apparently sculling\nand skimming around the entirety of the Seven Satrapies did that to a man.\nHow did I come from this?\nNext to him, Kip grew aware of Liv staring, openmouthed. She didn’t\navert her eyes, even as Gavin had to rummage through the closet.\n“Liv,” Kip said under his breath.\n“What?” she asked, glancing away, her cheeks bright. “He’s the Prism.\nIt’s practically my religious duty to give him my full attention.”\nGavin, who’d seemed oblivious to them, grabbed some clothing and\nsaid, without looking at them, “Ana, staring is rude.”\nLiv blushed harder and sank into herself, horrified.\n“Her name’s Liv,” Kip said.\n“I know her name. Now what is it?” Gavin demanded, pulling on a\ndazzling white silk shirt with gold piping.\nThe door opened behind Kip, and Marissia and Commander Ironfist\nstepped into the room. Ironfist stopped at the door, while Marissia brought\nin a tray with a silver service on it and three cups. She poured a dark,\ncreamy, steaming brew into one cup and handed it to Gavin, whose pants\nand sleeves were still unlaced. “Commander? Kip?” Gavin asked,\nmotioning to the other cups. “I think Liv is quite alert enough already.”\nLiv looked like she wanted to fall through the floor. Kip grinned.\nIronfist helped himself to the kopi while Marissia took over dressing\nGavin. Kip picked up a cup too. But as he picked up the carafe, his hands\nstarted shaking so badly he couldn’t even try to fill his cup.\n“Someone tried to throw me off the balcony,” Kip said.\nIt was like the words made it real. One moment ago, he’d been joking\nwith Liv, thinking about how unlike his father he was, and grinning when\nLiv got embarrassed. Now the reality of how close he’d come to getting\nthrown to his death came crashing in on him. He could see himself falling,\ntwisting, helpless, like in an awful dream, and then his body bursting like a\njuicy grape.\nAnd who would have suspected anything? The woman could have\nslipped into his room, thrown him off the balcony, and then simply left.\nEven if they’d figured out who was on the floor at the time, who would\nexpect a big woman as an assassin? People would have thought Kip had\nbroken after his testing and jumped. No one would have known.\nAnd who would have cared?\nKip felt a great gnawing emptiness in his chest.\nHe’d never been part of anything. Even back in Rekton, he hadn’t\nbelonged.

Too fat and awkward for Isa, too smart to feel a connection to\nSanson, who seemed a whisker away from simple, relentlessly mocked by\nRam, too young for Liv. He’d thought that being part of the Chromeria\nwould make him be part of something for the first time in his life. He was\ngoing to be different here, too. He would be different and alone, no matter\nwhere he went.\nOrholam, why had he even stopped that woman from throwing him\nover? Two moments of terror, sure, and a mess of exploded Kip on the\nrocks. But the terror would end, everything would end, and the sea would\nwash away the mess.\nSomeone slapped him. Kip staggered. Rubbed his jaw.\n“Make the words, Kip,” Gavin said.\nSo Kip told them everything. Liv stared woodenly at the floor when he\ntold of her leaving after he’d told her that he thought her father was dead.\nCommander Ironfist said, “General Danavis has been living in some\nbackwater village all this time?” He glanced at Liv. “Sorry, I knew we had a\nDanavis at the Chromeria, but I didn’t think you were related.” He cleared\nhis throat and shut up.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if he did get away,” Gavin said. “The general\nwas always a wily bastard, and I mean that in the best possible way.”\nLiv grinned, weakly and briefly. Kip told them the rest of it.\nAfter he finished, Gavin and Ironfist shared a look. “The Broken Eye?”\nIronfist asked.\nGavin shrugged. “Impossible to know. Of course, that’s the point.”\n“The what?” Kip asked.\n“My magisters told us that was a myth,” Liv protested. The Prism and\nthe commander of the Blackguard turned to look at her. She swallowed hard\nand stared at the floor.\nIronfist said, “Your magisters are partly right. The Order of the Broken\nEye is a reputed guild of assassins. They specialize in killing drafters.\nThey’ve been rooted out and destroyed on at least three separate occasions,\nif not more. No satrap or satrapah enjoys losing drafters who’ve cost them\nso much before the end of their natural span. We believe that each time the\norder has reformed, it’s been without any connection to any of the previous\norders.”\n“To put it plainly,” Gavin said, “some thug rounds up a few more\nthugs, hoping to make a lot of money from backstabbing a few drafters, and\nthey name themselves the Order of the Broken Eye so they can demand\nhefty payments. It’s pure pretense.”\n“How do you know?” Kip asked.\n“Because if they were real, they’d be better at their job.”\nKip scowled. His assassin had been pretty good.\n“It’s not to say they’re all equally incompetent, Kip,” Gavin said.\n“That’s the whole point. We shouldn’t even have brought it up. It doesn’t\nget us any closer to the real problem. Whether or not the order is real,\nsomeone sent an assassin to kill you. You haven’t been here long enough to\nmake any enemies, so it’s clearly an enemy of mine. There’s only one thing"

There’s only one thing\nfor us to do.”\nKip bit. “What?” He didn’t want to admit that he had already made an\nenemy. Surely that tester, Magister Galden, wouldn’t have sent an assassin\nafter him, would he?\n“We run away.” Gavin grinned, a reckless, boyish grin, eyes dancing.\n“What?!” Kip and Liv asked at the same time.\n“Meet me at the docks in an hour. Liv, that means you too. You’ll be\nKip’s tutor. We’re going to Garriston.”\n“Garriston?” Liv asked.\n“Pack quick,” Gavin said. “You never know where the order is\nlurking.” He grinned again, teasing.\n“Oh, thanks,” Liv said.\n“Pack?” Kip asked as Gavin swept out of the room. “I don’t even own\nanything!”\nChapter 54\nThe prisoner studied the dead man. “I’m going to kill you,” he said quietly.\n“I don’t die easy,” the dead man said, his mouth twitching. He was\nseated opposite Dazen, in his wall, knees folded, hands in his lap, his pose a\nmockery of Dazen’s own. He glanced at the carefully woven rag in Dazen’s\nlap. “Who would have thought?” the dead man mused. “Gavin Guile, so\npatient, so quiet, so content doing women’s work.”\nDazen studied his handiwork. Woven of his own hair as tight as he\ncould manage with calm cool blue flowing through his body, he wasn’t even\nsure how long he’d spent on it. Weeks, maybe. It made almost a skullcap, a\nsmall bowl. He studied the shiny interior. Finding, perhaps, a flaw, he took a\nlong but perfectly round fingernail and scraped it around his nose, over his\nforehead in methodical strokes. Harvesting the accumulated skin and, more\nimportantly, the precious oil with another fingernail, Dazen smeared the oil\ncarefully onto the flaw.\nHe was only going to get one chance. After years and years, he wasn’t\ngoing to mess it up.\nWith a steady hand and skin filled with blue, he gathered more oil and\nsmeared it on the wall directly over the dead man’s face.\n“This doesn’t change anything, Gavin,” the dead man said.\n“No, not yet,” he said.\nHe stood and drafted a blade. He cut off a hank of his greasy hair. He\nspat on it and scrubbed it against his dirty skin, getting it as foul as possible.\n“You don’t need to do this,” the dead man said. “It’s madness.”\n“It’s victory,” Dazen said. He drew the blue luxin blade smoothly\nacross his chest.\n“If you’re going to kill yourself, the wrist or the neck would work\nbetter,” the dead man said.\nDazen ignored him. With dirty fingers, he pulled the cut open and\ntucked the putrid mass of hair and dirt under the flap of skin.

The clothes in her hand were some lacy\nundergarments. Distracting.\n“You know, when you were busy trying to get killed.”\n“Oh, um, apology accepted?” Kip asked. What was she apologizing\nfor? He shifted the weight on the pack that Commander Ironfist had given\nhim before disappearing. Apparently it had taken Ironfist almost no time to\ngather some spare clothing, a waterskin, tools, and even a short sword for\nKip. Kip still hadn’t figured out how to get the pack to sit comfortably on\nhis shoulders, though. He’d come to Liv’s room to help her pack, but she\nwasn’t making things any easier. He glanced at the short pants again.\n“They’re just underclothes, Kip.” Ack, caught!\n“They’re see-through,” Kip said. How could such a small bit of cloth\nactually fit a person inside it?\nLiv looked down and colored a little, but played it off. She tossed the\nshort pants to Kip, who caught them instinctively, and instantly felt\nawkward. “Would you check if those are clean?” she asked.\nKip’s eyebrows shot off his face and stuck somewhere three floors up.\n“I’m teasing. I just moved and they gave me all new clothes.\nEverything here is new.”\n“Except my gullibility, apparently,” Kip said. That was twice in as\nmany days she’d fooled him.\nShe laughed. “You’re great, Kip. It’s like torturing the little brother I\nnever had.”\nOh, the little brother comparison. Just what every man wants to hear\nfrom a beautiful woman. I’ve just been castrated. “So would I feel more or\nless awkward holding my sister’s underclothes?”\nLiv laughed again. “Would these be better or worse?” She held up\nsome black lace that looked like little more than two strings tied together\nartistically.\nKip gaped.\nThen she held them up to her hips and cocked a saucy eyebrow at him.\nKip coughed.\n“I think I need to sit down,” he said. She laughed like he hoped she\nwould, but he wasn’t completely kidding. He backed up toward a chair—\nand instantly bumped into someone.\n“Watch it,” Commander Ironfist said. “You don’t want to run into\nsomeone with that little sword sticking out.”\nKip was too mortified for words. Little? Liv saw the look on his face\nand burst out laughing so hard she fell on the bed. She laughed so hard she\nsnorted, a decidedly unladylike sound, and then that made her laugh harder."

She laughed so hard she\nsnorted, a decidedly unladylike sound, and then that made her laugh harder.\nTurning around, Kip felt Ironfist’s firm hand guiding his pack away\nfrom him so he didn’t stab him with the scabbarded short sword on top of it.\nOh, that little sword. Relief flooded Kip, until he saw Ironfist glance\ndown at the sheer short pants in his hands.\n“You need me to find some in your size?” Ironfist asked drily.\nLiv snorted again, giggling so hard she was gasping for breath.\n“Aliviana,” Ironfist said. “You’re done packing? Because we’re\nleaving in five minutes.”\nLiv’s laughter stopped instantly. She popped off the bed and began\nrummaging through her things at great speed. Ironfist let a small, satisfied\nsmirk steal over his face briefly, then he dropped another pack next to Kip’s\nand walked out. Before Kip could ask him about it, Ironfist said, “Move it,\nboy genius. If you haven’t figured out the straps on your pack before I get\nback…”\nHe didn’t complete the threat. He didn’t need to.\nSoon they were striding onto the docks together. Despite his threats,\nIronfist had helped them with some settling of the packs. Mostly, that meant\nmoving things from Liv’s pack to Kip’s. When Kip asked the silent question\n—why are you making me carry her stuff?—Ironfist had said, “It’s more\ncomplicated to be a girl. You got a problem?” Kip shook his head quickly.\nAs they walked down the docks, past fishermen unloading catches,\napprentices of various trades running back and forth, loiterers, merchant\nwomen arguing with captains about prices for goods or transit—basically,\nall the normal business of the day—many people stopped whatever they\nwere doing for a few moments. It wasn’t to watch Kip, of course. It was to\nwatch Commander Ironfist. The man was big, and imposing, and handsome,\nand he strode with a total self-awareness, but it wasn’t his sheer physical\npresence that got him so much attention. He was, Kip realized, famous.\nAs Kip turned to see the faces looking at Commander Ironfist, he could\nsee Gavin walking onto the docks. And if for Commander Ironfist, business\nslowed, for the Prism, it stopped entirely. Gavin walked through smiling\nand nodding to people automatically, but they treated him like he was\nnearly a god. No one tried to touch Gavin himself, but not a few brushed his\ncloak as it floated past.\nWhat am I doing with these people?\nA week ago, Kip had been cleaning puke off his mother’s face and hair\nwhile she lay passed out from another binge. In their hovel. With a dirt\nfloor. No one in their backwater town had paid him the least mind. The\naddict’s boy, that’s all he was. Maybe the fat boy.

Kip hadn’t learned\nanything, and now they were going back.\n“Hey,” Liv said, “why so glum?” She laid a hand on his arm, which\ntingled from the contact. They’d stopped at an empty place on the dock,\ndown a ramp low to the water, and Commander Ironfist was drafting a luxin\nplatform onto the water, the first building block of a scull.\n“I, uh, I don’t know. Thinking about Tyrea makes me think about—”\nAnd from somewhere that Kip didn’t even know he had, tears tried to come\nup at the thought of his mother, dying. He pushed them away, diverted them\nto someone more worth mourning. “You know, I hope your father’s well,\nLiv. He was… he was always good to me.” He was the only one.\nYet even with Master Danavis, there had been a wall, a point past\nwhich he wouldn’t let Kip in. Was it just because of his own history that he\nhad to keep secret? Or was there something deeper, something wrong with\nKip?\n“Kip,” Liv said. “It’s going to work out.”\nHe looked over at her and couldn’t help but smile. Orholam had never\nmade a more beautiful woman. Liv could shame the sunset with her\nradiance. He fell into her dimples, hopeless. He looked away.\nLittle brother, he sneered at himself. Fun to joke around with, but not a\nman. The despair threatened to choke him completely.\n“Thanks,” he managed to push past the lump in his throat. “Can I have\na snack?” he asked Ironfist.\n“Yes, of course,” the big man said.\n“Great!”\n“When we get back.”\n“Hey!”\n“Now shut it, the Lord Prism is here.”\nAll eyes still on him, Gavin stopped in front of Commander Ironfist.\nHe looked at Ironfist’s pack. Neither said anything for a long time.\n“You can’t come, I’m not taking a bodyguard,” Gavin said finally.\n“I’m not coming with you,” Ironfist said.\n“Then get off my scull.”\n“I’m coming with Kip. He’s a member of the Prism’s family, and he’s\nentitled to protection.”\n“You’re the commander of the Blackguard, you can’t possibly—”\n“I can do what I deem appropriate to discharge the duties of the\nBlackguard. None may interfere with that. None.”\n“You are a wily bastard, aren’t you?” Gavin said.\n“It’s why I’m still here,” Ironfist said. “And quite possibly why you\nare, too.”\nGavin grunted. “You win, but let me remind you of your oaths.”\nIronfist looked offended.\n“You’ll understand soon,” Gavin said. “Everyone, load up.”\nWith a quick, practiced hand, Gavin drafted a set of the special oars he\nused to propel the scull, but he clearly left room for Ironfist to draft his own,"

Meanwhile, Gavin drafted a bench\nfor Kip and Liv to sit on, and straps to hold all the bags in the boat.\nIronfist wrinkled his nose at that, as if wondering why the bags would\nneed to be strapped in, but he didn’t ask. In moments, they were off. Gavin\nmanned his oars, and Ironfist manned his, and they sped out into the bay.\nThe scull began veering to port almost immediately. It was Gavin’s\nside. Kip realized Ironfist was rowing faster than Gavin, and the imbalance\nwas driving them to port. Gavin looked over at Ironfist, who grinned back at\nhim, continuing to sweep huge long strokes with his arms and legs. Gavin\nsped up. So did Ironfist. So did Gavin. Soon they were sculling across the\nwater at a nice pace.\nLiv looked over at Kip. “Can you believe this? I’ve never gone this\nfast!”\nKip laughed.\n“What?” she asked.\n“You’ll see.”\nThe men settled into a rhythm. They were going fast, competing, but\nneither trying to bury the other. “When are we going to meet your ship?”\nIronfist asked, raising his voice to be heard over the wind.\n“We’re going to cross the sea on this,” Gavin said.\nIronfist laughed. “Right. You’ve got more endurance than I thought!”\nKip grinned. The big Parian clearly didn’t believe Gavin, but was\nwilling to play along.\nAfter twenty minutes, they were out of sight of any other ships. Barely\nslowing in his rowing, Gavin lifted one hand up and drafted one of the great\ntubes Kip had seen him use to propel the skimmer earlier. Ironfist looked at\nit quizzically.\n“This is what I meant about your oath,” Gavin said. “Secrecy.”\n“A tube attached to another tube. Your secret is safe with me, O\nPrism,” Ironfist said, grinning. “I hope it gets us out of this port turn,\nthough.”\nGavin dropped the tube into the water. The deck shuddered as the first\nluxin ball hit the water streaming through the tube, then, as it quickly settled\ninto the whup-whup-whup that was familiar to Kip, the skimmer shot\nforward. The whole skimmer rose up, and Ironfist almost fell over as his\noars came free of the water.\nThe skimmer sped up slowly and began to skip from one wave peak to\nthe next, then the skips got longer and longer, and soon the platform\nstopped hitting the waves at all. After a time, the astounded Ironfist joined\nin and they skimmed even faster.\nThe water was so clear, Kip could see the tube cutting through the\nwaves below them. Gavin had given each tube little wings. It was on those\nwings that the whole skimmer was flying above the surface. The wind was\nincredible, but Kip could hear Ironfist whooping over it.\nHours later, when the sun was halfway to the horizon, Gavin decided\nto switch back to sculling before they came in sight of Garriston.

He actually physically trembled.\nThen he swept into an elaborate bow before Gavin. “My Lord Prism,” he\nsaid, “you have made the world small.”\nGavin bobbed his head, acknowledging the bow. “Small, maybe. Safe,\nno. Did you see a corvette over that way?”\nIronfist shook his head. Their watercraft, no longer lifted up by the\naction of the tubes, sat low in the water. But by the time Ironfist had drafted\nnew oars, a corvette appeared, a league away, plowing right toward them.\nIronfist cursed.\nGavin grinned recklessly. “So Kip, Liv, you ever fought pirates?”\nChapter 56\n“Surely you’re joking,” Ironfist said. “My Lord Prism,” he added belatedly\nand not enthusiastically.\n“Let’s go hunting,” Gavin said.\n“My lord!” Ironfist said. “I can’t let you put yourself in that sort of\ndanger. We can outrun these Ilytian scum.

Can we have this conversation at a safer distance?” He\nglanced at the pirates. They were making good progress in the afternoon\nwind.\n“That’s what it was supposed to do,” Gavin said. “Instead, each\ngovernor has taken it as a personal chance to get rich. The Parians had the\nfirst rotation, and they stripped Garriston of everything that survived the\nfires. Every governor since then has followed their lead.”\nLiv spoke up. “During the first year, most governors try to keep the\nUmber River clear of bandits so the crops can get through. But most of the\ncrops come in too late on the second year. The governors don’t want to lose\nmen killing bandits just to enrich the next governor from some other\nsatrapy, so they withdraw into Garriston. Only the most optimistic farmers\neven bother planting on the second year anymore.”\n“While repeated sacking of Garriston and the surrounding country is\ntragic, it doesn’t have much to do with these pirates,” Gavin said. “The\nhandover happens after Midsummer’s, two weeks from now. The Ruthgari\nmerchants and craftsmen and wives and whores are busily loading their\nships to take whatever plunder they’ve managed to steal this time home. Or\njust whatever they brought with them.

Or\njust whatever they brought with them. I suppose just because every\ngovernor so far has been corrupt doesn’t mean the smiths who shoe their\nhorses are, too.”\n“This is fascinating,” Ironfist said, “but can’t some long guns shoot\neighteen or nineteen hundred paces?”\n“It’s farther away than that,” Gavin said. “Point is—”\n“Finally, thank Orholam,” Ironfist muttered.\n“Ahem. Point is, there’ll be an armada heading back to Ruthgar in two\nweeks. The pirates descend like wolves, and they take any ships that get\nseparated from the main fleet.”\n“Serves them right,” Liv said.\nGavin stared at her, and she scowled defiantly, but couldn’t handle the\neye contact, so she scowled at the waves.\n“Some merchants try to beat the rush and get out before the rest of the\nfleet, hoping they’ll avoid the pirates.”\n“But here they are,” Liv said.\n“Exactly,” Gavin said. “And if there’s war this summer, especially—\nOrholam forbid—if we lose, there’ll be chaos. Dozens of ships, maybe\nhundreds, all going their own direction, fleeing. A lot of the people in those\nships will be Tyrean, Aliviana.”\nShe looked chastened.\n“Smoke,” Kip said.\nAll conversation on the little scull stopped cold. Everyone turned to\nlook.\n“It would take an extremely skilled gunner to come within a hundred\npaces of us at this distance,” Gavin said, but Kip noticed he didn’t take his\neyes off the corvette either.\n“Maybe it was an empty charge, just to let us know—”\nThe water erupted twenty paces in front of the scull. The sound of the\nshot reached them only afterward.\n“That was quite a shot,” Gavin said. “The good news is that very few\ncorvettes have more than one gun mounted on the front, so we should have\nat least thirty seconds while they’re—”\n“Smoke!” Kip said.\n“I hate this part,” Gavin said. He and Ironfist scrambled onto their oar\napparatus.\nThis time, the splash was fifty paces in front of them.\n“Good to know the first one was lucky,” Liv said.\n“Unless the second was unlucky,” Kip said.\nGavin looked at Ironfist, a momentary worry line pressed between his\neyes. “Let’s go.”\n“Right!”\nThey began rowing and quickly picked up speed. “What can I do?”\nKip asked. He hated feeling useless.\n“Think!” Gavin said.\nThink? Kip looked at Liv to see if she had any idea what Gavin meant.\nShe shrugged.\n“Smoke!” she said.\nExcruciating seconds passed, then Kip heard an odd whistling hum.\nThe water exploded fifty paces behind them.\n“Didn’t expect us to come straight at ’em!” Gavin shouted. “Next\none’ll be closer!” He cackled.\nThe man had gone quite mad.\nSmoke. This time, Kip counted. One. Two. Three. He strained his eyes."

        "text": "one’ll be closer!” He cackled.\nThe man had gone quite mad.\nSmoke. This time, Kip counted. One. Two. Three. He strained his eyes.\nSurely he should be able to see something as big as a cannonball. Five. Si—\nBoom! The water exploded not fifteen paces to the left—port?—of the scull.\nKip actually felt spray.\n“See?” Gavin said. “Talented gunner!”\nMad. Totally mad. “It’s a six count between the smoke and the splash,”\nKip announced.\n“Good!” Gavin shouted. “Ironfist, hard starboard as soon as they—”\n“Smoke!” Liv said.\nThe men cut hard to starboard and the next shot splashed harmlessly a\ngood distance away, albeit probably perilously close to where they would\nhave been.\nAnother shot, and they turned even more to starboard. Again, the shot\nwas at least thirty paces off target. Kip looked at the wind and the sails of\nthe Ilytian ship. They were cutting at a hard angle, sails full, wind steady. It\nlooked like a good platform to shoot from, but as for how Kip could use\nwhat he was seeing to help them survive, he had no idea. He just didn’t\nknow anything about sailing. They were getting closer, though. Now the lag\nbetween the smoke and the shot was less than five seconds.\nThe scull cut back and forth, sometimes even stopping, and though\nKip’s fear never really shrank, he saw that Gavin was right. Their scull was\nsimply too fast, too small, too maneuverable to get hit—unless the gunner\nmade both a skillful and lucky shot. And though as they got closer to the\nIlytian ship they had less time to move between the cannon being fired and\nthe shot landing, the gunners were also having to change their angle more\nand more.\nThere was a long pause between shots.\n“What’s going on?” Kip asked.\n“Maybe they’re tired of wasting powder?” Liv asked hopefully.\nTen seconds later, they had their answer as twin columns of smoke\nerupted from the cannons.\n“Port!” Gavin shouted.\nHe’d guessed right. Water erupted both where they would have been if\nthey’d gone straight and where they would have been if they’d turned to\nstarboard. Though it was longer between volleys, now the pirates could\nmake two guesses of where the scull was headed instead of one.\n“Clever bastard!” Gavin said. “Time to cheat! Kip, switch me.” He\nclambered off the oars, and Kip jumped in.\n“Straight,” Gavin said. Blue flooded his skin and he drafted a\npropulsion tube into the water. As before, they leapt forward. Kip and\nIronfist almost fell as Gavin cut their oars smooth. But if he hadn’t, Kip\nrealized, they’d have been ripped apart by the inexorable turning of the\ngears.\nGavin’s teeth gritted under the strain of pushing the entire boat by\nhimself, muscles knotting, veins standing out on his neck, but after a\nmoment as they gained speed and it became easier, he said, “Ironfist, put\nfire grenadoes in all the cannon holes and the sails. Liv, cut the rigging. Kip,"

Kip,\nyou…” He paused like he couldn’t think of anything for Kip the Inept to do.\n“You call out anything you think I don’t see. Take my pistols.” Gavin pulled\nhis hand from one of the tubes and drafted a basin and filled it with red\nluxin in moments. Ironfist instantly began drafting blue projectiles and\nfilling them with the flammable goo.\nThey traversed the last five hundred paces before the men scrambling\non deck could reload the front cannons. Only one man seemed unfazed by\ntheir impossible speed.\n“Musketeer!” Kip shouted. One of the gunners, whether or not it was\ntheir cannoneer with the preternatural aim Kip didn’t know, stood at the\nbow, calmly tamping powder down his musket with a ramrod. With smooth,\nfast motions, he drew a square of cloth, reached into another pocket for a\nbullet, and then tamped those. He held a smoking slow match in his teeth.\nAs they got closer, Kip saw that the gunner was Ilytian, with skin as\nblack as gunpowder, aboriginal features, a scattered dark beard, short loose\ntrousers cut off below the knees, and an incongruously fine royal blue jacket\nover his lean frame with no shirt. His wiry black hair was bound in a thick\nponytail. His knees were bent, compensating for the rolling motion of the\ndeck as naturally as breathing. He fixed the burning fuse into place.\n“I said, musketeer!” Kip shouted. They cut the water right beside the\ncorvette as the cannon portholes opened and the ship turned hard away from\nthem.\nGavin just turned with the bigger vessel. No one was going to do\nanything. Kip cocked the hammers of Gavin’s dagger-pistols, trying not to\nskewer himself on the long blades.\nThe musketeer pivoted smoothly, aiming at Gavin. Kip raised both\npistols.\nThe musketeer shot first. His gun exploded in his hands, knocking him\noff his feet. Kip pulled both triggers. The pistol in his right hand scraped the\nflint against the frizzen, but didn’t throw a spark. Nothing happened. The\npistol in his left hand roared. It kicked back at Kip with far more force than\nhe’d expected.\nKip spun, tripped, and slid toward the back of the skimmer, rolling,\nscrambling. He saw Liv flinging both of her hands forward, then turning,\nher pupils tiny pinpricks as she drafted superviolet. Then she dove for him.\nTumbling facedown, Kip lost sight of Liv, the ship, the drafters, and\nthe battle. All he saw was the slick blue of the skimmer’s deck, sliding away\nbelow him. His face slid over the edge. His forehead skipped off the water\nblurring past them, making his whole head bounce up, just about tearing his\nhead off his neck. On the second bounce, he wasn’t so lucky. His nose went\nunder, and positioned off the back of the skimmer as he was, his nostrils"

His nose went\nunder, and positioned off the back of the skimmer as he was, his nostrils\nacted as twin scoops, jetting water up into his sinuses at great speed.\nLiv must have grabbed him, because there was no third bounce, but\nKip could see nothing, think of nothing. He was coughing, retching, crying,\nblind, spitting up salt water.\nBy the time he propped himself up, the Ilytian corvette was two\nhundred paces behind them. Its sails sagged, cut and burning. Smoke\nbillowed out of all the cannon portholes on the starboard side, and fire was\nvisible on the decks. And the whole ship was sitting low in the water. Men\nwere leaping off the decks on every side.\nCommander Ironfist, who’d barely said two words the entire time,\nsaid, “Men jumping off that fast means the fire must be headed for the—”\nThe middle of the corvette exploded, sending wood and ropes and barrels\nand men flying every direction. “—powder magazine,” Ironfist finished.\n“Sorry bastards.”\n“Men like those kill and rape and steal and enslave. They don’t\ndeserve our pity,” Gavin said, slowing the skimmer. He was talking to Liv\nand Kip, who both sat almost equally wide-eyed. “But Ironfist’s right. It’s\nno easy thing to be the hand of justice.” He dropped the tube into the water.\n“We’ll row the rest of the way. By the by, nice shot, Kip.”\n“I hit him?”\n“Blew the captain right off his wheel.”\n“The wheel’s at the… uh, back, right?” The musketeer had been at the\nfront.\n“Stern?” Liv suggested.\nA dubious look. “You weren’t aiming at the captain, were you?” Gavin\nasked.\n“Aiming?” Kip asked, grinning.\n“Orholam have mercy, the nut doesn’t fall far from the tree,” Ironfist\nsaid. “However, luck is a—”\n“ ‘Luck’ is not dropping your father’s priceless, one-of-a-kind pistols\nin the sea,” Gavin said.\n“I dropped your pistols?” Kip asked, heart dropping.\n“Whereas ‘slick’ is catching said pistols at the last moment,” Gavin\nsaid, producing the weapons from behind his back. He grinned.\n“Oh, thank Orholam,” Kip breathed.\n“You still almost lost my pistols,” Gavin said. “And for that, you get to\nrow. Liv, you too.”\n“What?!”\n“You’re his tutor. He’s your responsibility. Everything he does wrong\nis on you.”\n“Oh, perfect,” she said.\nChapter 57\n“It looks so… dirty,” Kip said. After seeing the wealth of Big Jasper and the\nmagical edifices of the Chromeria, Garriston looked decidedly\nunimpressive.\n“Dirt is the least of it,” Gavin said.\nKip wasn’t sure what that meant, but he was sorry that he’d been\nunconscious when he’d floated through the city the first time with Gavin. If\nhe had seen Garriston then, it would have doubtless been impressive. It\nwould have been the largest gathering of humanity he’d seen in his life, at"

Rekton’s alcaldesa would never have tolerated the\nheaps of trash Kip could see pushed into the alleys just off the docks, sitting\nright next to crates often holding food. Disgusting.\nThe docks had perhaps forty ships, half-protected by a seawall with\ngreat gaps in it. Liv saw Kip looking at the holes, wondering if there was\nsome purpose for them. “The occupiers never really want to break their\nbacks helping out us backward Tyreans,” she said. “The moorages opposite\nthe gaps in the seawall are given to locals. You should see the captains\nscurry when a winter storm comes. The soldiers gather up in the towers and\ntake bets on whether individual ships will break up.”\nThe scull, powered by Liv and a hard-breathing Kip, cruised past\ngalleys, galleasses, corvettes, and fishing dories full of locals mending their\nnets. The men and women stopped their work at the sight of a scull, much\nless a scull with such an exotic crew. It warmed Kip just to see Tyrean faces\nagain. It made him feel at home. Only as they went past did he see the\nhostility on those faces.\nAh, not much for foreign drafters. Guess that makes sense.\n“Where are we going?” Kip asked.\nCommander Ironfist pointed to the most magnificent, tallest building in\nthe city. From here, all Kip could see was the perfect egg-shaped tower with\na spike pointing to heaven. A wide stripe around the widest part of the tower\nwas inlaid with tiny round mirrors, none bigger than Kip’s thumb. In the\nafternoon sun, the tower seemed to be on fire. Above and below that stripe\nof mirrors, similar stripes of other colors of glass were inlaid as well.\n“I sorta figured,” Kip said. “What I meant was, where should we dock\nthe scull?”\n“Right there,” Gavin said, pointing to a blank wall at the point nearest\na gate. It wasn’t a docking spot, and the level of the streets was a good four\npaces above the level of the water.\nNonetheless, Kip and Liv steered—fairly expertly, Kip thought—\ntoward the wall. The scull’s nose dipped lower in the water as blue luxin\nbloomed on the front of the boat and snaked out. It solidified as soon as it\ntouched the wall and became steps, locking the scull in place and giving\nthem easy egress.\n“I’m still not used to this whole magic thing,” Kip said.\n“I’m thirty-eight years old,” Commander Ironfist said, “and I’m not\nused to it. Just a little quicker to react. Grab your packs.”\nThey did, and climbed the stairs to street level while locals looked at\nthem curiously. After they were all off, Gavin touched a corner of the stairs.\nAll the luxin in the scull lost coherence and dissolved, falling into the water\nas dust, grit, and goo depending on its color.

The yellow even flashed a\nlittle, much of its mass translated back into light, and the water popped up a\nlittle, suddenly freed of the weight of the scull. Gavin, of course, paid it all\nno heed.\nThis is normal for him. What kind of world have I stepped into? If\nGavin were at dinner and misplaced his knife, he’d draft one rather than get\nup and look. If his cup were dirty, he’d draft a new one rather than clean the\nold. That gave Kip a thought.\n“Gavin—er, Lord Prism, why don’t drafters wear luxin?” Kip asked.\nGavin grinned. “They do, sometimes. Obviously, yellow breastplates\nand such are highly valued in battle, but I’m guessing you mean as clothes.”\n“You use magic for everything,” Kip said.\n“That’s me,” Gavin said. “A normal drafter isn’t going to shorten her\nlife just so she doesn’t have to dock her scull another fifty paces out. Well,\nsome would, of course. The truth is, there was a fashion of wearing luxin\nclothing once, when I was a boy. With the application of enough will, even\nsome kinds of sealed luxin can become fairly flexible. Soon, there were\ndrafter-tailors who specialized in the clothing. But most people couldn’t\nafford them, and if you make your own, there are any number of mistakes\nyou can make. Some are fairly harmless, like making your pant legs too\nstiff. But if you made a mistake in the drafting, your shirt might dissolve\ninto dust in the middle of a day. Or”—Gavin cleared his throat—“certain\nmischievous boys might learn how to unseal the luxin that the tailor-drafters\nhad woven. These boys might have caused some chaos at a memorable\nparty, where the ladies who’d gone to the expense of even having luxin\nundergarments found themselves in particular distress.” His mouth\ntightened, hiding a grin at a memory. “Sadly, the fashion ended rather\nabruptly after that.”\n“That was you? I heard about that party,” Liv said.\n“I’m sure whatever you heard was much exaggerated,” Gavin said.\n“No,” Ironfist said. “It wasn’t.”\nGavin shrugged. “I was a bad child. Fortunately, I’ve come a long way\nsince then. Now I’m a bad man.” He smiled, but it didn’t touch his eyes.\n“Here we go,” he said as three Ruthgari men approached.\nThe three all wore what looked to Kip like wool sheets with a hole cut\nfor the head, carefully folded so there were pleats at their wide leather belts.\nThe garment—a tunic?—then fell to the men’s knees. Though their legs\nwere bare, the wool seemed entirely inappropriate for Tyrea’s climate, and\nall three were sweating freely. All wore leather sandals, though the guards’\nlaced up into shin armor. The guards each carried a pilum, and a gladius and\na crude pistol at their belts. The man in the lead, apparently in charge, had\nhis tunic embroidered at the hem and on each breast. He carried a scroll, a\nlarge bag slung over one shoulder, and a heavy purse at his belt. He wore a\npair of clear spectacles low on his nose."

He wore a\npair of clear spectacles low on his nose.\nClear spectacles? What kind of drafter would want clear spectacles?\nBut as the men came close, Kip realized the man wasn’t a drafter at all.\nHis eyes were clear brown. The men were also all pale, a common Ruthgari\ntrait, Kip guessed. With their skin barely bronzed, they weren’t pale or\nfreckled like Blood Foresters, but they still seemed pretty ghostly. Their\nhair was a normal dark hue from brown to black, but straight, and fine.\nThey walked with either authority or hauteur. Kip glanced at Liv. She was\ndefinitely taking their attitude as the latter. She practically sneered at them.\nKip thought she might spit at their feet.\n“I am the assistant portmaster,” the man said. “Where’s your vessel?\nThe tax is levied according to size and term of stay.”\n“I’m afraid the size of our vessel is negligible at the moment,” Gavin\nsaid.\n“I’ll be the judge of that, thank you. Where’d you dock?”\n“Right about there,” Gavin said, pointing.\nThe assistant portmaster looked, then glanced up and down the wall,\nsquinting. There were no ships within fifty paces. He folded his arms, his\njaw setting as if Gavin were making fun of him. “The tax isn’t heavy, but let\nme assure you, the penalty for attempting to evade taxation is.”\nOne of the guards tapped the assistant portmaster’s shoulder, but the\nman ignored him.\n“As it should be,” Gavin said, still polite. He handed over a letter.\nThe man held the letter low, so he was looking through his spectacles,\nlike he was going to draft the letters right into words. “Oh,” he said quietly.\n“Oh, oh!”\nThe man’s head snapped up, and he peered at Gavin’s eyes through his\nspectacles. “Oh! My Lord Prism! A thousand pardons! Please, my lord, let\nus accompany you to the fortress. It would be a great honor to us.”\nGavin inclined his head.\n“I sort of thought you’d pick them all up with magic and shake them or\nsomething,” Kip said, once they all fell in behind the guards and the\nassistant portmaster.\n“There’s a time to toss idiots around,” Gavin said. “But this man’s just\ndoing his job.” They walked into the shadow of the fortress, whose northern\nwall nearly overhung the harbor. Both of them looked up. There were\narchers walking along the top of the wall, looking down at them. “Besides,”\nGavin said, “you start throwing luxin around, you never know who’s going\nto answer with gunfire.”\nThe assistant talked to the men guarding the gate. Lots of furtive\nglances at Gavin followed. Kip was busy looking at the fortress. The gate,\nand the entire fortress, was carved travertine. Mellow green, incised with a\ncrosshatched pattern to make the stone look woven rather than carved.\nThere were a number of murder holes cut in the gate.

As the soldiers opened\nthe gate, Kip saw that it led to a short killing ground, entirely enclosed, with\nmurder holes everywhere, then another gate. The guards at the second gate,\nwhich was open, carried muskets with almost bell-shaped muzzles. These\nguns were also shorter than the muskets the guards at the Chromeria\ncarried.\nKip was next to Ironfist now, so he asked, “Why are their muskets so\nshort?”\n“Blunderbusses,” Ironfist said. “Instead of a ball, they load them with\ncobblers’ nails or chain. At short range you can hit four or five men. Or\nblow a good hole in one. Good for rioters. A man cut in half isn’t any less\ndead than one with a small hole in his heart, but he’s a much greater\ndeterrent to everyone else in the crowd.”\n“Nice,” Kip said, swallowing.\nAfter a few more checkpoints, at which they accrued a few more\nsenior guards, they climbed several floors. When they were on the third\nfloor, they passed an open door to chambers overlooking the sea. Gavin\nstopped abruptly. Their escorts didn’t notice immediately. Ignoring them,\nGavin walked into the room.\nIronfist, Kip, and Liv followed him. The room was a suite of\napartments, filled with paintings, pillows, screens with ornate paintings of\nhunts, fireplaces, several chandeliers, and great long-handled fans for room\nslaves to waft their masters. Everywhere Kip looked, things sparkled,\nshined, and gleamed.\n“This,” Gavin announced as his escorts hurried in, “will be\nsufficient…”\n“Yes, Lord Prism, of course, this is the guest of honor’s suite. We’ll get\n—”\n“For my servants,” Gavin finished. “Kip, Liv, I trust you can stay out\nof trouble while I get our accommodations arranged?”\n“Yes, of course, my Lord Prism,” Liv said, a formality and maturity in\nher voice that Kip wasn’t familiar with.\n“Start Kip’s drafting lessons. I’ll check up on you after I’m finished\nwith a few things.”\n“Of course,” Liv said, curtseying. Kip half-bowed, and instantly felt\ndeeply foolish. He didn’t know how to bow. No one bowed where he grew\nup.\n“Ironfist?” Gavin said.\nIronfist raised an eyebrow—oh, now you want me to go with you?\n“Best chance you’ll have to see a pompous Ruthgari governor get\nkicked out of his rooms. More if you’re lucky. Might even be someone you\nknow.”\nThe corner of Ironfist’s mouth twitched. “It’s the simple pleasures that\nmake life beautiful, isn’t it?”\nChapter 58\nThe door closed behind them, and abruptly Kip and Liv were alone, away\nfrom the important people and the matters of state. Children once more.\nLiv looked at Kip for a long time.\n“What?” Kip asked.\n“Sometimes it’s really strange to me that you are who you are. A week\nago I would have blushed just at seeing Commander Ironfist. Now I’m\nsitting in the finest rooms in the Travertine Palace—and they’re mine?”"

Her eyes softened, compassion\netched on every feature. “You were there. In the village. When it\nhappened.”\n“At Green Bridge with Isa and Sanson. And Ram, of course.” He still\nwanted to sneer at the very thought of Ram, but that seemed cruel and small\nnow. “Ram and Isa were killed. Sanson and I got away. But eventually they\nkilled him too.” Kip’s voice was wooden and distant even in his own ears.\nHe couldn’t even look at Liv. If he saw her compassion, he’d break. He\nalready looked weak and foolish and young and fat in her eyes, a boy to be\npitied. He didn’t need to make it worse by crying. “My mother made it out\nbut her skull was smashed. I was with her when she…”\n“Oh, Kip, I’m so sorry.”\nHe pushed that down, pushed it aside. “Anyway, I really do hope your\nfather got out. He was always good to me. In fact, if he hadn’t made me\nleave when he did, I’d be dead.”\nLiv said nothing for a time. Kip couldn’t decide if it was an awkward\nsilence or not. “Kip,” she said finally, “I’ve been trying to work up the\nnerve to… Things can be really complicated now. With who your father is,\nand the way things are at the Chromeria… Sometimes things don’t really go\nthe way we want, and we—”\n“Am I supposed to have some idea what you’re talking about?” Kip\nasked. “ ’Cause…”\nShe opened her mouth and looked at him again. Then he saw the gates\ncome down. “I’m just really glad you made it out, Kip.”\n“Thanks,” he said. Thanks for not trusting me enough to say whatever\nyou just wanted to say. “Should we get started?”\nShe smiled wanly, like she wanted to say more but didn’t know how.\n“Sure. Come out to the balcony.”\nThey walked out onto the balcony, which hung literally over the sea.\nFrom above, they could hear the muffled voices of men speaking on top of\nthe Travertine Palace. Kip stood looking out at the sea, trying to put himself\nin a frame of mind to concentrate, and said, “What do I do?”\n“To draft you need four things,” Liv said. “Skill, Will—”\n“Source, and Still,” Kip said. “Er, sorry, I have picked up a thing or\ntwo.”\n“Right. So there’s basically modifications and nuances to each of the\nbig four, but that’s where it all starts. Let’s start with source.”\nKip thought that he’d picked up a lot of what she was going to say, but\none doesn’t interrupt a beautiful girl unless one is going to be funny. Liv\nrummaged through her pack and pulled out a rolled-up green cloth and then\na white one."

Liv\nrummaged through her pack and pulled out a rolled-up green cloth and then\na white one.\n“We’ll hold off on the color theory as much as we can,” she said. “We\nknow you’ve drafted green. So your source can either be something\nreflecting green light in the world or you can take something that has green\nas a component color and look at it through a lens.”\n“Huh?” Kip said. So much for this all being a repeat. “What do you\nmean reflecting green? You mean something green?”\n“Something you’ll learn the further you go in the Chromeria is that\nyour experience of a thing and the nature of the thing itself are often\ndifferent things.”\n“Sounds… uh, metaphysical,” Kip said. Hadn’t Gavin said something\nlike that?\n“Some take it that way, too, but I’m speaking strictly physically. Look\nat this.” Liv pulled out another cloth. It was a red spectrum, but instead of\nflowing smoothly from the deepest to the lightest red, there were parts that\ntook steps back. “When you look at this, Kip, you can tell that it’s off. It\ngenerally goes right, but there are subcolors out of sequence. Most men\ncan’t see that. They think it’s right. They can differentiate these four\nspectral blocks here, but not these blocks inside. It doesn’t matter how hard\nthey try, or how long they study it. Their experience of it is less nuanced\nthan yours or mine. Now, quite honestly, we don’t know if what you and I\nsee is the totality of what is actually there, or if some people from beyond\nthe Great Desert might think we’re as blind as we think the men are who\ncan’t tell this from this.”\n“That’s weird.”\n“I know. In class, the magisters usually have every boy come to the\nfront and attempt the test, just because so many of the girls who can see the\ndifferences can’t believe that everyone else can’t see them too. It’s pretty\nhumiliating. Actually, I think it’s worse for the girls who can’t see it either.\nThe boys aren’t expected to pass. The girls who can’t see it feel awful.” She\nshook herself. “Tangent. The point to remember, even if you don’t believe it\nnow, is that color doesn’t inhere in a thing. Things reflect or absorb colors\nfrom light. You think this cloth is green. It’s not. Really it’s a cloth that\nabsorbs all colors except green.”\n“This is us saving color theory for later?” Kip asked lightly.\nShe paused, then she saw he was teasing and she smiled. “No you\ndon’t, I’m not going to get drawn into more tangents. The point is, light is\nprimary. This cloth, in a dark room, is worthless to you. Obviously, you can\ntake the religious significances pretty deep, but you and I are only going to\ntalk about the physical, not the metaphysical. You can draft green light.\nThere are only a couple of ways for you to do that. The best is to have green\nthings around you. Especially if you have lots of them. Especially if you\nhave lots of different hues and tones available.”\n“So, like a forest.”"

        "text": "things around you. Especially if you have lots of them. Especially if you\nhave lots of different hues and tones available.”\n“So, like a forest.”\n“Exactly. That’s why before the Unification, the green goddess Atirat\nwas worshipped in Ruthgar and the Blood Forest more than anywhere else.\nGreen drafters flocked to the forests and the Verdant Plains because they\nwere more powerful there than anywhere else. In turn, those lands were\ndominated by the green virtues and the green vices, either simply because\nof the sheer amount of green being drafted there or because Atirat was real.\nTake your pick.”\n“That I don’t understand.”\n“We’ll worry about all that later. The second-best way to draft is to\nhave spectacles. Like these.” She reached into her pack and pulled out a\nlittle cotton pouch. Loosening the drawstring, she withdrew a pair of green\nspectacles.\n“You don’t draft green,” Kip said.\n“No, I don’t,” Liv said, smiling.\n“They’re for me?” Kip asked. Tingles shot down his spine.\nLiv smiled broadly. “Usually there’s a little ceremony, but it amounts\nto a congratulations.”\nKip took the spectacles gingerly. They had perfectly round lenses set in\na thin iron frame. He put them on his face. Liv stepped close and measured\nwhere the arms of the spectacles passed over his ears. Kip could smell her.\nSomehow, after a full day skimming across the entire sea and fighting\npirates and then baking in the sun, she smelled wonderful. Of course, Kip\nhadn’t been this close to a woman very often—except his mother, usually\ncovered with sweat or vomit on the nights he was unlucky and had to carry\nher home. Isa had smelled good too, but different than Liv.\nIsa had barely crossed Kip’s mind in the last days. He’d thought about\nher, but there was something hollow there. He’d let himself daydream about\nkissing Isa someday, but maybe that had been more because she was there\nthan that she was perfect for him. Or because she was there and Liv wasn’t,\nand Kip needed something to distract him from thinking about Liv.\nAnd now here she was. She’d measured both sides, and she took his\nspectacles off and was carefully bending the arms to fit behind his ears.\n“Hmm,” she said. “Your right ear’s higher than the left.”\n“My ears are lopsided?” Kip said. As if I didn’t have enough to be self-\nconscious about.\n“Don’t worry, mine are too! Really, most people’s are off a little bit.”\nShe paused. “Just not quite so much.” She shook her head in disbelief.\n“I’ve got freakish ears?”\nLiv grinned wickedly. “Gotcha.”\n“Orholam’s ba—Ahem, beard.” Kip scowled. Every time. Every\nstinkin’ time.\nShe smiled, self-satisfied, and gave the nose pieces a final bend, then\npropped the spectacles on his face. “There. You might have to play with\nthem to make them more comfortable, but they aren’t really meant to be on\nyour face all day long anyway.”\nHe looked around, and was not terribly surprised to see that most\neverything had a greenish tinge through the green glass."

        "text": "your face all day long anyway.”\nHe looked around, and was not terribly surprised to see that most\neverything had a greenish tinge through the green glass.\n“What you’re seeing is white light from the sun reflected off of\nsurfaces, then filtered through your lenses. So if you’re surrounded by white\nmarble walls or something, you’ll be able to draft almost as much as if you\nwere in a forest. The lenses aren’t as good as drafting from natural greens,\nbut it’s better than nothing. You can’t just look at anything, though. Look\naround. You see how some things really look green, and others don’t? Like\nif you look at this cloth, what color does it appear to be?” She drew another\ncloth out of her bag.\n“Uh, red.” Kip thought he could hear Gavin’s voice from the floor\nabove them, getting louder, angry.\n“It is red.”\nRefocusing his attention on Liv, Kip looked over his glasses, and\nthough the cloth’s tone was changed a little, it was indeed red. “So how\ndoes that work?” he asked.\n“The spectacles will only help if there are surfaces that are reflecting\ngreen to you. White surfaces work best because white is all the colors\ntogether. Much less good, but sometimes possible, will be drafting through\nyour lenses when looking at yellow or blue surfaces, since green is a\nsecondary color.”\n“Lost me there.”\n“So now you want the color theory?” She grinned, joking. “For your\npurposes, if you need to draft, the spectacles will help most if you can find\nthings that are either white or light-colored. Ripe wheat would work, a\nspruce tree won’t,” Liv said.\n“I think I can remember that,” Kip said. The whole things-aren’t-the-\ncolor-they-are thing really didn’t make sense, but he suspected he could\nwrestle with that later.\n“Good, so that covers source. For the time being.”\nYou mean we still have to cover skill, will, and still?\nLiv said, “I don’t want to beat this to death, and I’m sorry you don’t\nget to have the ceremony, because maybe that helps this sink in. Those\nspectacles are now your most important possession. Not only do most\ndrafters have to save up for months or even a year to afford one pair of\nspectacles, but everyone then immediately saves for a spare pair. If you get\nrich, or if the Prism orders it, I suppose, you can have a custom pair made\nby the lens grinders. They can give you a darker or lighter green or adjust\nthe frame for fit or looks. But without your spectacles, you’re close to\npowerless. I know you’ve been with the Prism, but he’s the exception. He\ndoesn’t need spectacles. His eyes don’t halo. He can use as much magic as\nhe wants. The rules don’t apply to him. Even the rules for Prisms don’t\nseem to apply to him. Can you imagine anyone else coming in here, alone,\nand simply taking over? From the Ruthgari? And the funny thing is, they’re\ngoing to take it.

He landed far\nbelow with a huge splash in the bay, and Kip saw him struggle to the\nsurface, spluttering, his rich clothes billowing in the water. He started\ncrying for help.\n“This is outrage—!” someone started to shout, then Kip saw another\nman plunge past the balcony. He splashed in the bay, almost on top of the\ngovernor.\nThere was a gigantic burst of light. “So help me, the next one of you\nisn’t going to land in water,” Gavin said, his voice ringing.\nKip expected to hear gunshots—surely the governor had guards—but\nthere was nothing. They took it.\nThat’s my father. That’s my father?\nGavin imposed his will, and the world took it.\n“So,” Kip said, feeling very much like the men floundering in the bay\nbeneath him, barely able to swim and desperate to be pulled out. “So. Will.\nThat’s next, right?”\nChapter 59\nCorvan Danavis approached Garriston as the sun set. The outer walls of\nGarriston, of course, had long ago been demolished. During the Prisms’\nWar—Corvan never thought of it as the False Prism’s War—he had set men\nto working on rebuilding them, but there just hadn’t been time. The outer\nwalls had been built to shield a city of hundreds of thousands. At the time of\nthe war, there had been perhaps ninety thousand. There had been no way to\nprotect them all.\nThe irrigation canals that could have been watering all the land\nbetween the outer walls and the inner walls were broken, except for one or\ntwo. But the inner walls still stood, as did the Ladies.\nThe Ladies, mostly now stripped of associations with the goddess\nAnat, guarded each gate. Each was an enormous white statue, incorporated\ninto the wall itself. Each had represented an aspect of Anat: the Guardian\nwas the colossus standing astride the entrance to the bay; the Mother\nguarded the south gate, heavily pregnant, defiant, dagger bared; the Hag\nguarded the west gate, leaning heavily on a staff; the Lover lay across the\nriver gate to the east. For reasons Corvan had never understood, the Lover\nwas depicted perhaps in her thirties while the Mother was depicted as very\nyoung, perhaps still in her teens. Each was carved of the most expensive,\nfaintly translucent white marble, such as was only available in Paria—\nOrholam alone knew how they’d shipped so much this far. The statues,\nluckily, had been coated in the finest sealed yellow luxin—all of one piece.\nAstounding work. The city had been invaded at least three times, and still\nthe Ladies were unmarked, even after the fiery devastation of the great\nconflagration.\nAnat, the Lady of the Desert, the Fiery Mistress, the sub-red, had been\nthe goddess of all hot passions: wrath, protection, vengeance, possessive\nlove, and furious lovemaking.

        "text": "love, and furious lovemaking. When Lucidonius had taken the city for\nOrholam and eliminated the cult, his followers had wanted to tear down the\nstatues, which, granted, would have taken some powerful drafters.\nFamously, Lucidonius had stopped them, saying, “Tear down only what is\nfalse.” Several times in the intervening centuries, zealous Prisms had\nwanted to tear down the pagan relics anyway, but each time the city had\nthreatened war. Until the Prisms’ War, Garriston had had enough military\npower that a threat of going to war with her was daunting.\nCorvan had never approached the Lover at sunset. As with the other\nLadies, her body was incorporated into the gate. She lay on her back, back\narched over the river, feet planted, her knees forming a tower on one bank,\nhands entwined in her hair, elbows rising to form the tower on the other\nbank. She was clad only in veils, and before the war a portcullis could be\nlowered from her arched body into the river, its iron and steel hammered\ninto shape so that they looked like a continuation of her veils. But in the\nwar the portcullis had been broken and never replaced.\nThe sight of her still took Corvan’s breath. With the sun setting, the\nthin yellow luxin sealing the statue, usually nearly invisible, was set alight.\nThe yellow was like golden bronze skin, fading slowly as Corvan walked\nand the sun sank, finally leaving only a welcoming silhouette—a wife\nwaiting abed for her long-absent husband.\nIt sent a pang through him. He could never come here without thinking\nof Qora, his first wife. Liv’s mother. Qora had greeted him like that once,\nlying abed, clad only in veils, deliberately mimicking the Lover when\nCorvan had returned to her. Even now, eighteen years later, grief and\nremembered desire and joy and love twined in his breast. Corvan had\nremarried in Rekton, two years after Qora’s death, but marrying Ell had\nbeen more to give Liv a mother than for love. Three years later, Ell had\nbeen murdered by an assassin who’d finally tracked Corvan down. Corvan\nhad considered moving, but the alcaldesa begged him to stay, and Kip was\nthere, so he’d stayed. But he’d not remarried again, not even with the\noverwhelming number of women for every man in Rekton and the constant\ncarping of the would-be matchmakers. He couldn’t love as he had loved\nbefore. Losing another woman he loved as much as he’d loved Qora would\nkill him, and it wasn’t fair to ask another woman to act as mother to his\ndaughter if he wasn’t willing to love her with his whole heart. Corvan no\nlonger had a whole heart to give.\nHe trudged on, past farms with their thin but ripening crops of spelt\nand barley, trying not to look at the Lover stretched luxuriously before him.\nReaching the gate, which opened through the spilling tresses of her hair, he\njoined the line of men and women heading back into the city, brushing past\nthose heading back out for the night. He kept his eyes down as he passed\nbetween two Ruthgari guards who had still been on their mothers’ knees"

He kept his eyes down as he passed\nbetween two Ruthgari guards who had still been on their mothers’ knees\nduring the war. They were barely paying any attention to the stream of\npeople passing by them, however. One was leaning against the Lover’s\ncascading hair, his foot propped against the rippling stone, his straw\npetasos, the characteristic Ruthgari broad-brimmed hat, thrown back to\nhang from his neck now that the sun wasn’t beating down on them. “…\nthink he’s here for?” he was asking.\n“Scorch me if I know, but they say he threw Governor Crassos into the\nbay. I suppose we’ll…”\nCorvan couldn’t hear any more without pausing, and pausing meant\ninviting attention. Inviting attention might mean making eye contact, and\nwith Corvan’s red-haloed eyes, that wasn’t a good idea.\nSo someone powerful has come to Garriston, but who was powerful\nenough to throw a governor in the bay? Corvan didn’t know anything about\nthis Governor Crassos, but the Ruthgari royal family had half a dozen\nyoung princes. Most likely one of them had been sent to help oversee the\nwithdrawal from Garriston. No one else would dare throw a Ruthgari\ngovernor into the sea.\nAn impulsive prince actually might be better for Corvan’s purposes\nthan a comfortable governor. Harder to deal with at first, but more likely to\nprepare for war, and war was what Corvan was bringing, like it or not.\nAs he passed through the city, he found himself analyzing it like the\ngeneral he used to be. King Garadul might be a monster, but the Ruthgari\nwere the occupiers. Who would the people of Garriston join, and would\nthey join enthusiastically or not? As Corvan walked, he paid particular\nattention to the Ruthgari soldiers. At times, the men walked singly, running\nerrands for their commanders or simply heading back to barracks or out to\ntaverns. He saw a soldier get jostled on accident by a vendor closing his\ncarpet stall who backed up too quickly. The soldier pushed past like it was\nan annoyance, but never checked his back. The vendor, a native Tyrean,\napologized respectfully, but without fear.\nThis wasn’t a city on the verge of revolt. The Tyreans had grown\naccustomed to being occupied. The Ruthgari were the fourth satrapy to do\nso, and this was their second time around. Not every nation got a turn in the\noccupation and spoils. Paria had had the first two years, and if they’d had\nthe richest spoils to steal, they’d also had the task of putting down the most\nrebels. The Ilytians had ostensibly fought on Dazen’s side, and had no\ncentral government anyway, so they didn’t get a turn. The Aborneans had\npreferred to trade with both sides, and had entered the fight only after the\nBattle of Sundered Rock. They didn’t get a turn either. That left the Parians,\nthe Atashians, the Blood Foresters, and the Ruthgari. In that order, if\nCorvan remembered correctly. It made sense that the people of Garriston"

It made sense that the people of Garriston\nwould have their favorites, or at least those less hated, among their\noccupiers.\nIt took Corvan only a bit of mental shuttling to figure that with the\nParians replacing the Ruthgari, this would be the third time Garriston had\nendured the Parians. The most easily tolerated occupiers were about to be\nreplaced by the most hated ones.\nBut the question his observations didn’t answer was just how much\nfear was mixed with the hatred of the Parians. The Parians had put down\nrebels both times they’d ruled. Maybe their cruelty meant the Tyreans\nwould think twice before taking up weapons. It might mean they would take\nthem up more quickly. Corvan didn’t know, couldn’t know without\nspending a lot of time in the city. Time he didn’t have.\nThe city was more cosmopolitan than it had been the last time he had\nvisited, some ten years ago. Before the war, Garriston had been as populous\nand diverse as any rich port city in the world. After the war, everyone who\ncould leave had left, especially those who looked like they were from\nelsewhere. Tensions had run high. During that time, the only people in\nGarriston were native Tyreans and their occupiers of the moment.\nApparently, with each round of occupation, a few traders and soldiers had\nstayed and intermarried with locals. Corvan saw two shopkeepers chatting\nas they swept out their open stalls with straw brooms. One woman had the\ntraditional Tyrean caramel skin and dark full brows and wavy hair, while\nthe woman next to her had skin like honey, and ash blonde hair, rare even\nfor the Ruthgari. They were dressed almost identically, bangles on their\nwrists, long flax skirts, hair tied back with scarves.\nCorvan passed an alley where children played gada together, kicking\nand passing a ball of wrapped leather. There were more obviously Tyrean-\nblooded children than any other kind, but the teams were mixed. A few\nmothers had gathered to watch, and they stood close to each other\nregardless of what Corvan would have guessed were their origins, gossiping\nor shouting encouragement.\nNot a powder keg. That was good. A radical shift in power and\nlawlessness in a city where neighbor hated neighbor would have invited\nwanton bloodshed. Garriston had seen enough of that.\nThe water market, basically an outsized version of what Rekton had,\nwas nearly empty except for a few food vendors offering quick meals to\npassing soldiers and those who had otherwise missed dinner. Corvan bought\na few skewers of rabbit and fish marinated in a fiery Ilytian pepper sauce\nand kept walking.\nBefore he headed to the Travertine Palace, Corvan walked to the Hag’s\nGate. Here, like the Guardian’s Gate and the Lover’s Gate, the statue was\nworked into the wall. But this time Corvan had no interest in the statue. He\nhad come to watch the soldiers. The gates had closed for the night, though it\nhad doubtless been a long time since raiders had dared move against the\ncity itself. The soldiers who stood at the top of the wall were joking,"

The soldiers who stood at the top of the wall were joking,\nlaughing, talking loudly, even drinking when their superiors left. Corvan\nhad seen archers atop the Hag’s Crown and at the top of the Hag’s Staff—\nthe two towers on either side of the gate—but after the two women settled\nin, quivers laid down, bows unstrung, they never made a circuit of their\nrespective posts.\nSo, soldiers with little discipline. Soldiers who had become city\nguards, through no fault of their own. In the first year of an occupation, the\nsoldiers might be sent against raiders and brigands or patrol the river’s\nlength. After that, they retreated to the city and became guards. The\nsoldierly duties came to seem extraneous, and discipline slipped. Sitting\nwatch in towers where there was never anything to watch for soon became a\npost where soldiers gambled and drank.\nCorvan headed toward the Travertine Palace. Of course, there was no\nway they were going to let some peasant walk in off the street and meet\ntheir prince, so when he got close to the front gate, he ducked into an alley.\nAfter Karris had been captured, Corvan had scouted King Garadul’s camp\nenough to decide that any attempt at rescue would be suicide. Then, as\nthey’d rendezvoused with other generals, swelling the army—most likely\nwith forced levies—they’d turned south. Corvan had headed back to a cave\noutside of Rekton.\nHe was almost disappointed that thieves had never found his cache.\nWhen Rekton’s alcaldesa had told Corvan that he and his daughter could\nstay, he’d hidden away everything that could connect him to the war, both\nfor his new home’s sake and his own. He’d shaved off his distinctive\nbeaded mustache and traded rich clothes and weapons for flaxen pants and a\ndyer’s shop. What had seemed meager gold in his pockets then was now a\nfortune in his eyes, but in the intervening years it had all been unspendable.\nNo one in Rekton had gold coins, especially not stamped with a Blood\nForester satrap’s face.\nSo now he pulled out the long folded samite tunic, swept off a portion\nof the ground with his hand and laid it on it. Next came a broad leather belt\nembossed with crocodiles with tiny ruby eyes in emerald-dotted swamps\nwith diamond-eyed herons. Last, he drew out Harbinger, the sword that had\npassed to him only when the last of his elder brothers died. A young boy sat\non the curb opposite him, silently watching, quizzical. Corvan tried to\nignore him. He stripped off his long shirt and pulled out a mirror. With\nmirror and a skin of water, he did his best to clean himself up. Then he\ndried himself with the dirty shirt and pulled on his rich clothes. There was\nnothing to be done about his boots or pants, but the samite tunic and the\nstress was going to have him sweating enough as it was. After packing his\nthings and strapping Harbinger onto his belt and pushing his hair into\nsomething resembling order, he took a deep breath and rounded the corner,\napproaching the gate.\n“I need to see whoever’s in charge,” Corvan said to the guards,"

Apparently they didn’t know if he meant the governor or the\nprince.\n“Whoever threw the governor in the bay,” Corvan said. “It’s an\nemergency.”\nThe guards shared a look. “Got no reason not to waste his time,” one\nguard said to the other. “He’s not exactly given us cause to screen his\nvisitors carefully.”\nThe other Ruthgari soldier grinned. “We’ll take you right to him, sir.”\nThey didn’t even ask his name. Corvan followed them, astounded by\nhis good fortune. Apparently the prince—presumably a younger prince or\nthe Ruthgari wouldn’t dare behave this way—hadn’t been endearing\nhimself to the common soldiers. Even more incredibly, the soldier marched\nhim straight to the counsel room. Corvan hadn’t been there in sixteen years.\nThe man rapped a quick code on the door, and the guards inside opened it.\nHe whispered something about emergency, looks important, to the guard,\nand then beat a hasty retreat.\nThe counsel room guard, a tall, serious Ruthgari, ushered Corvan in.\n“Name?” he asked quietly.\nCorvan stepped inside. The Ruthgari prince was leaning over a table in\nthe counsel room, his back to Corvan. “Corvan Danavis,” Corvan said\nquietly. There was a huge—both tall and thickly muscled—ebony guard\nstanding across from the prince, his eyes hard, studying Corvan, taking note\nof the sword at his side. He wore all black. This prince had some nerve,\npretending to have his own Blackguard. When the Chromeria found out\nabout that, it would not be pleased.\n“Corvan Danavis,” the guard announced loudly. “He says he has an\nemergency message, my Lord Prism.”\nIt was like lightning hit all three men at once. The Blackguard—an\nactual, real Blackguard, for Orholam’s sake—had two pistols out and his\nblue spectacles on half a breath after Corvan’s name was announced.\nThe Prism—not a princeling, Gavin Guile himself—stood and turned.\nHis lip curled. “General Danavis, it’s been too long.”\nChapter 60\nGavin kept his face carefully neutral. After sixteen years, Corvan Danavis\nstill looked fit, healthy, and sharp as ever. His skin was deeply tanned, no\ndoubt to try to cover the freckles and look as Tyrean as possible, and there\nwas no sign of his famous beaded mustache. His blue eyes were only about\nhalf-haloed with red, not much more than when Gavin had last seen him.\nThe lines, both smile lines and deeper worry lines, were new, however. His\neyes flicked to Ironfist, and then he looked dismayed.\nConsummate actor, Corvan Danavis.\n“Commander Ironfist, please relieve this man of his weapons, and\nreprimand the guards.

He walked forward\nand took Corvan’s sword, eyes flicking only briefly to it in appreciation.\nAfter putting the sword and Corvan’s bag in a small closet off the main\nroom, he put away his other pistol and frisked Corvan briskly.\nBefore turning to go, Ironfist looked one more time at Gavin.

He\nhadn’t been here long enough to know if there were peepholes or\neavesdropping tunnels behind the walls. Corvan stood, hands folded,\nwaiting patiently. “Come out onto the balcony, General.”\n“Please, I’ve not been a general for many years,” Corvan said, but he\nfollowed Gavin out. Gavin closed the double doors behind them. The\nbalcony was spacious, with a number of chairs and tables spread out so the\ngovernor and his visitors could enjoy the view over the bay. It made Gavin\nglad he’d flung the governor a long way. Dropping the man off the roof\nonto this wouldn’t have been quite as humorous—and he hadn’t\nremembered this balcony protruding quite so far. Lucky, Gavin.\nFunny that I always think of it as luck, rather than Providence.\nCorvan glanced over the edge. “Bay looks deep enough here,” he said,\nthe corner of his mouth twisting wryly.\nGavin leaned on the balcony’s railing. The sun was just touching the\nhorizon, setting the sea alight, pinks and oranges threaded through thin\nclouds. Suddenly, the lost years were rolling down his cheeks and he was\nholding the railing like a drunk, simply to be able to stand. “It cost too\nmuch, Corvan.”\nCorvan glanced around for spies, checking the docks, looking back\ninto the counsel room, up at the roof. He said, “It’s good to see you too.\nNow quit that or you’re going to get me started.”\nGavin glanced at him. Corvan wore his quirky grin, but his eyes\nbetrayed him. That grin was him trying to give his face something to do so\nthe depth of his emotion didn’t overwhelm him.\nSuddenly, appearances didn’t matter. Gavin embraced his old friend.\n“It’s good to see you… Dazen,” Corvan whispered. That broke open\nthe floodgates for both of them. They wept."

They wept.\nThe grand deception had been Corvan’s idea from the beginning,\nsixteen years ago. It had been a throwaway idea when he’d proposed it.\nNeither had really believed Dazen could beat Gavin. One night, when\nthey’d had a rare respite from the battles and had been sharing one too\nmany skins of wine, Corvan had said, “You could win and simply take\nGavin’s place.”\n“That’s sort of the point of a Prisms’ War, isn’t it? Last man standing?”\nDazen had said. “Last Prism shining?”\nCorvan ignored the joke. Dazen was a little further gone than he was.\n“No, I mean you could be Gavin. You two look almost the same. For years,\nevery time the two of you played scrum, the only way anyone could tell you\napart was Gavin’s prismatic eyes. You have those now.”\n“Gavin’s a peacock. And I’m taller.”\n“Clothes can be changed. And he wears lifts in his shoes to make\nhimself as tall as you are. Which would actually make things easier.”\n“He’s got that scar. Which you gave him, I might add,” Dazen had\nsaid.\n“I could give you one too. Nice symmetry to that, huh?”\nNow Dazen was taking it seriously. “I’ve gone a while without a\nhaircut. The scar’s right along the hairline. I could hide the cut while it was\nhealing.”\n“If I can remember which side I cut him on,” Corvan said. “Pass me\nthat skin, I’m getting parched.”\nA few days had passed, and Dazen had asked Corvan to stay after\nanother council of war. After dismissing everyone from the tent, he’d\nhanded Corvan a piece of paper. On it was written a precise description of\nGavin’s scar.\n“I was joking,” Corvan said, looking into Dazen’s serious eyes.\n“I’m not. I’ve got a chirurgeon waiting outside the tent to stitch me up.\nIf anyone notices, we were sparring and had an accident. I’m embarrassed\nabout my clumsiness, so I asked you not to say anything about it.”\nCorvan had said nothing for a long time. “Dazen. Have you thought\nabout what this would mean? You’d have to maintain a charade for years,\nmaybe the rest of your life. Everyone who loves you now would think you\ndead. Karris—”\n“I lost Karris when I killed her backstabbing brothers.”\n“Are you prepared to be Gavin in her eyes?” Corvan had asked.\n“Corvan, look at our allies,” Dazen had said, tense, lowering his voice.\n“I’ve practically sworn a port in every satrapy to the Ilytians. I’ve promised\nthe Atashian throne to Farid Farjad. The cultists joined us in hopes that their\nstrength would help us shatter the Chromeria. Once we win, they’ll turn on\nus. And the Blue-Eyed Demons have been too valuable to us to be content\nwith mercenaries’ wages. I expect Horas Farseer to come to me on the eve\nof the battle with some outrageous demand: lands, titles, permanent bases."

After we win, I might renege with one group, but not with\nall of them. I don’t know how it got to this, but however things started,\nwe’re the bad guys now.”\n“We’re the bad guys. After what they did to Garriston,” Corvan said\nbitterly.\n“In terms of what will happen to the Seven Satrapies if we win? Yes.”\nA long silence. “You’ll be discovered eventually,” Corvan said. “You\nmust know that. It can’t last forever.”\n“I don’t need to fool them for long. A few months. Enough to\nconsolidate the victory. Even if the Spectrum found out, they wouldn’t\nexpose me until our enemies are crushed. Some morning, I won’t rise from\nmy bed. I can accept that.”\n“We’re not without options,” Corvan said. “I mean, if we win. These\nproblems can be handled. We don’t know what will happen after we win. If\nwe can take Gavin’s army relatively intact and get the Chromeria to\ncapitulate quickly, we could counter—”\n“Do you see the White capitulating quickly?”\nCorvan opened his mouth. Closed it. “No.”\n“It’s not a good plan,” Dazen said. “I know that. But it may be the least\nbad.”\n“We may still lose, I suppose,” Corvan said.\n“You always do look on the bright side,” Dazen had said.\nNow Corvan pushed Gavin back, wiping his own tears away with the\nbacks of his hands. “I’ve missed you, friend.”\n“And I you. Now, what the hell are you doing here?” Gavin asked.\nThe joy at their reunion leached from Corvan’s face. “I came to warn\nthe governor that King Garadul’s marching here. His army will arrive\nwithin five days, a week at most. And they captured Karris White Oak.”\nGavin sucked in a breath. Karris captured?\nThere was nothing to be done about it now, even if it did tear a hole in\nhis stomach and hollow him out. “I knew about King Garadul,” he said.\n“Not… the other.”\n“I figured. Why else would you be here?” Corvan said.\n“You think he’ll attack just after Midsummer’s?” Gavin asked.\n“The day after,” Corvan said. “Ruthgari will have withdrawn, but the\nParian regiments won’t have landed.”\nIt was what Gavin had guessed. It gave him almost no time. “I can’t\nbelieve that Governor Crassos never got word of Garadul’s army.”\n“Don’t believe it. He did know,” Corvan said. “The Ruthgari have\nbeen withdrawing early. It’s a skeleton crew now, so they make sure they all\nget out of the city before Garadul attacks. Why should they fight to save the\ncity for the Parians?”\n“Bastards,” Gavin grunted.\n“And cowards and opportunists.” Corvan shrugged. “What do you\nintend to do about it?”\n“I intend to hold this city.”\n“And how do you hope to do that?” Corvan asked."

You can’t. It’s\nimpossible. Lord Prism, I’m the enemy general!”\n“And since when don’t the conquered sometimes join the victor’s\narmy?” Gavin asked.\n“Not as generals. Not right away.”\n“It’s been sixteen years. You’re a special case,” Gavin said. “Corvan\nDanavis, held in high esteem by both sides of the False Prism’s War. The\nman who ended the war honorably. A man of unimpeachable integrity and\nintelligence. It has been a long time, why could people not believe that we\nhad put it all behind us?”\n“Because I’m the one who put that scar on your temple, and you were\nnone too happy about it. And Gavin’s men killed my wife.”\nGavin’s brow wrinkled. “There is that.”\n“You don’t need me,” Corvan said. “You’re no slouch at command,\nLord Prism.”\nIt was true. Gavin had seen good leadership and practiced it enough to\nknow his own abilities. He also knew his weaknesses. “With equal armies\nand terrain and me without magic, who would win between us, Corvan?”\nCorvan shrugged. “If you had a good cadre of support staff, and your\nfield commanders would tell you the truth, I think—”\n“Corvan, I’m the Prism. Men don’t tell me the truth. I ask them, can\nyou do this? And they say yes, no matter what. They want to think the\nrighteousness of obeying the Prism himself will magically help them\novercome any obstacle. When I ask for objections to my most flawed plans,\nI get silence. It took months and several disasters to get our armies even\nhalfway past that back in the war. We don’t have that time now.” It took a\ncertain kind of mind to understand exactly how each branch of his forces\nwould react, what kind of combat situations they could handle and what\nones they would buckle under. Gavin was good at that. He was good at\njudging enemy commanders, especially those he’d met, and figuring out\nwhat they might do.\nBut making snap judgments about the disposition of enemy forces\nfrom fragmentary scouts’ reports and getting thousands of men in various\nbranches into position was something else entirely. Splitting your forces and\ngetting them to take different paths to an objective, each under its own\ncommander, and having them arrive simultaneously—that was a skill very\nfew men had. Instilling discipline in men to continue maneuvering during\nthe battle itself, for men to disengage right now when they could kill their\nopponent with just one more thrust, and to get men to communicate so lines\ncould open just a second before a cavalry charge came through the ranks\nthemselves—that was almost impossible. Gavin was good at men and\nmagic. Corvan understood numbers and time and tactics. And sixteen years\nago, he’d certainly been Gavin’s master in the art of deception. Together,\nthey’d been unstoppable.\n“Of course, Rask did massacre my village.” Corvan said it"

He wasn’t working through his fury at losing everyone he\nknew; he was working through the story people would tell: I thought the\nPrism and General Danavis hated each other! They do, but the Prism\nneeded a general, and Danavis’s village was just butchered by King\nGaradul, he wants revenge.\nIt worked. It would seem odd, but not incredible. It had been sixteen\nyears.\n“So we’re both using each other,” Gavin said. “I need your tactical\ngenius, you need my army to effect your revenge. I could check in on you\nopenly, making it clear I didn’t quite trust you.”\n“I could grumble about slights in front of the men. Nothing to\nundermine their confidence, but enough to make it clear I wasn’t\ncomfortable with you.”\n“It could work.”\n“It could,” Corvan said. He turned from looking at the bay. “Deception\ncomes quickly to you these days.”\n“Too much practice,” Gavin said, sobered from his initial joy at the\nchance to work with his friend once more. “You know, if this works, we can\nbe friends again in a year or two. Even in public.”\n“Unless I can serve you better as your enemy, Lord Prism.”\n“I’ve got enough of those. But fair enough. Now I’ve got a surprise for\nyou.”\n“A surprise?” Corvan asked, dubious.\n“I can’t be seen giving you something you enjoy, so you’ll have to go\ndownstairs without me. The room directly below this one.” They stepped\nback toward the counsel room, but Gavin stopped. “How is she?”\nCorvan knew who he was talking about and what he really meant.\n“Karris once seemed like a wilting flower, bowing to her father’s every\ncommand. And she became a Blackguard, the White’s left hand. If anyone\ncan make it, she will.”\nGavin took a deep breath and, masks of seriousness and distrust\nreplaced, they stepped into the counsel room. Commander Ironfist had\nalready returned. He stood by the main doors in the loose, casual readiness\nof a man who spent much of his life guarding, waiting, watching. He was\naccustomed to inactivity and prepared for violence.\n“Commander,” Gavin said. “Corvan Danavis and I find ourselves with\na common enemy. He has agreed to help us coordinate Garriston’s defenses.\nPlease notify the men that they will be overseen by General Danavis,\neffective immediately. The general will answer only to me. General, you\ncan take it from there?”\nCorvan looked like a man who’d swallowed vinegary wine and he\nwasn’t doing a good job of hiding the fact. “Yes, my Lord Prism.”\nGavin waved his hand in dismissal. Abrupt, slightly imperious. Let\nCommander Ironfist take it as Gavin asserting his dominance. Corvan’s jaw\ntightened, but he bowed and left.\nGo, my friend, and may finding your daughter repay a tiny measure of\nthe misery you’ve endured because of me.\nChapter 61\n“Will is what makes the Chromeria scary, even for us,” Liv said.

The sun\nwas just touching the horizon outside, and room slaves entered as if on cue\nand began lighting lamps and a fire.\n“Who is this Will, and how do we stop him?” Kip asked.\n“Kip.” Liv tilted her head down. “Focus.”\n“Sorry, go ahead.” She was ignoring the room slaves, so Kip tried to\ndo so as well.\n“Will is just what you think it is. You impose your will on the world.\nYou will magic to happen. Will can cover over the gaps in flawed drafting.\nThat’s especially important for flailers.”\n“Flailers?”\n“All men drafters and the half of the women drafters who aren’t\nsuperchromats,” Liv said. She paused. “Well, most men, huh?”\nThe term was a bit nasty, really. A little bit, We’re better than you are,\nyou helpless hacks. You try, we succeed. But that was how the Chromeria\nworked, wasn’t it? Everything was about power and dominance. “Right,”\nKip said, “flailers. Those sad sacks. Pitiful.” Even if Kip found himself in\nthe elite group, it didn’t mean he had to like how the others were demeaned.\nLiv flushed and shot back, “Look, Kip, you don’t have to like it, but\nyou have to deal with it. And you’ll probably do better if you don’t have a\nchip on your shoulder about everything. It’s not like back home. Because\nguess what? We don’t have a home now. The Chromeria is all we get, and\nwe’ve got it good. So grow up.”\nIt was like he’d been slapped. She was right, but he hadn’t expected so\nmuch vehemence out of nowhere. He averted his eyes. “Right. Sorry.”\nShe expelled a breath. “No, I’m sorry. That… I don’t know… I guess\nI’m still adjusting to this whole life myself. There’s a hierarchy to\neverything at the Chromeria, Kip, and it’s not easy to adjust to. I don’t even\nknow if it’s good to adjust to it. But once you know your place, you can\nfigure out how you’re supposed to deal with everyone else, even people you\ndon’t know. It does simplify things. I just—after the last three years as a\nmonochrome in an obscure color, and a Tyrean on top of that, I never liked\nthe whole hierarchy. But I’d finally come to terms with my place in it, and I\nwas almost finished with my training and ready to head out into my shitty\nlife. Now I’m a bichrome and everything’s different, overnight. I’m going\nto have to stay at the Chromeria for another couple of years, and my life\nwill be totally different. People see me now.” She smiled ruefully, sadly. “I\nguess you know all about having everything change in a blink. The thing is,\nI like my new life. I have new clothes, jewelry, an allowance.

I—”\nWhat were you going to say, Kip? I’ve been in love with you since I\ncan remember? Right.\n“I couldn’t bear losing my last anchor to Rekton,” he said instead, all\nthe words tripping over each other. “You’re the only one who knew me\nbefore all this.”\nGreat, good job making it seem like it’s totally impersonal.

What if she’s never thought of you\nas a friend?\n“You’re from Rekton, too,” he said instead, lamely. Impersonal again.\nDamn! “I need someone to talk to, and I’ve always… admired you.”\nAdmired? Like she’s a painting?\n“I mean, I appreciate—”\nAppreciate. Kind of the same as admire, isn’t it? Like she’s a good\ncook?\nOrholam’s balls, this is agony! Ah, a way out! Not appreciate her, but\nappreciate how she does something.\n“I appreciate how you—” How she whats?\nHow she looks in that one too-small green shirt she used to—shit!\n“—have always been so nice to me.”\nNow you’re the pleading, awkward child again. Well done. Kip Silver\nTongue, they ought to call you.\nI’m never going to speak to another woman again.\nKip could barely stand to look at Liv after that performance, but she\nwaited until he met her eyes, leery.\n“Why, Kip, are you flirting with me?!” she asked.\nIt was like Kip had stepped into that nightmare where he walked to the\nMidsummer’s Dance on the green, barely registering the curious glances\nuntil he stepped up on the stage and the music stopped, every dancer missed\ntheir steps, and everyone turned to look at him.

Thoughts slower.\n“Not often that you’re left with nothing to say,” Liv said, poking him.\nHis thoughts on that must have shown, because she smirked. “If you don’t\nwatch it, I’ll ruffle your hair.”\n“That’s it, I’m shaving my head!” Kip declared.\nLiv laughed. “Enough, enough! No more digressions! I’ll never teach\nyou anything if we keep on like this.”\n“So,” Kip said, “will. Not the bad man. See?

Corvan laughed and squeezed her\nhard.\n“I heard you were dead!” Liv said.\nUm, yes, that was me. Kip, bringer of false bad tidings. “I didn’t\nbelieve it, but I was so—” Liv started crying.\nCorvan closed his eyes, just holding his daughter. Kip wondered if\nthere were some way he could escape.\nAnd go where? This is my room.\nBut after a few moments, Corvan gently pushed his daughter back. “I\nam surprisingly durable. You look more lovely than ever, Aliviana.”\n“I’m all cryey,” Liv protested, wiping her eyes.\n“Perhaps even a smidge more beautiful than your mother. A claim I’d\nnot have tolerated until this day, seeing the truth with my own eyes. She’d\nbe so proud of you.”\n“Father,” Liv said, her cheeks coloring, but pleased.\n“Don’t you think she’s beautiful, Kip?”\nKip spluttered, making some kind of sound like he was drowning.\nSeriously, if embarrassment were a muscle, I’d be huge.\n“Faather!” Liv said, horrified.\nCorvan laughed. “My day wouldn’t have been complete without my\ndaughter thinking I was embarrassing. Your pardon, Kip.”\n“Erm,” Kip said eloquently. So he hadn’t been the target after all. Liv\nhad. Kip was seeing where she got her wicked sense of humor.\n“It’s wonderful to see you well, Kip… Kip Guile.” Corvan shook his\nhead, astounded. “Liv, Kip, I’d love to catch up with you both, but the\nPrism has just given me work.”\n“Work?” Liv asked."

Say, Liv, do you know anything about Karris\nWhite Oak?”\nLiv shrugged. “Only Blood Forester Blackguard, astounding fighter,\nbichrome who was nearly a poly, maybe the fastest drafter on the Jaspers.\nWhy?”\nThe new general said, “She was captured by King Garadul.

It felt like it had barely been\nten minutes since he went to bed.\nGavin said, “Get dressed. We’re going for a walk.” He turned toward\nCommander Ironfist, who was standing by the door. “You’re invited.”\nA grin flashed over Ironfist’s face, visible only because his teeth were\nso starkly white against his ebony skin. He would have accompanied them\nregardless.\nKip pulled on his clothes. Within minutes, they were walking the\nstreets of Garriston. Kip was playing his part of the gawker once more, still\na little overwhelmed by being in a city of this size, despite that it wasn’t\nnearly as impressive as the Jaspers. The construction, of course, wasn’t all\ntowering minarets. Like back home, the buildings were square, with flat\nroofs where people could relax in the evenings or sleep during the\nunbearably hot nights. Even with the sea breezes, it got stiflingly hot here.\nBut the buildings here weren’t solely the stone construction that was used in\nRekton.

Ahem, that is,\nif men want to make anything permanent, they have to add will. Makes it\nsound like it’s meat you add to a stew, doesn’t it? Hmm. I don’t teach much,\nobviously. Let me try this.” Gavin appeared perfectly heedless of the dark\ncorners they were passing and the acquisitive eyes that followed them. But\nthen, once any acquisitive eyes alit on Ironfist, they found other things to\nstudy in a hurry.\n“Every time you draft, you use your will. You have to decide that\nsomething totally outlandish, weird, unnatural-seeming is going to happen,\nand you’re going to make it happen. In other words, you decide to do\nmagic. Now, the more outlandish it is, the harder it is to believe you can\nreally do it. Or to put it another way, the more will it takes. You with me?”\n“Makes sense so far,” Kip said.\n“Good. Now, blue sword.” Gavin lifted a hand from beneath his cloak.\nHis hand was solid blue, and as Kip watched, blue luxin blossomed from it.\nGelled, solidified, hardened into the form of a blue sword. Gavin handed it\nto Kip."

Gavin handed it\nto Kip.\nKip took it, feeling self-conscious as they passed through an\nintersection with another alley and he was bearing the blade like he was\nfollowing it to his destiny. “Uh,” he said, but then he felt the hilt go\nslippery. A moment later, the blade drooped, broke off the hilt of its own\nweight, and splatted on the dirty cobblestones of the alley. There was a light\nshimmer of blue, and then nothing but blue dust. The same happened\nmoments later to the hilt in Kip’s hand, leaving only that gritty blue dust.\n“What’s the dust?” Kip asked.\n“A later lesson,” Gavin said. “I’m having trouble teaching the basics as\nit is. The point for you is to imagine I’d drafted you a plow instead of a\nsword. Great, it works while the drafter is at your farm, but ten minutes\nafter he leaves, all you’ve got is dust, literally. Not helpful. This is why\nsuperchromats are heavily recruited by all satrapies.”\n“So they can make plows?”\n“Not all magic is for fun and dismemberment, Kip. In fact, most\ndrafters spend their whole lives doing practical things like making plows.\nFor every artist, there’s ten men who repair roofs with green luxin. Anyway,\nmen—and the women who aren’t lucky enough to be superchromats—can\ncover their failings with will.”\n“You mean just by trying harder.”\n“Pretty much.”\n“That doesn’t sound so bad. So they try harder. Liv was making men\namong drafters sound like slaves compared to the freeborn.”\n“More like dogs, I’d say,” Gavin said.\n“Huh?”\n“Well, they are second-class because using will constantly wears you.\nIt’s exhausting. And will isn’t just effort, it’s belief and effort together. So if\nyou need belief to do magic, what happens to the man who loses all his\nbelief in himself?”\n“He can’t do magic?” Kip guessed.\n“Exactly. That’s half of what all the hierarchy among drafters is about.\nSatraps and satrapahs treat drafters like they’re Orholam’s gift to the world\nnot just because they are Orholam’s gift, but because if the drafter doesn’t\nbelieve he’s special and you call on him to do magic, he won’t be able to do\nit. Drafter who can’t draft? Useless.”\n“I never thought of that.” So the rigid hierarchy wasn’t simply because\nthey could? Kip guessed that this wasn’t the way Liv’s tutors had explained\nthings to her.\n“Of course, it’s a circle that spirals on itself. You’re a satrap, you’ve\npaid a fortune for a bichrome drafter, well, now you’ve invested so much in\nhim that you can’t afford for him to fail you, so you have to reinforce his\nfeelings of superiority and pamper him, give him slaves and so forth. It\nmakes the more powerful drafters more and more difficult to manage.”\nThere was a cough from behind them. Ironfist.\n“Commander,” Gavin asked, “you have something to add to this\ndiscussion?”"

Ironfist.\n“Commander,” Gavin asked, “you have something to add to this\ndiscussion?”\n“Little dust in my throat. Apologies,” Ironfist said, sounding not at all\napologetic.\n“Problem with will is, we think that the more will a man or woman\nexpends in their life, the faster they die. Or it could merely be that men or\nwomen with great will tend to draft a lot more. Either way, their careers are\nspectacular. And short. It’s probably why male drafters don’t tend to live as\nlong as women do, expending will all the time in order to have their\ndrafting be useful. Side effect is that among the most powerful drafters, we\nhave a lot of people with titanic will. Or, to put it bluntly, a lot of arrogant\nassholes. Especially the men. And madmen. Delusional people tend to\nbelieve in what they’re doing. Makes them powerful.”\n“So I’m going to be spending my time with crazy, arrogant bastards.”\n“Well, many of them are of the finest blood.”\nOh, that’s right, I’m the only bastard around here. “I thought being a\ndrafter was going to be fun,” Kip said.\n“Grunts never get to scull,” Gavin said.\n“Grunts?”\n“Grunts, mundies, norms, grubbers, clods, shovelslingers, blinders,\ndulls, scrubs, mouth breathers, slumps, the benighted—there’s lots of\nnames. Most of them not as nice as those. They all mean the same thing:\nnon-drafters.”\n“So what about you?” Kip asked, as they finally left the alleys. They\ncrossed a wide, peaked stone bridge over the Umber River.\nGavin looked at him. “You mean what nasty names do they call me?”\n“No!” Oh, Gavin was teasing. Kip scowled. “Your eyes don’t”—he\nlooked for the right word—“halo. So does that mean you can draft as much\nas you want?”\n“I tire like anyone, but yes. For a time I can draft every day as much as\nI can handle and it won’t burn me out. Someday, most likely five years from\nnow, I will start to lose colors. It will take about a year, and then I’ll die.”\n“Why five years from now?” Kip asked. It was still odd to him how\nmatter-of-fact drafters were about their impending deaths. I guess they have\ntime to get used to the idea.\n“It always happens on multiples of seven from when a Prism begins\nhis reign. I’ve made it sixteen years, so I have until twenty-one. Long time\nfor a Prism.”\n“Oh. Why multiples of seven?”\n“Because there’s seven colors, seven virtues, seven satrapies? Because\nOrholam likes the number seven? Truth is, no one knows.”\nThey walked on through streets swelling with people starting their\nmorning errands, and those eager to get as much work done as possible\nbefore the heat of the day. They approached a long line of workers\nbottlenecked at the Lover’s Gate, heading out to work outside the city."

They approached a long line of workers\nbottlenecked at the Lover’s Gate, heading out to work outside the city.\nThough Kip didn’t even see him draft, Gavin turned and handed him a\ngreen rock. Not a rock. Green luxin, perfectly the size to fit in Kip’s palm.\nKip took it, confused.\n“You bring your specs?” Gavin asked. He handed Kip a square board,\nnot a foot on each side, perfectly white.\nKip produced them. Smiled weakly. I have a bad feeling about what\nhe’s going to tell me next.\n“Your turn. You can have lunch—or dinner or possibly breakfast—\nwhen you make a green luxin ball of your own. You’ve got the spectacles, a\nwhite reflector, plenty of sun, and an example. I couldn’t make it easier if I\ntried.”\n“But I need Skill, Will, Source, and Still. I don’t have skill. Any skill.\nAt all.”\nGavin looked at him sardonically. “And how do you think you get\nskilled? Skill is the most overrated of the requisites. Will covers a multitude\nof flaws.”\nI keep hearing that. Kip hadn’t even had breakfast, and he wasn’t\ngoing to get to eat until he made a magic ball? Fantastic.\nThey came upon the back of the line. Gavin glanced at Commander\nIronfist. Without further prompting, Ironfist said, “Looks like a wagon\nbroke down. It’s blocking half the gate.”\nGavin swept a hand forward, as in, You go first. Commander Ironfist\nwent first, and the impatient farmers and craftsman parted easily for him. Or\nat least those who looked furious at being pushed aside quickly hid it once\nthey saw the size of the man towering over them. “We’re going to help,”\nGavin said.\n“Sure, you Parian scum,” someone said, spitting. Gavin stopped and\nscanned the crowd for who’d spoken. As men met his eyes and saw those\nprismatic orbs, they quieted, confused, stunned.\n“You can have my help, or you can have my enmity,” Gavin said\nloudly. He unbuttoned the nondescript cloak and threw it back over his\nshoulders, exposing the almost blindingly white coat and shirt he wore\nunderneath, worked with gold thread and jewels.\nHe walked on, and Kip scooted close to him. The crowd parted around\nthem, murmuring questions and imprecations. In a minute, they were at the\nfront of the line. At least a dozen men were straining to move a wagon.\nApparently, the horses had spooked and veered to the side as they passed\nthrough the gate. The wagon’s wheel had smashed into the gate’s support—\nhere actually the Lover’s hair. The wheel was completely shattered, as was\nthe wagon’s axle, and the whole thing was still stuck against the wall,\nmaking normal efforts at repair impossible. The men were straining to lift\nthe wagon by sheer brute strength, with a few using long poles to try to\ncrank the mass off the wall.\n“We’re going to have to bring up an empty wagon and unload this\nbefore we’ve got a chance,” one of the guards was saying.\nTo Kip’s admittedly inexperienced eye, the man was right.

The\ncombined muscle of all these laborers was barely budging the wagon. But\nthe assembled crowd groaned, a few complaining aloud.\n“Bring an empty wagon? From where? Through that whole mess\nbehind us? It’ll take hours!”\n“You all are going to have to use the other gates today,” the guard said.\nThat met similar protests. With how thickly crowded the street was,\nnone of the men at the front of the line would be able to leave until\neveryone at the back dispersed. It would take hours.\n“What?” the guard shouted. “I didn’t do this. I’m just trying to fix it!\nYou have a better idea?”\n“I do,” Gavin said.\n“Oh, sure, you smart—Lord Prism!” the guard said.\nThat sent a ripple of murmurs through the crowd.\nGavin ignored it. He gestured to the men to step back. They did, some\nin awe, others more peeved, some hostile. He simply walked to where the\nwagon was smashed against the wall. “I see why you had trouble,” he said.\n“But I have a few extra tools available to me.”\nKip, still holding his green luxin ball and the white board, realized\nCommander Ironfist had disappeared.\nHe’s gigantic. How does he disappear? Kip looked around, and finally\nfound him. The commander was standing behind a man in the crowd whose\nhand had dropped to the big work knife at his belt. Commander Ironfist’s\nhuge hand enveloped both the man’s hand and his knife. The commander\nhimself, towering over the man, was quietly speaking in his ear.\nAs he spoke, the man’s face blanched and his whole body slackened.\nCommander Ironfist gave the man a friendly pounding on his shoulder\n—which nearly crushed him—and stepped back toward Gavin.\n“Always running off when I need you,” Gavin said.\nCommander Ironfist grunted.\nKip couldn’t help himself. “I think he might have just saved your—”\nHe saw the look on Gavin’s face belatedly. Gavin knew. “Oh. Um. Never\nmind.” Clever Kip.\nBut Gavin was back to work already. “I need ropes.” He held a hand\nup over his head and a bar of yellow luxin formed in his hand and snapped\nout in both directions, until it was three times the height of a man. He\nhanded it to one of the stunned workers. “You and you, get this in position,\nI’ll need you to lever the wagon off the wall.”\nThe man bobbed his head. He and the other man started jamming the\npole as deep between the wall and wagon as they could.\nGavin walked as far around the wagon as he could, sending out thin\njets of luxin in a number of places under the axles. “Now,” he told the men\nwith the lever.\nThey strained and moved the wagon less than a hand’s breadth. After a\nthree count, they relaxed and set their shoulders to try again.\n“Not necessary,” Gavin said. “You gave me enough already.

Well\ndone.” And indeed, there was luxin even behind the wagon, encasing the\nwhole in a shimmering web of various colors, mostly greens and yellows.\nGavin rolled his shoulders, braced himself, pointed at the arching\nluxin-and-stone of the gate, and shot out a stream of blue and yellow. In\nmoments, it congealed into a pulley. He took coils of rope from a nearby\nfarmer and shot out another bolt, anchoring one end of the rope to the\nceiling. Then he threaded the rest of the rope through the pulley. He pulled\nsome slack into the rope between the fixed pulley and the attached end and\ndrafted a free-rolling pulley onto that, which he then fixed to the web of\nluxin around the wagon. He beckoned the farmer, apparently the wagon’s\nowner, and tossed him the rest of the rope. “It’ll still take all of you\nhelping,” he said.\nKip swallowed. “Please tell me he isn’t designing those off the top of\nhis head,” he said to Commander Ironfist, who was silently watching the\ncrowd.\n“He’s not. You’d be surprised how often wagons break down when\nyour army is pursuing another army across half the Seven Satrapies. I’ve\nseen him lift heavier loads by himself. Albeit with lots more pulleys.”\nWhich meant the real question was why Gavin didn’t just do this\nhimself. He could draft luxin better than any hemp rope. He could draft\nanother four pulleys and make the burden so light he could lift the wagon\nhimself. But as soon as Kip asked himself, he knew. Gavin was building\nrapport with the townsfolk. If he marched in and did it all himself, they’d be\nawed, but they’d not be a part of it. This way, he was simply enabling them\nto help themselves. His power might still be awesome, but it was power in\nservice of them.\nThe men heaved on the lines, and Gavin called some men to him. As\nthe wagon lifted off the ground it swung away from the wall, and Gavin and\na few others braced it so it didn’t swing wildly and hurt anyone. Finally\nthey stabilized the swinging, and Gavin shouted, “Okay, hold it there!”\nThen he slid under the wagon, scooting on his back under the broken back\naxle.\nThat was no light wagon, and the men were straining to hold the load\n—these men of a city Gavin’s army had nearly obliterated sixteen years\nago. And yet Commander Ironfist didn’t seem perturbed.\n“Aren’t you worried they’ll drop it on purpose?” Kip whispered.\n“No.”\nKip was. But Gavin appeared unafraid. He grabbed the ends of the\nbroken axle and brought them together as close as he could. It was no use,\nthey were twisted and bent, but Gavin brought them as close as he could\nand then bound them by degrees with yellow. The wagon wheel followed in\nshort order. He repaired what he could, and replaced what he couldn’t.\nHe scooted out and gestured. The men lowered the wagon and it\nsettled on the road, easily taking the weight. A shout of triumph went up"

Gavin clapped the farmer on the shoulder.\n“Those’ll be good for about three days, then you’ll need to get real repairs,\nbut it’ll hold you until then.”\n“Thank you, sir, thank you ever so much. I thought they were going to\nlynch me for sure. A day’s lost wages for all these men. You’ve saved me,\nsir.”\nGavin smiled and said, “You’re welcome. Now get those horses\nhitched up.”\nOnly as he saw the smiles did Kip understand fully what Gavin had\ndone. With ten minutes of effort and a little subtlety, he had turned an\nannoyance into an opportunity to win over not just the men he’d helped, but\nall those to whom they would repeat the story. The incongruity of the Prism\nhimself joining in the starkly physical labor of lifting and moving and\nstabilizing the wagon, heedless of soiling his expensive white clothing,\njoining them muscle to muscle, communicated something to these men. A\nruler who would sweat with them was a ruler who might understand men\nwho won their bread by the sweat of their brow. That man was easier to\ntrust than some dandy in silks who might be all kinds of noble-smart but\ndidn’t know the real world.\n“It’s why you hardly ever hear anyone call him Emperor Guile,”\nIronfist said quietly, reading Kip’s mind. “At heart, he’s not an emperor;\nhe’s a promachos. It’s not always the best way to fight, but it’s his only way.\nIt’s why men will die for him.”\n“Why didn’t he stay promachos, then?” Kip asked, wondering if it was\na dangerous question.\n“I could list a dozen reasons. Truth is, I don’t know.”\nWith a gesture—completely for show, of course—Gavin released all\nthe luxin and it dissolved, shimmering, until it was nothing but dust. He\nnodded to his fellow laborers and then gestured Kip to follow.\nAs Kip joined Gavin and walked through the gate, Gavin said, “You\nhave that green luxin ball for me yet?”\n“What?” Kip protested. “I can’t believe—I didn’t even have a chance\n—”\nOh. He got me again. Gavin was grinning.\n“Look, Kip,” Kip said, “gullible’s written on the sky!” He gazed up as\nif clueless. “Huh? Where?”\nGavin laughed, and if Kip didn’t misjudge, he thought even Ironfist\nwas smiling. “A little slow at the starting line, but watch out when he picks\nup speed. Reminds me of someone.” His smirk told Kip the someone was\nhimself. He put his hand on Kip’s shoulder.\nKip felt a thousand things he couldn’t identify at that touch. That touch\nclaimed him: That’s my boy, it said. His mother had said those words a few\ntimes—always after Kip messed up. She’d never said them with pride.\nGavin Guile wasn’t just a great man.

Kip would\ndo anything for him.\nChapter 63\n“General, I need to speak with you.” Liv Danavis had found her father on\nthe roof of the Travertine Palace, checklists and reports spread all over a\ntable. It wasn’t yet dawn, and he was bundled against the chill of the\nmorning. He was standing, ignoring his work for the moment, his butt\nagainst the edge of his table, looking toward the east.\n“ ‘General’ this morning, not ‘father.’ I must be in trouble,” he said.\nThe corners of his mouth twitched. “Come here.”\nShe came to his side and he pulled her close so they could watch the\nsun rise together.\n“Moments of beauty sustain us through hours of ugliness,” her father\nsaid. She watched him as he watched the sun rise. His blue eyes—outside\nthe red halo, of course—looked tired. Corvan Danavis had always had the\ncapacity to survive on less sleep than anyone Liv knew, so she knew it\nwasn’t the early hour that had him weary. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen\nthis look on his face, but she thought it might be the first time she\nunderstood it.\nAll those times she’d seen this look pinching his eyes and squeezing\nthe joy out of her usually jovial father, he was reliving battles. Today, he\nwas preparing to see more men die—and fighting for the very man who’d\nkilled his people in the past, Gavin Guile. It must be tearing him apart.\nThe sun rose in magnificent pinks and oranges mirrored in the waves,\nand slowly the tension leaked out of her father’s eyes. She could see the\nfreckles under his caramel skin around his eyes, and the faint red highlights\nin his hair were set afire by the sunlight. She’d inherited neither, nor the\nblue eyes that would have helped her be a more powerful drafter.\nCorvan’s lips moved faintly, mouthing words. Oh, he was praying, she\nrealized. Finished, he made the triangle, splaying three fingers: touching his\nthumb to his right eye; his middle finger to his left eye; and his forefinger to\nhis forehead, the spiritual eye. He completed the gesture by touching\nmouth, heart, and hands. The three and the four, the perfect seven, sealed to\nOrholam. What you behold, what you believe, how you behave.\nHe didn’t turn from the risen sun. “You came to demand how I can\nfight for my old enemy,” he said.\n“He killed mother.” Liv’s voice was icy.\n“No, Aliviana, he didn’t.”\n“His people did. Same thing.”\n“The situation is more complicated than you realize.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean? Don’t treat me like I’m a child!”\n“I’m sorry, Aliviana, I have to protect—”\n“I’m seventeen. I’ve been surviving without your protection for three\nyears! You don’t have to protect me anymore.”\n“Not protecting you,” Corvan said. “Protecting others from you.”\nWhat?

I’ve seen fathers who abuse\ntheir position and demand slavish obedience of their children. I’ve never\ndone that with you, have I? When you wanted to go to the Chromeria and I\ndidn’t want you to go, when I told you that I could teach you everything\nabout drafting you needed to know, what happened?”\n“You let me go.” Eventually.\n“And it was awful for you there, but you showed me how strong you\nare, and here you stand. I’m proud of you, Aliviana. You swam with sea\ndemons and survived. But I’m asking you to trust me on this. I’m doing the\nright thing. I promise. I haven’t forgotten your mother. I haven’t forgotten\nyou.”\nShe couldn’t maintain the eye contact or her righteous indignation in\nthe face of her father’s open, honest refusal to be more open and honest. He\nwas standing on his record, and more than anyone, she knew that his record\nwas unimpeachable. She also knew that he wouldn’t be moved once he\nmade a decision like this. If she was stubborn, she’d come by it honestly.\nShe gave in. “It was so much easier to admire him when he wasn’t\nmaking war in our country. I mean, I didn’t even think about the war when I\nwas around him.”\n“A little infatuated?” her father suggested.\nA flush crawled up her cheeks. “Maybe a little,” she grumbled.\n“I’d wonder if you weren’t. He is what he is,” Corvan said, shrugging.\n“He really isn’t responsible for mother’s death?” Liv asked, feeling\nweak.\n“Responsible? That’s tricky. If the Guiles hadn’t gone to war, would\nyour mother still be alive? Probably. But I can tell you two things: Gavin\ndidn’t order or desire your mother’s death in any way, and he is utterly and\nforever besotted with one woman, and that’s not you.”\n“That’s three things, isn’t it?” Liv asked, shooting her father a grin.\nHe grinned back. “You get one free for being my daughter.”\n“What’s he doing here? The Prism’s men burned this city, killed tens\nof thousands. He’s showed no interest in Garriston since then, so what does\nhe want now? Like it didn’t matter when no one wanted it, but now that\nsomeone does, he can’t lose it?”\n“There weren’t two Guile brothers, there were three. The youngest\none, Sevastian, was murdered by a blue wight when Gavin was about\nthirteen. Gavin’s first purpose is to protect the innocent from color wights.\nOr, if you want to look at it uncharitably, to kill color wights wherever he\nfinds them. King Garadul is using color wights, or at least the Prism\nbelieves he is. So he must be stopped.”\n“A blue wight? That doesn’t make sense.

Some\ncolor wights hold on to something like sanity for weeks or even months.\nSome are fine during the night, but in light, they’re fully in the grip of their\ncolor. The madness is different every time. A blue can go into a murderous\nrage; a red can seem calm and philosophical. It’s why they’re so dangerous.\nNow, are you going to help me?”\n“Fine, what can I do?” she asked.\n“Do you know how to make luxin grenadoes?”\n“What? No.”\n“What are they teaching you dims at the Chromeria these days?”\n“Hey!”\nCorvan smiled. “You have your specs?”\n“Of course,” Liv said.\n“Good, I could use a yellow.”\n“I’m not a very good yellow. I mean, I can’t make a solid brightwater.”\n“That’s not what I need,” Corvan said. “Do you know what happens\nwhen you mix red and liquid yellow, seal it airtight in a blue shell, and then\nshatter it against something?”\n“Uh, something good?” Liv asked.\n“Boom!” Corvan said. “You could use superviolet for the shell, too,\nbut it makes throwers nervous.”\nPicking up an explosive when you couldn’t see whether the shell was\nintact? Liv could see how that might make someone nervous.\nCorvan tossed her a blue luxin ball. She caught it and was surprised\nthat it rattled. She looked closer. The ball had round shot inside it, like small\nmusket balls. For some reason, it stunned her. “These, these…”\n“Those are what make grenadoes kill. That’s what we’re doing,\nAliviana. We’re killing people. Right here, right now. We’re using\nOrholam’s gift to kill Orholam’s children. Most of whom are fools who\ncould be our friends at any other time. It’s a hard world. You want me to lie\nabout it? You want to be protected after all?”\nLiv felt the blood drain out of her. Her father’s words were a sponge,\nsucking up her illusions, blotting up the thin joy she’d gotten from being in\nhis presence again, in trusting someone to make her decisions for her.\nSomething snapped.\n“Father, I can’t do this,” she said. “I can’t kill Tyreans, not for the\nChromeria, not just because you say so.”\nFor a moment, she saw keen sorrow in her father’s eyes. He looked—\nfor the first time she’d ever seen in her whole life—old, haggard. “Liv.” He\npaused. “At some point, you have to decide not merely what you’re going\nto believe, but how you’re going to believe. Are you going to believe in\npeople, or in ideas, or in Orholam? With your heart, or with your head? Will\nyou believe what’s in front of you, or in what you think you know? There\nare some things you think you know that are lies. I can’t tell you what those\nare, and I’m sorry for that.”"

I can’t tell you what those\nare, and I’m sorry for that.”\nIt seemed to Liv that this was his long way of explaining Fealty to\nOne.\n“What did you choose, father? Ideas or men?” Liv asked. Though she\nhad just seen him praying, she knew her father wasn’t very religious. That\npart of him had died with her mother. His prayer had likely been something\nalong the lines of: “Well done, sir. This is a beautiful sunset.” Her father\nrejected the idea that Orholam actually cared about individual men or\nwomen, or nations, for that matter.\nShe saw him blink. His mouth opened, closed rapidly. Set in a line,\neyes pained. “I can’t say,” he said finally.\nCan’t say because you never actually made the choice? How can you\nlecture me, then? But that didn’t make sense. Her father was the best man\nshe knew.\nNo, that wasn’t it. Her father had lived his life because he believed in\ncertain ideas. That was what had led him to fight against Gavin Guile, to\ngive up everything in that fight. He’d been a man of ideals. Those ideals\nwere what had made him stay away from the Chromeria himself, what had\nmade him oppose his daughter going to the Chromeria. He’d been afraid\nthat she would be corrupted by the Chromeria’s lack of ideals.\nA wise fear, as it turned out, Liv thought guiltily. She had been\ncorrupted. She had agreed to spy on Gavin. She was just as bad as everyone\nelse at the Chromeria.\nBut that didn’t explain why her father was suddenly fighting for the\nman he should hate. The ideals hadn’t changed. If anything, Gavin being\nhere, fighting Tyreans, should have made her father fight him all the more\nfiercely.\nOrholam, maybe her father had been corrupted too. Maybe he’d been\nbought. Maybe he’d sold out his ideals just like everyone else. Her heart\nhurt at the very thought, but why else wouldn’t he tell her the answer to\nwhat was an obvious question? Because it would make his hypocrisy\nundeniable.\nThe whole swiving Chromeria was corrupt. It defiled everything it\ntouched. Liv had been at the bottom. She’d seen how monochromes were\ntreated; she’d seen how Tyreans were treated. And she’d become part of the\npower, too. She’d become almost a friend to the Prism himself—and she’d\nloved it, loved talking with a powerful man, basking in his attention. She’d\nloved the beautiful dresses and being treated as special and worth attention.\nAnd to keep her power, she’d sold herself—so easily, so easily. But that was\nhow things worked at the Chromeria. It had even corrupted her father.\n“Liv,” her father said. “Liv, trust me. I know it’s hard, but please.”\n“Trust you? When you won’t trust me?” she asked, pained.\n“Livy, please. I love you. You know I wouldn’t do anything to hurt\nyou.”\nAnd then it all became clear and it took Liv’s breath away. How could\nthe Prism get her father to betray everything he held dear? Why would her"

        "text": "you.”\nAnd then it all became clear and it took Liv’s breath away. How could\nthe Prism get her father to betray everything he held dear? Why would her\nfather evade simple questions? Because he loved her. Corvan had been\ncorrupted, but not by money or power or sex. She knew he wouldn’t sell his\nsoul so cheaply. So what did the Prism have over Corvan? He had Liv.\nGavin Guile was using Liv to suborn her father. She didn’t know what\nexactly the threat and the bribe had been, but it didn’t matter. Liv was being\nbribed and threatened exactly the same way, but by the Ruthgari. She knew\nhow the game was played, now. She had betrayed her principles because\nshe loved Vena. Her father was betraying his principles because he loved\nLiv.\nCorvan had chosen that his fealty would be to his family only. That\nmeant Liv. And it meant he couldn’t tell her. Because if he told her, she’d\nruin it and make his sacrifices worthless.\nLiv’s heart broke. She had to clamp down hard on her emotions to\nkeep from bursting into tears. Cruel. So cruel. How could Gavin do such a\nthing and then smile at her?\nBecause that’s how the Chromeria is. Vipers and villains, all of them.\nAnd Corvan had done everything he could to try to keep Liv out of the\nChromeria—everything short of ordering her not to go, because he wasn’t\nso imperious. It was her fault. Liv swallowed the sudden lump in her throat.\nHer father had been debased because of her. He deserved better than for her\nto expose his shame.\nShe smiled as bravely as she could, pretending to acquiesce. “I\nunderstand, father. I do trust you. Just tell me everything when you can. Fair\nenough?”\n“Fair enough,” Corvan said, his relief obvious. “I love you, Livy.”\n“I know you do, father.”\nAnd Gavin Guile was going to pay for turning that love against him.\nChapter 64\nIt’s simple, Kip. You’re not being asked to draft a pulley or a scull. One\nlittle green ball. It’s nothing.\nHe was sitting cross-legged, green spectacles on, white board in his\nlap, willing something to happen. He’d been doing this for two hours. And\nwhat exactly was he doing? Nothing. How were you supposed to even keep\nyour mind on drafting when nothing happened for hours? His stomach was\ncomplaining again. It was constant now as the sun approached noon.\nNo food until I draft? It’s cruel. It’s torture. It’s impossible.\nKip looked up. Gavin had brought them only a few hundred paces\noutside the Lover’s Gate to the ruins of the old outer walls. When they’d\narrived, there were already hundreds of men at work, and since then, many\nof those who’d been stuck in the line that they’d passed had joined them.\nThey were excavating the roots of the wall down to bedrock, which was at\nleast four paces down in the few places Kip could see. The excavation,\nthough, went faster than he would have thought possible, between the sheer\nnumber of men working and the sandy soil, with only thin vegetation on\ntop.\nGavin was poring over drawings with Master Danavis.

General\nDanavis, Kip supposed, and the natural manner with which the general\ncommanded men to do this or that—exactly how he’d told Kip to go do this\nor that—made Kip wonder why he’d never wondered about Master Danavis\nbefore. The man was obviously too big for a little town like Rekton, but Kip\nhad never even thought about him. Children only think about themselves,\nKip.\n“It’s not good enough,” Gavin was saying. “No, the detail’s fine. The\ndetail’s perfect. But the old wall didn’t stop us, so why rebuild something\nthat’s faulty?”\nRebuild the wall? Hadn’t Gavin said that King Garadul’s army was\narriving in four or five days?\n“We’ll be lucky if we can get something that’s merely faulty,” General\nDanavis said. “We’ll be lucky if we can finish anything at all.”\n“Bring me the drawings of Rathcaeson,” the Prism said.\n“You’re seriously going to build a wall based on artists’ renditions of a\nmythical city?”\nThe muscle in Gavin’s jaw twitched with irritation.\n“Understood, Lord Prism,” General Danavis said. He bobbed a bow.\n“Bring your daughter,” Gavin said. “I could use a superviolet.”\nA slight hesitation. “Of course.” The general left, mounting his horse\nand galloping toward the city, his Ruthgari personal guards trailing in his\nwake.\nThen, though he’d been speaking nonstop with foremen, Ruthgari\nguards, and General Danavis all morning, Gavin was suddenly alone. He\nlooked over at Kip. Oops, I think I’m supposed to be drafting.\nGavin cocked an eyebrow at him. “Not hungry yet, huh?”\nKip grimaced. “Thanks for reminding me.”\n“Kip, more than any other color, green can be summarized in one\nword. All the others require at least a few, a bit of hedging, some qualifiers.\nGreen is wild. Everything both good and bad associated with wild is what\ngreen is. That’s why I can tell you that you only need will, because will and\nwildness go so naturally together. If you were an incipient blue, I’d have to\nexplain the sense of drafting, the harmony, the order, how it fits with the\nworld. That’s not you. Any questions?”\nNot about drafting. “What happened to that gunner?”\n“What?” Gavin asked.\n“The one on the Ilytian boat, who nearly killed us. Right before I shot\nhim, his gun blew up.”\n“It does happen,” Gavin said. “You overcharge your shot, the musket\ncan’t handle the charge.”\n“That gunner, who nearly hit us from five hundred paces? He\nmisjudged a musket?”\nGavin smiled. He turned his palm over. There was nothing in it. Oh,\nKip tightened his eyes. A superviolet ball rested in Gavin’s hand. “See it?”\nGavin asked.\n“I see it.”\nGavin extended his hand. A little pop, and his hand jumped back. The"

The\nsuperviolet ball streaked out like it was a musket ball itself. “I blocked his\nmusket barrel,” Gavin said, shrugging. “You can use any color to do it.\nYellow only if you can make solid yellow, of course, but pretty much\nanything else.”\n“Why not kill him?”\n“I may have,” Gavin said. “A musket exploding in your hands is no\njoke.” He shrugged. “I recognized him. Freelancer during the war.\nSometimes fought for me, sometimes for my brother, sometimes for any\ncaptain that would pay him enough. He’s a drunk and a scoundrel and the\nfinest artist of the cannon in the Seven Satrapies. Whatever name he was\nborn with, now he’s simply known as Gunner. It’s everything he is. His first\nunderdeck command as cannoneer was on a ship called the Aved Barayah,\nthe Fire Breather.”\n“The Fire Breather? The Fire Breather?” Kip asked.\n“Only ship in memory to ever kill a full-grown sea demon. Gunner\nwas maybe sixteen years old.” Gavin shook his head, dispelling a memory.\n“I’ve killed a lot of people, Kip. Sometimes you hesitate, and as bad and as\ndangerous as that is, I like to think it’s proof that I’ve still got some\nhumanity left. Besides, I knew making his gun blow up in his hands would\nreally infuriate him. If I know Gunner, he made that musket himself, and\nhe’s probably wondering who the hell overcharged his precious musket.”\nHe glanced over to a richly dressed Ruthgari approaching, flanked by\nguards and slaves carrying a mobile pavilion to shade the light-skinned\nman. “I’ll leave you to your work,” Gavin said. “You might want to hurry,\nthe servants should be bringing lunch anytime.”\nJust when I’d sort of forgotten my stomach. Thanks.\nKip pushed the spectacles up his nose—they kept slipping down, and\nthey weren’t even close to comfortable—and stared at the white board.\nWild. Wild, unbridled, growing. The Ruthgari noble—Kip gathered it was\nthe governor—was complaining shrilly to Gavin about something or other,\nand he stood as if he was going to take his time about it. Kip tried to block\nhim out.\nGreen. Come on, let’s suck up some wildness.\nWild, now there’s a word for me. Kip the wild. I was pretty wild when\nRam used to call me Tubby, huh? I was pretty wild when he made me back\ndown over Isa. She’d be alive if I’d been a little wilder. To be wild is the\nopposite of being controlled, and I’ve been controlled for my whole life.\nControlled by Ram, by Ram! A village tough. A boy! Barely a bully.\nIf Kip had told Ram to go to the evernight, if he had shredded Ram\nwith his tongue, what could Ram have done except beat him? Ram’s\nmuscles weren’t half a match for Kip’s brain.\nWell, they’re not a match for anything now that they’re rotting."

There’d been\nplenty of good things about the boy. A few, anyway. And if Kip didn’t feel\nterrible that Ram was dead, he did wish the boy were alive so he could face\nhim now.\nI’ve talked with Gavin Guile. I sank pirates with him! Well, mostly I\ntried not to drown while he sank pirates, but still.\nKip looked at his hands. Still no luxin. The governor was still\ncomplaining loudly. Orholam, how was Gavin standing it? The man had the\nmost nasal voice Kip had ever heard. Kip wanted to bean the man in the\nhead with a big old ball of green luxin. He glanced at his hands again.\nNothing.\nI’m going to fail Gavin. Again. Like I failed Isa. Like I failed Sanson.\nLike I failed my mother a thousand times.\nHunger gnawed Kip’s belly. That’s all I am, a fat failure. A new life’s\nbeen handed to me on a plate. Gavin Guile’s son, bastard son, sure, but he\nhasn’t once treated me like an embarrassment. And I can’t even summon\nthe will to reach out and take this new life. In return for all the good he’s\ndone me, I’m going to humiliate the man who saved my life, who gave me a\nsecond chance.\nIt was like bands of iron were being laid across his chest, and now they\ntightened, tightened. Kip could barely breathe. His eyes welled with tears.\nBaby. Failure. Disappointment. His mother’s face, twisted, dangerously\nhigh from smoking ratweed laced with ergot: You ruined my life! You’re the\nworst mistake I ever made. I gave everything and you took it all and gave\nme nothing! You make me sick, Kip.\nKip, you can throw off those chains. Stop believing those—\n“Lies!” the governor shouted. Kip shivered, his skin tingling. The sun\nwas nearly at its zenith. Orholam’s eye pressed down on the land like a\nphysical weight, but to Kip it was a caress. Light, energy, warmth, love,\nlight in dark corners. He looked at the white board, and in the green filtered\nthrough his spectacles, he saw one face of Orholam. Kip wouldn’t call it\nwildness. It was freedom. He wanted to shout, dance for joy, to hell with\nwhat anyone thought. There was freedom from all of that, and freedom\nfrom the prison of his own head, freedom from the nagging voices of doubt,\nfrom the running commentary about everything he saw and did. It was\naction, and it was as powerful as a redwood springing up in the cracks of a\nboulder. Life would win. The roots would reach and heave and strain.\nKip could feel those bands of iron around his chest burst asunder. He\nfelt more alive than he had in his whole life. An animal strength and joy.\nSo this is what they mean by wild.\nThe yapping governor’s voice shrilled. Kip drew a ball of green luxin"

Kip drew a ball of green luxin\ninto his hand. Just like that? Just by deciding to do it? It seemed too easy.\nThe ball was thick, dense, but flexible to his squeezing fingers. Kip made it\nbigger, hollow, about twice the size of his own head. Now the flexibility\nwas exaggerated. Soft enough that it wasn’t going to kill anyone.\nWith the biggest grin on his face, Kip held it in his palms. How had\nGavin shot out luxin? Kip had seen Ironfist do it too. He wrinkled his nose.\nMaybe I just will it.\nA tiny part of his mind was protesting: You can’t assault the governor!\nHe’s the governor, for Orholam’s sake. You think his bodyguards are going\nto appreciate that you don’t really mean to hurt him?\nBut in the grip of green, words like “governor” were bled of meaning.\nWhat was that? What was the difference? The trappings of human rituals\nand human titles seemed artificial, thin.\nKip willed the ball to shoot out of his hands. Still seated, grinning like\na fool, he could feel energy coiling up behind the ball. How long did he let\nthat build before he let it go? Oh well, that felt like long enough. A muffled\ncrack and the ball jetted out of Kip’s hands, fast.\nStill seated on the ground, he was blasted ass over elbows.\nRolling to his knees, laughing, Kip looked to see what had happened to\nthe yapping man.\nThe governor was laid out, and apparently the green luxin ball had\nbounced around some, because the palanquin was collapsing, two of the\nslaves tumbling away from it. The palanquin dropped right on top of the\ngovernor, and Kip heard him shrieking—but his view was blocked as one of\nthe bodyguards charged Kip, sword out.\nSpectacles askew, Kip couldn’t draw any more green, but he still had a\ngood amount in his body. He began drawing another, smaller ball. Too slow,\ntoo slow!\nThe air shimmered between him and the swordsman as he raised his\nhands. There was a crack from his hands and a tiny green ball shot out,\nsnapping both hands back painfully from the kick.\nA wall of blue luxin unfurled between Kip and the swordsman in the\nblink of an eye. The swordsman’s sword struck the blue wall in midlunge\ntoward the kneeling boy. The blade screeched as it was forced downward,\npeeling off layers of blue. The swordsman himself smacked bodily into the\nblue a split second later, grunting. There was a sound like glass cracking,\nand a high-pitched whine.\nThe swordsman recovered, then stopped. The blue luxin right in front\nof his face was cracked from Kip’s shot, spiderwebs centered where his\nhead would have been, a musket-ball-sized crater in the blue luxin.\n“Enough,” Gavin said. He didn’t raise his voice, just injected it in a\nmoment of silence. His blue wall had saved both of them."

What did I just do?\nThe governor, still protesting, was pulled from the fallen palanquin by\ntwo of his bodyguards. He stood, nose bleeding, face flushed from\nembarrassment rapidly giving way to rage, and stormed over to Gavin.\n“Your slave has assaulted me, I demand satisfaction!” The governor\ndrew the decorative blade hanging at his hip and pointed it at Kip.\nA muscle jumped in Gavin’s jaw. “That’s no slave. Kip is my natural\nson.”\n“This, this is your bastard?”\nStony silence from Gavin. Finally, “Kip, apologize.”\nKip swallowed and stood, unable to conceal his trembling. “I’m\nterribly sorry, sir. I was practicing drafting for the first time. I really didn’t\nknow what I was—”\n“An apology? No, Lord Prism, first you assault me, and now this\noutrage? I demand satisfaction.”\n“You’ll demand nothing,” Gavin said. He never broke eye contact.\n“You’re corrupt if not treasonous, Governor Crassos. You’ve been colluding\nwith King Garadul, and if I can find just a little more evidence of it, I swear\nwhen you return to Ruthgar, your head will have a pike waiting for it.\nUnless Satrapah Ptolos decides to hand you over to the Parians instead.\nYou’re incompetent, contemptible, a liar, a thief, and a coward. If you want\nsatisfaction, you can duel with me. Sword to sword. On my word of honor I\nwon’t draft, but we’ll do it right now.”\nThe governor blinked and the sword point trembled. He blinked again.\nSheathed his blade. “I’ll leave brawling with swords to the benighted.” He\nsnarled and turned on his heel, storming off.\nKip became aware that someone was right behind him. He turned and\nsaw Ironfist looming over him. “How long have you been there?” he asked.\n“Long enough to protect you from your foolishness, if not long enough\nto stop it. I wasn’t aware you had your family’s knack for getting into\ntrouble in the blink of an eye.”\nOh, the blue wall had been Ironfist’s. Was that twice over now that Kip\nowed his life to the huge Blackguard?\n“Commander,” Gavin said, “I need you to go speak with our spies.\nCrassos is rattled. He may run. Make sure the crews manning the cannons at\nthe harbor’s entrance are men who will obey the order to fire, if it comes to\nthat. And that he doesn’t plunder the treasury. I need to be able to pay our\narmy.”\nIronfist frowned. “I’d prefer not to leave Kip. I’m a Blackguard, Lord\nPrism, not a messenger. My duty is here.”\nGavin said, “I can’t do it. Kip can’t do it. It needs doing.

Dozens of\nworkmen had seen what had happened, and humiliating the governor had\nclearly earned Gavin some goodwill, but no one appeared to want to come\nclose either, lest Gavin was angry. Gavin rubbed his forehead. “You’re\nprobably wondering why we’re going to fight a war for assholes like that\ngovernor,” he said.\nActually, the thought hadn’t occurred to Kip, but now that Gavin\nbrought it up, it did seem odd.\n“Because Rask Garadul had the stench of a fanatic, Kip. That’s all.\nHundreds, or if we’re unlucky, thousands of people will die because I met\nRask for a few minutes and I thought he was crazy.” Gavin expelled a\nbreath. “He wants this city, and honestly, he’s got a right to it. If I could\nsimply give this city back to Tyrea’s people, I would. They deserve it. They\n—you—have paid too high of a price for a war in which they took the only\nside they could. If there were anyone else who would take over after we\nleft, I’d do it, and damn the Spectrum. But with Rask in power… It’s a little\nmore complicated than that, of course, but that’s why I’m here, and my\npresence is what will make this a near thing. If we left, Rask would march\nin unopposed, close the harbor before the Parians could land, and that\nwould be pretty much the end of it. The Parians would be furious, but the\nprofits here aren’t so great that they want to march an army here.\nEventually, Rask would offer an exclusive shipping contract on all the citrus\nfrom Garriston for a few years, and they’d take it. What do you think? Is it\nworth it?”\nHe’s asking me like my opinion is worth something. Kip hadn’t had\nthat many adults care what he thought. “I think King Garadul should die\nand save us all this trouble.”\nGavin laughed ruefully. “If only. Maybe Karris will work a miracle\nand do just that.”\n“You really miss her, don’t you?” Kip asked before he could stop\nhimself.\nGavin looked at Kip sharply. Then he looked away. Relented. After a\nminute, he expelled a long breath, and it was like Kip was watching Gavin’s\nhope leak out of him. “That obvious, huh?” Gavin asked.\n“You think they’ll kill her?” Kip asked.\nA number of emotions flitted over Gavin’s face, settling in resignation,\nsorrow too deep for tears. “She’ll live until Rask sees if I’ll trade the city\nfor her. Then he’ll kill her. Either way.”\nNo. No they won’t, Kip thought. I swear it.\nChapter 65\nThe empty feeling in Kip’s stomach didn’t go away when they served\nlunch.

Kip sat to one\nside, out of the way. He had no idea what they were doing, and space\naround the table was limited. He ate fresh oranges with gusto, and tore into\nthe intriguing spiced fresh javelina. It tasted amazing, but even he couldn’t\nkeep his mind on food for long.\n“I’d ask if you’re serious,” General Danavis was saying, “but you have\nthat look.”\n“The problem isn’t the drafting,” Gavin said. “I can handle that much\nluxin easily—”\n“Easily?” General Danavis interrupted, dubiously.\n“Fine, not easily, but I can do it. The problem is the weight. I can’t lift\nthis much, much less throw it into place.”\nLiv cleared her throat gently, as if unsure she really wanted to intrude.\n“Aliviana?” Gavin asked.\nShe colored. “Please, Liv.” She brushed her hair back nervously. “How\nabout this?” She drafted something onto the table. It was, of course,\nsuperviolet, and thus invisible to most people.\nGeneral Danavis scowled. Apparently, most people included him.\n“Sorry, father,” she said. “I can’t control yellow enough to make\nmodels with it.”\nKip tried to see what she’d drafted, but the table was obscured by\nbodies.\nGavin chuckled. “It looks ridiculous,” he said, and Liv blanched. “But\nit’ll work. Perfect. Fine. What do our architects think of the design?”\nFor a moment, Kip thought Gavin was being pretty rude. Obviously,\nGeneral Danavis and everyone else around the table was curious about what\nLiv had designed. But this was Gavin as leader. All the rest of them didn’t\nneed to know, and there was work to be done. He understood the solution to\nthe problem, and that was all that was necessary. On to the next problem.\nWhich is what I should be doing. Kip had finished lunch. He could\nnow draft a little bit, and on purpose. He knew what he had to do.\n“My Lord Prism, none of us has ever built a wall of this magnitude, or,\nor—or a wall at all, to tell the truth,” a nervous architect said, “but these old\ndrawings you’ve shown us of Rathcaeson are clearly flawed. Too much\nfantasy, not enough function.”\n“This empty desert doesn’t have enough function,” Gavin said sharply.\n“Tell me what we need to do to fix it. I need to start building now, today.”\nThe architect blinked. Swallowed. “Uh, here.” He drew a line with his\nfinger. “This interior passage isn’t wide enough. You’re going to have men\nrushing back and forth in armor, with guns, cannons being rolled into\nposition, or replaced for repair. This passage must be wide enough for men\nto run past each other and past carts or cannons.”\n“How wide?” Gavin demanded.\n“I’d say, uh…” He held his fingers apart on the drawing."

        "text": "to run past each other and past carts or cannons.”\n“How wide?” Gavin demanded.\n“I’d say, uh…” He held his fingers apart on the drawing.\n“For Orholam’s sake, write on it,” Gavin said.\n“Sir, those drawings are hundreds of years old, priceless relics of—”\nanother man, perhaps an artist, protested.\n“Priceless is being alive next week,” Gavin snapped. “Continue.”\nKip didn’t know why he’d been so slow, but it only dawned on him\nnow that Gavin was seriously planning on building a wall, here. Before\nKing Garadul’s army arrived. In four days.\nOh, maybe because it’s impossible?\nOf course, crossing the Cerulean Sea in a morning was impossible too.\nBut seriously, did Gavin mean to draft the entire thing by himself? Kip\ndidn’t know all that much about drafting and how much a drafter could\nsafely use in a day, but the mere fact that the world wasn’t bursting with\nluxin buildings and bridges and walls told him that it had to be incredibly\ndifficult. In fact, the only luxin buildings he’d seen had been at the\nChromeria, and he had to guess that the seven towers had been the product\nof a huge collaborative effort.\nThe architect, a squinting little man, after puffing out his cheeks a\nnumber of times, deep in thought, began drawing quickly. “The cutouts on\nthese murder holes don’t give sufficient range of fire. If you modify the top\nof the wall like this, scaling ladders won’t be able to hook onto the wall—at\nleast not as easily. A railing on the back, like so, will save more of your own\nmen from falling off the wall than theirs. These areas on top of the wall\nneed to be bigger so you can store more powder for the cannons. There’s no\nplace in these drawings for taking the wounded. I think you could\nincorporate that here. If you can set sleds like this right into the wall of the\ninterior passage, it’ll be easier to move materiel around. There are also no\nlantern hooks in this plan. Your wall will be entirely dark if you don’t fix\nthis. You’ll need cranes here, here, and here to lift supplies.”\n“You’ve never built a wall before, huh?” Gavin asked.\n“I have studied a few,” the architect said.\n“How much am I paying you?”\n“Uh, nothing yet, Lord Prism.”\n“Well, double it!” Gavin ordered.\nThe architect looked befuddled, obviously doing the arithmetic and not\nliking the result, but not wanting to call the Prism himself out on it.\n“He’s joking,” General Danavis told the man.\nGavin’s eyes sparkled.\n“Oh.” The man looked relieved. Then Kip could see the question cross\nhis face: joking about giving me nothing, or joking about giving me more\nfor doing a good job?\nGavin said, “Keep working. This man here will take notes. I’m going\nto go lay the foundation.”\n“He means that metaphorically, right?” the architect asked, squinting at\nthe receding figure of the Prism.\n“Our Prism’s a bear for metaphors,” General Danavis said.\n“Huh?” the architect asked.\nKip stood, feeling heartsick. Now was going to be as good of a chance\nto escape as he was going to get."

Now was going to be as good of a chance\nto escape as he was going to get.\n“Kip!” Gavin’s voice rang out, drawing everyone’s eye to Kip. Kip felt\na surge of panic and embarrassment at having been caught so easily. “Well\ndone today. It’s not many boys who can draft consciously on their first day\nof trying.”\nA flush of pleasure went through Kip, only doubled by the impressed\nlook that flitted over Liv’s face.\n“Liv!” Gavin called out, making her head whip around. “I want you to\nmake models: lay out the curvature of the halls, widths for the top of the\nwall, whatever the architect tells you.”\n“Yes, Lord Prism!” she said, her eyes turning back to the table and her\nwork.\nNow or never. If he waited, Ironfist would be back, shadowing him\nwherever he went. Kip looked at General Danavis, head down, making\nsuggestions; Liv, listening intently; and finally at Gavin. These were the\nonly people in the world who meant anything to him, and incredibly, they\naccepted him. Tolerated him, anyway. With them, for the first time in his\nlife, he felt like he was part of something.\nKip turned his back and walked toward the city.\nChapter 66\nIt was only as Kip approached the Lover’s Gate that he understood why\nGavin was attempting to build a new wall. The old wall was encrusted with\nhomes, shops, and inns like a ship with barnacles, except here the walls\nwere covered both inside and out. In places, people’s roofs were almost\nlevel with the top of the wall. If Gavin wanted to make that wall defensible,\nhe’d have to level hundreds of homes. The demolition itself would have\ntaken four days.\nClearly, the effect on the people’s opinion of demolishing the homes of\nperhaps a fifth of the city’s population would be ruinous. Gavin had only a\nfew days in which to make the people who remained in the city want to\nfight for him rather than for his enemy. He’d been caught between\nimpossible choices: leave the people’s homes propped against the inner\nwalls and have a militarily indefensible wall, or tear the houses down and\nrisk turning an already divided populace against him. So Gavin had decided\nto build his own wall.\nUnbelievable. How must it have been during the Prisms’ War, when\npeople had to choose which brother to fight beside? It would have been like\nfighting beside giants, knowing that their slightest move might crush you,\nbut knowing that standing in the no-man’s-land between them would be\neven worse.\nKip found his way back to his rooms and packed what he guessed he’d\nneed. Cloak and food, and more food, and short sword, and a stick of tin\ndanars in a money belt. It was more than he thought he’d need—he hoped\nthey’d forgive him for that, but he might need money for bribes. Then he\ndecided he’d need to leave a note so they didn’t waste precious time\nsearching for him.\nThere was a quill and parchment on the desk in his room, so he\nscratched out the letters laboriously. “I’m Tyrean and young.

No one will suspect me. Will try to find Karris.” He signed\nthe note, folded it after the ink dried, and stuck it under the covers in Liv’s\nbed.\nThen he scratched out another one. “Went to buy some food and watch\nminstrel shows. Shaken after drafting. Will be back by midnight.”\nThat one he left on the desk. They would find it first and give him a\nhead start. They wouldn’t find out he was truly gone until after nightfall. At\nthat point, they’d know he would be too far gone for them to catch him.\nWith what he felt must have been suspiciously overloaded saddlebags,\nKip made his way past the gate guards and to the stable.\n“I need a horse,” Kip told the stableman imperiously.\nThe man returned his gaze, not moving from his position leaning\nagainst one wall. “Right place,” he said.\nKip had a sinking feeling. The man wasn’t buying that he was anyone\nwho could give orders. If Kip couldn’t get a horse, he couldn’t do anything.\nIt would be the shortest attempt at running away in history. He hadn’t even\ngotten out of the house. “Uh, I need something not too ostentatious, and not\ntoo… spirited.”\n“Not much of a rider, huh?” The man’s tone said, Must not be much of\na man.\nConfess your ineptitude and fall on his mercy, Kip. “What’s your\nname, shit shoveler?” he demanded instead. Oops.\nThe groom blinked and stood up straight unconsciously. “Gallos…\nsir,” he added uncertainly.\n“I don’t ride these stinking meat barrels much, but I need one that’s\nreliable, that can handle my fat ass, and that won’t panic when I use magic,\nyou understand? And I don’t have time for your superciliosity.” Was that\neven a word? Kip bulled forward. The groom probably didn’t know either.\n“There’s a war on. Get me my damned horse and save the shit-packing for\nyour stable boys.”\nThe groom moved with alacrity, saddling an old draft horse. “Best I\ngot for what you’ve asked, sir,” the man said.\nA draft horse? I’m not that fat.\n“Sorry, sir, only one I got.”\n“It’ll do,” Kip said. “Thank you.” No need to press his luck. The\nstirrup did look impossibly high, however. Instead of humiliating himself\nby trying to mount and most likely failing, he took the reins and led the\nbeast out into the city, taking care to tip the groom.\nOrholam, I really was an asshole. Kip didn’t know what made it more\ndisconcerting: that being an asshole had promptly gotten him his way, or\nthat he had enjoyed exerting mastery over another man.

It looked old, worn, and cost\nmaybe as much as one of Kip’s coat’s pockets. Kip traded with the man.\nThen he bought wine and water in one of the streets leading to the water\nmarket and was convincing a shopkeeper that he really did want to trade his\nfine cloak for a plain woolen one when he heard loud voices. He turned.\nSome old man was standing in the back of a wagon, exhorting the\ncrowd heading into the water market, most of whom were ignoring him.\n“—to have our own nation again. With our own king! You all want to\nwrithe under the bootheel of the Parians again? Do you remember what\nthey did last time? Have you no memory?!”\n“They killed hundreds for listening to nonsense like yours!” someone\nshouted.\n“And I say we don’t have to let them ever do it again,” the old man\nsnapped back. That got some murmurs of agreement.\n“Everyone who wanted to listen to your shilling for King Garadul has\nalready left!” a shopkeeper yelled.\n“The king isn’t willing that any should perish. Come, join him, and\nfight!”\n“We don’t want to fight. We don’t want to kill. We don’t want to be\nkilled. We want to live.”\n“Cowards!” the old man said. Then he shuffled off to look for a more\nsympathetic audience.\nKip was about to head out of town when something caught his eye.\nThere was a new ship in the bay, a galleon flying a white flag with seven\ntowers. The Chromeria’s flag. Almost at the moment that he identified the\nflag, he saw a line of men and women walking through the streets led by at\nleast a dozen Blackguards. He froze. Guilty conscience. They didn’t know\nhim, and he didn’t see the only two Blackguards he’d seen before, Stump\nand whatever the other one’s name had been.\nThe people behind the Blackguards were perhaps more interesting,\nthough, and Kip studied them as they passed half a block away and turned\ndown a street to head toward the Travertine Palace. There were perhaps two\nhundred of them, and Kip was sure that every last one was a drafter. A few\nhad eyes light enough that he could see their irises were solid blue or green\nor red, but some of the lighter-skinned among them actually had a visible\ntint to their skin. Some concealed that with long sleeves. Other didn’t seem\nto care. “… be true, but it looks better than the last time we were here,\nSamila,” a blue-tinged man said. Despite his light-enough-to-show-color\nskin, the man had his hair in dreadlocks almost to his waist. The woman\nwas stunning, perhaps forty years old, with solid blue irises, high\ncheekbones, and the olive skin of the western Atashian upper classes. Both\nwore rich clothing.\nSamila Sayeh and Izem Blue? No, surely not. Those names were just\nfrom stories. Surely there were plenty of drafters their age who happened to\nbe blues and reds who had special relationships with each other."

Surely there were plenty of drafters their age who happened to\nbe blues and reds who had special relationships with each other.\nNext came more Blackguards, helping infirm drafters or wheeling\nthem in chairs. Kip decided not to wait to see if Stump were with them.\nHe turned to slip through the crowd—and found himself face-to-face\nwith Liv. She stood with her hands on her hips, her jaw tight. She flicked\nher eyes to the horse and back to Kip. Gulp.\n“I can explain,” Kip said.\n“You already did. Twice.” There was no amusement in her tone.\nShe’d found both notes. Oh hell.\n“Don’t stop me, Liv, please.”\n“What do you think you’re doing?” She lowered her voice. “You think\nyou’re going to spy? You’re going to find Karris? And do what?”\nHis jaw set. “I’m going to save her.”\nShe made no effort to hide her incredulity. “That is one of the more\nridiculous things I’ve heard in my life, Kip. If you want to run away\nbecause it’s too dangerous here, you don’t need to pretend—”\n“Go to hell!” he said, stunning even himself. Her eyes shot wide. He\ncouldn’t believe he’d said that to Liv—Liv, for Orholam’s sake! “I’m\nsorry!” He said it too loud and some people around them looked at him. He\nlowered his voice sheepishly. “I’m really sorry, that was stupid to say, and\nmean. I didn’t mean it. I—Liv.” He paused, then bulled ahead. “I’m\nnothing. I’ve been a nothing for my whole life. And I’m being catapulted\ninto having people treat me different because of something I had no control\nover? Because of my father?” He could see on her face that she understood.\nShe knew exactly what he meant. “Liv, I owe Gavin everything, and he\nhasn’t asked anything of me.”\n“He will,” Liv said darkly.\n“Has he ever asked you to do anything wrong, Liv?”\n“Not yet,” she admitted. “I’m just saying that you have to look out for\nyourself when it comes to people from the Chromeria.”\n“And what? You’re not one of them? If you make me go back, you’ll\nbe making me break my word.”\n“What?” Liv looked like he’d just slapped her face.\n“I swore that I was going to save Karris. Don’t you see, Liv? I’m\nperfect precisely because I’m a nothing. Look at my eyes!” Still confused,\nshe looked at his eyes. “No color, no halo,” Kip said. “But I can draft. Liv,\nfor the first time in my life, I know exactly what I have to do. No one is\nmaking me do this. I’m doing it because it’s right. There’s something\ntremendously—” He clenched his hands, trying to pull in the words.\n“Freeing. Powerful. I don’t know what, but I know it feels good.”\n“Even if you go to your death?” Liv asked.\nHe chuckled joylessly. “I’m not being a hero, Liv. I just don’t like"

So what if I die?”\n“That’s the most awful thing I’ve ever heard,” Liv said.\n“I’m sorry,” Kip said. “I’m not trying to be pitiful. I’m just saying—\nI’ve got nothing. I’m an orphan, at best a bastard. A shame. I just don’t have\nthat much to lose. If I can do something good with my life—or even with\nmy death—then how could I not try?”\nHe could see her wavering. For the first time, he had hope that he\ncould actually get away with this.\n“Please, Liv. If I fail in this—if I can’t even get out of the city—I\nreally am a nothing. Please. Don’t make me fail in the most important thing\nI’ve ever tried to do.”\nShe blinked, then grinned. “I never thought what might happen if you\nturned that wily tongue against me. You ought to be an orange.”\n“I do resemble one in general shape, but I’m not sure—”\n“A drafter, not a fruit!” she said, laughing.\nOh, he was like a slippery drafter.\n“Does this mean you’re not going to stop me?” Kip said.\n“Worse,” she said.\n“Huh?”\n“You have to do what’s right; I have to do what’s right. You’re my\nresponsibility, Kip.”\n“Oh no you don’t.”\n“Yes. I’m going with you—or you’re not going.”\n“Liv, you don’t understand—” She doesn’t understand what? That\nyou’re totally smitten with her? That she’s beautiful and smart and\nwonderful and amazing and your whole soul longs just to be with her, but\nyou can’t imagine putting her in danger?\n“I don’t understand what?” she asked. Damn it.\n“You’re light to me.” It slipped out. He couldn’t believe he’d said it\nout loud. His eyes went wide even before hers did.\nHe’d been nearly physically naked before her when that assassin had\ntried to kill him. This was worse. He was paralyzed. His lips failed him.\n“Very funny, Kip, but you’re not going to fool me and slip away when\nI’m not looking or something. You might be wily, but I wasn’t born\nyesterday.”\nOh, thank Orholam! She thought he was joking! A wave of relief\npassed over him, leaving his knees weak.\n“I’m going with you,” Liv said, “and that’s final. You’re right: what\nyou’re trying is a good thing. I know Karris is worth saving, and what she’s\nlearned could change the whole war. And if you want to succeed, you’re\ngoing to need my help, and you’d be making me break my oath to look after\nyou if you don’t let me come.”\nHe had used that “don’t make me break my oath” thing as the whole\nlinchpin of his argument. He didn’t particularly like having it turned against\nhim, but with his whole brain in a fog—his heart was still pounding hard—\nhe couldn’t exactly counter it.\n“Besides,” Liv said more quietly, “even if you’re not running away"

Great.\n“I’m coming. Let’s go,” Liv said.\nTogether, they found the old man who’d been shouting at the crowd\nearlier, and got directions to King Garadul’s army: “Head south and follow\nthe tracks. Thousands have gone already. If you want to join the army rather\nthan be useless like the rest of the camp followers, tell the recruiting\nsergeant that Gerain sent you.”\nThe guards at the Hag’s Gate didn’t even look at them twice. Outside\nthe city, Kip found a rock, stood on it, and wiggled his way into the saddle.\nLiv took his hand and climbed up behind him. The huge draft horse seemed\nto have no trouble with the weight. Kip willed himself to relax as Liv put\nher arms around his waist to hold on.\nStill, Kip hesitated, looking north, looking back at Garriston. Come on,\nKip, you’ve done dumber things and lived to tell the tale.\nNot so sure about that. Still, Kip prodded the big horse and they began\nthe long trip.\nChapter 67\nIt started as a dull throb. It always did. For a while, Karris hoped her\nstomach was reacting to the food King Garadul was practically forcing\ndown her gullet. Karris hadn’t had her moon blood in six months. Like most\nof the women of the Blackguard, her flow was irregular at best. Their level\nof training simply precluded it. But when Karris had hers, it was like her\nbody was making up for lost pain.\nDamn King Garadul. This was his fault. The enforced boredom was\ndriving Karris mad—sitting in the wagon, unable to do much, and\nconstantly checked on. When they’d found her doing strength exercises,\nthey’d sent in three drafters and two Mirrormen. The six barely all fit in the\nlittle wagon. Karris had been seized by the Mirrormen and laid over the\nknee of one of the drafters. Literally laid over her knee.\nThe woman had produced a man’s leather belt and beat Karris’s\nbottom raw. Like she was a recalcitrant child. She’d been caught three\ntimes, and the punishment never changed, but gradually her will to resist\ndid. It had seemed like too small and inconsequential a rebellion to keep up.\nNow she wished she had. The throbbing was already spreading to her\nback. Not long now for the diarrhea to start.\nLove being a woman.\nThe other women of the Blackguard took advantage of their relative\nfreedom from moon blood as also granting relative freedom from worrying\nabout pregnancy. Karris just enjoyed her relative freedom from pain. It had\nbeen years since she’d had sex with anything more than her pillow. Not that\nshe wanted to think about that right now. In fact, she thought if she even\nsaw a man she’d tear his eyes out.\nIt was for men that women suffered this. As the old saw said, a woman"

Chronologically confused, but true\nenough.\nThey brought her the dress in the morning.\nIt wasn’t the kind of clothing one would expect to be asked to wear for\none’s execution. It wasn’t an exact copy of the dress she’d worn when she’d\nfinally given in to her father’s demands and joined Gavin at the head of his\narmies when they’d reclaimed Ru, but it was close. For one thing, it was\nblack silk rather than green. King Garadul’s tailor had obviously been\nworking either from memory or a painting of the day or they had simply\ndecided to alter the dress for the changes of sixteen years of fashion.\nThe fit would be perfect, of course.\nKarris stared at the dress with loathing all day, as cramps wracked her\nguts, as the inevitable diarrhea came, as she nearly passed out a couple of\ntimes. That dress symbolized more than giving in to Rask Garadul’s\nchildish fantasy. That dress was Karris’s youth. It was the girl she’d been. It\nwas femininity, softness, yielding. The desperate grubbing for people’s\neyes, for the jealousy of the other girls, for the envy of older women, for the\nattention of men. Karris had been weak and petty and stupid, hopelessly\ndependent.\nThey would force her to wear the dress, of course. She could wear it\nnow, or be beaten until she gave in and wore it. Of course, she could tear it\nto shreds. While satisfying, that would only delay the inevitable. Besides,\nthey weren’t going to let her out of here without the dress. She was certain\nof that much. What she didn’t know was if they would let her out even with\nthe dress. Still, it was a better chance than nothing. And how was she going\nto kill Rask Garadul from in here?\nShe put on the dress.\nShe wanted to hate it. She wanted to hate it with a passion. But she\nhadn’t worn anything that fit her so well in years. Her Blackguard garb, of\ncourse, fit like a glove, but those were work clothes. This, the whisper of\nfine silk on skin, was altogether different. It fit like a sheath. If it hadn’t\nbeen so perfectly tailored, she wouldn’t have been able to breathe, much\nless move. The dress was curve-hugging around her hips and stomach, and\nthe more generous scalloped neckline drew attention to both the liquid\ndazzle of folds of fine silk and to her cleavage. Surely her old dress hadn’t\nbeen so low-cut in the back, the few thin interlaced ties only emphasizing\nher back’s essential nakedness. Looking down at her chest—there was no\nmirror in the room—she hoped she didn’t get cold. If she did, everyone was\ngoing to know it.\nHad her dress been unlined when she was that stupid sixteen-year-old?\nHad she not even noticed? She honestly couldn’t remember.

She’d felt like the goddess Atirat standing\nnext to Gavin in it, long hair caught up in a diamond-and-emerald-encrusted\ntiara, people practically worshipping them. She’d convinced herself that she\ncould love Gavin. At first, before the Luxlords’ Ball, she’d felt more\nattraction toward him than toward Dazen. Surely she could blow that coal\nback to flame.\nDazen had been perpetually in his elder brother’s shadow, and he\nseemed content with it. Gavin had been so confident, so masterful. She’d\nbeen drawn to him irresistibly, as everyone was. But after that night at the\nLuxlords’ Ball, everything had changed. After she got to know Dazen,\nsuddenly there hadn’t seemed to be much depth to Gavin. Dazen had never\nunderstood his own strength. He had worshipped Gavin, projected all his\nown virtues onto his older brother, been blind to his faults and exaggerated\nhis qualities. Gavin had fed on all the adoration and grown fat on it.\nBut Gavin was still gorgeous, stylish, commanding, and admired. To\nthe sixteen-year-old Karris, other people’s regard had been very important.\nShe’d always wanted to please her father, her mother, Koios and her other\nbrothers, her magisters, everyone. Gavin was everything good. He was the\nPrism, his brother by that point a disgraced runaway and a murderer. Karris\nremembered convincing herself she could be content with the Prism.\nContent—with the most admired, feared, desired man in the Seven\nSatrapies. Besides, after what Dazen had done, she had to marry Gavin or\nwhat was left of her family would be ruined.\nOn the platform announcing their betrothal, Karris had thought she\nreally was going to be happy. She had admired her fiancé. Gavin always cut\na fine figure. She had enjoyed every minute of the attention.\nAt dinner that night, Gavin had made a jest to her father about taking\nKarris back to his rooms and not sleeping a wink. Karris’s father, ordinarily\nso traditional, the man who’d always sworn his daughter wouldn’t give milk\nuntil some young satrap bought the whole cow, the man who had beaten\nKarris for giving her virginity to Dazen, that man, that hypocrite, that\ncoward, had chuckled nervously. Until that moment, Karris had been able to\nstave off her rising panic. At least I won’t have to sleep with him until we’re\nmarried, she’d thought. I’ll be able to fall in love with him in the coming\nmonths. I’ll forget Dazen. I’ll forget my shivers when he kissed the back of\nmy neck. I’ll forget that swelling in my chest I felt every time he gave that\nreckless grin. Everyone else is right, Dazen isn’t half the man Gavin is. I\ncan’t love Dazen after what he did.\nBut there had been no escape. Karris had chosen her own kind of\ncowardice and gotten roaring drunk. Her father had noticed too late—or just\nin time, depending on how you looked at it—and forbade the servants from\ngiving her more wine before she could pass out at the table. She couldn’t"

With Gavin, she was filled with such unutterable despair it\nchoked her cries in her own throat. She couldn’t remember if she even\nprotested, if she’d asked him to stop. She’d wanted to, but her memory was\nfogged. She didn’t think she had. She’d kept thinking of her father saying,\n“Our family needs this. Without this marriage, we’re ruined.” And she\nhadn’t fought.\nShe remembered crying, though, during. A gentleman would have\nstopped, but Gavin had been drunk and young and horny. There was no\ngentleness in him. When she wasn’t ready and he was hurting her, he’d\nignored her protests and thrust with a young man’s need.\nFar from keeping her awake all night as he’d bragged, he’d soon\nfinished. Then he’d told her to leave. The casual cruelty of it had taken her\nbreath away. And she’d taken it. She should have clawed his eyes out.\nHe hadn’t wanted Karris. He’d wanted to show that Dazen couldn’t\nhave what rightfully belonged to him. Karris might as well have been a tree\nfor him to piss on after the last dog, reclaiming his territory.\nShe’d stumbled through the halls in that beautiful dress with half its\nbuttons undone—the damned thing required the help of servants to button.\nShe’d been seen, of course. Somehow she got home, not their home on Big\nJasper that had burned to the ground, but to their apartments nearby. Her\nfather had been waiting up, but he didn’t say a word, just stared at her. Her\nroom slave had undressed her with trembling fingers, and when Karris had\nfinally fallen in bed, the doorway of her room was darkened with her\nfather’s silhouette. He wobbled, leaned against the doorframe.\n“I could challenge him to a duel,” he said. “But he’d kill me, Karris,\nand then you’d be ruined. Hopeless. We’d lose everything our fathers have\nfought for for fifty generations. Maybe tomorrow will look better.”\nShe’d been winesick for two days, and when she’d emerged, Gavin\nhad kissed her in public, seated her at his right hand, and treated her like a\nqueen.

Or like it had been\nbeautiful.\nLater she’d decided it was because everyone had been talking about\nthe two of them as such a perfect couple, of how beautiful she was, and\nGavin had decided she suited his image. So instead of casting her aside,\nhe’d decided to go through with the marriage. But then he’d left and soon\nafter fought the final battle at Sundered Rock.\nWhen he came back, he seemed like a different man. He treated her\nwith a genuine warmth, respect, so unlike the man who’d banished her from\nhis bedchamber after he took his pleasure of her. It made Karris doubt that\nthe night had happened at all. She could have convinced herself that it had\nall been a nightmare—until she found out she was pregnant. The very day\nshe’d become aware of it, before she could tell him, Gavin had broken their\nbetrothal.\nShe’d been sixteen, pregnant, and without any prospect of marriage. In\nother words, her father’s perfect nightmare. As soon as she was certain she\nwasn’t going to miscarry, she’d told her father. He demanded she see the\nchirurgeons and get it taken care of.\nFor the first time in her life, she’d refused her father. To hell with him.\nHe moved to strike her. She pulled out a pistol. She told him she’d hollow\nout his skull if he dared to strike her. She told him he was a coward. She\nwas going to bear Gavin’s bastard and let the world know it was his. To hell\nwith him, and to hell with her father, and to hell with everyone. Bearing that\nchild would be her first free act, and her revenge.\nHer father had gotten down on his knees and begged. Literally begged.\nPlease save our family, we can’t be the ones who let down all the\ngenerations of White Oaks who sacrificed everything to get us here. We and\nus, he said. He meant, I and me. He was the one who had destroyed the\nfamily and he knew it. He looked so small and weak, cold sweat gleaming\noff his balding head. Abruptly, she despised him. He’d been the absolute\nlord over her, and he was disgusting. She refused his pleas, and she felt\npleasure at the sick, slack despair in his eyes.\nTwo days later, her father kissed the double barrels of a pistol and blew\nout his own brains. His ledger books were all in order. That was how he’d\nspent those two days. All the family properties had been sold to pay off\ntheir debts, leaving Karris enough to live on quietly for the rest of her life,\nenough to support her illegitimate child. Her father had taken care of\neverything. His suicide note had simply explained where the remaining\nmonies were and told Karris where to go if she wanted to bear her child in\nsecret. It didn’t beg her to do so. Indeed, there was no emotion in the note\nwhatsoever. No curses, no forgiveness, no regrets. It was as empty as his\nskull after the musket balls passed through them. Just gore and black\npowder residue. Ordure and death. Hollow, messy.\nShe couldn’t stand to stay on the Jaspers, couldn’t endure the pity and\nthe awkward glances.

She’d borne the child and given it up immediately, not\neven hugging it, asking not even to know its gender, and learning only\nthrough her hosts’ indiscretion that it was a boy. The family adopting\nGavin’s get lived nearby, and Karris couldn’t bear to stay, so she’d gone\nback to the Chromeria. She’d lost the baby weight in short order, and her\nyoung skin barely even showed any stretch marks. It was like nothing had\nhappened, except for the memories clinging to her like hellstone eating her\nsoul.\nFitting that my new dress is black then, huh? A little piece of midnight,\nlike what’s inside me.\nThought you left the melodrama behind, Karris.\nGo bend over a fence.\nI think that’s what the king is hoping for.\nThat’ll be a treat for both of us. Hope he enjoys blood.\nSo, what? I’m supposed to be thankful that I’m flowing now? Not\nmuch chance—\nA cramp wracked her in midthought. Karris hunched. Not much\nthankfulness here.\nWhile she was hunched over, a slip of paper was pushed under the\ndoor. Karris picked it up. It was no bigger than her finger.\n“Orders: assas. KG. Dark. Can’t help.” There was an old Dayric rune\nat the bottom. It was the agreed symbol to show it was from the agent\nKarris had been sent to meet. Not well drawn, but correct.\nIt wasn’t much of a code, but they’d never figured Karris would need a\ncode. She was supposed to have met the agent in person. He was to identify\nhimself by idly tracing part of the rune on any surface: a table, dirt,\nwhatever. Karris’s orders were to assassinate King Garadul. Secretly. And\nher contact wouldn’t be able to help her.\nPerfect. Karris couldn’t even burn the note, and though small, it was\ngrimy. She popped it into her mouth with a grimace and swallowed it.\nHer contact wouldn’t be able to help her. Damn it, Karris, you’ve been\nthinking so much about the past, you haven’t thought about the present. In\none moment, Corvan had understood that someone must want Karris dead.\nOf all the White’s agents, Karris had to be the worst person to send here.\nEither the White wanted Karris dead, or…\nThere was no other possibility. Or she hoped I’d be kidnapped and\nmaybe raped? Ludicrous.\nShe knew she frustrated the White at times, but she’d thought the\nstubborn old woman liked her. Then again, the White always played a deep\ngame. Maybe she thought she could use Karris’s death to accomplish\nsomething else.\nKarris felt sick to her stomach. It was possible. She wouldn’t have\nthought it before, but she’d sworn to give her life for the White if necessary.\nMaybe the White had decided it was necessary.\nThere was a knock at her door.

This time, however, several women bearing tins\nof powders and glosses came in. With the efficiency of professionals, they\nmade up Karris, fixed her hair, and applied perfume. But they didn’t apply\nany powder to her eyes or lashes.\nAnd soon enough, Karris found out why as one of the slaves took out\nviolet eye caps. Blind them, they’d thought of everything.\n“If you tear these off, you’ll certainly rip your skin,” one of the slave\nwomen said. “And possibly tear off your entire eyelid. If you leave them\nalone, the king may give you greater freedom, and it won’t hurt your eyes.\nIn a few days, they will loosen and come off by themselves.”\n“At which point you’ll reglue them,” Karris said.\n“Yes.”\n“What if I get something in my eye?” It would be impossible to get it\nout.\n“Try not to.”\nThey tried the fit over her eye sockets. The caps weren’t a perfect fit.\nThe slave woman, eastern Atashian from her features, scowled. “To make\nthe caps fit, we’re going to have to use extra glue. Extra glue means if you\nblink, your eyelashes will get stuck. King Garadul wants you for your\nbeauty, so I don’t want to cut off your eyelashes if I can help it. But once we\nset the caps on your face, they’ll be there for days. You really don’t want\nyour eyelashes globbed with glue—or stuck in it. So, do you want to be\nblind, irritated, or lashless?”\n“Lashless, and to hell with Rask,” Karris said.\nThe slave pursed her lips. “You’re right. The king might be annoyed.\nWe’ll have to take our chances. Blink right now as much as you can,\nbecause you’re going to have to not blink for as long as possible.” With\ngreat care and globs of glue, they put the eye caps on. The glue globs took\ncare of the gaps left in the fit.\nKarris barely dared breathe, holding as still as possible, forcing herself\nnot to blink. When she finally broke down and had to blink, her lashes\ncaught for a moment in the drying glue, but pulled free.\n“Oh, and try not to cry,” the slave said. “Or you’ll be up to your\neyeballs in tears. Literally.” She smiled unpleasantly.\nHilarious.\nThey put more makeup around her eyes after the glue was fully dried.\nThen, bracketed by drafters and Mirrormen, Karris was whisked\nthrough camp. The sun had set perhaps an hour before, and Karris\nwelcomed the fresh, dry air. Over the smell of her own perfume, she was\nfinally able to smell horses, men, campfires, butchered raw meat, cooking\nmeat, sagebrush, oil. Oil? She looked around and saw a supply wagon\nnearby. Oh, oiled swords and gunmetal.\nWith the number of wagons surrounding her own, Karris couldn’t see\nenough of the army to get a good idea of how many men were marching on\nGarriston. Even the number of wagons didn’t help her. She didn’t know"

She didn’t know\nhow heavily or lightly packed they were, and even if she did, the last time\nshe’d traveled with an army, she hadn’t paid any attention to such things.\nYoung, pampered, terrified, and stupid, it hadn’t occurred to her that such\nsimple things might be useful to her someday.\nThere were a large number of women diffused throughout the army,\ncarrying fresh-cut wood for the fires, standing on the butcher’s wagon,\nshouting at men to make sure the skinned wild javelinas were dispersed\nfairly, tending the minor injuries inevitable in moving thousands, taking in\nweapons and armor that needed repair for the blacksmiths, rejecting those\nthat they deemed reparable by the men trying to get someone else to do it.\nMost of the women seemed to be in service roles, however, which either\nmeant that King Garadul didn’t think much of women or that most were\nnew recruits. From the wide variety of their dress, Karris guessed they came\nfrom all over the social spectrum. That meant they were newer recruits, and\nwilling ones. These people weren’t all servants he’d brought from Kelfing;\nthey were locals. King Garadul had significant support from the Tyrean\npeople.\nFrom the glimpses out into the growing darkness punctuated by fires\nscattered randomly as stars, it seemed the army sprawled wherever it willed,\nbut Karris was brought quickly to an area where perhaps fifty wagons were\ncircled, leaving only a few avenues between them at the points of the\ncompass where horses would be able to pass, each guarded by ten\nMirrormen with matchlocks. In the middle there was an open space for\ndefense, small falconets pointed out everywhere like a porcupine ready to\nfire its quills, and then a number of large striped pavilions of every color.\nA cramp caught Karris as she was ushered to the central pavilion. She\nhunched, breath taken away. She squeezed her eyes tight shut, and the luxin\ncaps cut into her brows and cheeks painfully. She smoothed her expression\nand waited until the fury of the cramp passed. She took a slow breath,\nmastering the pain. Then she gestured to one of her guards, as if she were a\nqueen and ready to enter now, thank you.\nThe man pulled back the pavilion’s flap, and Karris entered.\nIt must have been some dress. Because as soon as Karris stepped\ninside, conversation ceased.\nThere were perhaps seventy people in the pavilion: slaves, tumblers,\njugglers, and musicians surrounding perhaps thirty noblemen and -women\nseated on cushions around a lower table piled high with delicacies and\nwine. Everyone was colorfully dressed, so much so that Karris could tell\neven through the muting of her dark eye caps. King Rask Garadul sat at the\nhead of the table, of course, rings sparkling from fingers wrapped around a\nwine goblet. He had stopped, midsentence, and was staring at her,\nopenmouthed.\nBut Karris barely even saw the king, because at his right hand sat a\nman like none she’d ever seen.

She forced herself to continue walking\ntoward the king, hips rolling, skirt swishing, head up, shoulders loose, as if\nshe weren’t unnerved.\nThe man was a Tainted, a color wight. Karris had only ever seen one,\nand that one had been in the early stages of his madness. This man wasn’t in\nthe early stages, but neither did he appear mad. He wore a simple luxiat’s\nrobe, but it was dazzling white rather than the customary black of\nOrholam’s luxiants, that color an admission that they needed Orholam’s\nlight most of all. Nor did his face bear any trace of a luxiant’s humility.\nBut at least his face was mostly human—skin and bone and blood.\nThreads of green luxin lay submerged beneath burn-scarred skin like faded\ntattoos, rising close to the surface at his cheekbones and brow. At his neck,\nhis body changed. The skin was pure luxin of every color of the rainbow.\nThe inside of his elbow, visible as he raised his wine goblet in a mocking\nsalute to Karris, was flexible green luxin, as were his other joints and his\nneck. Blue luxin plates sat on every surface that didn’t need to move. It\nmade plate armor on his forearms, formed gauntlets from his very hands,\nhis knuckles spiked, his shoulders unnaturally broad under that\nblasphemous luxiant’s robe, the V of his chest visible through the robe\nshimmering with reflected light like the sea at sunrise. Not plates of blue\nluxin, then, but actually woven blue luxin, which tripled its strength and\nmade it much less likely to shatter, if one had the skill and patience to make\nit.\nEverywhere, yellow luxin flowed between or beneath the other colors,\nconstantly renewing whatever was lost to sunlight or natural breakdown.\nWhere plates came together, lubricative orange luxin made them slide\nsmoothly past each other. Red luxin formed archaic designs of runes and\netchings of eight-pointed stars in thin layers on top of the blue plates. Karris\ncouldn’t see if he had incorporated superviolet into his skin, but was certain\nhe had. After all, in the middle of each palm he’d embedded a flame crystal.\nFlame crystals, the physical, sealed manifestation of sub-red, usually only\nlasted a few seconds. Exposure to air made them burst and flame out.\nThis monster had somehow sunk one into each hand and sealed it from\nthe air with blue luxin so that you could literally see through each of his\nhands, albeit as though through a mirage, the image wavering from the heat,\nwhich was the signature of a flame crystal. And yet he still retained the use\nof his fingers, meaning he was either a miracle-working healer or it was\nsome illusion. It had to be. The whole thing was impossible.\nKarris saw his eyes last, as she came to stand before King Garadul.\nThe Tainted’s eyes were shattered. The halo was broken everywhere. Colors\nleaked everywhere from the iris, staining the white of his eyes with every\ncolor.

A sight for sore eyes.”\n“And you’re a sore sight for eyes,” she replied, smiling sweetly.\nHe laughed. “Not only more beautiful than you were as a girl, but\nsharper, too. Karris, join us. I have a gift for you, but first, I’d like you to\nmeet my right hand.” He gestured to the Tainted. “Karris White Oak, meet\nthe Crystal Prophet, the Polychrome Master, Lord Omnichrome, the Color\nPrince, the Eldritch Enlightened.”\n“Long name,” Karris said. “Must take your mother forever to call you\nto dinner.”\n“You can pick your favorite,” the Color Prince said. His voice was\ndisconcertingly… human. Strong, confident, amused if husky like a\nlongtime haze smoker’s.\n“The Motley Fool then.”\nRed snapped to the surface of his eyes, quickly replaced by cool,\namused blue. “Now, Karris, is that the way your father taught you to speak?\nYou used to be so concerned with pleasing him. So ladylike, so sweet. So\ntame for a green drafter.”\n“That ended a long time ago,” she said. “Who the hell are you? You\ndon’t know me.”\n“Oh, but I do,” the Color Prince said. He glanced over at the king.\n“Oh, sure, go ahead, let her open her present early,” Rask Garadul said,\npretending exasperation.\n“Look at me, Karris,” the Crystal Prophet said. “Take a moment. See\nbeyond your fear, your petty disgust, your ignorance.”\nKarris bit her tongue. There was something genuine in that raspy\nvoice, some wish to be known. So she looked, silently. The body, of course,\nwas no help, so she studied his face. The luxin-stained skin obscured the\nfeatures, as did the burn scars. One eyebrow had grown back in white,\nwhether reacting to fire or luxin, she didn’t know. But there was something\nfamiliar.\nOrholam. The fire. The burn scars. A fist clamped tight around her\nheart and squeezed. She couldn’t draw a breath. It couldn’t be him, he was\ndead these sixteen years. But as soon as she saw it, she knew it could be no\nother. “Koios,” Karris said. So this was why the White had sent her. Her\nenemy was her brother. Her knees gave out and she sat heavily on the\ncushions next to the king, lest she suffer a very ladylike fainting spell.\nChapter 68\nGavin stopped drafting as the sun sank below the horizon. He could use the\nambient reflected light if he wished, but he was already exhausted. He\nlooked over the scrub brush plain to the south. Karris was out there,\nsomewhere. In all likelihood, he would never see her again, never get the\nchance to tell her the truth. It saddened him more than he would have\nimagined possible.\nHe turned back and studied the day’s handiwork with disappointment."

It saddened him more than he would have\nimagined possible.\nHe turned back and studied the day’s handiwork with disappointment.\nHe’d hoped to erect half a league of wall today, at the least. Instead, he’d\nlaid nothing more than foundation, albeit a full league of it. Surprisingly\nenough, it had been Aliviana Danavis who’d solved the hardest problem so\nfar. Or maybe not surprisingly, given how smart her father was. Gavin had\nbeen walking along the trench the workers were digging, spraying yellow\ninto it. Where there was existing wall, he’d let the yellow flow over it like\nwater, sinking into every crack, reinforcing stone and mortar with magic.\nWhere even the old wall’s foundation was gone, he drafted the yellow into\nsolid luxin directly, giving the wall a foundation seven paces wide.\nEverywhere, he anchored the yellow to bedrock with a half-evaporated,\ntarry thick red luxin.\nBut not only was walking slow, but as soon as the luxin reached the\nlevel of the ground, Gavin had to throw it. Like every other color, yellow\nhad mass. It weighed about as much as water, and with the amounts that\nGavin was moving, he was getting crushed. His muscles would give out far\nbefore his drafting ability. Of course, it would only get worse as the wall\ngot taller.\nHe’d begun using scaffolding, but within half an hour it was clear that\nthat wouldn’t get the wall finished in a month, much less the five days he\nhad.\nThat was when Liv had sketched out her idea, and like most great\nideas, it seemed simple, obvious—after she said it.\nGavin laid two tracks on either side of the wall, and drafted arms to\nconnect them. With the addition of wheels and a harness to hold him, he\nwas able to hang suspended in the air over the wall. The wheels glided\nalong the tracks, so instead of having to move a scaffolding every twenty\npaces, his scaffolding moved with him. Instead of throwing luxin, he could\ndrop it. It took almost all the physical effort out of the project.\nBy the time he’d properly drafted the harness so that he wasn’t\nswinging crazily every time he threw more luxin, it was late afternoon.\nGavin had rolled slowly along his tracks, sealing the yellow luxin at twenty-\npace intervals and laying more yellow over the sealed points. With the\namount of time left before sunset, he’d focused on the brute drafting, so\nrather than tackle the intellectual challenges of drafting the interior of the\nwall, he’d decided to draft as much foundation as he could.\nHe made huge progress, but it was still hard to say whether he was\ngoing to finish the whole project in time. If he finished an entire tall,\nimpregnable wall by the time Rask Garadul’s army arrived, except for two\nhundred paces in the middle, the entire endeavor would be vanity.\nGavin lowered himself to the ground. He wobbled a little as he\napproached Corvan Danavis, who was holding their horses. Corvan looked\nconcerned. “Just a long time off my feet,” Gavin said.\nCorvan accepted that silently. A few blocks later as the sun was fading\nout of the sky, he said, “So… Karris was captured.”"

I always thought she was the biggest threat to your plan.\nEnough reasons to hate both of you, and rash enough to tear it all down\nwithout thinking. So you’ll antagonize Rask and hope he kills her to show\nhe’s serious?”\n“Damn you,” Gavin said.\n“Oh, not past it, then?” Corvan asked.\nHe wasn’t serious about getting Karris killed. Gavin knew that. Corvan\nmight always understand the cutthroat thing to do, but that didn’t mean he\nalways did it.\n“So she still doesn’t know?”\n“No. That’s why I broke our betrothal.”\n“Because she was the mostly likely to see through you, or some other\nreason?” Corvan asked.\n“We destroyed her. Dazen burned down her home and the war took the\nrest. I didn’t realize she had nothing—and I should have. By the time I\noffered to restore her family’s fortune, it seemed like an insult. She spat on\nme and disappeared for a year. When she came back, she was different.”\n“I noticed. A Blackguard. An astounding achievement. But you didn’t\nanswer my question.”\nThough it was getting darker, the streets were comfortably warm, and\nif anything, the crowds were getting thicker, people lighting lamps outside\ntheir own homes or shops. Others were relaxing, drinking on the flat roofs\nof their houses. It was almost as if doom weren’t impending.\nGavin looked around and made sure his voice was low enough not to\ncarry. “I’ve lied to everyone. I’ve lied so much sometimes I forget who I\nwas. With everything my brother and I did to Karris… I couldn’t—well,\nshit, she’s seen us both naked, hasn’t she? If anyone would know, she\nwould. It would be the quickest way to destroy everything.”\n“True enough, but you were going to say something else,” Corvan\nsaid, looking down at his saddle, giving Gavin that shred of privacy.\n“I thought about it, you know? How to marry her and still deceive her.\nOr, failing that, how to show her that she had no choice but to keep my\nsecret. In the end, she was the one thing I wasn’t willing to defile. After I\nran away, she fell in love with my brother. If she figured out the truth and\ndecided to destroy me…” Gavin shrugged.\nNow Corvan did look him in the eye. “I don’t know whether to admire\nyou all the more, or to be horrified that you’d be so stupid.”\n“I usually opt to admire me all the more,” Gavin said, grinning.\nCorvan gave a grudging smile, but didn’t laugh.\nThey rode through the streets as quickly as they could without\ncrushing anyone, and arrived at the Travertine Palace as darkness set in.\nIronfist was standing at the gate. Uncharacteristically, he had a huge grin on\nhis face.\n“High Lord Prism,” he said. “Dinner awaits.”"

If Ironfist was grinning, it meant something awkward,\nunpleasant, or vexing was coming. But he wasn’t going to ask. With that\ngrin, Ironfist would just grin bigger and enjoy being mysterious. Fine.\nGavin started walking toward the private dining hall.\n“High Lord,” Ironfist interjected. “The great hall.”\nIt was only a few steps away. Gavin barely had time to think why they\nmight possibly need the great hall for dinner before he was inside the\nantechamber to the great domed hall.\nThe great hall of the Travertine Palace, though perhaps only a third the\nsize of the Chromeria’s great hall, was one of the wonders of the old world.\nThe doorways were enormous bulbous horseshoe arches, striped green and\nwhite, speaking of the days when half of Tyrea had been a Parian province.\nTravertine and white marble alternated everywhere: in the chessboard\npattern of the floor, in intricate geometric shapes on the walls, and in old\nParian runes that decorated the bases of the eight great wooden pillars that\nsupported the ceiling, their layout an eight-pointed star. Each pillar was a\nfull five paces thick—atasifusta, the widest trees in the world—and none\nnarrowed perceptibly before reaching the ceiling. The wood was said to\nhave been the gift of an Atashian king, five hundred years before. Even then\nit had been precious. Now they were extinct, the last grove cut down during\nthe Prisms’ War. Gavin had never found out who had done that. When he\narrived in Ru, the grove was simply gone. His commanders—Dazen’s\ncommanders—had sworn the last trees were standing when they left the\ncity. Gavin’s commanders after the war had sworn the trees were gone when\nthey arrived.\nWhat made the atasifusta unique was that its sap had properties like\nconcentrated red luxin. The trees took a hundred years to reach full size—\nthese giants had been several hundreds of years old when they’d been cut.\nBut after they reached maturity, holes could be drilled in the trunk, and if\nthe tree was large enough, the sap would drain slowly enough to feed\nflames. These eight giants each bore a hundred twenty-seven holes, the\nnumber apparently significant once, but that significance lost. On first look,\nit appeared that the trees were aflame, but the flame was constant and never\nconsumed the wood, which was ghostly ivory white aside from the\nblackened soot smudges above each flame hole. Gavin knew that the flames\ncouldn’t be truly eternal, but after allegedly burning day and night for five\nhundred years, these atasifustas’ flames gave little indication of going out\nanytime soon. Perhaps the flames nearer the top were a little duller than\nthose lower as the sap settled in the wood, but Gavin wouldn’t have bet on\nit.\nWhen the wood wasn’t mature, it made incredible firewood. A bundle\nthat a man could carry in his arms would warm a small hut all winter. No\nwonder it was extinct.\nNo torches were necessary in the great hall, of course, but outside the"

No\nwonder it was extinct.\nNo torches were necessary in the great hall, of course, but outside the\nstained glass windows, each also a horseshoe arch, torches burned so that\nthe colored glass would glow day or night, white or green or red.\nAgain, the colors, the shape itself, all were meaningful to the people\nwho’d built this wonder, and Gavin had no idea what any of it meant. It\ngave him a sense of insignificance. He didn’t think anything he made would\nsurvive five hundred years after he was gone. Indeed, it was mostly luck\nthat his brother Gavin hadn’t razed this very wonder when he’d destroyed\nthis city.\nAs Gavin walked in, his eyes were pulled from the majesty of those\natasifusta pillars to the men and women seated at the great table, every face\nturned toward him. He was distracted briefly as he stepped past twin\nshadows flanking the halls. His head snapped to the side, expecting an\nassassin. No, it was a Blackguard. One on either side of the doorway, and\ndozens more around the hall, all of them familiar to him. Blackguards?\nHere?\nOh, the ships of those to be Freed have come. Ironfist must have\ncommanded all these Blackguards to come along.\nHis eyes returned to the table. There were at least two hundred drafters\nwaiting for him. A small class, as the White had told him. What she hadn’t\ntold him was who was in this class. Gavin knew all of them by face, and\nmost of them by name. He recognized Izem Red and Izem Blue, Samila\nSayeh, Maros Orlos, the discontiguous bichrome Usef Tep whom they\ncalled the Purple Bear, Deedee Falling Leaf, the Parian sisters Tala and\nTayri, Javid Arash, Talon Gim, Eleleph Corzin, Bas the Simple, Dalos\nTemnos the Younger, Usem the Wild, Evi Grass, Flamehands, and Odess\nCarvingen. Everywhere he looked, heroes from the Prisms’ War, from both\nsides. These were some of the most talented drafters in the Seven Satrapies,\nand they represented every single one of the Seven Satrapies too, even the\nIlytians were represented, albeit only by Flamehands, and Eleleph Corzin\nwas Abornean.\nGavin stopped in his tracks, disbelieving. Every year, some drafters\nfrom the war were Freed, but Gavin hadn’t had this many of the greats since\nimmediately after it, when so many had been pushed to the brink by the\namount of power they’d handled in fighting.\nThese drafters had all been young during the war, and Gavin had\nknown and dreaded that they’d start passing, but so many, all in one year?\n“We had us a pact,” Usem the Wild said, answering Gavin’s obvious\nconfusion. “Some of us who fought together. Said once the first of us had to\ngo, we’d all go together. Wanted another year or two, myself, but better to\ngo out on top, isn’t it?”\n“Better to go out sane,” the Purple Bear growled.\n“Better to go together,” Samila Sayeh said. “And stop making Deedee"

Her\nskin was tinged a permanent green, and the halo of her eyes was straining\nunder the green that had overwhelmed her formerly blue irises. She smiled\nweakly. “Lord Prism, it’s an honor. I’ve been looking forward to this\nFreeing for a long time.” She curtsied, choosing to ignore, as most of the\nold warriors did, that she had been on the other side of the war than Gavin.\nThe rest of them followed her example, bowing or curtseying in the\nformal style of their homelands. Gavin bowed formally, meeting their eyes,\ncareful that he too gave equal respect to drafters from each side.\nInside, as it always did, his heart broke. He wanted to tell those who’d\nfought beside him that it was him, that he wasn’t Gavin, that it had all been\nfor the best. Instead, he sat with them, finding himself next to the irascible\nUsem the Wild as the slaves brought out steaming platters of food and cool\nflagons of citrus juices and wine.\n“When I told some of the others”—Usem nodded grudgingly over at\nthe Izems and Samila, who’d fought for Gavin—“they thought it would be a\ngood year for them too.”\n“We wished, Lord Prism, to perhaps help the Seven Satrapies put\nthe… war behind us,” Samila Sayeh said, diplomatically stopping herself\nfrom calling it the False Prism’s War. “We’ve actually become good\nfriends.”\n“Personally,” Maros Orlos, the shortest Ruthgari Gavin had ever seen,\nsaid, “I’m glad to have a Freeing without all the trappings. The fireworks\nand speeches and posturing by satraps and satrapahs and upstart lordlings\nwho won’t ever have to fulfill the Pact themselves. A Freeing’s holy. It\nought to be between a man, the Prism, and Orholam. The rest is\ndistractions.”\n“Distractions? Like dinner with the Prism and your Freeing class?”\nIzem Red asked. He was Parian, lean as a whip and with a wit to match. He\nstill wore his ghotra folded so it resembled a cobra’s hood, a style he’d\npicked up as a seventeen-year-old drafter, and endured incessant teasing for\nit. He’d been called a poser until the first battle when his lightning-like\nstrikes, fireballs as fast as an arrow, and decimation of the enemy’s ranks\nhad silenced all teasing once and for all.\nMaros opened his mouth to protest, realized he was about to spar with\nIzem Red, and turned his attention back to his food.\nTala, an older Parian woman with short white hair and red halos\ncompressing brown irises, said, “You know, High Lord Prism, Commander\nIronfist told us you have a little project you’re working on.

        "text": "that reminds me of that old poem about the Wanderer. How does it go, some\nwork…?”\nIt was a famous poem; they all knew it. She didn’t even need to say the\nwhole thing. She was offering their help on Gavin’s wall. “That would be\nwonderful—” Gavin began.\nBas the Simple, the odd Tyrean polychrome, interrupted, his head\ncocked to the side. “ ‘Some work of noble note may yet be done, not\nunbecoming men that strove with gods.’ Gevison, The Wanderer’s Last\nJourney, lines sixty-three and sixty-four.” He looked up, saw everyone\nlooking at him, and looked down shyly.\n“That would be marvelous,” Gavin said. “I understand if anyone has\nobjections and doesn’t wish to join me, but if you would like to… I’d really\nappreciate it.” It was a total gift, and one that wouldn’t cost most of them\nanything. Not all of these drafters were at the edge of death, most of them\nwere ridiculously powerful, and many were wonderfully subtle in their\nchromaturgy. Their help would make all the difference.\nOf course, these were also all the people who had known Gavin and\nDazen best. If anyone were likely to discover that Gavin was a fraud, he or\nshe was in this room. And with their Freeing looming, the discoverer would\nhave little or nothing to lose in exposing him.\nGavin’s chest tightened and he smiled over his fear, as if he were\nsmiling at how brilliant and strangely simple Bas was. Smiles returned to\nhim from every side of the table. Some of those smiles, Gavin knew, must\nsurely be serpents’ smiles, but he had no way of knowing which ones. Who\nwould be more likely to destroy him? Those who thought he was the man\nwho had been their friend and learned he had usurped Gavin’s place, or\nthose who’d fought for him and had believed him dead and now learned\nthat he’d betrayed them?\nBas the Simple was staring at Gavin, not smiling, his head cocked to\nthe side, oddly perceptive eyes studying everything.\nChapter 69\n“The boy’s gone,” Ironfist said. It was almost midnight. They were standing\non the roof of the Travertine Palace, looking over the bay. “Kip,” he said, as\nif there were some other boy. He didn’t say “your son,” though.\nGreat how everyone has to dance around my misdeeds. My misdeeds.\nRight. Thanks, brother. “Why wasn’t I told?” Gavin asked. He’d spent all\nnight pretending to be his brother with drafters who knew them both, and\nhaving to pretend to be enjoying himself. It was disconcerting. He’d\nenjoyed his old enemies’ company, and felt constantly like his vision was\nblurring. The men and women he’d hated when he’d been Dazen had been\nquite pleasant. A few of Dazen’s old friends, though not all, had had an edge\non all their interactions that made them unattractive. Gavin looked at men\nand women whom he had arranged to live and work far from the Jaspers\njust so they wouldn’t endanger him and thought, I ruined you and you never\neven knew it. And I missed you.\n“We just discovered it a few minutes ago. This note was sitting out."

This note was sitting out.\nThe other was tucked under the bedsheets.”\nSmart. Kip accomplished exactly what he was trying to do: he bought\nhimself time. Kept us from looking for him all day. Gavin extended his\nhand, knowing Ironfist would have the notes. Ironfist handed them over.\nThe important one read, “I’m Tyrean and young. More help as a spy\nthan here. No one will suspect me. Will try to find Karris.”\nA spy? Orholam strike me. “Any other news?” Gavin asked.\n“He took a horse and a stick of coins.”\n“So he could get himself into even more trouble than simply heading\ninto an enemy camp armed only with delusions,” Gavin said.\nIronfist didn’t respond. He generally ignored statements of the\nobvious. “The Danavis girl is gone as well. The stableman says she asked\nhim for a horse, but he turned her down. Sounds like she found the notes\nand went after him.”\nGavin stared out over the bay. The Guardian, the statue guarding the\nentrance of the bay, and through whose legs every sailor passed, held a\nspear in one hand and a torch in the other. The torch was kept by a yellow\ndrafter whose entire job was to keep it filled with liquid yellow. Special\ngrooves cut in the glass slowly exposed the yellow luxin to air and caused it\nto shimmer back into light. Mirrors collected and directed the light out into\nthe night, spinning slowly on gears driven by a windmill when there was\nwind and draft animals when there wasn’t. Tonight, the beam illuminated\nthe misty night air, cutting great swathes in the darkness. It was what every\ndrafter was supposed to do: bring Orholam’s light to the darkest corners of\nthe world.\nIt was what Kip was trying to do.\nIronfist said, “If he came into my camp and kept a low profile, I\nwouldn’t suspect him as a spy.”\nBecause he’d make a marvelously bad spy, perhaps? “About our spies,\nwhat have you learned?”\n“Governor Crassos very innocently came to inspect the docks, carrying\na very innocent-looking and strangely heavy bag. He looked awfully\npleased to see me,” Ironfist said.\n“You only get sarcastic when you’re mad,” Gavin said. “Go ahead. Let\nme have it.”\n“I swore to protect Kip, Lord Prism, but first, the spies—”\n“You can call me Gavin when I’ve been stupid,” Gavin said flatly.\n“The spies report—”\n“Out with it, for Orholam’s sake.”\nIronfist clenched his jaw, then willed himself to relax. “I need to go\nafter him, Gavin, which means I can’t be here, helping with the defense and\ndirecting my people.”\n“And you’re Parian and huge and pretty much the opposite of\ninconspicuous, so if you go after him—as your honor demands—you’ll\nmost likely be killed, which will not only mean that you’re killed, which\nyou don’t particularly desire, but it also means you will have failed to\nprotect Kip, which would be the only point of going after him in the first"

And you can’t delegate the mission to anyone else because you\npromised to protect him personally, and besides, any other Blackguard\nwould stand out nearly as much as you do.” It wasn’t that Blackguards were\ndarker-skinned than Tyreans and had kinky rather than wavy or straight\nhair. There had been enough mixing over the centuries that quite a few\nTyreans had both traits. Even Kip could still make a good spy despite his\nblue eyes; Tyreans were used to minority ethnicities from all the people\nwho’d stayed after the war. The problem was that ebony-skinned, extremely\nphysically fit drafters who exuded danger from their very pores were going\nto stand out anywhere. Blackguards would stand out among an army of\nParian drafters.\n“That’s pretty much it,” Ironfist admitted, the edge of his anger blunted\nby Gavin acknowledging exactly why he was angry.\n“What else did you learn from our spies?” Gavin asked, shunting aside\nIronfist’s concerns for the moment.\nIronfist seemed just as happy to not be talking about his dilemma.\n“Some of them have come from King Garadul’s camp, and I think our\nproblems are bigger than we realized.” He pushed his ghotra off his head,\nscrubbing his scalp with his fingertips. “It’s religious,” he said.\n“I didn’t think you were much for religion,” Gavin said, trying to inject\na bit of levity.\n“Why would you think that? I speak with Orholam constantly.”\n“ ‘Orholam, what did I do to deserve this?’ ” Gavin suggested, thinking\nhe was kidding.\n“No. Seriously,” Ironfist said.\n“Oh.” Ironfist, devout?\n“But you know how that is. You speak with him all the time as well.\nYou are his chosen.”\n“It’s different for me.” Very very different, apparently. “But sorry to\njest. Religion?”\n“This isn’t just some political matter of calling himself a king. Rask\nGaradul wants to upend everything we’ve accomplished since Lucidonius\ncame. Everything.”\nAn indefinable dread settled in Gavin’s stomach. “The old gods.”\n“The old gods,” Ironfist said.\n“Get Kip back, Commander. Do whatever you have to. If anyone\ncomplains about your methods, they’ll have to go through me. If you can,\nsave the girl too. I owe her father a debt I can never explain.”\nGavin slept little and fitfully. He never slept much, but it was always\nworse as the Freeing approached. He hated this time of year. Hated the\ncharade. His chest felt tight as he lay in his bed. Maybe he should have let\nhis brother win. Maybe Gavin would have done a better job of all of this. At\nthe very least, he wouldn’t be here now.\nNonsense.\nAnd yet he couldn’t help but wonder if Gavin would have been a better\nPrism than he was. Gavin had always borne burdens of responsibility better\nthan Dazen had. It didn’t even seem like a weight to his older brother. Like\nthe man had been without self-doubt. Dazen had always envied Gavin that."

Dazen had always envied Gavin that.\nThe morning came none too soon. Dazen sat up and put on his face,\nGavin once more. He felt that stab of pain radiating through his chest,\ntightening his throat. He couldn’t do this.\nNonsense. He was just missing Kip, and Karris, and was worried for\nCorvan’s daughter and dreading the exhausting drafting he was going to\nhave to do all day long. There was nothing to do but get on with it.\nAfter taking his time with his ablutions—why had Gavin had to be\nsuch a dandy?—he ate and rode to the wall. He was greeted by a young\norange drafter.\nThe drafter was one of the tragically young who couldn’t handle the\npower. An addict. He couldn’t have been twenty years old, mountain Parian,\nbut he didn’t wear the ghotra, instead wearing his hair in dreadlocks, bound\nback with a leather thong. The rest of his clothing spoke of similar rejection\nof traditional attire—any tradition. Oranges tended to see exactly how\nothers liked things to be. In most cases they used that to their advantage,\nbecoming as slick as their luxin. But in some cases they defied every\nconvention they saw, becoming artists and rebels. Given how the man’s\nclothes somehow worked together to look good despite their disparate\norigins, and that all the colors and textures complemented each other, Gavin\nguessed this one was an artist. This young man’s orange halo was thin with\nstrain, though. He definitely couldn’t have made it until the next Freeing.\n“Lord Prism,” the young man said. “How can I help?”\nThe sun had barely cleared the horizon, and all the drafters who were\ncapable of drafting without hurting themselves or losing control had\ngathered at the wall. The local workmen seemed stunned to be surrounded\nby so many of them.\n“What’s your name?” Gavin asked. He didn’t think he’d even seen this\nyoung man before.\n“Aheyyad.”\n“So you are an artist,” Gavin said.\nAheyyad smiled. “Not much choice, with the grandmother I had.”\nGavin tilted his head.\n“Sorry, I thought you knew. My grandmother is Tala. She knew I was\ngoing to be an orange and an artist by the time I was four years old. She\nforced my mother to rename me.”\n“Tala can be very, ahem, persuasive,” Gavin said.\nThe boy grinned.\nA boy going to the Freeing at the same time as his grandmother. There\nwas a tale of woe just under the surface there, a family’s grief, the loss of\ntwo generations at once, but no need to prod that now. All things are\nbrought to light in time. “I need an artist,” Gavin said. “Can you work\nfast?”\n“I’d better,” Aheyyad said.\n“Are you any good?” Gavin already knew that Aheyyad was or Corvan\nwouldn’t have sent him. He wanted to know whether the young man would\nbe bold or tentative when faced with something so vast.\n“I’m the best,” Aheyyad said. “What’s the project?”"

He wanted to know whether the young man would\nbe bold or tentative when faced with something so vast.\n“I’m the best,” Aheyyad said. “What’s the project?”\nGavin smiled. He loved artists. In small doses. “I’m building a wall.\nWork with the architect to make sure you don’t screw up anything\nfunctional, but your task is to make this wall scary. You can commandeer\nany of the old drafters to help you. I’ll give you some drawings we have of\nRathcaeson. If it can resemble those, do it. You’ll tell the blues how to hold\nthe forms. I’ll fill them with yellow luxin. I’m doing functional things first.\nWe can attach and integrate whatever you design in two or three days.”\n“How big can I make… whatever I make?”\n“We’ve got a couple leagues of wall.”\n“So you’re saying… big.”\n“Huge,” Gavin said. Having the artist only design the forms would\nalso keep the young man from having to draft anything at all, which with\nhow close Aheyyad was to breaking the halo would possibly save his life.\nIt took until noon before they were ready to start the drafting. Gavin\nhad asked all the old warriors to look at the plans of the wall, and not a few\nof them had come up with suggestions. Those suggestions had covered\neverything from expanding the latrines—and making sure the raw sewage\ncould be routed onto their enemies by emptying the pots suddenly through\nchutes out the front of the wall—to reworking the mounts for the cannons\nand adding furnaces to heat the shot at several of the stations. Heated shot\nwas wonderful for setting fire to siege engines. Someone else suggested\ntexturing the floors and providing gutters not only outside for rainwater,\nwhich had already been considered, but also within the wall itself for blood.\nMany good suggestions, and quite a few bad ones. The wall should be\nbigger, smaller, wider, taller. There should be space for more cannons, more\narchers, more beds in the hospital, the barracks should be within the wall,\nand so on.\nAt noon, Gavin was rigged back into his harness and lifted off the\nground. The others swarmed around him, drafting forms, steadying his\nharness. Then he set to work.\nChapter 70\nIt wasn’t until two days later, as Kip and Liv came within sight of King\nGaradul’s army, plopped over the plain and fouling the river like an\nenormous cow pie, that he realized how deeply, incredibly, brilliantly stupid\nhis plan was.\nI’m going to march in there and rescue Karris?\nMore like waddle in there.\nAt the top of a small hill, they sat on the horse, which seemed grateful\nfor the break, and scanned the mass of humanity before them. It was\nimmense. Kip had never tried to estimate a crowd, and never seen one this\nlarge.\n“What do you think, sixty or seventy thousand?” he asked Liv.\n“More than a hundred, I’d guess.”\n“How are we going to find Karris in that?” he asked. What did I\nexpect? A sign, perhaps? “Captured drafter here”?\nMost of the camp was chaotic, people pitching lean-tos against\nwagons, those who had tents screaming at each other over who got which"

A sign, perhaps? “Captured drafter here”?\nMost of the camp was chaotic, people pitching lean-tos against\nwagons, those who had tents screaming at each other over who got which\nspot, children running around, clogging the spaces between tents and\nwagons and livestock. The sky was still light, though the sun had gone\ndown, and campfires were being started all over the plain. Kip could hear\npeople singing nearby. Men were swimming and bathing in the river,\ndownstream of where some soldiers had hastily erected a corral. The\nanimals dirtied the water, but no one seemed to care. Other men stood on\nthe bank, urinating directly into the water. The color of the river upstream\nand downstream of the camp was distinctly different. People were carrying\nbuckets of water everywhere, taken directly from the river.\nMaybe I’ll only drink wine.\nMore importantly, the smell of meat cooking permeated the air.\nKip’s stomach complained. They’d gone through his food faster than\nhe’d thought—mostly, he had gone through it faster—and now he had\nnothing. Well, except for a stick of danars I stole with half a year’s wages\non it.\nOh. That.\n“We split up,” Liv said. “You head directly for the center of the camp.\nI imagine that’s where the king will have his tents. She’s important, so they\nmight be keeping her close. I’ll go look for where the drafters are camping.\nA captured drafter will probably be watched by other drafters. She’s got to\nbe in one place or the other. We’ll meet back here in, say, three hours?”\nKip nodded his acquiescence, impressed. He would have been lost on\nhis own.\nAnd almost instantly, she slipped off the horse and was gone. No\nhesitation, no second-guessing. Kip watched her go. He was hungry.\nLeading the big, docile horse, tugging and pulling the beast as it tried\nto munch grass to the right and left, Kip approached at one of the larger\nfires. Not one but two javelinas were roasting on spits over the fire, and as\nKip stared, swallowing, one of the fattest women he had ever seen sawed\noff a fully cooked leg with a few deft strokes at the joint. The smell was\nrich, succulent, savory, mouthwatering, lovely, astounding, mesmerizing,\ndebilitating. Kip couldn’t move—until he saw her raise the meat to her lips.\n“Pardon me!” he said, louder than he meant. Others around the fire\nlooked up.\n“Didn’t smell it,” the fat lady said, then she sank her teeth into greasy\nham. Kip died a little. Then more as the hard men and women around the\nfire laughed at him. The fat woman, leg in one hand, long knife in the other,\ngrinned between bites. She had at least three chins, her facial features\ndisappearing into the fat that encased her like an awkward child surrounded\nby a crowd of bullies. Her linen skirt could have served as a tent. Literally.\nShe turned away from Kip, slipping the knife back into a sheath and putting\nher hand back to turning the spit. Her butt was more than a jiggly haunch; it\nwas architecture."

Her butt was more than a jiggly haunch; it\nwas architecture.\n“Pardon me,” Kip said, recovering. “I was wondering if I could buy\nsome dinner. I’ve got money.”\nEars perked up all around the fire at that. Kip wondered suddenly if\nhe’d picked a good fire to stop at. Were the men everywhere in the camp as\nscruffy as these ones?\nKip looked around. Uh, yes, actually they were.\nOh shit.\nHe fumbled with the leather money belt holding the stick of tin danars.\nHe’d grabbed the money belt because it already had money in it and would\nbe easier to transport than loose coins. The stick was a great way to carry\nmoney. Cut square to fit the square hole in the middle of danars, and of\nuniform length so people could rapidly count their own money—scales\nwere still used to count others’ money, of course—it was convenient and\nkept your money from jangling at every step as they did in a purse. Plus the\nsticks could be bound in leather for attaching to a belt or hiding inside of\nclothes, as Kip’s was. He’d seen the gleam of this stick and grabbed it.\nBut as Kip pulled the open end of the money stick out to pull off one\ntin danar coin, he saw something was very wrong. He froze. The weight had\nbeen right, or at least close enough that he hadn’t thought about it, but the\ncoin he pulled out wasn’t tin. A danar was about what a worker would make\nfor a day’s labor. An unskilled labor like his mother would only make half a\ndanar a day. He’d assumed the stick he grabbed was full of the tin coins,\neach worth eight danars.\nInstead, he’d grabbed a stick of silver quintars. Slightly wider in\ncircumference, but only half as thick, and the metal slightly lighter than tin,\nthe silver coins were worth twenty danars each. A stick of silver quintars\nheld fifty of the coins, twice as many as the twenty-five tin coins that would\nfit on the same stick. So instead of stealing two hundred danars from the\nTravertine Palace—an already princely sum—Kip had stolen a thousand.\nAnd he’d just pulled out one right in front of everyone, making it clear he\nhad more.\nConversation ceased. In the dancing light of the fire, more than a few\neyes gleamed like wolves’.\nKip tucked the rest of the money belt away, praying no one had seen\nhow full it was. What did it matter? His life might be worth less than even\nthe one silver quintar. “I’ll take the other leg,” he said.\nThe fat woman let go of the spit and reached her hand out.\n“I’ll need nineteen danars back,” Kip said. A full day’s wages should\nbe more than three times what the javelina leg cost.\nShe chortled. “We run a charity house here, we do. Look like luxiats,\nhuh? Ten.”\n“Ten danars, for a meal?” Kip asked, not believing she was serious.\n“You can go hungry if you wanna. You ain’t gonna starve,” the woman\nsaid."

        "text": "huh? Ten.”\n“Ten danars, for a meal?” Kip asked, not believing she was serious.\n“You can go hungry if you wanna. You ain’t gonna starve,” the woman\nsaid.\nThe injustice of this whale calling him fat and the impossibility of\ndoing much about it paralyzed Kip. He gritted his teeth, glaring around the\nfire, and handed over the quintar.\nThe leviathan took the quintar and held it between her teeth, bending it\nslightly. If it were a counterfeit, tin coated with silver, it would give the\ncurious crackling sound unique to bending tin. Satisfied between the weight\nand the texture that it was real, she tucked the coin away. She took a swig\nfrom a glass jug, set it down, and then sawed a leg off the javelina. While\nshe was working, Kip noticed that some of the men around the fire had\ndisappeared.\nNo doubt he was going to find them in the spreading darkness, waiting\nfor him. Orholam, they had seen the rest of the stick.\nNor were the remaining men and women looking at him in a terribly\nfriendly manner. They sat on their bags, on stumps, or on the ground,\nmostly watching him quietly. A few drank from wineskins or aleskins,\nmurmuring to each other. A glassy-eyed woman was lying with her head in\na long-haired, balding, unshaven man’s lap, stroking his thigh. Both were\nstaring at him.\nThe whale handed Kip the javelina leg.\nKip looked at her, waiting.\nShe stared blandly back at him from beneath her layers of blubber.\nA few weeks ago, Kip would have backed off. He was used to people\ntreating him like dirt. Ignoring him or bullying him. But he couldn’t\nimagine Gavin Guile being bullied, not even when the odds were stacked\nagainst him. Kip might be a bastard, but if had one drop of the Prism’s\nblood, there was no way he could knuckle under. “I need my ten danars,”\nKip said.\nThe drunk woman across the fire laughed suddenly, uncontrollably,\nuntil she started snorting and laughing harder. Not just drunk, then.\n“Do I look rich enough to have ten danars?” the whale asked.\n“You can cut that danar in half.”\nShe drew her knife and shrugged, stepping close to Kip. She reeked of\ngrain alcohol. “Sorry, got no knife.”\nKip understood instantly. Several of the men were sitting up, not only\npaying more attention, but getting ready to hop to their feet. They weren’t\nwaiting only to laugh at him, knowing this whale would cheat him. They\nwere waiting, knowing the whale would cheat him, to see if he was a\nvictim. Would Kip meekly accept being cheated? If he was a victim, he was\na mark. If he had one quintar, he might have more.\nBut what could he do? Give back the food? No, she wouldn’t give him\nthe quintar back regardless. If he left, he’d confirm his weakness. Someone\nwould be waiting for him in the darkness. What would they do if he\nattacked her? If, without warning, he punched her in her blubbery face as\nhard as he could?"

If, without warning, he punched her in her blubbery face as\nhard as he could?\nThey’d attack him, of course. And after they beat him, then they’d rob\nhim.\nIf he ran away, even if he got away, he’d lose his horse, and he had too\nmuch trouble mounting the beast to leap into the saddle and ride away—\neven if it hadn’t been the most placid creature on earth, unlikely to gallop\neven with hell on its heels.\n“Fine,” Kip said. He turned as if to go, but instead grabbed her glass\njug. “I’d like to have a drink with dinner. You keep the rest. For the great\nservice.” He smelled the jug. As he thought, it was grain alcohol. He took a\nswig to look tough and had to school his face to stillness when it set his\nmouth on fire. Then his throat. Then his stomach.\nThe men who’d been shifting to get up settled back down.\n“Mind if I sleep here tonight?” Kip asked.\n“It’ll cost you,” the man who was balding up front and had hair\nhalfway down his back said.\n“Sure,” Kip said. He wasn’t nearly as hungry as he’d been a few\nminutes ago, but he forced himself to eat the greasy javelina leg. As the rest\nof the javelina cooked, the other men and women came and took slices.\nAs Kip finished, he sucked his fingers and walked toward his horse. He\ngot far enough that he began to hope that they would simply let him leave.\n“What are you doing?” the balding man demanded.\n“I need to rub down my horse,” Kip said. “It’s been a long day.”\n“You don’t need to go anywhere, and I don’t want you near my horse.”\n“Your horse,” Kip said.\n“That’s right.” The man bared blackened teeth at Kip—not quite a\nsmile, not quite like he was going to bite him—and drew a knife.\n“We’ll be needing that coin belt, too,” another man said.\nThe women around the fire simply watched, impassive. No one moved\nto help. Several other men joined the two already facing Kip. Kip looked\ninto the darkness, his vision spoiled by the fire, but still he could see several\ndark shapes waiting for him.\nGive them what you have, and maybe you’ll escape with a beating,\nKip. You know you’re not getting out of here with everything. Stall for\ntime, maybe there’s some kind of camp guards here who might save you.\n“Evernight take you,” Kip said. He smashed the top off the jug of grain\nalcohol on the edge of a wagon wheel.\n“Fool boy,” the balding man said. “Most people keep the handle if they\ndo that, not smash it off.”\nKip lunged, splashing grain alcohol over the man. The balding man\ngrimaced, rubbing stinging eyes, switching his knife to his left hand. “You\nknow what? I’m going to kill you for that,” he said.\nWith a yell, Kip charged.\nIt was the last thing the man expected.

He was still rubbing his eyes.\nHe raised an arm to fend off a blow, but Kip dove at his stomach, past the\nknife, spearing the top of his head into the man’s gut. With a whoof! the\nman staggered backward and tripped right at the edge of the fire.\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Then the grain alcohol on his hands\nignited. He lifted his hand with a yell, and his hair ignited. His beard\nignited. His face. His yells pitched to tortured screams.\nKip bolted, straight past the flaming man.\nNo one moved for a blessed moment. Then someone dove for him,\nmissing his body but clipping his heel. Kip went down heavily.\nHe hadn’t even gotten three paces from the fire.\nSome run, Porky.\nHe rolled over in time to see the flaming man, still screaming, run\nstraight into the fat woman. She shrieked, an oddly shrill sound to come\nfrom such a big woman, and started whacking at him with her big knife.\nThen three men were on Kip, the fire behind them making them huge\ngrotesque shadows. A kick caught Kip in the shoulder, then one from the\nother side hit his kidney. Pain lanced through him, taking his breath away.\nHe curled into a ball.\nKicks rained on his back and legs. One of the men was leaning over\nhim, punching his hip, his leg, trying to hit him in the crotch. Someone\nstomped on his head. It was a glancing blow, but it caught his nose. Hot\nblood exploded over his face and his head caromed off the dirt.\nOnly a single thought won through the fog suddenly wreathing Kip’s\nbrain. They’re going to kill me. This wasn’t going to be punishment. It was\nmurder.\nSo be it. They’ll have to kill me on my feet. He struggled to all fours.\nThat opened his ribs to attack and a kick hammered his side. He\nabsorbed it with a groan.\nThree grown men, attacking a boy who’d done nothing to them.\nSomething about the injustice of it tapped an iron reserve of will. No, not\nonly three now. More had joined. But the additional numbers only\ninfuriated Kip further. He hunched into his own bulk, gathering his strength,\ntucking his head between his shoulders. Burn in hell, I can take it.\nWith an inhuman roar, a sound like Kip had never heard, a sound he\ndidn’t even know he was capable of, he shot to his feet, taking a wide\nstance. The suddenness of his movement seemed amplified by his previous\nslowness.\nBellowing, bleeding, with his yell he sprayed blood into the face of a\nman who’d been running forward to kick him. Kip was like a cave bear,\nsuddenly standing on its hind legs. The man’s eyes went wide.\nKip grabbed the man’s shirt and pulled, spinning, screaming, and\nhurling him the only direction that wasn’t blocked by bodies.\nInto the fire.\nThe man saw where he was headed.

It\nspun him sideways into the fire, his head dropping right into the heart of the\nflames, the spit collapsing.\nKip didn’t watch, didn’t listen to the new screams. Someone hit him in\nthe stomach. Ordinarily the blow would have folded him in half. But now\nthe pain didn’t matter. He found his attacker—a big, bearded man easily a\nfoot taller than him, looking at him like he was stunned the boy hadn’t\nfallen. Kip grabbed the man’s beard and yanked it down toward him as hard\nas he could. At the same time, he lunged forward, head like a ram. The big\nman’s face crunched as they collided. He went down in a spray of blood and\nflying teeth.\nSomething like hope glimmered through Kip’s rage. He turned again,\nlooking for another victim just as something cracked across his head.\nKip went down. He wasn’t even aware of falling. He was just on the\nground, staring up at another grinning ghoul of a man carrying a piece of\nfirewood in his hand. Behind that man were four others. Four? Still?\nBetween the tears and the dizziness, Kip wasn’t even sure he was counting\nright.\nHe clambered to all fours again, and promptly fell over, spots\nexploding in front of his eyes. He had no balance.\n“Throw him in the fire!” someone yelled.\nThere were other words, but Kip couldn’t sort them out. The next thing\nhe knew, he was being lifted, one man taking each limb. He was facedown.\nThe heat of the fire beat at the top of his head, his face.\nThe men stopped. “Don’t push us in, you assholes!” one of the men at\nthe front said.\n“On three!”\n“Orholam, he’s big.”\n“Don’t have to throw him far.”\n“Gonna sizzle like bacon in the pan, ain’t he?”\n“One!”\nKip swung a little over the fire, close enough that he swore his\neyebrows curled from the heat. Fear strangled him. The dizziness\ndisappeared.\nHe swung back away from the fire.\n“Two!”\nEnough. The odds were just too bad. I tried. What do I have to fear\nwhen I have nothing to lose? I despise myself. So what if I die? A little\npain, so what? Then the pain’s gone forever. Then oblivion.\nKip swung farther over the fire, closing his eyes, welcoming the heat.\nHis eyebrows and eyelashes melted. The fire licked his face like a cat.\nA Guile wouldn’t give up. They accepted you, Kip. Expected you to\npull your weight. Gavin, Ironfist, Liv, they let you belong for the first time\nin your life. And you’re going to disappoint them?\nAnd like that, the fear was gone. No.\nThey swung him back away from the fire; one last time. Four men.\nFour Ramirs.

His eyes widened at the sight of the fire like a lover’s eyes widen\nat the sight of his beloved. Yes, beautiful. Yes, mine.\nA rushing sound like a mighty wind roared out of nowhere. The fire\ndeformed, leapt toward Kip—into Kip. And disappeared. The entire fire\nwent out in an instant, plunging the camp into darkness.\nThe men dropped Kip with a shout.\nAnd Kip barely noticed.\nHe’d fallen among the embers. He caught himself with his left hand,\nand heard a sizzle as his hand closed around a burning faggot. Though he’d\nsucked up the whole fire, the embers were still red-hot.\nAnd Kip barely noticed. Rage was a sea and he merely floating in it.\nHe wasn’t himself, wasn’t aware of a self. There were only those he hated,\nwho must be struck down.\nHe screamed, throwing a hand heavenward. Heat gushed out,\nbecoming fire a foot away from his hand, painting the sky blue, yellow,\norange, and red. He stood, heat roaring through his veins. Unbearable heat.\nDespite the darkness, he could see the men who’d been holding him clearly.\nHe saw their warmth. One had tripped and was staring at him,\nopenmouthed.\nKip flung a hand at him. Fire enveloped the man from head to foot.\nThe others fled.\nKip threw his left hand toward one. He felt skin crack as he opened\nthat hand, but the pain was a distant echo. He aimed with his right hand,\ntoo. Pop, pop, pop. Three fireballs, each the size of his hand, flew into the\nnight, almost pushing him back into the fire with the recoil. But each found\nits target, burying itself in a man’s back, gutting him with fire, cooking him\nfrom inside even as he fell.\nFalling to his knees, still hot, so hot, so overwhelmed, Kip raised his\nhands once more. Fire poured into the sky from both hands, even his\ncrippled left hand. Then his vision returned to normal. He heaved deep\nbreaths, like some demon had just released him, leaving him empty, hollow,\npart of his humanity burnt away.\nThe fire was burning once more, much smaller, the heat of the coals\nslowly returning the wood to flame, illuminating the wagons and the faces\nof the fearful crowd gathering to see what had happened.\nIn the light of the lanterns and torches and the reawakening fire, Kip\nsaw the scene with sane eyes. Scores of people were staring at him from a\nwide circle around the fire, all looking ready to bolt. There were bodies\nstrewn about: the four men who’d tried to throw him in the fire were dead,\none a charred meaty skeleton, the others with holes the size of Kip’s hand in\ntheir backs.\nSomehow, the others were worse.

The man Kip had doused with grain\nalcohol had skin sloughing off his face and chest and knife wounds all over\nhis arms and body. He lay moaning softly, a few tufts of hair still protruding\nfrom his burnt scalp. The fat woman lay next to him, openly weeping. The\nflaming man must have run headfirst into her, because her face was\nscorched, blistered on the right side, her eyebrow gone, her hair melted\nback halfway up her head, and somehow her own knife had been plunged to\nthe hilt low into her right side. Blood dribbled down her cheek. The man\nKip had flung into the fire was the worst, though. He’d caught the spit to\nstop himself, and only his head had dropped into the fire, falling directly\nonto the hottest coals.\nHe’d dragged himself out of the fire, and by some dark miracle he was\nstill alive and still conscious. He was crying softly, as if even weeping hurt,\nbut he couldn’t stop. He’d rolled over, exposing the burnt side of his head.\nHis skin hadn’t just sloughed off—it had stuck to the coals like burnt\nchicken sticking to a pan. His cheekbone was exposed, his cheek burned\nthrough, exposing teeth now washed red with coursing blood as he wept,\nhis eye burnt a chalky white.\nThe only one who might survive was the bearded man whose teeth Kip\nhad smashed. He was unconscious, but so far as Kip could see, still alive.\nKip tottered toward his horse, unfeeling. He didn’t have a plan. He just\nhad to get away. He was so ashamed. He got all the way to the beast before\nhe saw the soldiers. They had surrounded the camp, but were staying back\nin the crowd. Kip looked at one of the soldiers who was mounted, an\nofficer, he guessed.\n“I’m sorry, sir, but we can’t let you leave,” the officer said. “One of the\nFree will be along for you shortly.”\n“They attacked me,” Kip said, exhausted. “Tried to rob me. I… I\ndidn’t mean…” He leaned against the horse. Stupid beast hadn’t run away.\nOh, it didn’t have a line of sight, and it had been tied up so it couldn’t leave\nif it wanted to. Still, he would have expected it to be going crazy. Instead, it\nstood, placid as ever. Kip leaned against it.\nWith his left hand. Orholam. The skin cracked and tore open and\nstarted bleeding at every joint. Kip gave a little cry. But even the thought of\nhis own agony dragged his eyes back to the fire, to the people he’d killed,\nand those who weren’t dead yet but would be. His heart felt wooden, like he\nshould feel more, but he just couldn’t.\nLooking back, though, he saw a young man moving among the bodies,\nchecking them.

Over his white shirt, his forearms were covered with\nmulticolored vambraces with five thick bands of color against a white\nbackground. His cloak echoed the pattern, from a band outlined in black\nthat looked fuzzy—sub-red?—to red to orange to yellow to green. There\nwas no blue or superviolet. It didn’t take a genius to guess he was a\npolychrome.\nBut that wasn’t what arrested Kip’s attention. Out of all the thousands\nof people in this camp, and out of the hundreds of drafters they must have,\nKip recognized this one. He’d been part of the force that massacred Rekton.\nHe’d personally tried to kill Kip at the water market. Zymun, the boy’s\nmaster had called him. Kip’s heart plummeted like a child jumping off a\nwaterfall.\nZymun put on a pair of green spectacles. “Hello, firefriend,” he said.\n“Welcome to our war. I assume you’ve come to join the Free?”\n“Right,” Kip said, finding his voice. The Free?\nEmerald smoke swirled down into Zymun’s hands. “Just so you\nknow,” he said, “you can kill who you must—though Lord Omnichrome\nprefers it not be so indiscriminate—but when you do, please clean up your\nmesses.” He swept his arms in a martial circle, slowly, bending his knees,\ngiving the impression of gathering energy. Then his hands snapped across\neach other, flashed out. Pa-pop, pa-pop. Four spikes of green luxin, each as\nlong as a finger, shot out in two volleys. Around the fire, almost\nsimultaneously, four heads burst open with wet splatters. The wounded.\nTheir moans stopped instantly.\nKip goggled.\nZymun looked pleased with himself. He folded his green spectacles\nand tucked them in a pocket.\nHe’s showing off. He’s showing off by killing people.\nZymun frowned suddenly as Kip stepped close. “What’s your name?”\n“Kip,” Kip said, before thinking that it might be a poor choice to use\nhis real name.\n“Kip, you have a tooth in your head.”\nHuh? Kip showed his teeth and pointed. “Actually, I have all my teeth\nin my head.” Play it like you don’t want to throw up, Kip. Push through\nthis.\n“No, not your tooth,” Zymun said. He gestured to his own scalp like he\nwas being a mirror.\nKip reached up and, sure enough, there was a tooth sticking in his\nscalp. What the hell? He pulled it out, wincing, and fresh blood dribbled\ndown his face.\n“Hmm,” Zymun said. “Maybe we’ll take you by the chirurgeons first\nand get you looked at.”\n“First?” Kip asked.\n“Yes, of course.

        "text": "drafters. Even the sloppy ones.”\nChapter 71\nAs darkness fell over the vast host, Liv wandered through campsites,\nbecoming more and more aware that she was alone and female, surrounded\nby rough men. Lots of rough men. Men who were laughing too loud,\ndrinking too much, afraid of the coming battle. And if being Tyrean had\nmade her an outcast and studiously ignored back at the Chromeria, here she\nhad no such protection. Most of the men looked at her subtly enough that if\nshe hadn’t been so intensely aware of being alone and not wanting to be\nlooked at, she would never have noticed it. Others stared at her so blatantly\nthat she checked her neckline. Nope, it was quite modest.\nJust a few jackasses who’ve been away from their wives for too long.\nShe was practically starving, and though she didn’t want to stop at any\ncampfire, it was the only way to get not only food, but information.\nLiv picked a campfire with some kind-looking farmers huddled around\na pot of stew. She couldn’t see everyone before she entered the circle, of\ncourse, but a few of them looked kind, and it was the best she could do.\n“Good evening,” she said, a little more cheerily than she felt. “I’d give\nhalf a danar for some stew. You have any extra?”\nEight heads swiveled toward her. An older man spoke. “It’s a mite thin\nto call it a stew. One rabbit, a couple tubers, and the leavings of a javelina\nleg between nine mouths.” He smiled, self-effacing. “But Mori did find a\ngrapefruit tree the soldiers missed somehow.”\nFeeling reassured, Liv came closer. The man looked at her eyes,\nblinked, and said, “If you’re getting hassled, you should put on your\nspectacles, young lady.”\n“Hassled? Why would you think that?” Liv asked. “And it’s Liv, thank\nyou.”\n“You look as skittish as a deer at a watering hole, that’s why.” He\nhanded her a tin cup of broth with a few chunks. He waved off her attempt\nto pay him. She ate the thin stew and the small, underripe grapefruit they\ngave her, and mostly sat and watched.\nAfter a time, the men returned to their talk of war and weather and\ncrops they hadn’t bothered to plant this year, citrus trees they hadn’t\nbothered to prune because if they bore more fruit, it only meant the bandits\nwould spend longer close to their village. They weren’t bad men. In fact,\nthey seemed quite decent. They had their complaints about King Garadul,\nand one muttered darkly about a “Lord Omnichrome” before remembering\nthat a drafter was present, but they reserved their hatred for their occupiers.\nThe nuances of the rotating rule of Garriston were lost on them. They\ndidn’t differentiate between the better and worse occupiers. They hated\nthem all. One had lost his daughter a number of years before when a patrol\nhad passed through their village and an officer had simply taken her. He’d\ngone to Garriston afterward to try to find her, but never did. The others had\ncome partly for their friend, partly because they had nothing else to do and\ntaking a city might drop a few coins into their hands, and partly because"

Once a man called out to her as she\npassed, but the comment dried up on his lips as he saw her colored\nspectacles—even now, in the darkness, they respected drafters.\nThe drafters’ tents were separate from everyone else’s—not because\nthey were guarded or staked off, but evidently no one wanted to camp too\nclose to them. Liv slipped her spectacles off, but kept them in hand, in case\nsomeone challenged her.\nShe moved past a wagon surrounded by Mirrormen and painted all\nviolet—odd, but she didn’t slow, she moved with purpose, as if she had\norders. It was a trick she’d learned in the Chromeria. If you stood around,\nsome full drafter would find something for you to do. If you looked busy,\nyou could get away with almost anything.\nShe passed a number of fires with drafters being served a lavish dinner\nby cooks and wine or ales by a large number of slaves. The drafters all wore\ntheir colors on their wrists in either cloth or metal vambraces or in large\nbracelets for some of the women. The hem of their cloaks or dresses also\nechoed the color. Other than that, everyone wore his own style. In general,\nthough, these drafters were much more interested in loudly proclaiming\ntheir colors in broad swathes across their clothes than was common at the\nChromeria, where a woman might have a single green hairpin to let others\nknow she was a green.\nThey were a raucous, privileged group, but as Liv watched from the\nshadows, she saw that the men and women here often glanced to the south\n—not to the huge pavilion guarded by drafters and Mirrormen alike that Liv\nassumed was King Garadul’s residence, but to another set of bonfires. She\ngrabbed a pitcher of wine from one of the slaves’ tables and headed over. In\nthe dark, her own apparel didn’t look too different from the slaves’.\nWhat she saw, beyond the forms of the slaves, took her breath away.\nPeople—or monsters shaped like people—were talking, drinking, cavorting,\ndrafting.\nNearest to Liv, a circle of blue drafters, half of them wearing blue\nspectacles, and all filled with blue luxin, tinting their skin in the firelight,\nwere talking with a woman who seemed made of crystal.\nFor long moments, Liv had no idea what she was seeing.

A broken-haloed eye. The crystalline woman\ndrafting a matrix in the air as the other blues listened. Greens laughing,\ndancing around one fire, bouncing on unnaturally springy legs, jumping\nhigher than any man Liv had ever seen, doing flips and backflips over each\nother. A man and a woman, skin permanently green but not yet transformed,\nwere standing, holding each other, grinding their hips together, dancing in a\nmanner so lascivious that—wait, no, the woman’s skirt was bunched around\nher waist. In full view of everyone, including some cheering drafters, they\nwere actually—\nLiv tore her eyes away, her cheeks suddenly hot. A yellow was tossing\nlittle luxin balls into the air while a blue shot blue bullets at them, each little\ntarget exploding in a flash of light when he connected.\nBut Liv’s eyes were drawn to the full color wights. Even here, there\nweren’t many. She’d only heard rumors about such things at the Chromeria.\nThey said almost everyone who broke their halo simply went mad and died\n—or went mad and killed others, more often. That danger was what made\nthe Pact necessary. Orholam made magic to serve men, and a drafter swore\nto serve her community. Oathbreakers served only themselves, and they\nendangered everyone.\nBut there were always the legends of those who remade themselves.\nNow, here, Liv was seeing that they weren’t wild tales. Now, here, these\ndrafters were teaching each other how to do it. Liv looked at the crystal blue\nwoman. She was oddly beautiful. Crystal hair, and diamond-shaped eye\ncaps close over her eyes, flawed crystal skin, broken into a thousand facets,\ncovering every natural curve of her body. She’d conquered the problem of\nhow to deal with drafting hard, unbending blue luxin onto a body that had\nto be able to move and to bend by making thousands—tens of thousands—\nof small crystals. Her body glimmered, shimmered, coruscated in the\nfirelight as she shifted her upper body like a dancer to show her disciples\nwhat she’d done. She laughed, showing strangely white teeth against those\ngleaming blue lips. Then she shifted suddenly into a fighting stance, spiky\nguards springing up along the edges of her forearms, and plates of blue\nluxin congealing over her skin to make armor.\nShit!\n“Hey, caleen! I said wine!” a voice said.\nLiv turned and found herself face-to-face with a man with hideous\nburn scars all over his body. A sub-red, with the odd shimmering of fire\ncrystal broken through his halos. He held out a glass to Liv, and she filled it\nwith wine, trembling, averting her own eyes until he looked away. The man\nheld a haze pipe in one hand, and there were fresh burns all along his skin.\nAs Liv looked, she realized the burns were deliberate. He was trying to scar\nall of his skin deeply enough to lose feeling in it.

Until then, he was\ndeadening himself to the pain any way he could.\nIt had to be incredibly dangerous to even be in close proximity to a\nmad fire drafter. He couldn’t control himself normally, and now he was\ndrunk and high on haze.\nThe man had barely left when Liv saw a gout of flame blast into the\nnight sky a few hundred yards away. She stopped, and so did a few of the\ncolor wights, nudging those around them and pointing.\nWhatever it had been, the drafter who’d done it had been powerful.\nThat was a lot of fire to throw into the night. Where had he gotten the light\nto do that? From one of the bonfires?\nThen it happened again, fire painting the sky for several seconds. Liv\nfelt her throat tighten with fear. Kip! No, that was ridiculous. Kip was\ngreen/blue. Fire, sub-red, was at the opposite end of the spectrum. It\ncouldn’t be Kip. The color wights just laughed, as if it were one of their\nown out there, having fun.\nOrholam, Kip could be getting killed out there in the night. Liv needed\nto go.\nShe turned and headed out of camp. She almost ran into a dozen\nMirrormen who were escorting a woman clad in a gorgeous black dress and\nwearing violet eye caps out of the king’s pavilion. Liv stopped. Karris.\nThey hustled past, but Liv had no doubt where they were going. Karris\nwas being held in that odd violet wagon she’d seen, held captive. Liv\nshould have figured it out earlier.\nStill, any elation Liv had felt about finding Karris—actually finding\nher, on the first day, in a camp of maybe a hundred thousand souls if not\nmore—was quashed by her fear for Kip.\nWhen she got out of the drafters’ area, she put on her yellow\nspectacles. No one bothered her. She arrived at the place she and Kip had\nagreed to meet just in time, but he wasn’t there. He never came.\nThe next day, she learned a heavy boy with Tyrean skin and blue eyes\nhad been attacked and had killed five men—or ten or twenty, or five women\ntoo, depending on the rumor—and then thrown fire into the air. He’d been\ntaken away by drafters and Mirrormen. Despite the impossibilities—Kip\ncouldn’t draft sub-red—her intuition confirmed it. It had been Kip. She was\nsure. Someone had drafted fire, someone else had killed those people, and\nKip had been taken.\nShe searched for him for two days. She found nothing.\nChapter 72\nAs the sun dragged its feet toward the horizon, Gavin gave the signal, and\nthe teamsters’ whips cracked. The draft horses surged forward. Their leads\ndrew taut, and the ropes connected to the great yellow luxin supports\nstrained for a moment. Then the supports fell, the great straining mass of\nthe horses snatching them away from the dropping wall.\nThe final layer of yellow luxin hit the ground with a boom, shaking the\nearth. Gavin quickly moved to inspect that everything had gone according\nto plan.\n“One league out!” Corvan called. He was standing on top of the wall,\nlooking out toward King Garadul’s vast army."

He was standing on top of the wall,\nlooking out toward King Garadul’s vast army.\n“Shit!”\n“Here, Lord Prism!” one of the engineers called.\nGavin hurried over. The last of many big problems he’d run into in\ncrafting a wall almost entirely of yellow luxin was that all the luxin had to\nbe sealed. The seal was always the weakest point. If you could melt through\nthat one area—no mean feat, but still—the whole structure would unravel.\nThat his wall was made in sections just meant that each section had multiple\nseals. If any section failed, it would be catastrophic—an entire section of\nwall, fifty paces across, would splash into liquid light in moments.\nIt was probably the reason no one before Gavin had been idiot enough\nto make an entire wall of yellow luxin.\nThe solution had been simplicity itself: two layers of luxin, each\nprotecting the other, the seals to the inside. That part was common enough\namong drafters, but the seal was always the last thing you touched. So you\ncouldn’t really tuck it inside, not on something as big as a wall. You could\nprotect one seal by covering it with more luxin and sealing that, but one seal\nwould always be external. Most drafters would have covered the seal and\ncovered that seal and covered that one and left it at that.\nIt wasn’t good enough for Gavin. He’d built the entire second layer of\nthe wall up on supports. Then he’d built each side, sealing them on the\ninside. When the draft horses pulled out the supports and the second layer\nof wall fell into place, it left a structure where the seals—for the first time\nthat Gavin had ever heard of—were truly protected, not just by yellow\nluxin, but by the vast weight of the wall itself. And as each section locked to\nthe next, it became more and more difficult for anyone to ever lift the wall\nto access the seals.\nGavin was building something monumental, something pure, and it felt\ngreat. This edifice would stand long after he was dead. There weren’t many\nmen who could claim the same. The locals were already calling it\nBrightwater Wall.\nHurrying over to the engineer who’d called out, Gavin found that one\nof the supports hadn’t been pulled all the way free. The wall had dropped\non it, pounding the two-pace-wide support almost halfway into the earth,\nand keeping the wall from fitting the next section perfectly.\n“Three minutes until our artillery will be in place!” Corvan called\ndown.\nSonuvabitch! Gavin dropped on his knees next to the broad yellow\nsupport and brushed dirt away hurriedly. The support, unlike the wall\nsections, was sealed right at the surface for just this eventuality. Right…\nthere! Gavin sent some sub-red into the seal and the entire support\ndissolved, the yellow luxin abruptly liquid. The wall settled with a deep\nrumble.\nGavin had made the tolerances too tight. He should have made those\njoints able to hook together even if they weren’t so well aligned. The tight\njoints gave the wall more strength and would keep soldiers inside dry even\nduring rainstorms, but still.\nTaking his attention off the wall for the first time in hours—it felt like"

Most of the people of Garriston\nwanted to see the wall being built. Vendors had set up their wagons and\nstalls. Minstrels wandered through, playing and prodding people for coins.\nSoldiers kept avenues clear and began ferrying gear and powder and ropes\nand shot for cannons and firewood for furnaces and additional armor and\narrows and muskets. Others operated the cranes as soon as the second layer\nsettled in place. Drafters were pouring through the inside of the wall,\nsealing any cracks, looking for flaws that they could fix, or larger ones that\nneeded Gavin’s hand. The Blackguards—nearly a hundred of them—also\nstood nearby.\nThey’d told everyone to leave already, but they didn’t have the men to\nspare to enforce the order. The people were too curious; they knew they’d\nnever see anything like this again in their lives. Gavin couldn’t worry about\nthem right now. He was already feeling the tightness of impossibility\nsqueezing his chest.\n“Captain!” Gavin called. “You’ve seen the process. Get the teamsters\nmoving as fast as they can. We’ve got sixteen more sections. Send half the\nteams all the way to the east side, and have half work from here out. Take\nsix drafters. You four, you, and you. You’ve seen what I’ve done. Go do it.\n“General Danavis, talk to me!” Gavin shouted. Less than a league now.\nIt should be enough.\nGavin moved to the inside of the great arch that would hold the gate.\nThere were open holes, tubes running down the great curving length of the\nwall. Gavin filled himself with light and blasted green luxin down each\ntube. It would give the wall some flex, but also strength to recoil from any\nbattering ram blow. He sealed each green luxin tube at the end.\n“Lord Prism,” Corvan called, holding a fresh-drafted telescope up to\none eye. “It looks like they have teams pushing their artillery out in front of\nthe army. They know we don’t have the skirmishers to go out and smash\nthem. Damn spies! I can’t see the culverins, but we know they have half a\ndozen. If they fire from greatest random—” He paused, doing mental\ncalculations. Greatest random was literally the greatest distance gunners\ncould reach, but at almost two thousand paces for the biggest culverins,\nthere was no such thing as aiming. “They could begin their bombardment\nanytime now if their crews are practiced. Within minutes, even if they’re\nnot.”\nIt wasn’t the culverins Gavin was worried about. Because of the\ntrajectory of those big guns, their shots would hit the front of the wall.\nBrightwater Wall could take as many direct hits as they wanted to give it.\nThey would have to come substantially closer for the higher-trajectory\nhowitzers and closer still for the mortars that would absolutely wreak havoc\non the stubborn crowds behind the wall.

Garriston’s cannons would have to\nknock out those guns before they could be placed, bagged, and loaded.\n“Damn it, find someone who’s not doing something more important\nand get these damn people back,” Gavin ordered. “This isn’t a Sun Day\nouting! Shells are going to be landing where they sit in ten minutes!” Gavin\nturned back to General Danavis. “Start firing as soon as you can. Buy me\ntime, General!”\nGavin felt more than heard the next section of wall fall into place.\nPeople were rushing everywhere, but he pushed it out of his mind and\nconfronted the new biggest problem of all, now that the wall was actually\ntaking shape.\nHe hadn’t built the gate.\nHe ran over to one of the cranes hoisting supplies to the top of the\nwall. It was already lifting off the ground as he approached, rising fast.\nGavin jumped, throwing out two hooks of blue and green luxin, snagging\nthe sides of the load. He rose fast and pulled himself up. He jumped off as\nsoon as the load settled on top of the wall, startling the soldiers operating\nthe crane. They froze.\n“To work!” he roared. They jumped, and then jumped to it.\nGavin ran across the top of the wall, dodging men to get back to the\narch above the gap where he needed to draft the gate.\nTremblefist was barking orders, sending up a small number of\nBlackguards to stand with Gavin—as if they could do anything to protect\nhim from incoming shells—but not so many that they would get in the way\nof the defenders trying to set up the wall for any of a hundred tasks. The\nrest of the Blackguards took up positions in front of the empty gate.\nAs in all battles, there was simply too much to see, too much\nhappening all at the same time to put everything together. Gavin looked\ntoward the sun, poised above the horizon.\nTwo hours. All I need is two hours. Protecting these people is one great\npurpose I have that you must approve of. So if you’re up there, would you\nplease get off your holy ass and help me?\nGeneral Danavis had been organizing, training, promoting, firing, and\ntraining Garriston’s defenders for the past week. Twenty hours a day,\nsometimes twenty-two. It was inhuman, and yet it wasn’t enough. Gavin\nwas accustomed to the discipline and ease of working with veterans. By the\nend of the Prisms’ War, his men had worked together fluidly. Stocking this\nwall with supplies would have taken his veterans literally one-third of the\ntime it was taking these men. His veteran cannoneers would already be\nsighted in, with distances marked off. These men barely knew each other,\nmuch less trusted each other. It made everything painfully slow, and Gavin\nwas slow to adjust to how slow they were.\nWe’re doomed.\nBut then he drafted a quick platform to walk out on in front of the open\narch—necessary to gather some of his open threads of luxin—and he caught\nhis first sight of the wall as his enemies would see it.\nThat damned boy artist had made his masterpiece."

Now he saw the whole.\nThe entire wall—the entire great curving league of it—glowed the\ncolor of the sun when it first shows its face. That glow came from the liquid\nyellow—a hair’s breadth from being perfect, hard yellow—that floated\nbehind the first layer of perfect yellow. The liquid yellow would mend any\ndamage that did scar the outer wall. But then, within that thin layer, Gavin\nsaw that his old drafters, doubtless under the direction of Aheyyad, had\nadded their own touches. As an enemy approached, he would see that the\nentire wall was swarming with loathsome things. Spiders the size of a man’s\nhead appeared to be crawling across the wall, stopping, little jaws clacking.\nSmall dragons appeared to swoop and spin. Disapproving faces swirled up\nout of the gloom. A woman ran from some many-fanged thing and was torn\nto pieces and devoured alive, her face painted with despair. A man who\nappeared to be walking along the base of the wall was seized by hands that\nswirled out of the mist and yanked him in. Beautiful women turned into\nmonsters with forked tongues and huge claws. Blood seeped and pooled on\nthe ground. And those were just the things Gavin could see in a cursory\nglance. It was as if the drafters had gotten together and taken every\nnightmare any of them had ever had and put it into the wall. They were\nillusions, all of them mere images within the wall, but an enemy wouldn’t\nknow that at first, and even if they did know it, it was scary as the evernight\nitself. Better, it would certainly distract enemy archers and musketeers from\nmaking accurate shots at the murder holes hidden by those images.\nAnd that was just the wide blank sections of the wall. At every corbel,\nthe scowling, forbidding figure of a Prism looked down on the attackers. As\nGavin looked, he saw that every Prism for the past four hundred years had\nbeen crafted into the wall, with Lucidonius at the right hand of the figure\nwho dominated all and Gavin himself at the left hand. Above them, over the\nhuge gate gap, loomed the scowling figure of Orholam himself, radiant and\nfurious, his planted arms making the arches of the gate. Anyone attacking\nthis gate would be attacking Orholam himself, and all his Prisms. A brilliant\nlittle trick to make the attackers feel uneasy. Each figure, including\nOrholam, had cunningly hidden machicolations to drop stones or fire or\nmagic on attackers.\nGavin bit off another curse. He’d paused for a good five seconds,\nadmiring his own damned wall. He didn’t have time.\nFor a moment, he thought of simply closing the gate gap, just making\npure wall. But at this point, that wouldn’t be any faster. The forms were\nalready shaped to make a gate. All he had to do was fill them and tie them—"

All he had to do was fill them and tie them—\njust on one side, the cleverness he’d use for the rest of the wall would have\nto wait. Tomorrow, if they lived that long.\nGavin gathered the spools of superviolet that connected the whole\nsuperstructure of the wall and began pouring in yellow luxin.\nOrholam, he was exhausted. He’d been drafting to his absolute limit\nevery day for the last five days, and all through this day in particular since\nthe first rays of dawn. If he’d been a normal drafter, he’d have gone mad\nlong ago. Even most Prisms would have killed themselves with the amount\nof drafting Gavin had done. The others knew it too. If anything, Gavin had\ngotten more powerful since the war, and far more efficient. He’d seen\nwomen like Tala—whom he’d never seen impressed by anything in her life\n—shoot glances his way during unguarded moments like he was downright\nfrightening. But there was only so much even he could draft.\nNonetheless, he poured perfect yellow luxin into the forms. The real\nGavin couldn’t have done this: he wasn’t a superchromat, he couldn’t draft\na perfect yellow. But Gavin couldn’t go halfway. There was no “good\nenough” with yellow luxin; if it weren’t drafted perfectly, it would dissolve.\nSimple as that.\nSomething rocked the wall, and Gavin almost fell from his perch.\nSomeone steadied him, and he saw that Tremblefist was standing beside\nhim, holding him up. A moment later, he heard the delayed rumble of\ndistant artillery.\n“I’ve got you,” Tremblefist said. He wasn’t quite as big as his older\nbrother, but he too had worked with Gavin a long time. He must have seen\nthe glazed, stupefied look in Gavin’s eyes, because he said, “Our own\ncannons will start in a moment. Don’t be… distracted.” Don’t be alarmed,\nhe meant. Don’t be frightened. Don’t botch the gate and get us all killed.\nMore of King Garadul’s artillery began landing in the field, most of it\nfar short of Brightwater Wall. The sound of the enemy culverins became a\nthunderstorm in the distance. Gavin gathered his will and kept drafting. He\ndidn’t realize that he was weaving on his feet until he felt Tremblefist’s big\nhands close on his shoulders. Several other Blackguards pressed close.\n“Raise the cowl!” General Danavis yelled.\nAs yellow luxin splashed from Gavin’s hands into the forms below\nhim, he felt the wall shudder as each section of the cowl swung into place\non counterweights. The cowl was his architect’s invention. Basically, it was\na removable roof for use during artillery bombardment. There were plenty\nof times when an open roof was preferable—to gather rainwater, when it\nwas unbearably hot, or when men had to carry great loads or carts had to\npass down the length of the wall. But during a bombardment, it would\nshield defenders from howitzers and mortar fire. The wall’s own artillery\nwas left free to fire on the same basic defensive design as an arrow slit—"

The wall’s own artillery\nwas left free to fire on the same basic defensive design as an arrow slit—\neasy to fire out at a wide angle, but requiring a direct hit from the other side\nto put it out of commission.\n“What the hell is that?” Tremblefist breathed. Gavin wouldn’t have\neven heard him except that the man was basically holding him up. And\nTremblefist didn’t talk to himself much.\nGavin looked up, giving himself a small break, and looked over the\nplain.\nThe army was rumbling ever closer, catching up with their culverins.\nIn front of them were teams setting up the howitzers—the defenders still\nhadn’t fired a single shot, a fact that had General Danavis screaming at the\nnearest crews.\nBut that wasn’t what had Tremblefist cursing. In front of the main\narmy, drawing even with the advance cannon emplacements, were more\nthan a hundred men and women, some riding, and some simply running. All\nwere dressed in brightly colored clothing. Gavin could tell that by the way\nthe greens moved, sprinting with huge bouncing, league-devouring strides\nthat they weren’t just drafters. They were color wights, and they were\nheaded straight for the gate.\nThey would be at the wall within four minutes at the most.\nFour minutes. Gavin looked at his half-formed gate. If he didn’t worry\nabout hinges, if he just sealed the damn thing to the wall itself, it was\npossible. Maybe. He looked up at the sun, gathering power. It was less than\nan hour until sunset. The festivities for Sun Day’s Eve would start as soon\nas the last ray of sun disappeared from the horizon. Whether the attackers\nwere heretics or pagans or faithful, they wouldn’t fight during Sun Day. Sun\nDay was holy even to the gods Lucidonius had driven out.\nIf they could hold off the attackers for that one hour, they had a\nchance. And Sun Day would give them the time they needed to reinforce\nthe gates and get supplies and guns in place.\nOne day. One hour. Four minutes that would determine the course of\nthis war. It came down to this. Gavin was not going to quit. He had four\nminutes left in him.\nThe culverins on the wall finally answered those out in the field, but\nthe shots were wild, not even close to the field artillery emplacements or the\ncharging color wights. And more of King Garadul’s shots were hitting the\nwall itself, each rebounding off the yellow luxin with a crunch and a whine\nand a splay of yellow light as the wall absorbed the blow and healed itself.\nThe forms Gavin was filling with luxin were three-quarters full,\nwashing him in the invigorating scents so close to mint and eucalyptus, but\nhe was tiring anyway. He looked out to the color wights. Not even two\nminutes left.\nOrholam, I’m trying to do something good here. Great purpose,\nOrholam. Selfless and all that.

The crowd was beginning to\nscatter. Everyone was shouting, but Gavin couldn’t even make out the\nwords anymore.\nFlashes of magic bloomed in front of him. The color wights had\nspotted him. They were throwing missiles and fire and everything they\ncould think of, but his Blackguards were deflecting it all.\nGavin kept drafting. The color wights were only two hundred paces\nout now, running at a full sprint. He had only seconds left. A cannon roared\nto Gavin’s right and tore through a dozen of the color wights, shredding\nthem. But the color wights behind them leapt through the blood and smoke\nand flying limbs, faces snarling, inhuman, glowing.\nDrafting the last of the yellow luxin to fill the last form, Gavin pulled\nthe threads together in his hand. He was going to make it! He was sealing\nthe luxin when a cannonball smashed into the forms. All the force of the\nimpossibly lucky shot went straight into Gavin’s hands. It was like holding\na rope and having someone drop an anvil tied to the other side.\nThe luxin was yanked out of Gavin’s hands instantaneously. Gate and\ncannonball slammed into the ground beneath the arch, the cannonball\nblasting through Blackguards and a dozen still-gawking civilians behind\nthem. The gate—abruptly unheld, unsealed yellow luxin—hissed and\nseethed into light before Gavin could stop it.\nIn two seconds, the gate flashboiled into nothingness and disappeared\n—and so did Garriston’s hope.\nChapter 73\nGavin collapsed. Or he would have, if two Blackguards hadn’t caught him\nand dragged him away from the brink. He wanted to fight them, to stand up,\nbut he was so lightheaded he couldn’t even make words.\nHe missed the first clash, right below his perch, but he heard it, felt it.\nThe yells of men and women bracing themselves, giving voice to fear and\nrage, honing their will for their drafting. Then waves of heat and the shock\nof impact, armor popping, men and wights grunting. Then, screams, always\nscreams.\n“Where are my muskets?! I ordered those brought here two hours\nago!” General Danavis was screaming. Swearing. He was standing ten\npaces from Gavin, looking through the murder holes and machicolations at\nthe battle beneath the arch of the gate. His soldiers were blinking at him.\nOut of twenty men, only two had muskets. “Fire, damn you!” he shouted at\nthem. “You, and you, go find muskets. Now!” Then he was gone, screaming\nat the artillery crews.\nThe Blackguards pulled Gavin to the edge of the wall. The cowl on the\nwall meant there were only a few places open on either the front or the\nback. They found one where the cranes pulled in goods. A Blackguard\nbichrome drafted a blue-green slide all the way to the ground.\n“What are you doing?” Gavin managed.\n“We’re taking you to safety, sir.” Then the man jumped onto the slide.\nGavin was looking through the bright hallway formed by the bonnet to"

They had fired a ball and were looking downfield\n—the sign of an inexperienced crew. Only one man needed to watch so they\ncould adjust their aim. The rest should be reloading already. But after a\nmoment, they cheered. “Got it!” Gavin couldn’t see what they’d hit, but as\nthey turned back to their task, he saw a flash of movement.\n“It’s safe!” the Blackguard called up from the ground at the base of\nBrightwater Wall.\nGreen claws latched onto the wall just in front of the artillery team.\nWhat? Gavin had known green wights to infuse their legs with the\nspringiness of green luxin, but he’d never seen one jump even half the\nheight of this wall. He cried out, pointing, but not before the beast flung\nitself upon the artillerymen. Its hands, grown into huge claws, tore through\nfour men before they even knew it was there. Blood was flung in broad\narcs, splattering against the walls. The last three men saw the beast, but\nfroze. Only one even made an attempt to grab a musket from the wall.\nThe green wight clove the man’s head in three, two broad claws\ndescending halfway through his head.\nThe Blackguards hesitated for only half a second. None of them had\never seen a color wight either. Four Blackguards stepped forward, almost\nsimultaneously. The two in front went to one knee, clearing firing lanes over\ntheir heads. Their hands dipped in unison, one hand coming up to draft, the\nother coming up with a pistol.\nTriggers clicked, and flints struck, but in the two seconds it took to fire\na pistol, luxin was already streaking out from every drafter. A ball of blue\nluxin like a fist hammered the green wight toward a wall. A glob of red\nluxin splattered across its side and back and made it stick to the wall. Slick\norange smeared the floor in case it pulled away. But that wasn’t necessary.\nThe green wight’s claws were still stuck in the unfortunate gunner’s head,\nand it had no time to react before the last Blackguard’s flames hit the red\nluxin and set it alight.\nThe next moment, three guns roared. All three hit the green wight’s\nchest. Green luxin and all too human red blood burst from the wounds. The\nwight would have collapsed, but the red luxin held it to the wall, even as it\nburned.\n“Black out!” One of the Blackguards yelled. She stepped forward,\nalready pouring more powder in her flashpan. Apparently hers had been the\ngun that misfired. She cocked the gun, aimed, and pulled the trigger. A\nsecond later, it blew the still-burning green wight’s head apart.\nThe Blackguards were already reloading their pistols. For most of\nthem, Gavin knew, it was their very first battle. First blood. Yet each\nreloaded his or her pistol without looking. It was something they were\ntaught to do only when there was extreme and pressing danger—visually\ninspecting a pistol was usually a good idea to prevent misfires and double-"

It was something they were\ntaught to do only when there was extreme and pressing danger—visually\ninspecting a pistol was usually a good idea to prevent misfires and double-\ncharging—but it was worth it to not have to take your eyes off the\nbattlefield sometimes, and all of them had the presence of mind to do it\ncorrectly.\n“Tell General Danavis to withdraw the cowl,” Gavin said. The cowl\nwas keeping the green wights from getting in anywhere except at the\nartillery stations, but it left those men totally vulnerable. And while the\nBlackguards had all hit their target—now slumped on the floor, bleeding out\nand barely smoking—the other defenders wouldn’t be so accurate. The\ncowl transformed the top of the wall into a yellow luxin tunnel. That meant\nricochets. Ricochets meant anyone who missed a shot at an attacker would\nprobably kill a defender. It wasn’t worth the tradeoffs, especially because\nKing Garadul’s culverins and howitzers had stopped firing so they wouldn’t\nkill the color wights.\nGeneral Danavis must have realized the same thing, though, because\nbefore the Blackguards could argue that they couldn’t send even one of\ntheir own away from Gavin, the cowl slid back. The sudden motion\nknocked several defenders off the wall, the fall guaranteeing maiming or\ndeath. But it had to be done.\nIt also snapped the slide that the Blackguards had made for Gavin. But\nin moments they remade it and threw him unceremoniously down. He\ncouldn’t even catch himself. The sheer amount of luxin he’d drafted today\nhad left him with nothing.\nThe Blackguards at the bottom of the slide caught him and lifted him\nto his feet. He was able to stand.\n“Take me to the gate,” Gavin ordered.\nThe Blackguards looked at each other.\n“Damn you! Lose the gate, lose the wall. We lose the wall, we lose the\ncity.”\n“This city isn’t our concern. Your safety is,” a voice shouted.\nTremblefist. He’d appeared from nowhere. “You can stand, can you run?”\nhe asked Gavin.\n“I’m not running!”\n“We can’t hold the gate!” Tremblefist shouted. “My Guards are getting\nslaughtered, and for what? We’re not your personal army. We protect your\nlife, not your whims. You’re making our job impossible!”\nGavin’s failure spun out before him. This was his own fault. It wasn’t\nhis drafting that had failed, it was his leadership. He’d never told these men\nand women why they fought. He’d demanded obedience unto death without\neven telling them why it was important. He’d been divided in his own mind\nand now he was surprised that they didn’t want to die for that? A lie would\nhave been better.\nAll he could see through the press of the soldiers between himself and\nthe gate was flashes of fire, and smoke, and blood splashed high against the\narch. The Blackguards were doubtless still in the front line—only the\nBlackguard could have stood for so long against the number of color wights\nGavin had seen coming. The crackle of musket fire was constant but slow.\nThe soldiers between Gavin and the fight had no idea about establishing fire"

The crackle of musket fire was constant but slow.\nThe soldiers between Gavin and the fight had no idea about establishing fire\nlanes, so men farther back didn’t shoot for fear of striking those in front of\nthem. But so far, no one was turning back.\nOf course, that would change when they saw their best fighters retreat,\nabandon them. The Blackguards were the linchpin.\nWith a roar of frustration, Gavin grabbed a nearby soldier’s musket\nand ran toward the gate. He could hear Tremblefist’s curse, and had no\ndoubt the big man would be hot on his heels. He pushed and weaved\nthrough the crowd, his size slowing him, but not as much as Tremblefist’s\neven bigger size.\nGavin was cursing, screaming at men and women to move out of his\nway, when he heard a crunch of impact. A moment later, there was a surge\nfrom the gate, pushing everyone back a good five paces. Gavin cut across a\nline of soldiers to the wall. He grappled across a section where the image of\na huge warrior stood, stoic, unmoving except for breathing, little puffs of\nsteam escaping from his mouth. He touched a few sections—damn it, he\nshould have done something to demarcate the appropriate place—until he\nfound the one he was looking for. He touched it—anyone could touch it, it\nactivated from the heat in a man’s hand—and a little window of the wall\nwent transparent.\nHe was right. The crunch had been the impact of the regular soldiers\narriving. There were tens of thousands of them pressed against the wall\nright now, already hefting scaling ladders and ropes. He couldn’t wait for\nthem to find his little surprise—but none of that mattered if they couldn’t\nhold the gate.\nLooking to the sun, Gavin saw it was touching the horizon. Not long\nnow. If they could make it until the sun had fully set, the drafters’ power\nwould be more than halved. They could still draft from diffracted light, but\nnot nearly as strongly. He started running again, pushing through men and\nwomen directly against the wall. He heard the whistle of an incoming\nmortar.\nThe pitch was familiar, horribly familiar. A sound that replayed in his\nnightmares. You could hear death coming, but other than cowering on the\nground, there wasn’t anything you could do to avoid it. The thump and\nboom of the shell landing and exploding going Thboom, shattering\neardrums and blasting men off their feet. This one was getting really really\nloud—\nGavin dropped to the ground and covered his head with his arms.\nSomething heavy crushed him farther into the ground, and the world\noutside went blue.\nThump!\nTremblefist rolled off Gavin and dissolved the blue shield he’d drafted\nover them both. Gavin stared at the cannon shell, embedded in the earth not\nten paces away. It hadn’t exploded. It hadn’t even crushed anyone. It had\nlanded right between two lines of soldiers. One man was dancing around,\nshaking his hand. His crushed musket lay beneath the mortar itself, knocked\nout of his hand by the shell. It was right about where Gavin had been before\nhe cut toward the wall."

It was right about where Gavin had been before\nhe cut toward the wall.\n“Orholam’s hand is on you indeed, you damn fool Prism,” Tremblefist\nsaid.\nGavin was already up and pushing toward the heaving, bulging lines in\nfront of him. The men here had already fired their muskets and there was no\nway to reload. Some had fixed bayonets, the knife handles set inside the\nopen barrels. Others had drawn swords. Others were using muskets as\nclubs.\nOver their heads, musket fire rang out from the murder holes and\nstones the size of a man’s head were thrown through the machicolations in\nthe arch. But no luxin poured down. Either the drafters above had exhausted\nthemselves long ago, or they’d been killed, or they had never made it to\ntheir positions.\nOne more day, Orholam. One more day, and this wall would have been\nimpregnable. One more hour.\nGavin pushed into the melee at last. The area around the gate was a\ncharnel house. The stench of magic and gore mingled. Blood covered the\nground thickly enough that the combatants splashed it up around their legs\nas they fought. The bodies of men and monsters mingled, tripped up\nattackers and defenders. A pile of bodies filled the area directly beneath the\ngate, and as King Garadul’s men climbed up and over them, that made them\ntargets for the soldiers farther back in Gavin’s army who otherwise couldn’t\nshoot for fear of hitting their own men. Gavin saw a Blackguard fall, her leg\nripped open by a glasslike jagged foot claw of an exhausted blue wight.\nHis musket roared and the wight’s head exploded in red mist. Gavin\nflung the musket at a burning red wight that was moving to embrace a\nwounded soldier who was backed up against the wall, weaponless. He\ndidn’t see what happened. He grabbed the wounded Blackguard and tried to\nhaul her to her feet.\nShe was far heavier than she should have been. Gavin blinked, his\nexhaustion coming back to him in a rush. No, he was just weak. Someone\ngrabbed the wounded woman from him and hauled her off, and the sounds\nof the battle took on an eerie, tinny quality. He could hear incoming mortars\n—too distant to matter, but several of them. He could hear men screaming,\nthe wordless roars of those running to what they knew was likely death. He\nheard the whimpers of the wounded, saw a woman in that great pile of\nbodies at the gate trying to crawl away, wounded but not dead. Next to her a\nman was clawing at the air, blind because he was missing half of his face.\nLuxin fires burned on a dozen corpses, and luxin dust was everywhere.\nGavin caught a glimpse of the faces of his Blackguards. He could see their\ndelight, their sudden purpose—where were the rest of them? They were\nrushing over to him.\nHe pulled his pistols from his sash.

If Gavin hadn’t arrived\nso late to the battle, it would have drafted instead and incinerated him. He\npulled the trigger. His dagger-pistol, being Ilytian make, fired instantly. The\nball punched into the red wight’s chest but didn’t stop its momentum. Gavin\nstepped to the side and slashed the blade of the dagger across the wight’s\nthroat as it fell. He stumbled, almost went down.\nHe was more aware of than actually saw the two Blackguards streak\npast him. By the time he recovered and was standing once more, one\nBlackguard had been impaled on a great blue luxin sword that a blue wight\nhad drafted in the place of its right arm. Even dying, the Blackguard had\nlatched on with both hands to keep the wight from throwing him clear. The\nother Blackguard—Gavin thought his name was Amestan—had circled the\ncreature and hacked a sword at its neck. Once, twice—blue luxin shards\nexploding at each great impact. The creature struggled to free itself but\ncouldn’t. On the third cut, Amestan’s sword broke through the blue luxin\nand went into its neck. That wight’s will was broken, and Amestan’s fourth\ncut severed its head.\nOne of King Garadul’s Mirrormen—what the hell were they doing\nhere?—came over the top of the bodies piled chest deep, scrabbling, using\nhis hands, his drawn sword awkward. He saw Amestan’s back to him and\ncharged.\nInstinctively, Gavin tried to lash out with luxin, but even the touch of\nmagic made him want to vomit. It was like offering drink to a man with a\nhangover. He weaved, almost lost consciousness, leveled the pistol, fired.\nAt the last moment, Amestan spun to face his attacker—and moved\ndirectly into the line of fire. Gavin’s shot blew off the back of his head. A\nsecond later, the Mirrorman ran Amestan through, but he was already dead.\n“No!” Gavin yelled. An entire line of Mirrormen appeared over the\npile of bodies. King Garadul had realized the same thing Gavin had. The\ngate had to be taken tonight, or the wall would never be taken at all. So the\nking had sent his own personal guard to get it done. There were only maybe\nthirty Blackguards left, and the appearance of the dazzling Mirrormen\nwould easily be enough to make the defenders break. Especially without the\nBlackguards.\nIt wasn’t right that so much valor should result in failure. So much\ndeath. Gavin wasn’t thinking clearly. He knew that. He didn’t care.\nAs the sun’s last rays kissed the earth, Gavin drafted. It was like\ndrinking vomit. It was like diving headfirst into sewage. It was too much for\nhis body. He didn’t care. He threw everything he had into this. This wasn’t\nfor Gavin Guile. To hell with Gavin Guile. This was for everyone who’d\nfought and died for him. They’d stood for him. He couldn’t fail them, not\neven if it meant his life."

He couldn’t fail them, not\neven if it meant his life.\nThe magic was like a second sun being born within the gate arch. In\nmoments, it was born, stood, and leapt forward. The Mirrormen became\nradiant, their mirror armor reflecting light a thousand directions. But mirror\narmor was to magic like normal armor was to weapons: good for deflecting\nglancing blows, but nowhere close to invincible. A rushing wind filled\nGavin’s ears an instant before a cone of pure magic swept through him and\nblasted forth, exploding to the width of the entire gate. The gate became\nlike the barrel of a vast cannon. The Mirrormen went incandescent, standing\nfor a moment longer than seemed possible, their armor glowing, then\nglowing red-hot, then glowing white-hot, then ripping apart like everything\nelse.\nA concussion rocked the earth at the power of the blast, and only\nGavin didn’t fall. He rode the earth, magic bursting forth like he was\nnothing more than the tip of a volcano, the barrel of a musket.\nThen, not five seconds after it started, it was gone.\nThe gate area was scoured clean. The bodies were gone, and a wide\narea around the gate on King Garadul’s side was scorched and blackened.\nThere was stunned silence—either that, or Gavin had gone deaf. He\nstood, looking out, and a figure stumbled into his view. A big man, dressed\nin rich clothes, now blackened. King Garadul. Evidently the man hadn’t just\nsent his personal guards to attack the gate; he’d come with them.\nGavin and Garadul stood, facing each other, forty paces away. Gavin\ncould read the awe and uncertainty in the big man’s very stance.\nThen Gavin’s body gave out. He collapsed. There was something white\nin the dirt near his face, or he was going blind. Spots swam in every color\nbefore his eyes.\nMen were lifting him, carrying him away, and he heard the distant\nsounds of renewed battle. As the Blackguards lifted him, surrounding him\nwith their bodies and withdrawing from the field, he saw King Garadul\nthrough the open gate, charging the gate—alone. Whatever else Gavin had\ndone, he’d destroyed the barricade and every other impediment in that area.\nA few men joined their king. The dirt around Rask was exploding in little\npuffs as snipers tried to kill him, but none hit. It was like the man was\ncharmed, blessed, protected by some old god mightier than Orholam.\nThen Gavin saw Tremblefist’s bloodied, gunpowder-streaked face.\n“Forgive me, Lord Prism,” the Blackguard was saying. “You did everything\nyou could. More. Now—” Then Gavin lost consciousness.\nChapter 74\nAs night fell, the plain didn’t darken. At first, Liv had no idea why.

Along with what appeared to be half of the\nentire camp, she went forward to see what was so bright.\nThere were so many people covering the plain that Liv almost missed\nthe signs of the battle that had concluded mere hours before, obvious as\nthey were. Trenches where cannonballs had landed simply became ditches\nfor the wagons to avoid. Slippery, muddy, bloody areas next to those\ncannon scars, with fragments of armor littered about, were just places to\nwatch your footing in the near-darkness. The pungent aroma of gunpowder\nwas already dissipating.\nThe last of the great lines of soldiers were marching through the gate\neven now, forcing all the camp followers to wait until after they’d gone\ninside and set up camp. Liv heard wild rumors of huge magical\nconflagrations, an epic battle, but she was skeptical. King Garadul’s army\nhad taken the wall in an afternoon. It couldn’t have been much of a fight.\nHer father was a great general. He’d only lost one battle in his life, and that\nbarely. He must have decided that they wouldn’t finish the wall in time and\nhad withdrawn to the city walls. He’d probably just had some cannoneers\nstay to inflict some easy damage on King Garadul’s men and then withdraw.\nThe thought made Liv feel better. If her father had chosen to make his\nstand elsewhere, then he surely wouldn’t have been in danger today. The\nidea that he might have fought and died less than a league away and that she\nhadn’t had so much as a sick intuition was too terrible to entertain. She’d\nbeen so caught up in looking for Kip that she hadn’t even realized they were\nthis close to the city.\nBut all thoughts and worries and distractions faded as she pushed\nthrough the crowds lined up looking at the wall. No one went within fifty\npaces of it. As Liv finally pushed to the front, she saw why. An enormous\nspider, larger than a man, had strung up a dozen corpses—no, not corpses,\nat least one of the web-wrapped bundles was struggling. As Liv watched,\nthe man tore his head free, his hands bound tight up against his chest.\nUpside down, the man wriggled, trying to free his arm, setting himself\nswinging gently. The spider didn’t notice as it tended to another bundle ten\npaces away.\nLiv saw a sword stuck in the ground not far from the man. He tore his\nright arm free and began clawing at the rest of the webs holding him, but\ncouldn’t rip them open. Then he saw the sword. He swung, reaching for it.\nDidn’t quite reach it.\n“Orholam save him!” someone breathed in the crowd.\n“Look at the spider!”\nThe spider had frozen as if it heard something. Then it turned, just as\nthe man swung farther. It turned, eyes glowing a sickly green.\nThe man’s hands closed on the sword hilt just as the spider pounced.\nHe swung, missed, and the spider’s jaws closed on his neck. For one terrible\ninstant the man’s entire body tensed, face contorting in pain. Then those"

Then those\nawful jaws scissored together, and his head fell to the ground and rolled.\nHis free arm—still holding the sword—spasmed for several long moments\nas blood gushed out of his neck onto the ground. Then he dropped the\nsword. It speared into the ground, right where he’d left it.\nThe spider latched onto his bleeding neck and began feeding.\nLiv heard someone retch. Others muttered prayers and curses.\nShe was transfixed, as was everyone else. Eventually, the spider\npushed the man’s arm back against his chest and wrapped him in webs once\nmore. Then it picked up his head and put it back with his body.\nWhile the spider was fixing the webs, wrapping the man’s head back in\nplace, one of the other bundles began moving.\n“I been watching for two hours,” a man next to Liv said. “They don’t\nnone of them get away. This fella gets about thirty paces before she rips out\nhis guts. Them two try to fight her together. It’s the same every time. I know\nit, but I can’t stop watching.”\nThe same every time? Liv looked back to the first man and position of\nthe sword below him. It was the same as before—exactly the same. The\nblood that that pooled beneath his severed head had slowly receded to\nnothingness. This wasn’t a murder; it was a mummer’s show. Which\nactually didn’t make it any less impressive.\n“What are you doing?” someone called out behind Liv.\nShe hadn’t even realized she was walking forward, but she didn’t stop.\nAs she got closer, it became more and more apparent that she’d been right.\nShe walked closer as—sure enough—the second man tore free and ran\naway. But then the spider stopped in its pursuit, froze, and turned. The\ncrowd behind Liv gasped. The spider bounded back with great speed, going\nstraight for Liv.\nLiv froze, her heart leaping into her throat. The spider stopped, right in\nfront of her, great pincer jaws snapping together, forelegs lifted to grab her.\nToo frightened to move, Liv watched those jaws clack-clack together, not\nten paces away. Clack-clack…\nSoundlessly?\nLiv let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. She tightened\nher eyes and saw that the ground around her was laced with superviolet\ntriggers. Brilliant. She stepped to her left, and the spider didn’t move until\nshe stepped into the next zone, and then it was there, fast. And now that she\nwas this close, she could see that the cavern behind the spider looked all\nwrong. It wasn’t nearly as deep as it appeared from fifty paces out. It was\nlike a painting, with light and shadow used to make it appear that there was\nan entire cave where there was none. And the spider itself was crafted\nentirely of primary, stable luxin colors, layered so that it wouldn’t be\nobvious that it was a luxin creation.\nAs Liv moved past the triggers, the spider went bounding after the man\nwho had “escaped,” but somehow hadn’t taken advantage of the last thirty\nseconds to actually run away. The spider ripped out his guts, just as the man\nhad said."

The spider ripped out his guts, just as the man\nhad said.\nLiv touched the luxin of the wall and immediately forgot about the\ngenius of the spider mummery. The yellow luxin was flawless. It was\nperfection.\nForgetting where she was, she drafted directly from the yellow glow of\nthe wall. Drafting from yellow luxin had once been pursued as the perfect\nsource of light—at least for yellows—but it had never panned out.\nSomething was always lost, it was always inefficient. But with an entire\nwall, leagues long, inefficiency didn’t matter. Liv drew a little torch of solid\nluxin into her hand to better see the wall when illuminated by a second\nsource of light. Sometimes drafters hid things in their construction that—\n“Hey! Mistress! What are you doing out here? All drafters are\nsupposed to be inside the walls already.”\nStartled, Liv saw a grizzled old soldier coming toward her, wearing the\nuniform of a Tyrean sergeant, a brace of nice wheellock pistols at his belt\nand an empty scabbard. His face was smudged with gunpowder or smoke\nand there were light bandages wrapped around his hands. He glanced at\nLiv’s forearms as he approached.\n“I, uh—” She tried desperately to remember the lie she’d prepared in\ncase someone asked her about her lack of the colored vambraces.\n“You’re dazzled by Brightwater Wall. I know, all the drafters is.\nWhere’re your arms?”\nArms? Liv guessed he meant the color vambraces all the other drafters\nwore. “I, ahem, was invited to the color lords’ party last night and I had a\nbit much to drink, I’m afraid. I fell asleep behind a bush and my unit either\ndidn’t find me or thought it would be funny to leave me there mostly,\nahem…”\n“Naked?”\nLiv blushed as much from the brazenness of her lie as anything. “I’m\nlucky I still have my specs,” she said, showing him her yellow spectacles\ntucked in a pocket.\n“I’d probably drink a lot if I were asked to that party myself. Put on\nyour specs and go to the gate. They’ll let you through. Then go to\nQuartermaster Zid. He’s a real bastard and he’ll give you all sorts of\ntrouble, but… Ah, hell. Come with me, I’ll take you. That’s me, Master\nSergeant Galan Delelo, sucker for a pouty lip and a clueless gaze.”\n“Hey!” Liv said.\n“Joking, joking,” Galan said. “You actually remind me of my daughter.\nAnd if she’s clueless, she got it all from her father. Come on.” He turned.\n“And you, all you damned fools, it ain’t real. It’s just a show. Stop piddling\nyourselves.” He slapped the wall to emphasize his point and half the crowd\nducked at the sharp sound.\nMumbling to himself, he took her to the gate.

She’s not with the\nunits I supply. Forget it.”\n“You’re going to give me hell? Tonight? You crazy old ninny, do I\nneed to put my foot up your arse?”\n“Ninny? You come harping on me like a harridan and you expect roses\nand wine? I ought to pound that ugly nose of yours flat,” the hunchbacked\nman said.\nGalan laughed, rubbing a nose that had obviously been broken many\ntimes. “I seem to recall you trying that a time or two.”\nThe quartermaster grinned, and Liv’s terror faded as she realized the\ntwo were good friends.\n“I know you’re happy to see I’m alive,” Galan said. “So just do me a\nfavor and give the girl the rags.”\n“Yellow?” Zid asked. He poured the swords onto the counter, ignoring\nthe young soldier who tried and failed to grab all of them and almost\nskewered himself trying—unsuccessfully—to keep them on the counter.\n“Yes,” Liv said.\nHe grabbed a list. “Name?”\n“Liv.”\nHe scanned quickly. “No Livs, sorry. There’s not a yellow drafter\nnamed Liv in the entire army.”\nLiv’s mouth went dry.\n“You and you,” Zid said, pointing to some soldiers waiting, irritated, in\nline. “Arrest this woman. We’ll need to report an impostor—”\n“Oh for Orholam’s sake, Zid, whaddaya think she is, a spy? She’s\nprobably barely sixteen! What kind of a swiving fool would send a baby to\nspy on us?”\nAt the word “spy” Liv’s knees turned to water.\n“Maybe a very cunning fool, who thought we would discount her for\nthat very reason,” Zid said, suspicion leaking out of his very pores. “They\nsay Gavin Guile did. They say some boy over in the chirurgeons’ tents is his\nown bastard. Who’d send a child? Those wily bastards, that’s who.” He\nnodded vaguely toward Garriston.\n“I’m seventeen,” she said instead. What? Kip was in the chirurgeons’\ntents? Was he sick? Wounded? She was too flustered and scared to rejoice\nthat she’d just heard her first lead to Kip’s whereabouts.\n“Come on, Zid, those lists are barely good enough to wipe your arse on\nonce the fighting starts, you know that. It’s like you’ve never done this bef\n—”\n“Gotcha,” Zid said. He threw back his head and laughed. He threw\nsome yellow sleeves across the table. “That was for the ‘ninny’ crack. Now\nwe’re even.”"

And really, how\nhard could that be?\nNot for the first time in the last few days, Liv wanted to swear and\nthrow things and whine and complain, and—maybe just a little—she\nwanted to cry. Instead, she took a deep breath and headed deeper into camp.\nChapter 75\nWhen Gavin opened his eyes, it was bright out. There was a figure sitting\nbeside his bed. He looked at her. His mother.\n“Oh, thank Orholam. I thought I was awake,” Gavin said.\nFelia Guile laughed, and he knew he wasn’t dreaming. His mother’s\nlaughter sounded somehow freer than it had in years. “It’s almost noon, son.\nI know I hardly have to lecture you on duty, but you really should get up.”\n“Noon?” Gavin sat bolt upright. It was a mistake. His whole body hurt.\nHis head hurt. His eyes hurt. He held himself still while the hammer blows\nto the back of his head receded from ten-weight sledges to five-weight\nsledges and his eyes found focus once more. He usually didn’t get lightsick\n—but then, he’d never used so much magic as he had yesterday, either. Not\nsince Sundered Rock, and he’d been young then. “It’s almost noon on Sun\nDay?” he asked.\n“We thought it best to spare you greeting the sun and the dawn\nprocessional. It was going be a more informal Sun Day this year, regardless.\nOrholam will forgive us.”\n“Mother, what are you doing here?”\n“It’s time… Gavin.”\n“Time?”\n“For my Freeing.”\nGavin felt a wave of cold dread course down his body from head to\ntoe. No. Not his mother. She’d said sometime in the next five years. She’d\ngiven him time to prepare, but it couldn’t be this early. “Father?” he asked\ninstead.\nShe folded her hands in her lap, her voice holding quiet dignity. “Your\nfather has made far too many decisions for me. The Freeing is between a\ndrafter and Orholam.”\n“So he doesn’t know,” Gavin said.\n“I’m sure he knows by now,” she said, a little sparkle in her eyes.\n“You ran away?” And that would have been what it was, too. She\nwould have slipped out at night, bribed a ship captain some obscene\namount, and gone before Andross Guile’s spies could even report back. She\nwould have chosen the fastest ship in port so that even if Andross sent a\nship with the next tide, his men would still arrive too late. It was, Gavin had"

It was, Gavin had\nto admit, brilliant.\nAnd it would not go over well with Andross Guile. Not at all.\nShe was quiet for a long moment. “Son, I’ve told your father I wished\nto join the Freeing every year for the last five years. He forbade it. I can feel\nmyself slipping away. I haven’t drafted for three years, and my life feels\ngray. I love your father dearly, but he’s always been a very selfish man.\nAndross wants to hold on to his life and his power forever, and he doesn’t\nwant to be alone. I… pity him, son, and I’ve given him these years for the\nlove we once shared. You know I’m loyal, but we both know he’ll see this\nas a betrayal. And I know that he’ll blame you rather than himself, but if I\nhave to choose between my duty to your father and my duty to Orholam…”\n“Orholam wins.”\nShe patted his knee. “I’ve sent a courier to Corvan Danavis—”\n“Corvan’s alive? At the wall, I was afraid…”\nShe smiled sadly. “He’s well. But your defenders lost the wall, despite\nyour heroics.”\nMy heroics. Only his mother could talk about his heroics without a\nhint of irony in her voice. What would you think about that, down in your\nprison, brother?\n“Anyway, I’ve sent a courier to let him know you’re awake. I’m glad\nto see him again. He’s a good man.” She knew, of course, that Corvan had\ntaken a life in exile in order for Gavin’s masquerade to work, but as always,\nshe was circumspect, just in case there were spies eavesdropping. Gavin’s\nmother had always had a gift for figuring out how to live her life and let her\nopinions be known despite the pressures of court life and the demands of\nprotocol, secrecy, and discretion. “I’ll see you tonight, son.”\nGavin got dressed slowly after she left, testing his body to see if he’d\ndone any permanent damage with yesterday’s exertions. He was sore, but he\nsurely deserved worse. His muscles would loosen up as the day progressed,\nand he thought he’d be ready to draft the necessities this evening. Past noon\non a Sun Day.\nThere was a quick little flurry of light knocks on the door, the tempo of\nan old song he and Corvan used to enjoy. The door opened.\nCorvan came in. “You’re up.” He sounded surprised.\n“Not much the worse for wear. Thanks for letting me sleep in, but you\nknow you need my help today. What’s the situation?” Gavin was lacing up\nhis shirt.\nCorvan grabbed Gavin’s face in both of his hands and stared in his\neyes. Gavin slapped his hands to knock them away, but Corvan held him\nfirmly.\n“What the hell are you doing?” Gavin demanded.\n“You should be dead,” Corvan said. “Do you remember how much you\ndrafted yesterday?”\n“I remember it vividly, thank you, including quite a headache that\nyou’re not making any better.”\nAfter staring for a few more moments, Corvan released him. “I’m"

They say there are signs when a Prism starts dying. I\nhave no idea what they are, but I figured if anything would break you, it\nwould be what you did yesterday. Even a Prism shouldn’t be able to draft\nthat much. But your eyes look fine.”\nGavin shrugged it off. “How did we lose the wall?”\nCorvan blew out a breath. “Rask Garadul is either brilliant and crazy,\nor just crazy, that’s how.”\n“So no one shot that moron as he charged the gate?”\n“They got lucky. I think you scared both sides half to death with…\nwith what you did. The snipers were shaking so hard they couldn’t hit an\neasy target. Then, when the men saw that Rask was charging and you had\nfallen, they thought you were dead—that he’d somehow defeated you. The\nBlackguards pulled out to take you to safety and most of the best Tyreans\nwe had had already been killed in the fighting.” He pinched his nose\nbetween his eyes. Tension headaches. Gavin had forgotten how Corvan\nalways got those when there was fighting to be done. Gavin could imagine\nit now—the Prism down, the elite Blackguards suddenly pulling out, and\nthe enemy charging as if unfazed by all Gavin had done. No wonder the\nTyreans had lost courage.\n“So King Garadul’s men joined his charge and what… our men\nmelted? Got massacred? What?”\n“They actually held the gate for a few minutes. They bungled the troop\nrefresher maneuvers I tried to teach them, though.” That was when fresh\nmusketeers with loaded weapons would switch with the frontline troops.\n“But they were passing loaded muskets up the ranks, handing back fired\nmuskets to be reloaded. They were losing ground, but not fast, and the wall\ndefenses were holding. It was getting dark—I thought we were going to\nhold it.”\n“And then?”\n“They ran out of powder.” He sighed. Gavin could tell that the general\ntook it as a personal failure. “There was plenty elsewhere, of course. I’d\nsent men to take care of it, but… war happens.” Confusion, or spies, or the\ncouriers being killed, or the wagon men who were supposed to bring the\nblack powder forward deserting, on top of officers not checking back in and\ndouble-checking that the orders had been followed, either through their own\ninexperience or cowardice or death. Any link in the entire chain could break\nwith an army in which few men had trained at all, and few units had trained\ntogether. It was simply that the supply of black powder was the link that had\nbroken.\nOf course, that wouldn’t have mattered if Gavin had built the damned\ngate first. Or if he’d been stronger. Or if that cannonball hadn’t crashed\nthrough his forms. But second-guessing was futile.\n“Our defenders broke and ran,” Corvan said. “King Garadul didn’t\nsend anyone after us. I managed a fairly orderly retreat for the men in the\nwall. I suppose Garadul thinks we’ll surrender. Maybe he thought mercy\nwould accomplish his objectives more quickly than wiping out as many"

Maybe he thought mercy\nwould accomplish his objectives more quickly than wiping out as many\nmen as he could. Or he didn’t want his men killing each other in the\ndarkness. Or he’s devout and this new religion of his forbids night fighting.”\n“Old religion, I think,” Gavin said.\n“They’re not giving any sign of attacking today.”\n“Sun Day is holy even to pagans,” Gavin said.\n“So we have until tomorrow. What do you want to do, Lord Prism?”\n“When you thought I was incapacitated, what did you decide to do?”\n“Whatever goodwill King Garadul gained in the city by sparing the\nmen who fled yesterday, he more than lost by using color wights in battle.\nThe city is wild with tales of monsters. They’re terrified. Two days ago, I\nwas worried they would turn against us in a heartbeat. They watched you\nbuild a wall to protect them, and they saw what you were protecting them\nfrom. So now they trust you and they revile the man who slaughtered their\nfriends with the help of abominations. This whole city is yours. If you show\nyour face, they’ll follow you to the gates of the evernight.”\n“Corvan. The question.”\nCorvan rubbed his neck. Hesitated. “We can’t win. The old stone wall\naround the city couldn’t keep out a determined mule. Rask took most of our\ngunpowder when he took the wall, and all of our cannons. Half our muskets\nwere left on the field as men dropped them when they fled. We’d be lucky\nto kill a few thousand before they took the inner wall, and once we start\nfighting street to street, we could kill quite a few at some choke points, but\neventually their numbers guarantee it will be a slaughter. With their\nnumbers and our lack of matériel, this city is indefensible. There’s no\nstrategy I can imagine in which we win. We can hurt them badly while we\nlose, but that’s not the same.” He grimaced. “I was preparing a retreat.”\n“A retreat.” Corvan Danavis had never lost a battle—well, if one didn’t\ncount Sundered Rock as a loss, which Gavin didn’t. If you mean to lose,\nand you do, in exactly the way you intended, it’s not really a loss, is it?\n“Even a retreat is beset with unforeseen difficulties, Lord Prism. The\npresence of the ‘monsters’ that put everyone in the city on our side also\nmeans everyone in the city wants out. They think they’ll be slaughtered and\neaten if they stay, and there’s no way we can evacuate so many people with\nthe ships and the time we have.”\nGavin rubbed his forehead. Threw on his ceremonial white cloak.\nStalled, basically. “Have our spies reported anything about Karris?” he\nasked, trying to sound disinterested. Not that Corvan would be fooled.\n“Still alive as of yesterday. I imagine he was planning to use her to\nbarter with, if he needed to.” Which now, of course, he wouldn’t. Meaning\nKarris had become expendable. Corvan didn’t have to say it aloud.\n“Kip or Liv or Ironfist?” If Gavin had been thinking, or a little less"

Corvan didn’t have to say it aloud.\n“Kip or Liv or Ironfist?” If Gavin had been thinking, or a little less\nself-centered, he’d have asked about Corvan’s daughter first.\n“No word,” Corvan said. His jaw was tight.\n“Which could be good news, right? If they’d done anything disastrous,\nour spies would be more likely to hear about it, right?”\nCorvan didn’t say anything for a while, refusing to take such weak\nsolace. He wasn’t a man to grasp after straws or to believe that tragedy\ncouldn’t befall him. The deaths of two wives had cured him of idealism.\n“Our spies did report that there’s some kind of king of the color wights, a\npolychrome wight. They’re calling him Lord Omnichrome. No word on\nwho he was before breaking the Pact—unless he’s a true wild polychrome.”\nGavin shrugged. Just another problem among hundreds, but he knew\nCorvan was laying all the potential problems on the table so Gavin could\nmake his own choices about what was and was not important.\n“What do you want to do, Lord Prism?”\nHe meant about the battle or the evacuation, of course.\n“I want to kill Rask Garadul.”\nCorvan said nothing, didn’t move to order an assassination or\nsomething similarly stupid.\nDamn him, but Gavin’s father had predicted even this. If you lose the\ncity, kill Rask Garadul, Andross Guile had said. Gavin had been sure he\ncould save the city—and hadn’t arranged assassins to kill Rask. He should\nhave done both. Too late now, unless Rask charged him tomorrow as\nfoolishly as he had done yesterday.\nGavin moved to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. He cleared his\nthroat, trying to remove the taste of failure. “I’ll help as much as I can while\nperforming my religious duties, but…” He cleared his throat again. Seven\nyears, seven great purposes. Here I was trying to do something good for\nonce. “I’ve failed, Corvan. Order the evacuation.”\nChapter 76\nJudging from the cold air licking his skin, it was well after midnight when\nKip was escorted through some kind of gate. He had to judge from the\ntemperature because he was wearing a blindfold, along with a black sack\nover his head, a noose around his neck, hands bound behind his back.\nOne of the guards who was accompanying him was cursing, quietly\nbut constantly, awed by something apparently called Brightwater Wall.\nThey passed through slowly, stopping and starting, some military sounding\nvoice barking, “Don’t stand there and pick your butts. Move deeper into\ncamp. You’re blocking everyone else.” Kip heard the crack of a whip like a\npistol shot, and the line started moving again.\nThe last couple of days had been like this. Kip had woken in darkness\n—darkness that turned out to be a blindfold, his hands bound at his sides.\nWhen he struggled to get it off, men had come. They removed the blindfold,\none stared at his eyes, pulling them wide open with rough fingers, then they\nblindfolded him again. His left hand was agony.

That first day—if it was\njust a day—they had dosed his wine with something foul that dulled his\npain and his senses.\nThey’d taken him to see Lord Omnichrome, withholding Kip’s dosed\nwine so he would be lucid, but they never removed the blindfold. They’d\nsat in a tent with many voices for hours, with Kip in agony, and then they’d\nleft. Apparently the lord was too busy to see him.\nAfter a while, Kip heard his guards arguing. A clever man would have\nfigured out some way to exploit their divisions. Kip just stood quietly,\nwondering when his next dose would be. His hand was throbbing.\nThey handed him off to someone else—literally handing over the\nnoose around his neck.\n“Aren’t you going to give him the poppy wine?” one of his guards\nasked.\n“Why waste good poppy on bad blubber?” the other guard asked. “I\nlike poppy wine my own self.”\n“Oh, that stuff tastes foul,” the first said. Kip could agree with that.\n“I don’t drink it for the taste,” the guard said, laughing. Kip could\nagree with that too. “Let’s go. I saw some women a ways back. With your\ncharm and my poppy wine…” He laughed again.\nKip was pulled into a wagon. He stumbled up the steps and nearly\nstrangled on the noose, but soon found his seat. The door was closed behind\nhim.\nSomeone loosened his noose, pulled it off, took off his hood, pulled off\nhis blindfold. “Kip?” she asked.\nKip blinked. Though the light in the violet room was dim, after two\ndays in total darkness it made his eyes water nonetheless. But through the\nblear of his tears, he made out Karris White Oak.\n“Karris?” he asked. Stupid question. Of course it’s her, you’re looking\nat her, you idiot.\n“Kip, what are you doing here?”\n“I’m here to rescue you,” he said. Then he laughed.\n“Kip, how much poppy wine did they give you?”\nIt had been hours since they’d given him wine, but he just laughed\nharder.\nKarris guided Kip to her pallet in the wagon. He fell asleep instantly. She\nstared at him. A hard, mean part of her wanted to hate him.\nMy son would be Kip’s age. Hell, Kip could be my son. He does have\nblue eyes, and my grandmother was Parian.\nWhat, you think brown skin and kinky hair skips a generation? Like\ntwins?\nKarris rubbed her face. It was an idle fantasy and she knew it. The son\nshe’d abandoned was Kip’s half brother, but any similarities they shared\nwould be because they shared Gavin as a father. And what a father he’d\nbeen, to both boys.\nShe had to get out of here.

        "text": "Eventually, she covered him with her blanket.\nChapter 77\nGavin survived the noon rituals. The luxiat, a perfectly well-intentioned\nyoung green, was shaking like a leaf through the whole thing. Garriston\nwasn’t exactly a prime posting, so no doubt the young man hadn’t expected\nto ever catch a glimpse of the Prism, much less meet him, much less be\nresponsible for performing the Sun Day ritual with him. They muddled\nthrough, Gavin prompting the young man with his lines two or three times.\nIt took an hour and a half—and that was with Gavin cutting short the list\nbeseeching Orholam’s blessing on every noble in the Seven Satrapies and\nevery official in the Chromeria.\n“If even Orholam can’t remember their names, maybe they aren’t all\nthat important, eh?” he told the luxiat, leaving the young man gawping.\nIt was early afternoon before he could escape. Escape being relative, of\ncourse. He had a dozen Blackguards, a secretary, four messengers, and a\ndozen city guards accompanying him. He went to the docks.\nHe found Corvan there, ably directing the mess. The crowd wasn’t as\nbad as he had assumed it would be. Perhaps people were holding out hope\nthat Gavin would save them. Perhaps after seeing him build an impossible\nwall, they thought his powers were unlimited. Perhaps some were simply\nreligiously observant—only absolutely necessary work was supposed to be\ndone on this holiest of days.\nGood thing staying alive doesn’t count as absolutely necessary.\nMany nobles were bartering with ship captains. Boxes of goods were\npiled on the docks—and plenty of goods that weren’t in boxes. Rolled-up\ntapestries that must have hung in families’ great halls, furniture with gold\nleaf paint, artwork, a maze of trunks packed with Orholam knew what.\n“Lord Prism,” General Danavis said, coming up to Gavin quickly.\n“Perfect timing.”\nWhich means you’re about to hand over some truly unpleasant duty.\n“I gave the order yesterday that no ships were to leave the harbor, in\ncase an evacuation became necessary. I let it be known that disobedience\nmeant seizure of the ship for the captain, and death for whoever hired him.”\nIt was a harsh sentence, but war called for harsh sentences. Whoever\ntook a ship out of the city early was condemning dozens to death if\nGarriston were overrun and a massacre began. The problem with harsh\nsentences was that someone always tried to call your bluff—once. “Who\nwas it?” Gavin asked. He thought he knew already.\n“Governor Crassos. His men fired on the Blackguards who went to\nstop them.”\nBlackguards? How’d Corvan get Blackguards to obey a “fetch me that\nprisoner” order? “Any hurt?”\n“No, Lord Prism.”\n“He’s here?” Gavin asked. He needed to get out of here. His entourage\nwas blocking Corvan’s people from coming and going through the street as\nthey needed to, and they were blocking access to the docks as well. But this\nhe wouldn’t dodge. It was better to handle these things in a way that\nreinforced the solemnity of the law, but it was best to handle them quickly\nbefore others disobeyed the same law and you ended up having to kill more.\nWhen the sands were running out of the glass, delayed justice was as bad as"

He’d just been\nsurrounded by guards much taller than he was, blocking him from sight. His\nhands were bound behind his back and one eye was swelling. A motley\ncollection of smugglers were brought forward with him, scruffy, hard-edged\nmen who’d taken on the job knowing the risks.\nGavin raised both hands over his head, throwing out a small fan of\nsparks. Anyone who hadn’t been looking before was now. “I hereby\nconvene this adjudication in the light of Orholam’s eye. Let justice be\ndone.”\nHeads bobbed all around the docks in acknowledgment of the sudden\nprayer. The accused were pushed roughly to their knees. Humility before\njustice.\nIf I’m going to block the docks, I might as well accomplish something\nwhile I’m here.\n“Governor, you’re accused of hiring a ship to flee the city, against the\norders of the general in charge. Is this true?”\n“General? I’m the governor of this shithole! No one tells me what to\ndo!”\n“Not even I?” Gavin asked. “The general was acting in my name,\ngiven explicit authority to do so. Did you hire this crew to leave the city?”\n“You’ve got fifty witnesses who’ll tell you I did. So what? We helped\nyou. My family stood by you in the war. You wouldn’t be here without us!”\nGovernor Crassos’s voice trailed to a whine. “You’re going to put these\npeasants in front of me?”\n“Captain,” Gavin said, turning away from the governor, “you\nacknowledge your attempt to flee?”\nThe captain looked around, defiant, unbroken, but not quite daring to\nmeet the Prism’s eye. Apparently everyone on the docks had seen the\nattempt. He had the air of a man who knew he was going to die and wanted\nto die well. He was holding his courage in a tight grip. “Yessir. The guvnor\nhired us last night. I already wanted out.” Of course he did. Every man with\na ship wanted out, and wanted out yesterday.\n“It is an old tradition,” Gavin said loudly, for the assembled crowd, “to\ngrant one pardon on Sun Day. As Orholam is merciful, so should we be\nmerciful.”\n“Oh, thank Orholam and his Prism among us,” Governor Crassos said,\nstruggling to his feet. “You won’t regret this, Lord Prism.”\nGavin drafted superviolet for its invisibility and smacked it across the\nback of Crassos’s knees, never even looking at him. The man dropped.\nGavin addressed the captain. “Captain, by rights I should lock you in a cell\nand leave you there to whatever fate might find you. Instead, I’m going to\nrelease you, and I’m going to give you my ship—the ship you forfeited—\nand your crew. I’ll be watching you, Captain. Serve well.”\nThe captain looked poleaxed. Then, embarrassingly, his eyes welled\nwith sudden tears."

Then, embarrassingly, his eyes welled\nwith sudden tears.\n“What?!” Crassos demanded.\n“Governor Crassos, you have disobeyed my order and demeaned your\noffice. A governor is to bear up his people, not weigh them down. You have\nstolen from the people Orholam gave you the duty to lead. You are a thief\nand a coward. I hereby strip you of your governorship. You wanted to take\nyour riches and leave? So be it.”\nGavin selected a trunk from among those Crassos had taken with him.\nIt was full of rich clothing, large, and so heavy that one man would have\ntrouble holding it. He shot large holes in the top, bottom, and sides. He gave\norders and guards put the trunk in Crassos’s arms and then bound it to him\nwith ropes.\n“You can’t do this,” Crassos said.\n“It’s done,” Gavin said. “Your only choice now is how you face it.”\n“My family will hear of this!” Crassos said.\n“Then let them hear you died like a man,” Gavin said.\nIt was like Gavin had slapped the man across the face. His family\nobviously meant everything to him.\nGavin drafted a blue platform out into the water. “You wanted to flee,\nLord Crassos? Go.”\nWithout hesitation, Lord Crassos walked down the steps of blue luxin\nand out onto the water, carrying his trunk. He got out about fifteen paces\nbefore the luxin cracked and he fell into the water. In moments, he was\nkicking to keep the buoyant chest from bobbing over his head and drowning\nhim.\nThe tide was just turning, so he merely sloshed back and forth, neither\npushed in closer to shore nor washed out toward the other piers or toward\nthe Guardian and the open sea.\nA thousand pairs of eyes watched him, silently. In a minute, he wasn’t\nhaving to kick so hard to keep the trunk from pushing him under—because\nthe trunk wasn’t floating as high in the water. He was trying to stare\ndefiantly toward the dock, toward Gavin, but his wet hair was falling in\nfront of his eyes, and he couldn’t seem to shake his head enough to get it\nout of them.\nHe screamed something right before he went under. Gavin couldn’t\nunderstand him. More death. He hadn’t liked Crassos, hated his attitude,\nhated the type of noble he represented, who took and took and never\nthought to give a crumb back. But he’d just killed a man, made enemies of\nhis family—and this in the midst of a war that would have done the job for\nhim.\nGavin watched for the bubbles and didn’t see any. Crassos had floated\ntoo far out. Gavin raised his hands, and then brought them in. “Orholam\nhave mercy,” he announced, bringing the adjudication to a close. He’d\nalready spent too much time here. He turned.\nBehind him in the bay, a shark’s fin cut the water like an arrow headed\nfor its target.\nChapter 78\nAt sunset, Gavin had finished the most public of the rituals of the day.

It was one\npart of the day he could feel good about. He always performed nearly\nnaked. Colors bloomed and raced through his body, out of his body, and\ngave the appearance of going back into him.\nIt hurt a little to use so much magic after yesterday’s fight, but it was\none thing he wouldn’t compromise.\nAll too soon, however, it was over, and people were retiring to their\nparties. The parties would go all night. Sun Day lasted until the next dawn.\nThe parties of those to be Freed would begin at full dark. He was sitting in a\nlittle chapel in the fortress. He had a few minutes, supposedly to pray.\nThere was a time when he had used it to pray. No more. If Orholam\nwas real, he was busy, he was asleep, he didn’t care, he was taking a shit.\nTime was different to Orholam, they said. That would explain why he’d\nbeen doing it for Gavin’s entire life.\nGavin’s chest felt tight. He was having trouble breathing. The chapel\nseemed too small, too dark. He was sweating, cold, clammy sweat. He\nclosed his eyes.\nGet some balls, Gavin. You can do this. You’ve done it before. This is\nfor them.\nIt’s a lie. It’s all a lie.\nIt’s better than the alternative. Breathe. This isn’t for you. You want to\ngo out there and tell those drafters waiting for you that their entire lives are\na fraud? That their service is a waste? That Orholam doesn’t see their\nsacrifice? That what they’ve done, what they’ve given, doesn’t matter?\nEveryone dies, Gavin, don’t rob it of meaning for these people. Don’t make\nthem see themselves as worthless. Their sacrifice as empty. All life as\nmeaningless.\nIt was the same debate he had with himself every year. He’d even\nbrought a bucket with him into the chapel, along with extra incense. He\nthrew up, some years.\nThere was a knock at the door of the chapel.\n“Lord Prism, it’s time.”\nKip wasn’t blindfolded the next night. Instead, they gave him darkened\nglasses, bound them around the back of his head, pulling them tight against\nhis eyes, and ripped the sleeves off his shirt. It would be hard to draft, and\nanyone around him would have ample warning.\n“Apparently there’s something they want us to see,” Karris said as the\nguards, Mirrormen and drafters, hustled them out of the wagon they’d been\nsharing.\nThey were brought to a security perimeter out away from the tents. It\nwas oddly separate from the rest of the camp, given far too much room. The\nperimeter itself was simply a rope strung between posts pounded quickly\ninto the ground, but it was huge—and no one from the camp even came\nclose to violating the circle. Inside, looking tiny compared to the size of the\ncircle, was a crowd gathered before a platform. The sun had fully set, but it\nwasn’t yet dark.\n“They don’t want to be overheard,” Karris said. “Tells you how crazy"

They’re going to rally the troops with some idiocy any norm\nwould mock outright.”\nNorm? Oh, a person who couldn’t draft. Wait, that meant…\nAs they were walked closer, Kip saw that his inference was correct:\nevery single person here was a drafter. There had to be eight hundred or a\nthousand drafters here!\n“Orholam,” Karris breathed. “There must be five hundred drafters\nhere.”\nSo I can’t count, so what?\nBut even Kip’s bravado melted away as they got closer. His and\nKarris’s tenders pushed them into the crowd, and the first person they\npushed out of the way stared at them with wild green eyes. His halos were\ncracked, snakes of green wriggling through the whites of his eyes.\nKip felt like he was passing through a menagerie. It seemed almost\neveryone light-skinned enough for it to show had skin stained by luxin.\nGreen, blue, red, yellow, orange, even purple. When he looked into the\nsuperviolet, the superviolet drafters stood out like beacons. They’d worked\ndesigns into their cloaks, their armor, even their skin—all invisible to\nanyone but other superviolets. Adjusting his eyes, Kip saw that the sub-reds\nhad done the same, etching dragons, phoenixes, whorls, and flames onto\ntheir clothes. Blues wore spikes curling like rams’ horns, or knife edges\nalong their forearms. They passed an orange. The man looked normal\nexcept he’d slicked back his hair with orange luxin as if it were hair oil, and\nthe whites of his eyes were solid orange, leaving no differentiation from\nwhite to iris, only the tiny black dots of his pupils marring that perfect\ncolor. A green clad only in leaves hissed at them; then she laughed. A\nmenagerie indeed, except Kip was in the cage with the animals.\nThey were brought all the way to the front. The crowd was arrayed in\nfront of a stone rising out of the ground, its surfaces worn smooth by wind\nand rain, but tall enough to be a platform. As Kip and Karris arrived, a man\nclimbed up on the rock wearing a hooded cloak. He reached the top of the\nstone, threw back his hood, and tore off the cloak, throwing it aside as if it\ndisgusted him.\nThe man’s entire body glowed in the gathering dark. He stood, defiant,\nsilent, legs braced. He extended a hand toward the crowd, and at every five\npaces, in a wave, torches burst into flame, bathing them in light. Last,\ntorches ringing his stone platform caught fire, and Kip saw that the man was\nmade entirely of luxin. And he was glowing from within.\nAll around, drafters were dropping to their knees before Lord\nOmnichrome. But not all of them. Those who stood looked awkward,\nconflicted. For those who bowed weren’t just bowing, they were pressing\ntheir faces to the ground. This was pure religious devotion.\n“Don’t bow,” Karris said. “That’s no god.”"

This was pure religious devotion.\n“Don’t bow,” Karris said. “That’s no god.”\n“What is he?” Kip whispered.\n“My brother.”\nLord Omnichrome extended his hands. “Please, no. Brothers, sisters,\nstand. Stand with me. We have fallen prostrate before men for far too long.”\nThe orange drafter, the artist Aheyyad, fell prostrate before Gavin. He was\nto be the first of the night. It was an honored place, and Aheyyad deserved\nhonor. Real honor, not this travesty. But there was no way out. There never\nwas.\nGavin stepped forward. “Stand, my child,” he said. Usually, when he\ncalled the drafters “my child” he felt sardonic. But Aheyyad was a child, or\nat least barely a man.\nAheyyad stood. He met Gavin’s eyes, then quickly looked away.\n“You have something to say,” Gavin said. “This is the time.” Some\ndrafters felt the need to confess sins or secrets. Some made requests. Some\njust wanted to express a frustration, a fear, a doubt. Depending on the\nnumber of drafters to be Freed before dawn, each year Gavin took as much\ntime with each drafter as he could.\n“I failed you, Lord Prism,” Aheyyad said. “I failed my family. They\nalways said I was the son who could have been great. Instead, I’m a waste.\nAn addict. I’m the gifted one who couldn’t handle Orholam’s gift.” Bitter\ntears rolled down his cheeks. He still couldn’t look Gavin in the eye.\n“Look at me,” Gavin said. He took the young man’s face in his hands.\n“You joined me in the greatest work I have ever done. You did what I, the\nPrism, couldn’t do. Any man who has seen a sunset knows that Orholam\nvalues beauty. You made that wall as beautiful and terrible as Orholam\nhimself. What you did will stand for a thousand years.”\n“But we lost!”\n“We lost,” Gavin acknowledged. “My failure, not yours. Kingdoms\ncome and go, but that wall will protect thousands yet unborn. And it will\ninspire hundreds of thousands more. I couldn’t have done that. Only you\ncould. You, Aheyyad, have made beauty. Orholam gave you a gift, and you\nhave given a gift to the world. That doesn’t sound like failure to me. Your\nfamily will be proud. I am proud of you, Aheyyad. I will never forget you.\nYou have inspired me.”\nA quick grin flickered over the young man’s face. “It is a pretty great\npiece, huh?”\n“Not bad for your first try,” Gavin said.\nAheyyad laughed, his whole demeanor changed. He was a light\nindeed. A gift to the world, beautiful and so burning with life.\n“Are you ready, son?” Gavin asked.\n“Gavin Guile,” the young man said. “My Lord Prism. You, sir, are a\ngreat man, and a great Prism. Thank you. I am ready.”\n“Aheyyad Brightwater, Orholam gave you a gift,” Gavin began. The"

In Paria, the only people given\ntwo names were great men and women, and sometimes their children. From\nthe sudden tears welling in Aheyyad’s eyes and the deep breath he took, his\nchest swelling with pride, Gavin knew he’d said the perfect thing. “And you\nhave stewarded well the gift he gave you. It is time to lay your burden\ndown, Aheyyad Brightwater. You gave the full measure. Your service will\nnot be forgotten, but your failures are hereby blotted out, forgotten, erased.\nWell done, true and faithful servant. You have fulfilled the Pact.”\n“They say we take a Pact! We make an oath! And with that oath, they bind\nus, they bury us,” Lord Omnichrome said.\nLiv was pushing carefully through the throng, moving toward the\nfront. She swore she’d seen Kip led there, black spectacles bound to his\nhead. But everyone else was paying rapt attention to the freak up front, so\nshe couldn’t move too quickly. Instead, she pretended to listen, too, and\nmoved slowly.\n“Like this,” Lord Omnichrome said. He gestured to the rounded stone\non which he stood. “This is all that’s left of what was once a great\ncivilization. You have seen these relics scattered throughout this land.\nStatues of great men, broken by the pygmies who followed.” Liv’s ears\nperked up. Rekton had had a broken statue, out in an orange grove. No one\nhad ever said anything about where it came from. She thought that was\nbecause no one knew.\n“You think these statues are a mystery?” Lord Omnichrome asked.\n“They’re no mystery. You think it was a coincidence the Prisms’ War ended\nhere, in Tyrea? You think the Guiles simply wandered the Seven Satrapies\nuntil their armies found each other? And it happened to be here? Let me tell\nyou something you already know, something that all of you have believed\nbut no one dared to say: the wrong Guile won the Prisms’ War. Dazen Guile\nwas trying to change things, and they killed him for it. The Chromeria\nkilled Dazen Guile. They killed him because they were worried he would\nchange everything. They feared him, because Dazen Guile wanted to Free\nus.” There was some consternation in the crowd at that phrase. They all\nknew what day it was, and that the Prism was in Garriston, not even a\nleague away, performing the Freeing this very night.\n“You see?” Lord Omnichrome said. “You feel that uneasiness?\nBecause the Chromeria has twisted our very language against us. Dazen\nwanted to Free us. Dazen knew that light cannot be chained.”\n“Light cannot be chained,” some of the drafters echoed. It was an\nalmost religious refrain.\n“The Freeing, they call it. Lay your burdens down, the Prism says. I\ngive you absolution and freedom, he says. Do you know what he gives us?\nDo you know?!”\n“I give you absolution,” Gavin said, his heart in his throat as Aheyyad knelt"

Right in the heart. He withdrew the blade. A perfect\nthrust. But then, he’d had a lot of practice.\nHe didn’t look at the wound, didn’t watch the blood bloom on\nAheyyad’s shirt. He held the boy’s eyes as the life went out of them. And\nwhen it did, Gavin said, “Please forgive me. Please forgive me.”\nGavin had sheathed the dagger, and he was scrubbing his hands on the\nblood rag he carried—though they were clean. He stopped.\n“They murder you!” Lord Omnichrome shouted. “They stick a knife in you\nand watch you die. As you beg, they watch—and they say their god smiles\non this! Tell me, is this any way to treat our elders? Under the Chromeria,\nwe barely have elders. They’ve killed them all. Oh, except for the White.\nExcept for Andross Guile and his wife. The rules don’t apply to them, but\nyou and me, and our mothers and our fathers—we should be killed. They\nsay this is Orholam’s will. They say it is the Pact. Like something we swore\nto as ignorant children makes their murder of our parents good and right.\nWhat insanity is this? A woman serves the Seven Satrapies for all her life,\nand then as a reward, she’s murdered? Is this freedom? This is what they\ncall ‘Freeing’ her?”\nLiv caught sight of Kip, but she wasn’t pushing toward him anymore.\n“You know it’s wrong. I know it’s wrong. They know it’s wrong.\nThat’s why they speak about it in hushed tones and euphemisms. It’s not\njust. It’s not a Freeing, it’s a murder, let’s be clear about that. And then they\ndon’t even have the decency to give your body back to your family. They\nuse it in some dark ritual instead. Is that what our fathers served so long to\nget? Is that just? The Chromeria soils everything it touches. And do you\nthink that all who are ‘Freed’ have volunteered?”\nLord Omnichrome laughed derisively.\nAs the Blackguards took Aheyyad’s body out of the room, careful not to\nspill any blood, there was a single knock on the door. One strike, followed\nby nothing. It took Gavin a moment to remember: Bas the Simple had never\nreally understood knocking.\n“Come in, Bas,” Gavin said. Children and idiots. This is who I kill? I\nbathe in the blood of innocents.\nThe man came in. He was actually quite handsome dressed in his\nfinery. Unlike other simpletons Gavin had known, there was no sign of\nBas’s difference in his facial features.\n“I am sorry for coming out of turn, Lord Prism. I have a question, and\nI did not wish to interrupt my Freeing to ask it.”\nThat he was interrupting someone else’s Freeing to ask the question"

I have a question, and\nI did not wish to interrupt my Freeing to ask it.”\nThat he was interrupting someone else’s Freeing to ask the question\ndidn’t occur to him, of course.\n“Please, ask,” Gavin said.\n“I heard Evi Grass talking about Brightwater Wall. Evi is a\ngreen/yellow bichrome. She’s from the Blood Forest, but I don’t think she’s\nscary at all. My mother used to tell me that anyone with red hair is just as\nlike to set you on fire as look at you, but Evi isn’t like that.”\nGavin knew Evi well. Not classically bright, she was incredibly\nintuitive but rarely trusted herself. At least she hadn’t years ago.\n“Evi once saved me from a charging—”\n“What did she say, Bas?” Gavin asked.\n“She didn’t say anything, she just saved me. I guess she might have\nyelled. I couldn’t tell you for sure—”\n“What did Evi say about Brightwater Wall?”\n“I don’t like it when you interrupt, Lord Prism. It makes me nervous.”\nGavin stifled his impatience. Pushing harder would make Bas\ncompletely incapable of speech.\nBas saw that Gavin wasn’t going to push and then thought for a\nmoment. Gavin could see him find the mental path once more. “Evi said the\nbrightwater was drafted perfectly. She said she didn’t remember you being a\nsuperchromat. I can’t see the color differentiations myself, of course, but I\ndon’t think she’d lie, and Gavin Guile wasn’t a superchromat. His brother\nDazen was. And you’re taller than Gavin. He wore boots to make himself\nlook taller, but Dazen was taller by his thirteenth birthday. I remember that\nday. It was sunny. My grandmother said that Orholam had always smiled on\nthe Guiles. I was wearing my blue coat…”\nGavin wasn’t listening. He felt like the floor had dropped out from\nunder his feet. He’d known this moment was coming. He’d expected it for\nsixteen years. He’d gone into his first meetings as Gavin expecting anyone,\neveryone, to point and scream, “Impostor! Counterfeit!” Others had figured\nit out, but never in a way he couldn’t contain. He couldn’t discredit Bas.\nThe man was immune to political currents, and everyone knew it. And if\nasked, Bas would point out a hundred differences between Gavin and\nDazen. By the time he was done speaking, the Gavin mask would be\ndestroyed.\nAnd yet he’d come alone. On this night, of all nights.\n“So my question was… my question was, why are you lying, Dazen?\nWhy are you pretending to be Gavin? Dazen is bad. He kills people. He\nkilled the White Oaks. All of them. They say he went from room to room in\ntheir mansion, even killing the servants, and then he burned it all down to\nhide his crimes. The children were trapped in the basement. They found\ntheir little bodies in a pile. They were hugging each other. I went there. I\nsaw them.” Bas stopped speaking, evidently consumed by that old image.\nWith his perfect memory, it must have been vivid indeed. “I told those little"

Bas was\na green/blue/superviolet polychrome. Every drafter was changed over time\nby his colors. Only the wildness of green would make the formerly order-\nobsessed Bas skip his place in line. But the orderliness of blue was making\nhim crazy to know why, to see how things fit together. “Bas, I’m going to\ntell you something I’ve only told one other person in the world. I’m going\nto answer your question. You deserve it.” He lowered his voice. “When I\nwas sixteen years old, I had a… a vision. A waking dream. I was in front of\na presence. I fell on my face. I knew he was holy, and I was afraid—”\n“Orholam himself?” Bas asked. He looked doubtful. “My mother told\nme that people who say they speak for Orholam are usually lying. And\nDazen is a liar!” His voice pitched up at the end.\nThe last thing Gavin needed was Bas shouting something about Dazen.\n“Do you want to hear my answer or not?” he asked sharply.\nBas hesitated. “Yes, but don’t you—”\nGavin stabbed him in the heart.\nBas’s eyes went wide. He grabbed Gavin’s arms. Gavin withdrew the\ndagger.\nColdly, so coldly, Gavin said, “You gave the full measure, Bas. Your\nservice will not be forgotten. Your failures are forgotten, erased. I give you\nabsolution. I give you freedom.”\nBy the time he said “absolution,” Bas was dead.\nGavin lowered the man to the floor carefully. He went and knocked at\nthe side door. The Blackguards came in and took the body, and just like\nthat, Gavin got away with murder.\nChapter 79\nThe man was a liar. Kip didn’t know exactly what was lie and what was\ntruth, but Lord Omnichrome was King Garadul’s right hand. They’d\nmassacred his village. For nothing. If murder was nothing to them, what\nwas a lie?\nBut there was truth here, like all the best lies. That really was what the\nPact meant. No wonder they talked about it in sidelong conversations,\nhushed tones. You got old, you broke your halo, you became like a mad\ndog. They had to put you down. Kip remembered when Corvan’s dog had\nbeen bitten by a raccoon and later started foaming at the mouth. Corvan, the\nalcaldesa, and some of the other men loaded muskets and went after it.\nCorvan himself blew its brains out. He hid his face afterward, and everyone\npretended not to see his tears. It had been a year before he talked about that\ndog, but when he did, it was never of its madness, never of killing his dog.\nThis was the same. No one talked about the Freeing because no one wanted\nto dishonor the dead: “Kip was a great man, right until he went crazy and\nstarted trying to kill his friends. Right until we had to put him down.”"

That didn’t make it a lie. Indeed, it probably\nmade it more likely that it was true.\nBut no one in this crowd wanted to accept that. They wanted someone\nto blame for the death of their parents. They didn’t want to die themselves.\nThey could dress that up in some holy-sounding bullshit, but Kip had seen\nbehind the veil. These people were murderers. Gavin was a good man. A\ngreat man, a giant among dwarfs. So he had to do hard things. Great men\nmade the hard choices, so everyone could survive. So he held people to the\nPact, so what? Everyone swore to it. Everyone knew what they were\nswearing. There was no mystery, no con. They made a deal, and they liked\nthe deal until they had to pay the price.\nThese people were cowards, oathbreakers, scum.\nI have got to get out of here.\nHe turned and saw the last woman he expected to see here.\n“Ilytian water clocks claim this is the shortest night of the year,” Felia Guile\nsaid from the doorway. “But it’s always been the longest for you.”\nGavin looked up at her, gray-faced. “I didn’t expect you until dawn.”\nShe smiled. “There was some disturbance with the order. Bas the\nSimple cut in earlier than he was supposed to. Some withdrew until later.”\nShe shrugged.\nWithdrew? So maybe they know. It’s all falling apart.\nMaybe it’s best this way. I kill my own mother now, and she doesn’t\nhave to see it all come crashing down.\n“Son,” she said. “Dazen.” The word was almost a sigh, a release of\npent-up pressure. Truth, spoken aloud after years of lies.\n“Mother.” It was good to see her happy, but terrible to see her here. “I\ncan’t—I didn’t even take you on that flight I promised you.”\n“You really can fly?”\nHe nodded, his throat tight.\n“My son can fly.” Her smile lit her face. “Dazen, I am so proud of\nyou.”\nGavin tried to speak, but failed.\nHer eyes were gentle. “I’ll help you,” she said. She knelt at the rail,\nopting for more formality. With his mother, Gavin should have known.\n“Lord Prism, I have sins to confess. Will you shrive me?”\nGavin blinked back sudden tears, mastered himself. “Gladly…\ndaughter.”\nHer attitude of simple piety helped him play his part. He was not her\nson, not here and now. He was her spiritual father, a link to Orholam on the\nholiest day of her life.\n“Lord Prism, I married unwisely and lived fearfully. I let myself be\nowned by my fear that my husband would put me aside, and didn’t speak\nwhen I knew I should. I let my sons be pitted against each other, and one is\ndead because of it.

Acquiesced. “Daughter, go on.”\n“I have spoken cruel words. I have lied a thousand times. I have\ntreated my slaves without regard to their welfare…” She spoke for five\nminutes, not sparing herself, blunt and forthright, not condensing her\nanswers for her sake, but for Gavin’s—he had others to shrive this night. It\nwas surreal.\nGavin had heard stunning admissions and seen darker sides of people\nwith saintly reputations for the last sixteen years, but hearing her confess\nbeating an innocent slave in her rage minutes after finding Andross in bed\nwith another woman was heartrending. Dislocating. To hear his mother\nconfess was like seeing her naked.\n“And I have killed, thrice. For my son. I lost two boys; I couldn’t bear\nto lose my last,” she said. Gavin could hardly believe her. “Once I got a\nBlackguard who suspected him reassigned to a dangerous post during the\nRed Cliff Uprising, where I knew he would be killed. Once I directed\npirates to the ship Dervani Malargos was taking home after having been lost\nin the wilds of Tyrea for years. He claimed to have been closest to the\nconflagration at Sundered Rock and to have seen things no one else had. I\ntried to buy him off, but he slipped away. And once I hired an assassin\nduring the Thorn Conspiracies, using the cover of someone else’s fight to\nmurder someone who was about to blackmail my son.”\nGavin was speechless. In the first year of his masquerade, he’d killed\nthree men to protect his identity and exiled a dozen more. Then two in the\nseventh year. He hadn’t killed anyone in cold blood since—until Bas. He’d\nknown his mother had protected him, but he’d always thought she’d done it\nby passing on information she learned. His mother had always been fiercely\nprotective, but he’d never imagined how far she would go. How far he\nwould force her to go because he’d supplanted Dazen.\nDear Orholam, how I wish I believed in you, that you might forgive\nme for what I’ve done.\n“Each time,” she said, “I told myself I was serving Orholam and the\nSeven Satrapies, and not just my family. But my conscience has never been\nclear.”\nShaken, he intoned the traditional words, offering her forgiveness.\nShe stood, looking at him intently. “Now, son, there are a few things\nyou should know before I lay my burdens down.” She didn’t wait for him to\nsay anything, which was good, because he didn’t think he was capable of it.\n“You are not the evil son, Dazen. You were errant, but never mean-\nspirited. You are a true Prism—”\n“Errant? I murdered the White Oaks! I—”\n“Did you?” she interrupted, sharp.

She’d wanted to talk about this all along.\n“I can’t.”\n“If not me, who? If not now, when? Dazen, I’m your mother. Let me\ngive you this.”\nHis tongue felt like lead, but the images were there before his eyes in\nan instant. The leering faces of the White Oak brothers, the surge of fear\nparalyzing him. Gavin licked his lips, but he couldn’t force the first words\nout. He felt the hatred once more, fury at the injustice. Seven on one, more.\nThe lies. “Things were already bad with Gavin. Blue and green awoke for\nme early, but I was starting to suspect I could do more. I told him. You\nknow, we hadn’t been close since he’d been announced Prism-elect, and\nsomehow Sevastian’s murder only made things worse. I guess I thought\ntelling him my gifts were growing would bring him back. Like we could be\nbest friends again. But he didn’t like it. Not at all.” From nowhere, a wash\nof tears came to Gavin’s eyes. He missed his brother so much it tore his\nsoul. “I understand now how threatening it must have been for a young man\nto lose the one thing that made him special. I didn’t, then. The day after I\ntold him I was a polychrome, I heard him urging father to betroth him to\nKarris. It was the greatest betrayal I could imagine. Her love was the one\nthing that made me special. It was some time before I saw the symmetry to\nthat.\n“Anyway, I thought Karris was as in love with me as I was with her.\nWhen father announced her betrothal to Gavin, we decided to run away\ntogether. She must have told someone. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe\nGavin seemed a better prize. Karris and I were supposed to meet just\noutside her family’s mansion after midnight. She wasn’t there. Her maid\ntold me she was inside. It was a trap, of course. The White Oak brothers\nknew I’d been trysting with Karris, and they wanted to teach me a lesson.\nSaid I’d dishonored them, turned their sister into a whore.”\nThey’d grabbed him as soon as he stepped inside. All seven brothers.\nThey’d torn off his cloak and snatched away his spectacles and his sword.\nHe remembered the great, enclosed courtyard, servants peeking out from\ndoors and windows. There was a great bonfire in the courtyard—plenty of\nlight, but none for a blue/green bichrome without spectacles. “They started\nbeating me. They’d been drinking. Several were drafting red.

Glanced at his mother. Her face was all tenderness. He looked away.\n“I split light for the first time that night. It felt… wonderful. I’d\nthought I might be a superviolet to yellow polychrome, but that night, I\nused red. A lot of red. Maybe I wasn’t ready for what red does to you when\nyou’re already furious.” He remembered the shock on their faces when he\nstarted drafting. They knew he was a blue/green. They knew what he was\ndoing was impossible. There was only one Prism each generation. Images\nof fireballs streaking from his bleeding hands, of Kolos White Oak’s skull\nsmoking while he still stood, of the White Oak guards slaughtered by the\ndozen, limbs sheared off, blood everywhere. “I killed the brothers and all\nthe White Oak guards. The fires were spreading. The front gate collapsed as\nI got out. I heard people screaming.” He’d gone, staggering, left empty and\nnumb, to find his horse.\n“There was a maid at the side door. The woman who’d lured me into\nthe trap. She looked through the bars and begged me to open it. It was the\nsame door I’d tried when I was trying to get out. It was chained on the\ninside, but she didn’t have the key. I told her to burn, and I left. I didn’t\nrealize—I didn’t even think that all the other doors were chained too. I just\nwanted to get away. They couldn’t find the keys in time, I guess. With that\ncasual cruelty, I consigned a hundred innocents to death.” Like it was better\nfor the guilty to die than for the innocent to live.\nFunny thing, he could weep about not being friends with his brother,\nbut he had nothing inside himself for all those dead innocents. Slaves and\nservants bound to the White Oaks not by choice. Children. It was just too\nmonstrous.\nAnd most of the men who’d joined Dazen in the war later hadn’t even\nasked what had happened that night. They’d been happy to fight for a man\nwhom they thought had killed an entire mansion full of people—because it\nmeant he was indestructible. How he despised them.\nHis mother came and held him. And now, silently, he wept. Perhaps for\nthose dead. Perhaps only selfishly, because he was losing her.\n“Dazen, it isn’t mine to absolve you of what happened that night, or of\nall that happens in war that you carry still. But I do forgive you of all that I\ncan. You are no monster. You are a true Prism, and I love you.” She\ntrembled, tears streaking down her cheeks, but she glowed. She kissed\nGavin on the lips, something she hadn’t done since he was a boy. “I’m\nproud of you, Dazen. Proud to be your mother,” she said. “Sevastian would\nbe proud of you too.”\nHe held her, weeping. There was no absolution for him. Sevastian was\nstill dead, and her other son rotted in a hell Gavin had created for him. She"

She\nwouldn’t have forgiven that. But he wept and she held him, soothing him\nlike a child once more.\nThen, all too soon, she pushed him back. “It’s time,” she said. She took\na deep breath. “Is it… is it acceptable for me to draft one last time? It’s been\nyears.”\n“Absolutely,” Gavin said, trying to put himself back together. He\ngestured to the orange panel of the wall.\nShe drew in orange luxin. Shivered. Sighed. “It feels like life, doesn’t\nit?” She knelt gracefully. “Remember what I said,” she said.\n“Everything,” he swore. Even if I don’t believe it.\n“It’s all right,” she said. “You’ll believe it someday.”\nHe blinked.\nFelia Guile chuckled. “You don’t get all your smarts from your father,\nyou know.”\n“I never doubted it.”\nShe drew her hair back over her shoulders to give him a clear path to\nher heart. She placed her hand on his thigh, looked up at him. She let the\norange luxin go. “I’m ready,” she said.\n“I love you,” Gavin said. He took a deep breath. “Felia Guile, you\ngave the full measure. Your service will not be forgotten, but your failures\nare hereby blotted out, forgotten, erased. I give you absolution. I give you\nfreedom. Well done, good and faithful servant.”\nHe stabbed her in the heart. Then he held her, kneeling with her,\nkissing her face as she died. It was several long minutes before he had the\nstrength to stand and summon the Blackguards.\nWhen they opened the door, he saw that there were a hundred drafters\nin the hall, waiting for him. They weren’t smiling. The enormous Usef Tep,\nthe Purple Bear, stepped forward. “We didn’t want to cause a disturbance\nwhile you were with your mother, but sir, we need to talk.”\nSir. Not Lord Prism. Not Gavin.\nSo begins the end.\nChapter 80\n“Kip, whatever happens, stay close to me,” Karris whispered, leaning close.\nShe said it with a tension and certainty that told Kip something was\ngoing to happen. Soon. Though he wanted to, he didn’t ask. Their guards\nwere close, though everyone’s attention was focused on Lord Rainbow up\nfront and his verbal feces about duty and justice. Kip had long ago stopped\npaying attention. He was staring at a girl, not ten paces away. Liv.\nHe could have sworn she’d been pushing closer to him and Karris for a\nwhile, but for the last ten minutes she’d stood as though frozen, listening to\nLord Rainbow. The crowd between them moved, and he saw that she was\nwearing yellow cloth vambraces. Liv was a yellow. It had to be her.\nKip craned his head around, looking toward Brightwater Wall.\n“Stop acting suspicious,” Karris said through gritted teeth. Which left\nKip with absolutely zero places to look.

If he stared at Liv, that would draw\nattention to her, the speech disgusted him, he couldn’t look at the wall, and\nwhen he looked at Karris, he couldn’t help but notice her dress. Karris had\nbeen thought-freezingly gorgeous when Kip had seen her wrapped in a\nheavy black cloak over her Blackguard garb. In the thin black dress she was\nwearing, her beauty ripped Kip’s breath out of his chest, stomped on it, and\nset it on fire. She stood straight, imperious, regal, elegance personified. No\none had given her a shawl despite the coolness of the night. In the rising\nlight, Kip could see the gooseflesh on her arms.\n“Cold out, huh?” he said.\nOne of their guards snorted.\n“I will beat you to death if you ask for it,” Karris said, still staring\nstraight ahead.\nKip had no idea what she was talking about, or why the guard was\nlaughing. “What did—” He looked down at her chest. Her nipples were\nclearly defined against the thin silk. Kip gaped just as she looked over and\ncaught him looking.\n“Kip. Dark spectacles are not a license to ogle.”\nWill the earth please open and swallow me now? She thought he’d\nbeen being snarky about… Oh, Orholam. He was the stupidest boy in\nhistory.\nThe speech ended without anything special happening. Kip glanced\ncarefully at Karris. She looked toward the east, where the sky was\nlightening.\n“He’s waiting until it’s almost dawn,” Karris whispered, as their\nguards pushed them to start walking. “Be ready.”\n“He?” Kip asked.\n“Shut it!” the Mirrorman to Kip’s left said. He smacked Kip with the\nbutt of his musket.\nOh, I can make inappropriate jokes on accident, but you’ve got a\nproblem when I’m just trying to escape?\nAt first, Kip couldn’t see very well where they were going through the\nvast crowd. Gradually, though, he saw that the drafters were joining a much\nlarger group that was being addressed by King Garadul.\nKip lost sight of Liv quickly. The dark spectacles he was wearing\nmade him almost blind. He could see out of the sides if he strained, but it\nmade it impossible to search the crowd. With his hands tied behind his\nback, there was no way to fix that either.\nTens of thousands of soldiers surrounded King Garadul. The man was\nwaving his arms, shouting, but Kip could only hear snippets as the drafters\njoined the outskirts of that group: “cleanse this city… Take back what has\nbeen stolen from us… punish…” It sounded pretty grim.\nAgain, Kip seemed to be the only person who wasn’t hanging on every\nword, so as the sun rose, first touching Brightwater Wall behind them\nbecause it was higher than the plain below, he saw movement on the wall.\nHe couldn’t see it well around the frame of the spectacles, but the\nforms of five men—a cannon crew—became three, then in a violent motion"

The cannon on the wall had been pointed at a high\ntrajectory toward Garriston, but the man was angling it down and down.\nA quick spark.\nBoom!\nThe cannon spat fire. Kip didn’t see the shell hit, but he felt it. The\nearth seemed to jump.\nFor a moment, no one did anything, thinking it must have been a\nmistake. Screams of fright and pain. Then Karris collided with him,\nknocking him off his feet.\nKip smacked his head as he fell, so at first he wasn’t sure if the second\nexplosion was just his imagination.\n“Canister shot!” Karris said. “Shit! We have to move! Ironfist’s aiming\nfor that wagon.”\nWagon? Ironfist? Why was Ironfist shooting at them?\nKip was blinking. Something was strange about his vision—oh!\nSmacking his head against the ground had knocked one of the black lenses\nout of the frame of his spectacles.\n“Grab that lens and cut my hands free!” Karris barked.\nThey were both lying on the ground, hands bound. The crackle of\nmusket fire filled the air.\nOne of the Mirrorman guards grabbed Kip, trying to haul him to his\nfeet.\nDespite lying flat on her back, Karris kicked the back of the man’s\nknee with her left foot. He folded, and by the time he landed on his back her\nright foot had swept up and then down in an ax kick across his throat. There\nwas a crunch and blood sprayed through the mail flap over the man’s\nmouth.\nKip could hardly believe what he’d just seen, but Karris was already\nmoving on. She scrambled over the dying man, lying right on top of him.\nWith her hands still behind her back, she drew the man’s belt knife a hand’s\nbreadth and cut her wrists free.\n“Stop!” a Mirrorman yelled, his musket pointed at Karris’s head.\nThere was still screaming everywhere. Chaos. Shouting and gunfire\nand the screams of the dying.\nKip lashed out, kicking for the Mirrorman’s knee as Karris had done\nseconds before.\nThe Mirrorman saw it coming and swung the butt of his musket for\nKip’s leg—\n—and was flung away like Orholam’s own hand had slapped him.\nA concussion, a roar, a pressure so vast Kip’s vision went black for an\ninstant. Everyone standing was torn off their feet. Things—Kip couldn’t\neven tell what they were—blasted overhead.\nHe must have lost a few seconds. He rolled over, tried to stand, fell.\nHis wrists were bloody, but no longer bound. The acrid aroma of\ngunpowder filled the air. Bits of wood rained down on the ground.\nWhen Kip tried to stand again, someone helped him. Not even a\nhundred paces away where the powder wagon had been, he saw a crater in\nthe ground a good ten paces across and at least two paces deep.

He couldn’t hear her.\nHe saw her mouth a curse as she realized the same thing. He was\npretty sure she was mouthing “Ironfist” and a series of curses. She put a\nmusket in his hands and said, slowly enough that Kip could read her lips,\n“Can you walk?”\nKip nodded, not sure how much he was hearing her and how much he\nwas reading her lips. She pulled at him and they started jogging. He was\nstill disoriented, but he saw that he wasn’t the only one. Dozens of men and\nwomen with powder-darkened skin and clothes were staggering around,\nsome of them bleeding from their ears. A man was carrying his left hand in\nhis right hand, looking for the rest of his arm as blood pumped out of his\nmangled shoulder.\nTeams of soldiers were forming up now and running toward the wall.\nOthers stood back and were firing their muskets at the gun emplacement,\nbut Kip didn’t see anyone on top of the wall returning fire.\nSomeone was shouting at Kip. Good, so he could hear. He turned.\nHe didn’t recognize the soldier standing in front of him. “Form up,\nsoldier!” the man shouted. “Move it!”\nThey thought he was a soldier because he had a musket. But then, with\nhis powder-blackened clothes, it was no wonder.\n“Come on, soldier, we’ve got a city to take!”\nThere were at least twenty soldiers with the man, and only the officer\nhad a real uniform. Kip shot a glance at Karris. She was wobbling back and\nforth, holding her hands over her eyes like she was blind, just another\nwounded person. Kip realized that if they saw the violet caps over her eyes,\nthey’d capture her immediately. Or kill her outright. With that dress, it was\nbest not to let their attention alight on her any longer than necessary.\nIf Kip refused, the man could summarily execute him. And he looked\ngrim, ready to do it. “Yes, sir!” Kip said. He joined the lines, glanced at\nKarris, looked once more for Liv and didn’t see her, and then ran with the\nsoldiers toward the city and the sound of guns and the flash of magic.\nChapter 81\nGavin squared his shoulders and confronted his accusers. A hallway in the\nTravertine Palace. It wasn’t exactly where he would have picked to die, but\nhe supposed it was better than some dungeon somewhere. Better than I gave\nyou, Gavin. At least he could face this with dignity.\n“What do you want?” he demanded.\n“We know what you’re doing,” Usef Tep said. “Sir.” The “sir” was\nbelated. It always was with the Purple Bear.\nSamila Sayeh came forward, put a hand on Usef’s meaty arm. “We’ve\ncome together to stop you, Gavin Guile.”\n“And how do you propose to do that?” Gavin asked.\n“By volunteering.”\nHuh? Gavin tottered on the edge of drafting everything he could.\nStopped. Tried to keep his idiot perplexity off his face."

Tried to keep his idiot perplexity off his face.\n“It’s noble, Lord Prism, but it’s not wise.”\nWhat? Well sometimes when you don’t know what the hell someone’s\ntalking about, the best thing to do is play along.\n“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” Gavin said. Oops.\n“The Freeing is the holiest moment in a drafter’s life,” Samila said.\n“You’re trying to protect that for us. And we thank you for that. But we’re\nwarriors. All of us fought in the war. We’re willing to fight again.”\n“I die this day,” Usef said. “It’s my duty to make an end, and I accept\nthat. But I’ve got no patience for all this Orholam this and Orholam that. I’d\nrather go down fighting.”\n“Lord Prism,” Samila Sayeh said, “we have to hold the city long\nenough for everyone to escape. Holding the walls is a death sentence. Why\nnot give it to us? We’re dead anyway.”\nTheir talking had given Gavin a few moments to think, to recover his\nbalance. “If I send you out there, you’ll all break the halo. That’s why\nyou’re here. Next year I’ll have to face you fighting for him. They don’t put\ndown color wights. It’s not just your souls we’re talking about here. It’s\nyour sanity. And you’re right, you’re all warriors. That makes you ten times\nas dangerous when you break.”\n“We’ll fight in teams. Each with a pistol and a knife. When we break,\nwe’ll do as the Blackguards do.”\nWhen a comrade broke the halo on the battlefield, the Blackguards\nconsidered them dead—and indeed, it did usually render a person\nunconscious temporarily. The Blackguards would check the eyes of a fallen\ncomrade, and if the halo was broken, they’d slit their throat.\n“Except when a team’s down to one, we end ourselves too,” Samila\nsaid. It was, for some, a thorny theological point, though not without\nprecedent. Was suicide a sin when you knew you were going mad and\nwould likely hurt or kill innocents? “You are the Prism, you could make a\nspecial dispensation.”\n“Future generations would believe that implied special dispensation is\nneeded,” Talon Gim said, scowling. He had always had very definite\ntheological views.\nMaros Orlos stepped forward. “Lord Prism, we’ve already sent to be\nFreed all the drafters we knew were too far gone to be any use on the\nbattlefield. What is the greater good here? That we do things as they’ve\nalways been done, or that we save an entire city?”\nThere was no contest, of course. Gavin was trembling. “I think such a\nsacrifice would honor Orholam. I will give each of you a… special blessing\nas you take up this burden. I am… deeply humbled by this act of devotion.\nDeeply grateful.”\nThat much was no lie.\nAfter making the decision to let the Freeing class fight to the death\ninstead of be Freed on his knife, Gavin still met with each of them.

He\nshrived them, listened to their concerns about dying, and blessed them. It\nwas exactly the same as he would have done otherwise—minus the killing.\nBut to Gavin, it was entirely different. Usually, he was so sickened by what\nhe had to do that he couldn’t give their words his full attention. He tried. He\npretended. He knew they deserved his best.\nBut today, he did it. They weren’t really talking to him as they spoke;\nthey were talking to Orholam. Gavin was simply an instrument to make\ntheir confessions easier than addressing an empty room. What they were\ndoing was an act of devotion. It was an act of sacrifice.\nTo others, it wouldn’t seem that different than what some did every\nyear at the Freeing. It would end with a dead drafter who’d gone to death\nbravely. But without the burden of shedding their blood, Gavin was able to\nsee it clearly for the first time. These people were heroes.\nIf Gavin hadn’t pulled one over on the whole world and on Orholam\nhimself by masquerading as his own brother, perhaps the Freeing would\nhave seemed this holy every year. It was supposed to be something to\ncelebrate, but Gavin had dreaded it. Always.\nNow, as he prayed with each drafter, he could almost believe Orholam\nlistened.\nSamila Sayeh was the last. She was, Gavin was reminded, a woman\nwhose beauty withstood scrutiny. Her skin, even in her forties, was nearly\nflawless. A few smile lines, but clear and glowing. Slim. Stunning blue eyes\nagainst Atashian olive skin. Impeccably dressed.\n“I had an affair with your brother, you know,” she said.\nGavin froze. He knew that he, Dazen, had not had an affair with\nSamila Sayeh—which could only mean one thing: she knew. “Sometimes a\nman likes to pretend that nothing has happened between him and an old\nlover,” Gavin said quickly. “Especially when it was a great mistake.”\nShe laughed. “I’ve wondered often over the years, are you just so good\nthat you’ve never been discovered, or does everyone who could expose you\nhave an ulterior motive for not doing so?” She stared at him, but he said\nnothing. “You know, Evi was looking at your wall. She said, ‘I don’t\nremember Gavin being a superchromat. He shouldn’t be able to craft a\nyellow this perfect.’ And do you know what she said after that? She said\nthat Orholam must have blessed your effort. That it was proof you were\ndoing his will. And everyone nodded their heads. Can you believe it?”\nGavin felt a chill.\n“Gavin would have made a wall that would last a month and bragged it\nwould last forever. You made a wall that will last forever, and said it might\nlast a few years. You just couldn’t stand to make an inferior product, could\nyou, Dazen?” Someone who’d been drafting blue for twenty-five years\nwould be pleased to see the order in this: Dazen was a perfectionist, so even\nthough he could make his mask better with imperfection, it didn’t match his"

I killed for him,” Samila said.\n“We all did an awful lot of that,” Gavin said.\n“I felt so betrayed by you, that you wouldn’t even acknowledge me\nafter what we’d had. I felt a glimmer of hope when you broke your\nbetrothal with Karris. When I finally figured it all out, I still wasn’t sure of\nmyself. Gavin told us things about you, about what you would do if you\nwon. And you weren’t doing them. Was your brother a liar all along, or did\nyou change? You were supposed to be a monster, Dazen.”\n“I am a monster.”\n“Glib, still. The snot-nosed younger brother with a quick tongue. I\nmean it.” She looked at him long and hard. Looked at the Freeing knife that\nhe hadn’t drawn. “How well do you know yourself?”\nHe thought about the years, the goals he’d achieved, and the ultimate\ngoal it was serving. “The Philosopher said that a man alone is either a god\nor a monster,” Gavin said. “I’m no god.”\nShe stared at him for one moment more, those intense blue eyes\nunreadable. She smiled. “Well then. Maybe the times call for a monster.”\nShe knelt at his feet, and he blessed her.\nChapter 82\nKip had always pictured a charge as being somehow glorious. Whatever\nhe’d pictured, it wasn’t this. He held his pants up with his wounded left\nhand and the musket in his right. And the musket was heavy! His heart was\nheaving and everyone else was running faster than he was.\nHe had little sense of what was happening anywhere else. A man who\nroared that the soldiers could call him either god or Master Sergeant Galan\nDelelo ran at the front, urging his men on. The backs of the other soldiers\nfilled the rest of Kip’s vision, and the pain of running distracted him from\nall else except for the intermittent whistling, which he couldn’t place at first\n—until he realized it was the sound of musket balls flying past, and then he\ncould hardly think of anything else.\nFor a moment he saw the city walls as the men in front of him\ndisappeared in a ditch before scrambling up the other side. He remembered\ndismissing these walls not even a week ago. Now they looked pretty\nimpressive. The side of the wall was encrusted with slums like barnacles,\nand King Garadul’s men were already swarming there, trying to use the low\nbuildings and rough shelters as a ladder. But even in the brief glimpse Kip\nhad, one of the slum buildings on which the men were climbing teetered\nand then collapsed, crushing men and sending up a cloud of dust.\nSomething wet and chunky splattered across Kip’s face as he ran. He\nturned, vaguely saw a man dropping beside him—and then the ground\nsuddenly wasn’t where it was supposed to be.\nHe went down hard in the dry irrigation ditch. He skidded on his face,\nflipped over, rolled, the wind knocked cleanly out of him. As he moaned,"

They’ve got an angle right into this ditch from\nthe wall, you damn fools. Get up! If you’re anything less than dead, get up\nor I’ll shoot you myself!”\nFor a second, no one moved.\n“You wouldn’t,” a man said.\nThe master sergeant drew a pistol and shot him in the belly. “Who’s\nnext?” he yelled. He pointed his other pistol at a man carrying a large\nrobin’s egg blue sack.\n“I’m a messenger!” the man screamed.\n“You’re a soldier now,” Master Sergeant Delelo shouted. He was either\nunaware or just didn’t care about the musket fire raining around him,\nsending up little puffs of earth. “Now, move!”\nThe man dropped his messenger sack, grabbed Kip’s musket, and ran\nforward, along with everyone else.\nLying on the ground, Kip was left with the other corpses. When he had\nhis breath back, he touched the side of his face. Gore, gray-red chunks of…\nHe didn’t want to think about it. What mattered was that he was free. At\nleast until the next officer commandeered the cowards who filled up this\nditch again.\nThere wasn’t much time. If Kip thought too much or waited too long,\nhe wouldn’t move, and he needed to move now. The master sergeant was\nright, this ditch wasn’t out of the line of fire. If Kip waited, he was going to\nget killed.\nHe wanted to see more of the battle, make a good plan. He didn’t know\nwhat kind of a judge he would be of whatever he saw, and he didn’t even\nknow which way to run.\nHe grabbed the messenger’s sack and slung it over his shoulder. He\nsaw the wreck of a wagon farther back away from the wall.\nDid we run right past that? Kip hadn’t even noticed. Regardless, the\noxen who’d been pulling the wagon were dead or mewling, screaming in\npain, bloodied. Kip ran for it.\nHe ducked into the shadow of the wagon and found two other men\nalready there. They looked at him with wide, fearful eyes. “Move!” he\nshouted.\nKip climbed up on the wreck and looked out on the plain. At first all he\nsaw were the dead bodies. Several hundred perhaps. Mostly he couldn’t see\nany blood, so it looked like people sprawled about sleeping. It wasn’t so\ngreat a toll, considering how big the army was, Kip thought, but seeing so\nmany dead wasn’t really something he could merely think about. Those\npeople were dead. He could have been one of them. He could still be.\nHe tore his eyes away, tried to look for something useful.

It had slowed King Garadul’s advance, probably more\nbecause they’d stopped to talk about it than if they had simply charged the\nhorses through.\nAt the top of the hill, Kip saw standard bearers and a figure who might\nhave been King Garadul himself. He was shouting, making huge animated\nmovements toward Lord Omnichrome, who was unmistakable because he\nliterally glowed in the early morning light.\nKip didn’t realize he’d made a decision until he found himself running.\nHe snatched a musket from the ground next to a woman curled in the fetal\nposition, moaning, and kept running. His vengeance was this close.\nAs Kip approached the hill, movement began on the hill and rapidly\nspread, horns sounding orders. It was a few seconds before Kip saw the\nhorses moving. King Garadul was advancing on the wall—personally, right\ntoward the Mother’s Gate. Was he trusting that his men would open the gate\nby the time he got there, or was he just an idiot?\nKip was halfway up the hill when he saw a woman whose form\nseemed familiar. He stopped.\nKarris White Oak had flagged down one of the horsemen heading after\nKing Garadul. The man slowed down for her, and she swung up into the\nsaddle behind him with surprising grace. The man turned in the saddle to\nask her a question, and then tumbled out. Kip saw the quick gleam of a\ndagger, then it was sheathed, and Karris kicked the horse’s sides and went\nspeeding after King Garadul. She was going by herself, and with her eye\ncaps still on. She wouldn’t be able to draft, but she was still going to try to\nkill him. Even if she were successful, it would be suicide.\nI swore to save her. And I swore to kill him.\nKip was a terrible rider, but there was no way he could catch up\nwithout a horse. Seeing horses tied up near the crown of the hill, he headed\nstraight for them.\n“… through the Lover’s Gate. You’ll have to swim. Join the refugees.\nHe’ll—”\nKip rounded a tent in time to see the young drafter Zymun swing up\ninto a saddle. He was taking orders from Lord Omnichrome himself. Kip’s\nheart leaped. They weren’t twenty paces away.\n“You need a horse?” someone said, right at Kip’s elbow.\nKip almost jumped out of his skin. He blinked stupidly at the groom.\n“Rough work out there, huh?” the groom said.\n“Message!” Kip said, remembering he was carrying a messenger bag.\n“Message for the king! Yes, a horse! I need a horse.”"

I need a horse.”\n“I figured,” the man said. He went off to find a beast large enough.\nKip looked back toward Lord Omnichrome and Zymun. He missed\nwhatever else they said, but he saw Lord Omnichrome hand a box to the\nmounted drafter.\nThat box. Kip couldn’t believe it.\nThat was his box. Right size. Right shape. That was his inheritance.\nThe only thing his mother had ever given him. And Zymun had it.\nZymun bowed to Lord Omnichrome. Kip sank back as the young\ndrafter pulled his horse around and galloped away to the east. Lord\nOmnichrome strode back toward the crown of the hill. The groom brought\nKip a horse and helped him mount and stash the musket in a sleeve beside\nthe saddle.\nKip looked, torn. Lord Omnichrome was disappearing up the hill,\nrejoining his entourage. He was the heart of this; Kip knew it. He should\nkill him. Orholam, his chance was passing through his fingertips. But to the\nsouth, Karris was charging to her death, and to the east, that snake Zymun\nwas stealing the only thing Kip had to remember his mother by. Kill Lord\nOmnichrome and stop the war. Kill Zymun and take the knife. Or save\nKarris and have a chance at King Garadul. Kip couldn’t get them all.\nKip had made his oaths to the living and to the dead. He gritted his\nteeth, sure he was making the wrong decision—and making it anyway. It’s\nbetter that the innocent should live than that the guilty die. Gavin loved\nKarris, and he deserved another chance at happiness. Kip rode after her.\nChapter 83\nKarris had never fought in a full-scale battle before, but she had watched\nseveral with Gavin’s general Running Wolf. In another age, he would have\nbeen revered as a great leader. Instead, he’d faced Corvan Danavis, and\nbeen thrice bested by smaller forces commanded by the mustachioed\ngenius. Regardless, he’d been a kindly older gentleman with a soft spot for\nKarris, and he would explain to her what he was seeing as the distant lines\nclashed. Of course, he was often too busy to tell her much, but at other\ntimes it seemed to help him to think out loud. So now as Karris galloped\ndown the hill and headed toward the fray, she was able to piece together\nmore than she would have otherwise.\nThe buildings propped against both sides of the wall—the feature that\nwould eventually doom it, Karris was sure—were actually helping in the\nshort term. They were like a talus slope, wide enough that it encumbered\nanyone bringing forward siege ladders, and too unpredictable to charge men\nstraight up at any one place. Eventually, King Garadul’s men would figure\nout which places were stable and how much weight they could support, but\nuntil then the collapsing buildings killed and slowed the men attacking the\nwall.\nAs Karris rode in, drafters appeared at the top of the wall en masse for"

The wall wasn’t high, but it was wide enough for the\ndefenders to move along the top at great speed, and they’d seen King\nGaradul’s cavalry coming here.\nReds and sub-reds worked in teams from the top of the walls, one\nflinging sticky pyre jelly down onto the attackers, and the other setting it\nalight. King Garadul had a line of his own drafters up front, blues and\ngreens attempting to divert the pyre jelly in midair and throw it back at the\nwall. Reds threw their own luxin up at the defenders on the wall, though\nGaradul’s teams weren’t as good at getting it alight every time. On both\nsides, musketeers did their best to pick off drafters.\nThe defenders were getting the best of it, but there were simply so\nmany attackers, Karris didn’t see how they could possibly hold out for long.\nAnd why had King Garadul brought his cavalry here now? Directly against\nthe wall, their maneuverability was negated and they made easy targets for\nthe blue drafters at the top of the wall, who would pop up from behind the\ncrenellations, fire off a few daggers of blue, and then duck back down.\nAll Karris had to do was muscle her way through the crowd—not hard\nwhen you were mounted—steal a musket, stay alive long enough to get\nclose to King Garadul, and blow his head off. In the heat and fury and blood\nand confusion and cacophony of battle, it was quite possible no one would\neven realize the killing shot had come from behind him.\nKarris heard a yell behind her, somehow different from the rest of the\nscreams. She turned her head, still leaning low over her galloping horse. A\ndozen Mirrormen, coming after her on their gigantic chargers. Her heart\nconvulsed.\nSo the subtle approach isn’t going to work.\nShe picked at the eye caps again. The skin at the corner of her eye was\ntearing, but she wasn’t any closer to pulling the damned things off. If she\ncould draft, she would have a chance. She pushed down the sudden flood of\nred fury with effort.\nEighty paces out, she saw a line of musketeers reloading. She scanned\nthe crowd for anyone bearing a flintlock—a matchlock wouldn’t work for\nthis. Then, slowing her horse to get the timing right, she swept in just as one\nof the officers finished reloading and hefted the musket up to his shoulder.\nShe snatched it right out of his hands.\nCommander Ironfist had often chided her for her trick riding, for\npracticing things they both knew had no use beyond impressing the\nBlackguard’s new recruits. A vision of the big man’s head shaking in\namused surrender went through her head as she jammed the musket into the\nsaddle sleeve.

She wasn’t really going to—Karris kicked her feet\nfree of the stirrups, turned her wrist behind her back to get a firm grip on the\ncantle, tucked the reins between horse and pommel, and dismounted as the\nhorse continued at a canter. She hit the ground and instantly leapt, twisting,\nfeeling the sleeves of her dress rip. She’d always practiced this with a better\ncantle, but she’d also practiced on taller horses, and she almost flung herself\nover the side of the saddle on her way back up. It took a half a moment, but\nshe settled into the saddle, backward. She drew the musket, leveled it,\ntrying to absorb as much of shock of the horse’s cantering in her knees as\nshe could, trying to time how long it would take between trigger pull and\nmusket fire. She aimed at the lead Mirrorman forty paces behind her and\npulled the trigger.\nShe’d aimed perfectly, timed everything right, but the musket didn’t\nfire. She cocked the flintlock again, checked the mechanism. No flint. It had\nfallen out, probably during her impressive trick riding. Bollocks!\nKarris threw the musket away, reversed her hands, turned her head\nover her shoulder to make sure she’d be leaping off flat ground, and\ndismounted. The reverse dismount and remount was actually much harder\nthan the original trick, but she did it perfectly, both feet hitting the ground,\npushing off in tandem just as the pull of the horse’s forward motion\ncatapulted her into the air. Except as she was pulled up and forward, half of\nher horse’s head was torn off by a musket ball and its body dove for the\nearth. If she’d still been holding the reins, she’d have been flung to earth\ntoo. Instead, she became a human cannonball. The force of her jump and the\nhorse’s sudden dive had her twisting like a cat. She was flying, upside down\nand backward.\nTime only for one thought: Roll when you hit.\nBut when she hit, there was no time for anything at all. Whatever it\nwas, there were multiple levels, and it was mercifully soft—which didn’t\nstop it from whipping her head and limbs in different directions. When she\nfinally hit ground, she couldn’t move for a few long seconds.\nSomeone was cursing. She saw feet. She was lying on top of a man,\nand he was struggling to get out from under her. She must have crashed into\nthe backs of half a dozen soldiers—and taken them all out with her. One\nman had his leg twisted at a nasty angle. Another turned to look at her, his\nnose fountaining blood, cursing.\nA huge explosion took away whatever he was saying. Perhaps sixty\npaces away. Everything seemed to freeze for a moment on the battlefield,\nthen things began moving too fast to take them all in at once.\nKarris jumped to her feet—and almost collapsed. She was so\nlightheaded that it took all of her concentration not to fall. She checked\nherself quickly. There were stinging abrasions on her arms and legs, dress in\npathetic shape, but no serious wounds. She touched her eyes. The eye caps"

And smudged with blood so they were harder to\nsee through. Just perfect.\nNow that she was in the midst of the battle, the world narrowed. There\nwere images like little paintings, but no whole. Karris saw a drafter up on\nthe Mother’s Gate—Izem Blue? What was he doing here? He stood, skin\nfully blue, both arms extended, shooting blue daggers in rapid succession—\nan absolutely stunning display to work so fast, keeping his will focused,\nshooting from both hands. He was like a dozen musketeers—three dozen,\ndespite the hazy quality of the morning’s misty sunlight. Everywhere he\nturned, men went down. He turned toward the Mirrormen, and Karris saw\nthose blue blades shearing off in every direction from the mirror armor,\nchewing through everyone around the Mirrormen, but sometimes catching a\nchink or hitting the mirror armor flat enough that a knife punched through.\nA body stood in front of Karris, headless, its neck spraying blood in\ntime with the last beats of its heart.\nThe sound of muskets firing and the roar of blood in her ears melded\ntogether, a pulse, life and death twined together.\nThe Mirrormen surged toward a hole in the wall, perhaps seven paces\nacross. So that was where the explosion had been.\nA red drafter—one of King Garadul’s Free—had gone mad. He was\ncackling, throwing pyre jelly on everyone around him. The men splattered\nwith the stuff were shouting in fear. Someone was begging him to stop.\nA man was falling off the shattered edge of the wall, slipping,\nscreaming.\nOff to one side atop the wall, the sun gleamed off a man’s copper hair.\nKarris’s eyes locked on him. Gavin! He leaned close to another man, issued\nan order. Corvan Danavis. So the man really was a general. And he was\nhere? Gavin clapped the man on the shoulder, and they parted.\nKarris turned, remembering the pursuing Mirrormen, perhaps too late.\nThe leader was twenty paces back, horse surging through the lines,\nshouting at men to move aside, sword drawn. He was alone, his men cut off\nbehind him by a sudden sideways surge in the line, but he was too close.\nKarris was unarmed and still wobbly on her feet.\nTen paces away, her pursuer seemed to jump in his saddle. Karris\ncould see the whole front of his body, so he hadn’t been shot from the wall,\nbut nonetheless, he tumbled out of his saddle.\nSomeone had killed the man from behind. What the hell? Karris\nlooked behind the man.\nKip.\nKip? The young man was riding at a full gallop behind the Mirrormen,\nfollowing the path they’d pushed open through the ranks of soldiers. But he\ndidn’t have a musket.\nInstead, he was carrying a big green ball, larger than his own head. His\nskin was green, and he had a wild look in his eyes—and he looked like he"

His\nskin was green, and he had a wild look in his eyes—and he looked like he\nwas going to tumble out of the saddle at any moment.\nNot seeming to care that he was guiding his horse directly into other\nhorses, Kip drew the green globe backward like he was throwing a ball—\nclassic tyro misperception, they always thought that because a ball had\nmass, you had to muscle it. Kip’s arm came forward, and then with an\naudible pop he shot the green globe out at the Mirrormen.\nIt caught one in the side of his mirrored helmet. The mirror armor\nsheared luxin easily, but it still had to deal with the momentum of what was\nhitting it. A breastplate might withstand a bullet, but the man inside was still\ngoing to have some broken ribs. Here, the man’s head snapped to the side,\nblasting him out of the saddle, and the green globe ricocheted off, hitting\nanother Mirrorman’s shoulder and not quite dismounting him, then caromed\ninto a third Mirrorman’s horse, catching the animal on the side of its head\nand knocking it off its feet.\nThe force of the shot blew Kip out of his own saddle, almost halting all\nof his forward motion. His horse shied, trying not to collide with the others\nat the last second, but they had been startled by riders falling and a giant\ngreen ball flying past their heads, and one dodged directly into its new path.\nAnimal collided with animal at great speed, crunching a Mirrorman’s leg\nthat was trapped between them.\nBoth horses went down, but Karris was more concerned about Kip.\nShe lost sight of him when he fell. Soldiers were still a river, pressing past\nthe Mirrormen, not knowing or caring much what this fight was about. They\njust wanted to get out of the shadow of these deadly walls and into the city.\nKarris snatched a sword off the ground and ducked through the crowd.\nThree riders had wheeled around and were pushing toward a spot farther\nback. She couldn’t get there in time.\nOne was drawing his musket from the saddle sheath to kill her when\nhis head exploded in a burst of yellow light and pink mist. Karris was sure\nthis time the shot hadn’t come from the wall. It had to have come from the\nopposite direction—from the hill? And what the hell could have done that?\nAn explosive musket ball?\nShe was still too far away. She saw two Mirrormen pulling muskets\nout, aiming down.\nTwin green spears—pillars, almost, they were so thick—erupted from\nthe ground where the riders were pointing and impaled them. The first one\nwas hit square in the chest. Green light fractured out in a spray as the\nmirrored breastplate held for a moment, and then burst—and still the green\nspear shot up, lifting the Mirrorman up into the air. The other man was no\nmore lucky. That spear hit the top of his breastplate, again shearing some\nluxin away into a flash of green light. Then the spear rode up, catching him\nunder the chin and going into his head, ripping his helmet off his ruined\nhead like a child popping the head off a dandelion."

He gave her a curious look, and she\nsaid, “Kip, it’s me. Do you recognize me? It’s Karris.” Despite that\nastounding display of power, Kip was a new drafter, and the mental and\nemotional effects of the colors were always greatest when you first started.\nThe wildness of green could make a drafter dangerous.\nHe lifted a hand quickly and she flinched. “Kip, it’s me, Karris,” she\nsaid, all too aware that there was still a battle going on, though the amount\nof musket fire from the top of the wall had dwindled to almost nothing.\n“Hold still,” he said, staring intently at her face. He brought up a single\nfinger and moved it as if to poke her in the eye. She could feel the heat\nradiating from it. What? Kip was a sub-red, too?\nThere was a hiss as he touched the eye cap, and he must have hit the\nfuse point because the eye cap dissolved. Then he did the other.\nAnd like that, Karris could draft again.\nOh, hell yes.\n“What do you say?” Kip asked.\nWhat was he talking about? “Thank you?” Karris asked.\n“I say we go kill us a king,” Kip said, grinning recklessly. When they\nwere in the grip of their color, greens didn’t tend to be real big on common\nsense.\nKarris looked and saw that Rask Garadul was just getting to the gap\nthey’d blown in the wall. Half of his men were already through. It was the\nperfect time to attack—well, other than the fact that Karris and Kip were on\nthe side of the wall with King Garadul’s entire army.\nDrafting some red off the pools of gore around them, Karris felt the\ncomforting wash of red rage. She felt strong. “Let’s go kill us a king,” she\nsaid.\nChapter 84\nI’m not important enough for this, Liv thought as Lord Omnichrome came\nback to the top of the hill where she was tied up. From her vantage point,\nshe could see a familiar form taking a big red stallion from a groom, then\nmounting. Kip. If he turned around, he couldn’t help but see her.\nFor a moment, Liv wasn’t sure if she wanted him to see her or not. She\nhad no doubt what he would do if he did. He’d come charging up the hill,\nand to hell with the odds. That was Kip. That was who he was and who he\nalways had been. Not always smart, but always ferociously loyal.\nShe ducked her head. There was only death here for Kip. And sure\nenough, he turned for one second as he sat unsteadily atop the big horse.\nThen he kicked his heels in and almost tumbled out of the saddle as the\nanimal surged forward."

As he came close, she\nrealized he wasn’t as big as he seemed from a distance. His white robes and\nthe white cape hanging off great blue horns rising from his shoulders made\nhim seem bigger than a mortal man, but he wasn’t even as tall as Gavin\nGuile. But he glowed. It was like yellow luxin filled his veins instead of\nblood. His hair had been sculpted into a spiky crown with yellow luxin, so\nit dazzled, as if he’d been crowned by the sun itself, and his eyes beneath\nwere a constant riot of colors. And he was staring at her.\nI’m not important enough for this, she thought again. Her cheek was\nthrobbing, still dribbling blood. The powder wagon’s explosion had\nknocked her unconscious, and shrapnel had cut her in a dozen places. She\ndidn’t know how they’d found her among all the bodies. She didn’t know\nwhy they would want her.\n“How did you come to be here, Aliviana Danavis?”\n“I walked, mostly,” she said. Danavis, so that was it. They knew her\nfather was commanding the enemy army. And she’d stupidly delivered\nherself into their hands. Well done, Liv.\nLord Omnichrome’s retainers surrounded them: broken-haloed drafters\nof every type, soldiers, messengers, and a few high-ranking officers from\nKing Garadul’s camp who looked decidedly uneasy around all the drafters,\nmuch less Lord Omnichrome. Lord Omnichrome picked up a strange\nmusket as long as he was tall. He lifted it, fitted its leg into a slot on the\nbarrel, propped it up in front of himself, and aimed down the hill toward the\nfighting.\n“Dead center on that green door,” he said.\n“Third house from the left?” a spotter asked.\nLiv didn’t know much about muskets, but she knew you couldn’t make\na shot that accurate at three hundred paces. Not that you’d want someone\nshooting in your direction, but past one hundred paces aiming was more a\ngeneral hope. Nonetheless, Lord Omnichrome took a deep breath, sighted\ndown the barrel through the mists, fired.\nThe musket roared.\n“Three hands high, one hand left,” the spotter said.\nLord Omnichrome handed the musket to an attendant, who began\nreloading it. He turned to Liv. “I want you to join me, Liv. I saw you, last\nnight, listening. You understood. I could tell you did.”\nOrholam, she thought he’d looked at her, but then she’d dismissed it as\nher imagination. There had been thousands listening last night. And how did\nhe recognize her?\n“You love your father, don’t you, Liv?”\n“More than anything,” she said. How did he know her name, much less\nher nickname?\n“And how old is he?”\n“Maybe forty?” she said.\n“Old, then. For a drafter. If he weren’t a drafter, he could live another"

She felt a surge of emotion. Who\nwas this bastard, talking about her father? She wouldn’t let anyone speak\nbadly of him. He was a great man. Even if he had made mistakes.\nThe attendant handed the long musket back to Lord Omnichrome. He\nraised it, stabilized its significant weight on its leg, and said, “Blue drafter,\njust right of the gatehouse.”\nLiv watched, horrified, as Lord Omnichrome waited. The blue drafter\nwas ducked behind a crenellation, popping up to throw death down on the\nmen below and ducking down again. He popped up, Lord Omnichrome\nsaid, “Heart.” The musket roared.\nA burst of light and blood and the drafter disappeared from view.\n“Shoulder, your left,” the attendant said. “One hand left and three\nthumbs high.”\nLord Omnichrome handed the musket back to the man with a polite\nthank-you. “When the time comes, will you tell them?” he asked Liv.\n“Tell them? Tell them about my father?” Liv hesitated. “I’ll do what I\nneed to do.”\n“What you need to do. Interesting how they make it that, isn’t it? What\nif you couldn’t make it back to the Chromeria in time? Would you kill your\nfather yourself, with your own hand? What if he asked you to stop? What if\nhe begged you?”\n“My father isn’t such a coward.”\n“You’re dodging the question.” Lord Omnichrome’s eyes were\nswirling orange. Liv had never liked oranges much. Always unnerved her.\nWhen she didn’t speak for a long moment, he said, “I understand perfectly.\nWhen I started my own Chromeria, I followed them blindly at first, too.\nDespite what I am. One of my students broke the halo and I murdered her\nwith my own hands. She wasn’t the first to die for the drafters’ ignorance\nnor the last, but she was the beginning of the end. When I killed her, I knew\nwhat I did was wrong. I couldn’t shake it.”\n“Drafters go mad. Like you. They turn on their friends. They kill those\nthey love.”\n“Oh, absolutely. Sometimes. Some people can’t handle power. Some\nmen seem decent until you give them a slave, and soon they’re a tyrant,\nbeating and raping the slave in their charge. Power is a test, Liv. All power\nis a test. We don’t call it breaking the halo. We call it breaking the egg. You\nnever know what kind of bird is going to be hatched. And some are born\ndeformed and must be put down. That is tragedy, but not murder. Do you\nthink your father could handle a little extra power? The great Corvan\nDanavis? An immensely talented drafter who’s nevertheless had the\ndiscipline to make it to forty?”\n“It’s not that simple,” Liv said."

Tell me, Liv, when you judge the\nChromeria by its fruit, do you find it a place of love and peace and light—as\none might expect from Orholam’s holy city?”\n“No,” Liv admitted. She didn’t even know why she was defending it,\nexcept out of stubbornness. The Chromeria was everything she hated, and it\ndefiled all it touched. Including her. She owed debts there, and she couldn’t\nlie to herself so much that she would believe her flight to Tyrea and to\nfollow Kip wasn’t partly a flight from her debt to Aglaia Crassos and\nRuthgar.\n“The truth is, Liv, you know I’m right. You’re just afraid to admit\nyou’ve been on the wrong side. I understand. We all do. There are good\nmen and women who fight against us, good people! But they’re deluded,\ndeceived.

Should these people pay because two brothers—\nneither of whom was born here or cared a whit for this land—fought here?\nFor how long should they pay?”\n“They shouldn’t,” Liv said.\n“Because it isn’t just.”\nHe took the long musket from the attendant again. “Red drafter, top of\nthe gatehouse. Head.”\nLiv watched. The battle in front of the Mother’s Gate was hard to see\nclearly through all the smoke and flashes of magic. But she saw King\nGaradul’s cavalry reaching the gate, loading their muskets and firing at the\nmen at the top of the wall, but seeming to wait for something, frustrated it\nhadn’t happened yet. Lord Omnichrome’s musket roared, and an instant\nlater there was a small bright flash at the top of the gate tower. Liv was glad\nshe hadn’t seen all of it.\n“Dead center, Lord Omnichrome,” the attendant announced.\n“Excellent shot!”\n“Begone! Leave us.” The top of the hill cleared quickly of everyone\nsave the musket attendant, whom Lord Omnichrome gestured to stay. Lord\nOmnichrome turned toward Liv. He wasn’t smiling. “I don’t like killing\ndrafters. I hate it,” he said. “What I do here is what must be done. I want"

Why me? I’m barely a bichrome, not that powerful, no\ninfluence.”\nHe snorted. “Are you ready for the answer to that question? You want\nto be an adult, Aliviana? You want hard truths? Because that’s the only kind\nI’ve known for the past sixteen years.”\n“I’m ready,” she said.\n“I want you because you’re a drafter and every drafter is precious to\nme. And because you’re Tyrean, and this country will take a lot of\nreassuring after we win, and I’m not Tyrean. And because you’re Corvan\nDanavis’s daughter.”\n“I knew it!” she spat.\n“Listen, you half-wit! Listen or you’re unworthy of the role I have for\nyou anyway.”\nThat shut her up.\n“As Corvan’s daughter, I have some hope that you’re half as intelligent\nas he is. If so, you’ll be a formidable ally. I need bright leaders. But I won’t\nlie to you. I hope that your coming to our side might free your father from\nthe Chromeria’s grip. I suspect that he only serves the Prism because they\nheld you hostage. If that’s true, Corvan might come over to us, and having a\ngeneral of his standing on our side might prevent any further war from even\nbeing necessary. That’s how much fear your father inspires. Men won’t\neven take the field against him. During the Prisms’ War, his enemies would\nuse spyglasses to see which general was directing a battle. If it was your\nfather, they would retreat and fight another day. That’s how good your\nfather is, and I’d be a fool to ignore him when he might fight for me. If you\nthink that’s me manipulating you, you’re right. I’ll use you. You’re\nimportant. The Chromeria will use you too. Already has. Grow up and\nrealize it. I’ll be honest about it, that’s all. And my honesty gives you a\nchoice. That’s better than they’ll give you.” His eyes were threaded with red\nand orange, like flames.\nHe was right. It was true. And if that was true, what if all of it was\ntrue?\n“King Garadul slaughtered my whole town.”\n“Yes. He even took some of my drafters and made them help him.”\nLiv had expected him to deny it, excuse it.\n“And yet you’d have me serve him?”\nLord Omnichrome lowered his voice. “Kings don’t live forever.\nEspecially reckless ones.”\nA huge explosion rocked the wall to the left of the gatehouse. It was\npowerful enough that it threw many of the combatants off their feet, and\nmore than a few people off the wall itself, but as the smoke gradually\ncleared, to Liv it seemed that the charge must have been planted on the\nother side of the wall—the damage that she could see there was much more\nextensive, rows of houses simply obliterated. A cheer went up among the\ncavalry, though, as the clearing smoke showed a gap blasted in the wall\nitself."

A cheer went up among the\ncavalry, though, as the clearing smoke showed a gap blasted in the wall\nitself.\n“You see, the people of Garriston are working with us. They want to be\nfree.”\nBut Liv barely heard him. She’d just seen something through the mists\non the battlefield that took her breath away. Kip. And not just Kip. Kip and\nKarris both were riding into the fray. For a moment, Liv didn’t understand.\nKip and Karris had switched sides? They were fighting to free Garriston?\nThen her eyes followed the path they were taking. The path led straight to\nKing Garadul.\nKing Garadul, who Kip hated for wiping out their town and killing his\nmother.\nAnd they were being pursued by half a dozen mounted Mirrormen.\n“How much am I worth to you?” Liv said.\n“I’ve already told you.”\n“Then I’m yours, on one condition.”\nThe red swirled out of his eyes, replaced by orange and blue.\n“Save my friends. Him, and her. The ones those Mirrormen are after.”\nShe pointed.\nLord Omnichrome beckoned his attendant sharply, and the man came\nrunning with his long musket. “You wish me to kill several allies in order to\ngain one,” Lord Omnichrome said. “You barter lives like—”\n“Like an adult,” Liv said sharply.\n“And a formidable one indeed. But I’m not in the business of buying\nloyalty. I’ll do my best to save your friends. As a gift, regardless of what\nyou decide.” He sighted down his musket and fired. A Mirrorman riding\ntoward Karris died in a flash of light and blood. Lord Omnichrome handed\nthe musket off to be reloaded.\n“So take that out of your calculations, Liv, but tell me now, whom will\nyou serve? Me, or the Chromeria?”\nFealty to One. And to one only.\nThere was no good choice. There were no good guys. Trying to do the\nright thing had led Liv to spying on her greatest benefactor. The Chromeria\ncorrupted even people’s love for each other. Everyone she knew said Lord\nOmnichrome was a monster, but everyone she knew had been corrupted by\nthe Chromeria. So maybe Lord Omnichrome wasn’t perfect. Neither was\nGavin. The only people innocent here were the people of Tyrea. They\ndeserved to be free. If Liv had to fight, she wasn’t going to fight for their\noppressors. Fealty to One? A Danavis had to choose whom she would\nserve? So be it.\nTaking a deep breath, Liv gave a full Tyrean formal curtsey. “Lord\nOmnichrome,” she said, her voice even, her eyes meeting his. “I’m yours.\nHow may I serve?”\nChapter 85\n“Traitors!” Kip heard a woman say. His head snapped toward Karris. She\nspat on the dead Mirrormen. Imperious, masterful.\nWhat is she doing?\nKarris grabbed a musket and powder horn and began reloading it, as if\nshe were a simple soldier.

They’d just seen her and Kip fight\nMirrormen, but none of the surrounding men knew who was fighting on\nwhich side or if they should interfere. It looked like these soldiers had lost\nall of their officers—not surprising, since the defenders on the wall would\ntry to kill officers first. That was probably the only reason Kip and Karris\nwere still alive.\n“Well, drafter?” she said, finishing her reloading. She was as fast at\nthat as she was at everything. Her skin was the color of blood. Her eyes\nwere no longer capped with the violet eye caps that kept her from drafting.\nWait, had he done that? He was feeling shaky, drained. Her bluff had\nworked, though. The soldiers were turning back to the fighting, determined\nnot to get in the way of this virago.\nShe was talking to him.\nThat’s right, genius, seeing how you’re the one who just drafted two\nhuge spikes and impaled a couple of Mirrormen.\nWhich made Kip look toward the men he’d killed. Mistake. One had a\nfrothy gore-hole in his chest the size of Kip’s fist. The other’s head was torn\nin pieces, chunks of white bone mixed amid red in a picture that refused to\ncoalesce into a face.\n“Kip, ordinarily this is a bad idea when you’re as new as you are, but I\nwant you to draft more green. I need you with me,” Karris hissed.\nHe was staring at the smear of head on the ground. The soldiers\npushing toward the gate were trampling right over the pieces of brain and\nbone, giving more room to the two drafters than they did to the men Kip\nhad killed.\n“Kip!” She slapped him, hard. “Cry later. Be a man now.” The red\ndiamonds in her emerald eyes blazed. She cursed, cast about for a moment,\nlooking for something, then a few threads of green wove their way from her\neyes to her fingertips through the ocean of red that colored her pale skin,\nand she drafted something small in her hands.\nSpectacles. Spectacles entirely of green luxin. She put them on his\nface, adjusted them, did something to seal them, and then stepped away.\n“Now draft!” she ordered.\nKip was a sponge. It was like going outside on a hot day, closing his\neyes, and basking in the heat. Everywhere he looked there were light-\ncolored surfaces, homes and shops whitewashed against the sun, and every\none of them gave him magic. He soaked it in, feeling potent. Free. The\nthrobbing in his burned hand faded to nothing.\nHe joined the stream of soldiers heading toward the gap in the wall.\nThe musket fire from atop the wall had all but ceased. It was turning into a\nglorious morning, bright, crisp, slowly burning off the mist. It would be hot\nsoon.\nWhere before, when he was unmoving, the stream of men had parted\naround him like a boulder as they saw that he was a drafter, as soon as he\njoined the stream he was jostled about just like everyone else.

As it got tighter and tighter, more and more constrained,\nKip started to rebel against it. He wasn’t sure how much of the agitation\nwas his, and how much was the green luxin’s influence on him, but he could\ntell that there was more to his reaction than his own psyche.\nWith the confluence of horses and men in armor—though only a small\nfraction of King Garadul’s army was armored or uniformed, those soldiers\nwere intent on going in first—Kip lost sight of King Garadul himself. Karris\nhad slipped into the line in front of him, and she was using her slender form\nand muscles to slip in between rows and push forward. Kip soon lost sight\nof her too. It was all he could do to keep on his feet as the crowd packed\ntight together right at the wall.\n“You!” someone shouted.\nKip looked. A horseman, ten paces away, was staring at him. Kip had\nno idea who the man was.\n“You!” the officer repeated. “You’re not one of us!”\nAt first, Kip had no idea who the man was. He thought maybe it was\none of the soldiers who’d escorted him with Zymun after Kip had blown up\nthe fire. But even that was only a guess. Unfortunately, it didn’t matter. The\nman recognized him.\nThe officer tugged at his musket, trying to pull it from the saddle\nsleeve, but there were other horses pressing in on either side of him, and it\nwas stuck.\n“Spy! Traitor!” the officer shouted, pointing at Kip. “He doesn’t have\nthe sleeves! He’s not one of us! Murderer! Spy! That green drafter is a spy!”\nKip had been pushed up the rubble pile to the gap in the wall itself. It\nput him at a high point. Everyone was able to see him.\nThe officer finally pulled his musket free and kicked his horse savagely\nto come after Kip. Turned backward looking at the man, not really believing\nhe would fire into a crowd of his compatriots, Kip lifted his hands to draft\nsomething, anything. His foot slid on the rubble, and the surging crowd,\nsome pulling away, some reaching toward him, threw him off balance. He\nwent down in stages. The people were packed so tight that he didn’t fall all\nat once, but neither could he stop himself once he started.\nThe gap in the wall vomited them into Garriston. Kip fell and rolled.\nSomeone stepped on his burned left hand. He screamed. Feet were\nhitting his sides, someone tripped over him, someone stepped on his belly,\nsomeone kicked the side of his head. He tumbled, rolling down the slight\nhill of rubble, tried to gain his feet, and got smacked with the stock of a\nmusket. He ended up on his back, head ringing, left hand on fire with pain,\neyes having trouble focusing. Without meaning to, he’d gone turtle again,\nas he had when Mistress Helel had tried to kill him—and again, he was\nabout as effective as a turtle on its back.\nIt was like the world knew Kip needed to take the coward’s way, and it"

Some were trying to slam musket butts down on him, but\nthere were so many people packed in so tightly around him that he only felt\na few glancing blows on his legs. Back in the old days, he would have\nrolled over on his stomach and buried his head in his hands, rolled into a\nball and waited until Ram had asserted his superiority again and tired of the\ngame and left him. Doing that here would be death.\nDo you expect me to take a whipping lying down?\nYes, Kip. It’s your way.\nYou expect me to die lying down?\nFace it, Kip, you’re not much of a fighter, not when it matters. Why\ndon’t you curl up in a ball and quit?\nPart of him expected Karris to save him. She was a fighter. A warrior.\nA drafter. She was quick and decisive, nimble and deadly with magic or\nblade.\nThe crowd was like a beast, a seething, teeming, roaring mass that had\nlost all individuality. And Kip hated it. He ducked his head as someone tried\nto stomp on him. He saw leering faces. Brief images of snarling mouths.\nVisages twisted with hatred.\nPart of him expected Ironfist to save him. The man had swept in out of\nnowhere twice before and done that. Ironfist was huge, strong, intimidating.\nHe was as quiet and as unmoving as steel. A guardian.\nPart of him expected Liv to save him. Why not? She’d come in at the\nlast minute to save him from the assassin Mistress Helel.\nPart of him expected Gavin to save him. What good was a Prism if he\ncouldn’t save his own bastard? Gavin was here. Somewhere. He had to be\nclose. He had to know the wall had been breached. He had to be hurrying\nhere even now.\nA kick caught Kip in the kidney, sending lances of pain through his\nwhole body. As he lurched, a fist caught him in the face. His head bounced\noff the stones. Blood shot out of his nose, drenching his mouth and chin.\nNo one was coming. Like when his mother had locked him in a\ncupboard when he was eight years old because he’d complained or talked\ntoo much or—he didn’t even remember what he’d done wrong. He just\nremembered the look of disgust on her face. She despised him. She threw\nhis soup at him and locked the door and went out to get high. And forgot\nabout him. Because he was worthless.\nAfter a day, the rats had come. He woke to one licking the dried soup\noff his neck. Its little claws dug into his chest, its weight terrifyingly heavy.\nHe’d screamed, jumped to his feet, thrashed. Screamed and screamed, and\nno one heard. That rat ran away, but soon, in the darkness, more had come.\nThey dropped into his hair, bit his bare toes, scrambled up his pant legs."

He’d\nscreamed until his throat was raw, thrashed and hit at them until his hands\nwere bleeding, twisted his ankle on some old boxes crammed into the\ncupboard. And no one had come.\nHis mother had found him on the morning of the third day, curled in a\nball, head tucked in his arms, whimpering, dehydrated, long bloody wounds\nall over his head, shoulders, back, and legs, not even trying to dislodge the\nrats covering him like a cloak. There were a dozen dead rats with him and\nmore live ones. She’d given him water, eyes haze-glazed, begrudgingly\ncleaned his wounds with the last of her harsh lemon liquor, and then\nwandered out to find more haze. All without a word. She seemed to have\nforgotten it all when he next saw her. He still had scars on his shoulders,\nback, and butt where the rats had bit him.\nNo one’s coming, Kip. Another kick. You always were a\ndisappointment. Another kick. A failure. Kick. You’re not good at anything.\nKick.\n“Enough! Enough!” someone shouted. The officer finally pushed\nthrough the crowd, carrying his musket. “Move back!” he shouted.\nHe hefted the musket, pointing it at Kip’s head.\nWhat can I do? Draft little green balls? Fine.\nKip drafted a green ball and threw it up into the yawning barrel, willed\nit to stay.\nThe officer pulled the trigger. A moment, then the musket exploded in\nhis hands. The breach of the musket blew out, throwing flaming black\npowder into the man’s face, setting his beard alight. He screamed, fell back.\n“Kill him!” someone shouted.\nKip saw steel being drawn on all sides, flashes of the sun on blades.\nAnd he started laughing. Because he was good at something.\nHe was good at taking punishment. He was a turtle. Or maybe a bear.\nA turtle-bear. Orholam, he was an idiot. He laughed again, slapping his\nhands to his shoulders as he lay on the ground. Green luxin jetted out,\ncovering him like he’d seen it cover the green wight back in Rekton.\nAs Kip watched, a sword descended and hacked into the green luxin\nover his arm. It cut in two finger’s breadths, but the luxin was thicker. It\nstopped, quivering like an ax in wood. Kip flipped over, pulling in more\ngreen from every light surface, not even knowing how he did it, pulling and\npulling, drafting light from Orholam’s endless tap.\nIt filled him with that same wildness. Wildness chained, hemmed in,\ntrapped. The luxin covering him grew thicker. Kip gathered his feet beneath\nhimself and stood, roaring.\nHe was crazy. He was crazy, and he felt great. He smashed a green\nforearm into a wide-eyed man holding a sword. It flung the man back. Kip\npaused for a second, and spikes sprouted from his green armor everywhere."

Kip\npaused for a second, and spikes sprouted from his green armor everywhere.\nHe threw his weight back and forth, crashing into the crowd like they were\nrats to smash against cupboard walls.\nBlood was flying in red ropes. Kip wasn’t human anymore. He was an\nanimal, unwilling to be caged. He was a mad dog. Some dim, thinking part\nof him thought that he shouldn’t have been able to move so well with such a\nheavy suit on him. He was strong, but not this strong.\nHe had no sense of the battle beyond the little circle around him. Even\nthat was a blur—sharp motions to the left and right, gleams of light off\nblades and rising muskets to be crushed before they could fire. He slashed\nand hacked and pounded with unreasoning fury. He could hold only one\nthought: I will not be stopped.\nIn moments, or hours, Kip had no notion of time—he saw fear in every\neye. A continual flood of men spilled in through the gap, thrust forth hard\nby the mass of bodies behind them, all pushing them forward and into Kip,\nbut his very presence was slowing the flood, men pushing back as soon as\nthey saw him, others leaping to the sides, hoping to avoid his fury.\nTheir weakness inflamed him further. Like rats willing to bite in the\ndarkness but scattering in the light, they were cowards. He clubbed them,\nsmashing heads, ripping open bellies. He charged the gap where they\ncouldn’t flee, impaled them, flung gore left and right.\nA thought won through his brain. Among all the shouting and screams\nand fear and mist and musket fire and clash of arms, someone was\nscreaming a word: “Kip! Kip! King Garadul! That way!”\nKip couldn’t see who was shouting. He stretched, found himself taller,\nthe luxin swirling under his feet, boosting him several hand’s breadths.\nLooking into the city, he saw Karris, skin red and green entwined, holding a\nsword, pointing it deeper into the city still.\nKing Garadul was rallying his Mirrormen around him there, pulling\nthem together after they’d been separated coming through the gap. He was\nscreaming orders. Seemed furious about something. Hadn’t seen Kip.\nBefore he even knew what he was doing, Kip was charging, all his will\nfocused, intent, implacable. This one thing remained: King Garadul had to\npay for what he’d done. He had to die.\nChapter 86\nWhen Gavin heard the explosion, he knew immediately what it was. He\nwas almost back to the wall on his way from the docks, where he’d been\nusing the first light to help draft boats for the refugees. The evacuation was\nentirely possible if people would be reasonable. Gavin had told the city’s\nelders that nobles could bring three chests, armorers and apothecaries could\nbring three as well, rich merchants could bring two, and everyone else\ncould only bring what they could carry.\nIt was a simple rationale, if a hard one.

And though it stuck\nin Gavin’s throat to help the rich more than the poor, the rich would bring\ntheir riches out of the city. Those riches, if left, would again be used by\nKing Garadul and would help him kill others. If people did everything\naccording to orders, there would still be room for everyone to escape who\nwanted to.\nExcept, of course, everyone cheated. Everyone. Nobles brought six\nchests. Rich merchants brought five. Others lied and claimed to be armorers\nor apothecaries who were not.\nGavin put a local guild head in charge, went to draft on the barges, and\nwhen he came back found the man letting his own guild members bring\nextra baggage. Gavin drafted a scaffold off the side of the pier in five\nseconds, and had the man strangling on it in ten. He put someone else in\ncharge before the first man was dead.\n“Make decisions fast and as justly as you can,” Gavin told the deeply\nfrowning, pockmarked cooper he was putting in charge. “And my whole\nauthority is behind you, even if you make mistakes. Take one bribe, and I’ll\ntake my time making your death as much worse than this as I can imagine.”\nThen he left. He didn’t have time for this.\nHe was at the base of the wall when he heard the explosion. It was\nexactly what he’d been afraid of. It had been why he’d drafted Brightwater\nWall in the first place. With all the homes and shops built directly against\nthe city wall, it was hard to defend from enemies outside, but impossible to\ndefend from enemies within. Anyone who owned a shop could be given\nbarrels of black powder, tunnel under the wall a little bit, and set a charge.\nThey could work in full privacy, uninterrupted—could, and had.\nBlackguards in tow, Gavin dug his heels into his horse’s flanks. But he\ndidn’t head for the gap. A hole in the wall was a prize, of course, but it\nwould immediately attract defenders, and it might not be big enough for the\narmy to come through. It might become a choke point, a killing zone. Better\nto use the distraction of a breach in the walls to open a gate elsewhere.\nGavin dispatched messengers to the Hag’s Gate and the Lover’s Gate\nand headed toward the Mother’s Gate. At the top of the wall, he ran into\nGeneral Corvan Danavis with his entourage. Doubtless, Corvan was going\nto direct the defense at the breach in the wall personally.\nCorvan paused only to say, “They’re holding back their drafters and\ncolor wights. I don’t know why. But if we lose a gate in the next twenty\nminutes, we won’t make it until noon.” That was Corvan, condensing the\ninformation to the absolutely vital.\n“If it falls,” Gavin said, “be at the ships an hour before noon.”\nCorvan nodded his head. No fighting to the death. Gavin clapped\nCorvan’s shoulder. Then the general was gone.\nAt the top of the gate, Gavin looked over the teeming mass on the\nother side.

Hardly anyone was firing at the invaders from the wall anymore,\nbut the army pushed forward like a blind beast, black fingertips reaching up\nto grab the wall.\nMany of the homes outside the wall had been demolished in just a few\nhours, but of those that remained, the army had found which places were\neasiest to scale. At half a dozen places, a slow trickle of men were\nclambering up onto the wall itself and engaging the few defenders.\nFarther out, King Garadul’s men were setting up their mortars. Too\nlate, really. There was no point in them bombarding the city at all, and\ndoing so now would probably kill as many of their own as it would kill\ndefenders. Nonetheless, they were already loading the mortars. Gavin had\nfound that lots of men liked to be safe from the fighting, but they wanted to\nbe able to say they’d taken part. Those idiots would fire some rounds and\nlater brag how they’d turned the battle.\nGood to see that King Garadul’s got discipline problems too.\nAnd where was the king?\nFrom the gate’s highest point, looking back into the city, Gavin spied\nhim despite the mists. King Garadul had pressed into the city himself. Idiot!\nSure, Gavin had done the same more than once, but he was armed like few\nothers. Gavin’s presence on a battlefield wasn’t simple morale-boosting.\nKing Garadul was leading the attack, surrounded by perhaps a hundred\nMirrormen. As Gavin caught sight of him, he saw the king yelling at some\nmessenger, gesticulating angrily.\nHe wants his drafters.\nAnd why isn’t he getting them?\nGavin moved to the front of the Mother’s spear, stared out to the hill,\nsome five hundred paces away. On the crown of the hill there were banners\nand a crowd. He drafted lenses, adjusted the distance necessary between the\ntwo to get the focus right, and studied the image above the low-hanging\nmists. A multicolored man was lifting a musket, pointing it right at him.\nInsanity. No musket could fire so—\nThe musket fired—a huge charge from the cloud of black smoke.\nGavin couldn’t hear it over the rest of the sounds of battle, of course. One\nof the mortars fired. Gavin continued to study the man. He drafted the two\nlenses together to keep the focus steady. A polychrome wight. Probably a\nfull polychrome, or at least pretending to be one, from all the colors he’d\ndrafted into his own body. Curious. The man was studying him too.\nAround Lord Omnichrome, there were not just the usual complement\nof generals and lackeys, but dozens of drafters. They were clearly not going\nanywhere.\nSomeone handed the musket back to Lord Omnichrome. Lord\nOmnichrome took the musket, aimed quickly, and fired. A second later,\nsomething hit the Mother’s spear two paces above Gavin’s head and\nexploded, taking a chunk out of the rock. Luxin projectiles? From five\nhundred paces? Gavin was still thinking about it as the Blackguards pulled\nhim away and to the back of the spear."

Gavin was still thinking about it as the Blackguards pulled\nhim away and to the back of the spear.\nLord Omnichrome wanted King Garadul dead. So simple, so bold. He\nprobably had even egged on King Garadul at Brightwater Wall, daring him\nto be a promachos, getting the young king to lead from the front, hoping\nhe’d get killed.\nIf your enemy wants it, deny it.\nGavin drafted a small yellow tablet, making it read, “Capture Garadul,\nnot kill. At all costs.” He covered it in blue and liquid yellow luxin and shot\nit into the path where he believed Corvan was going.\nBut Gavin’s intuition told him the main strike was going to happen\nelsewhere, while the defenders focused their efforts here. “To the Hag’s\nGate,” he told his Blackguards. “We run!”\nChapter 87\nKarris snatched a second sword from a man lying on the ground, bleeding\nfrom a stomach wound. She didn’t know what side he was fighting for; she\ndidn’t care. The city smelled of gunpowder, sewage, and men’s sweat, the\nkind of stench that gets into leather armor and never comes out. As she ran,\nshe drafted a thin sheen of green luxin down the swords, sealed it, then ran\nred luxin on top of that and sealed that too.\nThis entire area was a tangle of alleys. The buildings were thrown\ndown haphazardly with seeming intent to vex one’s neighbors and make\nstraight lines of sight impossible. The good news was that it made it\nimpossible for King Garadul to rally his men in any numbers here.\nThe bad news was that—oh shit! Karris rounded a corner and almost\nran into three Mirrormen, lost, peering down different alleys and looking\nlike they were about to start arguing which way to go. Karris careened into\nthem before any of them could react. She threw her weight into the smallest\none and, catching him flat-footed, managed both to stop herself and to fling\nhim off his feet. She spun, left sword swinging in a red arc.\nThe second Mirrorman was moving his sword into guard position, but\ntoo slowly, with no leverage. Her blade beat right through his and cut into\nhis neck above his gorget. Not a deep cut, but deep enough, right there. Red\nluxin splattered on the outside of his armor, and as she yanked the blade\nback, red blood splattered the inside to match. He was still standing for the\nmoment, but to Karris he was already dead.\nBetween colliding with the first Mirrorman and cutting the second,\nKarris had lost sight of the last one. She spun around, ducking, blocking\nwith both swords, left down, right up in a reversed grip. The cut would have\nbeaten right through her weak right-hand guard if she hadn’t ducked too.\nInstead, her own blade slapped into her shoulder.

        "text": "—what kind of moron went into battle without armor?\nShe came up cutting, but the Mirrorman blocked her strike. Then his\neyes went wide. A low red flush of light washed them both. His sword had\nstruck sparks off of hers, setting the red luxin aflame—and not only on her\nsword. Where the two blades had met, his sword had scraped off red luxin\ntoo, and the same sparks had set his alight. She’d intended the flames for\nlater, but it worked as well for now.\nKarris swung her right-hand, flaming sword in a quick arc and stabbed\nthe Mirrorman in the face with her left.\nIf you’re going to wear heavy armor, never open the visor while you’re\nin battle.\nShe kicked him off her blade in a spray of broken teeth and exhaled\nblood, spun again, and saw the Mirrorman she’d collided with and sent\nsprawling crawling for his blade. She stomped on his hand as he lunged for\nit, and punched her blade through the mirror armor. It took a strong, direct\nstrike to push through plate, but she’d practiced it a hundred times with the\nBlackguard, who trained assuming assassins would bear every advantage,\nincluding mirror armor.\nPulling the blade free again, she quickly wiped the last of the flaming\nred luxin off the sword with one of the men’s cloaks and reapplied the red\nluxin. She’d set herself alight if she wasn’t careful. She lifted a sturdy bow\nand a half-empty quiver from one of the dead.\nNow where the hell was she? And where was Kip?\nKarris had taken a shortcut, she thought. She knew there was a market\non the south side of the city, and she’d thought she remembered roughly\nwhere it was. She’d pointed Kip after King Garadul hoping he would wreak\nsome havoc by following, which would allow her to circle behind the king\nand kill him.\nMaybe it had been a bad choice. Orholam, she’d abandoned Kip. A\nbaby drafter.\nNot that she could have done much to help him. At the Chromeria,\nthey called what Kip had done going green golem. At one time, they had\ntaught it as a war magic. No longer.\nThere were three problems with going green golem. First, you couldn’t\nseal the green luxin. If you did, you couldn’t move. Some drafters got\naround that by making big sealed plates and just holding the joints in open\ngreen. What Kip was doing was much harder. He was holding all the magic\nat once. It took enormous focus, and the armor was only as hard as his will.\nIf someone broke his focus, he’d lose his armor instantly. Second, using that\nmuch green luxin burned out drafters fast. In the False Prism’s War, Karris\nhad heard of green drafters breaking the halo after going green golem only\nthree or four times. Third, you had to be strong as a bull. The suit—the\narmor, the golem, whatever it was—had weight. For the drafter, it was less\nbecause their will took part of the weight, but they still had to move an\nenormous hunk of luxin. That said, using open green in the legs did mean\nthat a skilled user could make enormous bounds, and once they got moving,"

That said, using open green in the legs did mean\nthat a skilled user could make enormous bounds, and once they got moving,\nthey were nearly impossible to stop.\nIt all meant that Kip was more likely to get himself killed than\nanything. And Karris had abandoned him. Damn it. What kind of woman\nabandons a child?\nKarris double-checked the position of the sun from the shadows. The\nsun was still low in the sky and these alleys were swaddled in shadows and\nmist. As she looked up, she was struck by it. The rooftops rose from the\nmists like distant, square mountain peaks reigning over the clouds. Then she\nsaw the retreat flares. It was the color Gavin or the Blackguards were\nsupposed to use, and she was sure that was how he was using them now.\nBut retreat to where?\nThe docks. They knew they were going to lose the city. They were just\ntrying to make King Garadul pay as heavy a price as possible. Karris didn’t\nhave much time to make sure that price was the ultimate price.\nShe ran into an empty house—she was pretty sure all the houses were\nempty here. Pushing past the leavings of chickens and several dogs, and one\nlive skinny cow—lots of people brought their animals inside during the\nnight, both for safety and to warm the house—she found the stairs, ran up to\nthe family’s quarters, which had been hurriedly emptied, and found the\nladder to the roof.\nThe square, squat houses of Garriston all had these flat roofs. The roof\nbecame a third room for most families. A perfect place to cool down on the\nhot, long summer evenings, the commoners’ only chance of catching a\nbreeze off the Cerulean Sea. The buildings were packed tight, but by no\nmeans uniform. Not every building was three stories, and even of the many\nthat were, the stories were different heights.\nAll the same, as Karris reached the roof, for one moment she was\nstruck by the beauty of the scene. The whitewashed roofs, little squares and\nrectangles, gleaming in the sun, with mist curling up around every edge,\nchurches and a few mansions rising like mountains out of the clouds, and\nthe Travertine Palace dominating everything. Farther south, she could just\nsee Brightwater Wall, like a golden belt around the city. Nearer, there was\nblack smoking rising from the city wall, flashes of magic from the gates.\nShe shut it out. Found the market she’d been heading for. With the\nmist, she couldn’t see enough to tell if her guess had been correct.\nYou’ve already bet Kip’s life on this course, might as well see if it pays\noff.\nCursing herself for a fool, Karris drafted a green weapon harness,\nsheathed both blades on her back, messed with the harness for a second to\nget it to set right with the quiver and bow, cursed the torn, tight sleeves on\nher dress, cursed her muscular shoulders, and tore the sleeves off. She\nbreathed. Then she sprinted to the edge of the roof and leapt.\nThe houses here were so close, it was an easy jump. Some homes even\nhad planks between them so neighbors could visit each other.

So long as she\ndidn’t want to cross the street, it was easy going. She ran as fast as she\ncould. One street to clear, then another block of houses, then the market.\nHer eyes bounced back and forth as she approached the larger gap of\ncrossing the street.\nThere! One of the houses on the other side had a significantly lower\nroof. Karris veered left and leapt, passing over the heads of thirty or forty\nMirrormen. She hit the lower roof, rolled, popped to her feet just in time to\nhave to leap again—to a higher roof. She hit the next roof with one foot\nextended. She pushed up, trying to push herself just a little higher but not\nstop her forward momentum.\nHer body popped up, but not forward enough. She landed with half of\nher torso on flat, whitewashed stucco, then slid down, scrambling, trying to\nfind purchase.\nShe dropped to her fingertips, on dirty, cracked, crumbling stucco. She\nswung sideways, lost one handhold for a second as the stucco ripped away.\nShe latched her hand back onto the roof, a clean grip this time, and swung\nback the other way. Her foot reached the edge, tearing the slit of her dress\nup even higher. She pulled herself up quickly, not trusting that the rest of\nthe stucco wouldn’t crumble at any moment.\nNo time to be elated at being alive. Karris checked her swords and\nbow, glanced once down at the twenty-foot drop onto an uneven surface\nbelow—a broken leg there if she’d fallen, at least. Then she ran again.\nShe reached a roof overlooking the market and stopped. King Garadul\nwas coming, with hundreds of Mirrormen and a few drafters—and Kip was\nhot on their heels. Literally.\nThis was going to get messy.\nKarris smiled.\nChapter 88\nKip was on fire. Someone had doused him in red luxin and lit him up.\nIt didn’t stop him. He simply thickened the green that encased him so\nthe red wouldn’t burn through. The pyre jelly stuck to the green. He\ncouldn’t rub it away from his face, it was glued in place, implacable. But he\ncould move the green luxin itself, so he made it swirl outward, until his\neyes were clear and he could see again. Using the same technique, he\nswirled all of the pyre jelly to his arms and shoulders, then along his sides,\nso he was outlined in flame. It all took only a few moments. He thought it,\nand the luxin did it. Or more precisely, he willed it, and it happened.\nThe wildness within him was so strong that he wanted to break free of\nthe city and run away. But he wouldn’t allow it. He harnessed the wildness.\nThe wildness would serve him. It would help him destroy the man who held\nthe lash and the leash, the man who wanted to control him: King Garadul.\nHe wasn’t sure that he was going the right way, but he followed the\nflow of King Garadul’s soldiers.

But the light made his vision lousy. It was like\nholding a torch: if you held it over your head, you might see into the\ndarkness, but if you held it between yourself and the darkness, you weren’t\ngoing to see anything at all. Kip was the torch. He couldn’t see much, and\nhe didn’t care. He could see the men streaming away from him, some of\nthem seeing him and just running like hell, but others seemed to be running\ntoward something. A meeting place, a rallying point. Where King Garadul\nwould be.\nKip barreled around a corner into the backs of half a dozen soldiers.\nThey hadn’t seen him and he couldn’t stop. He ran right over them in a\nmess of screams and burning flesh and curses and blood and a struggle just\nto keep from falling as he stepped on body parts. He swung his arms in big\nsweeping motions, fire and blood and blades unleashed into a crowd.\nAnd it was a crowd. Kip had made it. There were hundreds of soldiers\nhere. He could see dim flashes of the winking armor of the Mirrormen on\nthe other side of the square. Then he was subsumed, folded into the loving\narms of battle. There was no morning mist. No counting of his foes. No\ndeciphering the shouts of his enemies into plain language, orders that might\nhelp him know what was coming. There was only the roar coming from\nKip’s own throat, the hammering of his own heart, the pulsing life that was\nhis magic. There was only the burning in his muscles, the resistance his arm\nfelt as a bladed arm cut into a man’s torso, and the freedom as he pulled it\nall the way through.\nThe world closed in on Kip. He could barely see, barely turn his neck\nwithin the green armor. It drove him crazy. He needed freedom. He couldn’t\nbe trapped. He was an animal. He crashed through ranks of soldiers as they\nformed against him. His sweeping arms snapped spears like nothing. He\nbludgeoned heads with his closed fists. Tore men off his back and snapped\ntheir spines in his hands.\nThen, abruptly, the ranks parted in front of him. All except one man,\nwho didn’t move aside in time, and Kip saw two rows of ten musketeers\neach. The first row was kneeling, the second row standing, all muskets\npointed at him. Someone shouted, his voice a command. And Kip saw the\none soldier between him and the musketeers. The man heard too, and\nunderstood. Kip saw the panic on his face.\nThe musketeers loosed a volley. Fire and smoke leaped like a\npouncing, snarling lion from their muskets. Kip saw the soldier cut down,\neven as he steeled himself against the blast.\nThe musket balls hit him like a fist, many striking at the same time,\nand a few instants behind the first, carrying him like a punch’s follow-\nthrough.

Kip’s head swam and he felt the green luxin going\nsoft all around him.\nNo! I can take punishment. That’s my gift. That’s my talent.\nA musketeer ran over to Kip, pointed a blunderbuss at his head.\nSomething streaked by the man’s head—an arrow?—but missed. Kip\ngrabbed the yawning mouth of the blunderbuss and pulled it to himself,\nstuck it right to his forehead, and pressed green luxin down the barrel. The\nman pulled the trigger and the breech exploded.\nKip jumped to his feet with inhuman strength. He stomped on the\nscreaming musketeer and looked at himself. He could see the lead musket\nballs, flattened, inside his green armor. Like they’d shot a tree. The bullets\nhad penetrated, but been stopped. Kip laughed, damn near insane. He was\nbulletproof.\nIgnoring the musketeers, several of whom were running away while\nthe rest were reloading furiously, fumbling with their ramrods and powder\nhorns, trying to ready another shot, Kip looked for King Garadul. These\nmen were no threat. They couldn’t bind him. But he couldn’t see. So he\npulled green luxin around him and made himself taller. Simple.\nAnd there he was. Surrounded by his Mirrormen, King Garadul was\nmounted, shouting at a drafter beside him, pointing at Kip. The drafter’s\nskin was bright blue, but even as she gathered her magic, something\nstreaked out of the sky. The woman’s hands opened limply and blue poured\nout of her, puddled on the ground. She toppled out of her saddle.\nKing Garadul stopped in midsentence, looked around. The drafter on\nhis other side, a red, fell out of her saddle. This time Kip—and all the\nMirrormen—followed the arrow’s path back to its source. Up on a rooftop.\nKarris, skinny, muscular, bloody, wearing a torn dress and already drawing\nanother arrow. One of the Mirrormen tackled King Garadul out of his\nsaddle. Karris’s third arrow cracked a Mirrorman’s greave and pinned his\nleg into his horse. The stallion went crazy, bolting, knocking down half a\ndozen men and trampling them before it tripped and rolled over on the\nMirrorman.\nKip ignored the havoc. He had his target now. He could feel his\nstrength ebbing. He had to do this now. There would be no second chance.\nHe bulled forward, men and women dodging out of his way, slowly\nreaching full speed.\nI’m crazy.\nKip laughed. If this was insanity, so be it. He collided with the first\nranks of Mirrormen before they had all recovered from looking for Karris.\nSome were turned, some were mounted, others had dismounted, some were\nstill drawing or reloading muskets to fire at the rooftop assassin.

Elsewhere, he saw that the\nspikes and blades he’d drafted onto his body had been cut or broken off\nwhere it collided with mirror armor. He smashed left and right, but even as\nhe crushed men, his armor was disintegrating. He was hacking parts of\nhimself off with every blow he inflicted.\nThe Mirrormen, recovering, formed up behind the front row. Kip burst\nthrough the row and found himself staring at dozens of pistols, all roaring.\nIt knocked him back once more, even though he braced himself. He felt hot\nlines against his skin—the luxin was thinner now. Some of the shots must\nhave gotten through.\nI will not fail. Not now. Not so close. Damn it, where’s the king?\nKip lashed out at the nearest Mirrorman, shooting a ball of green luxin\nat the man. It hit the Mirrorman’s chest and split in half, gobs of green luxin\nflying off in either direction, leaving no more damage than if Kip had\nthumped the man’s chest lightly with his fist, scored only because a musket\nball had been carried unintentionally inside the green luxin Kip had thrown.\nThe rest of the Mirrormen dropped their muskets and drew sharp,\nmirror-bright swords as one. Kip was looking at his chest, studded with\nthose flattened musket balls suspended in green luxin, some of them\nsurrounded by blood where they had cut him. He was drawing in more\nluxin to replenish his armor and he saw the little balls swirling around like\nlittle boats under a waterfall.\nLuxin doesn’t hurt? How about lead?\nKip drew one of the lead balls up from his chest into his hand. He\nextended his hand and shot out a tiny ball of green luxin carrying the\nmusket ball with all his will.\nA little hole lined in green goo appeared in one of the Mirrormen’s\nchest plates. His mirror armor cracked in splintery, spidery lines around the\nhole, and then crimson blood joined the emerald luxin and he toppled\nbackward.\nIt was like Orholam had breathed new life into Kip. He was exhausted,\nbroken, elated, and free. He was laughing again. Totally insane. Totally\nunstoppable. Lead bullets swirled through his armor and into his palms and\nhe fired them like he was a musket himself. The weight of green armor,\nwhich had been so crippling before, now allowed him to shoot the little\nbullets so hard that if he had been doing it without the armor it would have\nbowled him over.\nHe extended right hand, left hand, right hand, left. Shooting\neverywhere. At each place, men died. Kip wasn’t accurate in the least, but\nthis close, he didn’t need accuracy. He pointed at a chest and might hit a\nneck or a belly or someone else in the second rank. Either way, it killed, and\nranks disappeared before him.

He cut a gory path through the Mirrormen. He couldn’t see King\nGaradul, but he figured that wherever the resistance was greatest was\nprobably the right way. Nothing good is easy.\nThrough the ranks and chaos, Kip saw a flash of something. Royal\ngarments. Garadul.\nHe burst through just as King Garadul was pulled up onto a platform at\nthe back of the market square. His men were trying to hustle him down\nsome narrow alley there. Kip bounded forward, and found that his green\nluxin legs bounced him much farther than he’d intended. He landed\nbetween King Garadul and the alley, crushing two of the king’s men,\nincluding his last drafter. The ground was littered with dead drafters, but\nKip didn’t care how they’d died. He had eyes only for the king. He\nextended a hand behind him and shot out a dozen musket balls toward the\nremaining Mirrormen.\nKing Garadul tripped over a body on the platform. In an instant, Kip\nwas on top of him. He kicked at Kip. Kip brought a big fist down and broke\nthe king’s leg like kindling. The man screamed. Kip grabbed his head,\nlatching big luxin fists together on either side and lifting. The rattle of\nmusket fire stopped. Kip was too close to the king; no one would dare.\n“You killed my mother!” Kip shouted in the king’s face.\nThe king’s eyes focused on Kip’s face within the green armor. “You?”\nhe said. “Lina’s brat? She’s not worthy of vengeance and you know it.”\n“Kip!” Someone was shouting, but Kip barely heard it. The king was\ntrying to draw a bich’hwa from his belt, but he was in too much pain.\n“Go to hell!” Kip screamed. “You go to hell!” He lifted the king high\nand squeezed with all his strength and all his will.\n“Kip! Stop! This is just what Lord Omnichrome wants—”\nNothing could penetrate the madness, the sheer fury. Kip wasn’t even\nsure whether it was more at this man for massacring his village or at his\nmother. He loved her. He hated her.\nKing Garadul screamed and Kip screamed and together they drowned\nout Corvan Danavis’s scream. Kip’s hands clapped together and the king’s\nhead popped like a grape, like a watermelon dropped from a great height,\nsplattering juice all over.\n“Kip! No! It’s just what they want you to do!” Corvan Danavis’s voice\npenetrated Kip’s iron skull as he dropped the king’s limp corpse onto the\nplatform.\nLooking up, stunned, Kip saw Corvan Danavis, mounted at the head of\nperhaps a hundred men riding into the square. The invaders, already broken\nand leaderless without King Garadul, scattered at the sight of so many fresh\nsoldiers.\nKip heard a body fall behind him, and turned to see a Mirrorman with\nan arrow in his heart.

He’d\nmeant to save her, hadn’t he?\nThat turned out well.\nHe looked at King Garadul’s body and felt nothing but emptiness.\nWhen he looked up, Corvan Danavis was there, swearing. Kip had never\nheard Master Danavis swear.\n“Do you have any idea what you’ve just done?” Corvan asked.\n“Go to hell,” Kip said, empty, dry, lifeless. “He killed our whole town.\nHe deserved worse.”\nCorvan stopped and looked at Kip with a new respect in his eyes. He\ndidn’t say anything for a moment, then said, “Mount up. We have to get out\nof the city. Now.”\n“But I killed him. Don’t we win?” Kip asked. His head felt so thick\nand fuzzy. And the light was hurting his eyes. He wanted nothing so much\nas a blanket and a dark room. They had won, hadn’t they? “Why do we\nhave to go?”\n“Look at that,” Karris said, coming close. She was already mounted.\nShe was pointing toward the wall.\nLord Omnichrome stood on top of the Mother’s Gate, perhaps four\nhundred paces distant, and when he spoke, through some trick of magic,\nthey could hear him perfectly. “They’ve killed King Garadul! Avenge the\nking! Drive out the foreigners!”\nThe gate opened, revealing hundreds of drafters—hundreds—and\ndozens of color wights. They were followed by thousands more soldiers.\n“That’s why,” Karris said.\nChapter 89\nGavin’s intuition was wrong.\nOn arriving at the Hag’s Gate, he’d become like a man trying to plug a\nleaky hull with his fingers and toes. He could only reach so far. He and the\nBlackguards had held the Hag’s Gate alone, with no other support, against\nthousands of soldiers, for ten minutes now. At this point he could hold it by\nsimply standing here behind the bullet shield his Blackguards had drafted in\nfront of him.\nThey weren’t fighting him. Everywhere he went, the army facing him\nwithdrew. If the city had only had one gate, that might have been helpful.\nBut with three gates and a crumbling three-quarters circle for a wall, it was\nhopeless. No one would face him. They simply sent men around the sides\nand waited. If he held these men up for long, the armies would simply enter\nthrough the other gates. By this time surely all the gates had fallen.\nSo his enemy was canny. He wasn’t wasting his men throwing them\nagainst Gavin.

Then Gavin would\neither be rendered totally ineffectual, dashing from one place to another\nfighting men who melted away, or he would become separated from the\nmain body of his army—at which point Lord Omnichrome would throw\naway as many lives as he needed to to kill him. Or capture him.\nThe campaigner in Gavin was furious. During the war, he would have\ngone for the throat. They wanted to melt in front of him? He would have\ngone for the king and killed him and let the chips fall where they may.\nDoing such a thing would put him in the most peril possible, but he\nwouldn’t have cared. Which is why fortune favors the young. He snorted. If\nhe got killed, the refugees wouldn’t make it two leagues out of the harbor.\nCursing, Gavin drafted the retreat flares and shot them high into the\nsky.\n“Any news from the docks?” he asked.\n“No, sir.”\nGavin hadn’t expected any messengers to be able to find him, but it\nstill would have been nice. “Let’s go.”\nA red Blackguard laid down a thick carpet of red luxin across the\nbroken opening of the gate and set fire to it as Gavin turned and started\njogging. They’d lost their horses earlier, and hadn’t grabbed any\nreplacements. Horses that weren’t trained to musket fire and magic were\noften as dangerous to their riders as they were useful. Being mounted also\nmade you a nicer target for muskets and drafters. The city wasn’t that big,\nthey’d run.\nOdd, running through an empty city. Almost everyone was simply\ngone, and there wasn’t yet that air of abandonment and layer of dust that\nsettled over cities soon after their inhabitants had left. Garriston was the\nkind of empty that happened when people left food burning on the fire and\nsimply ran. The burnt smell hadn’t even dissipated yet. In fact, they were\nlucky no one had burned the city down. Empty alleys. Empty homes. Little\npotted flowers abandoned in windowsills and not yet withered.\nDeath will come for you too, little flower.\nThey made it to one of the bridges when the ambush was sprung. Two\ndozen drafters and several color wights popped up from the roofs and began\nhurling magic. No hesitation, no warning. Of course. They’d circled Gavin\nto cut off the most obvious route out. The flat roofs gave them an excellent\nplatform from which to attack, and the open area of the bridge made a\nperfect killing field.\nBut the Blackguards were Blackguards. Every one of them knew his\ntask and how the tasks would shift depending on which of them were killed.\nThey practiced for this. This is what they were. Shields of green luxin, blue\nluxin, and more green luxin, three layers thick, enfolded Gavin. He knew\nexactly where they would land, and each shield had holes in it, so that he\ncould fight too.\nHe stuck a hand outside of his shield and pointed at every one of the\nattackers he could see. He shot narrow tendrils of superviolet luxin at them,\nsticking it to each drafter, leaving dangling ropes of superviolet. Two of the"

Two of the\nBlackguards were superviolet/blue bichromes. Their first action was to\nshield Gavin, second to shield themselves, and third—if possible—this.\nThey could see Gavin’s superviolet threads, and they drafted blue along\nthose shining paths as they pulled grenadoes from their bandoliers. They\nhurled the grenadoes, which followed the arcing superviolet tracks\nunerringly. One, two, three, four, five, six. They had even bolstered the arcs\nof luxin so they followed a natural throwing path.\nBut the ambushers were moving too. Three Blackguards went down in\nthe first wave of fire missiles. In defending Gavin first, they couldn’t fix\ntheir own shields in time. A gout of red luxin jetted in from four sides,\ntrying to drench the entire bridge so they could set it alight. Blue and green\nBlackguards threw up shields to divert the flows off the sides of the bridge\nwhile a yellow threw light-burst grenadoes at everyone she could see.\nGavin looked forward and saw that the ambushers weren’t blocking\nthe way across the bridge. There was only one reason for that. They wanted\nGavin and the Blackguard to flee headlong into something worse.\nProjectiles were sparking and whining off his shields, grenadoes’\nexplosions were rocking the rooftops, and huge blue knives like icicles\nwere being fired by two of the color wights behind them. The Blackguards\nwere compressed tight around Gavin, using their shields and, if that failed,\ntheir bodies to keep him safe.\n“Let’s move! Cross the bridge!” the commander said. She was young.\nOrholam, had they lost so many that this young woman was in charge?\nAll this was according to the Blackguard training, too. Protect, secure,\ndecide, act. No hesitation.\n“No!” Gavin shouted. He pointed off the side of the bridge and drafted\na new walkway in green from the middle span to a point thirty paces down.\n“Flash!” one of the Blackguards yelled. She was a yellow. She\nlaunched a flash bomb a mere ten paces into the air. Gavin and the\nBlackguards covered their faces as it exploded with so much force that\nGavin could feel it rock his shields.\nThen they ran across the new green bridge, even as the bridge behind\nthem, no longer protected from the red luxin streams, went up in flame.\nOne of the blue wights dropped into the street in front of them as they\nmade it back to land, determined to steer them back into the secondary\nambush. A dozen Blackguard hands went up and the beast was riddled with\nluxin bullets and cudgeled aside instantly.\nA Blackguard fell, though Gavin hadn’t seen what cut him down. “No!\nNo! No!” the man was yelling. His partner split away from them. The\nBlackguard who had fallen rolled over onto his back. His partner, a woman\nnear forty, Laya, Gavin thought her name was, stood over him.\n“I’m sorry,” the fallen Blackguard said. “Too much. Too much.”\nLaya pulled an eyelid up to get a good look at the fallen Blackguard’s"

She whispered something, kissed her fingers, touched them to the\nfallen man’s eyes, mouth, and heart. Then she cut his throat. The rest of the\nBlackguards didn’t wait.\nThey ran past an alley and found themselves looking at the backs of\ndozens of musketeers, all in formation, muskets up, pointed the other way\nwhere the ambush had originally tried to steer Gavin. The men were so\nintent on waiting for their quarry to appear in front of them that they didn’t\nsee Gavin behind them. As they ran past, Laya slopped red luxin over them.\nA lot of red. The whoosh of flame was so intense as she set it alight that\nGavin saw shadows half a block away—which meant the flames had leapt\nfor a moment above the rooftops. The screams followed. Men burning to\ndeath.\nOne more river crossing. This time, Gavin led the Blackguards to a\nblank section and drafted his own green span across. No need to risk\nanother ambush.\nThey made it to the docks and found hundreds of soldiers there,\nmuskets loaded, facing out. The boats were still being boarded, mountains\nof luggage pushed aside, left behind, now gathered for use as barriers.\nThere was a stream of boats already heading out, a line disappearing into\nthe distance, going through the Guardian’s legs as she stood guard. Every\nship in the entire harbor had been used. And most were already gone. Two\nhuge barges crafted of blue and green luxin and wood had been constructed\nand were already heading out too. That left one luxin barge that was rapidly\nfilling even now, with far too many men to fit in it.\nThe soldiers here were locals mostly—where the hell had all the\nRuthgari soldiers gone? Boarded earlier ships no doubt. Someone would\npay for that, but not now. The soldiers who remained looked resolute, and\ntheir countenances lifted as they saw Gavin. These were men who thought\nthey were going to die to give their families a chance to get away. Men who\nwere willing to pay that price.\n“Who’s in charge?” Gavin asked.\n“I am, sir. Lord Prism. Sir.” A mousy Ruthgari with oddly kinky hair\nfor his pale complexion and a look in his eyes like he was scared to death\nstepped forward. In another time, Gavin would have laughed to see the\nawkward little man. “We’ve got almost all the ships we have loaded. Men\ngathered who will fight. We need room for another three hundred, if no one\nelse comes from the city.”\n“Any sign of General Danavis or Commander Ironfist?” Gavin asked.\n“No, sir. Lord Prism. Sir.”\n“Sir is fine,” Gavin said. “Blackguards, any of you who can draft\nwithout breaking the halo, help me. We’ll make one more barge while we\nwait.”\n“Wait, sir?” a Blackguard asked.\n“General Danavis is coming. We finish one more barge. Then we go.\nHe’ll be here by then.”\nA trumpet sounded. The pale Ruthgari shouted, “Enemies coming!\nReady!”\n“Can you hold while we make a barge?” Gavin asked."

The pale Ruthgari shouted, “Enemies coming!\nReady!”\n“Can you hold while we make a barge?” Gavin asked.\nThe man was still small, still mousy, but his face was resolute, and\nanything comical about his appearance was gone. “We’ll hold, sir. To the\nlast man.”\nChapter 90\nKarris selected one of the Mirrormen’s horses that looked like it still had\nsome wind and spirit left. Its barding was mirrored, and it shone in the\nmorning sun. She might as well paint a target on her back. Well, she wasn’t\nexactly inconspicuous herself.\nThey didn’t have long. The four hundred paces between Lord\nOmnichrome’s color wights could only be crossed through a maze of alleys\nor rubble-strewn streets. It would slow them, but not much. Some things,\nthough, had to be done. Karris moved to check King Garadul’s body,\ngritting her teeth against the gore.\nHe was definitely dead. She felt a peculiar emptiness. She’d wanted\nhim dead. He deserved it. Now he was just gone. And, quite possibly, it\nhadn’t accomplished anything. She saw her bich’hwa on the ground next to\nhim. Sonuvabitch. She picked it up, and scanned the ground, but there was\nno sight of her ataghan.\nNo more time. Corvan Danavis’s men were finishing collecting\ngunpowder and shot or replacement weapons from the dead and forming\nback up. Kip looked as bad as Karris would have expected. Corvan said,\n“It’s called being lightsick, Kip, and it might do anything to you. Make you\nfeel weak as a puppy or strong as a sea demon. I’ve seen modest men tear\noff all their clothes because they couldn’t bear anything touching their skin.\nAnd shy women, well, never mind.”\n“Hey, that was just the one time,” Karris protested, mounting up.\nWhen you could, it was good not to let a drafter sink too deep into\nthemselves after drafting too much.\nCorvan laughed. “I don’t know that I’d call you ‘shy,’ on any day,\nKarris White Oak.” He glanced down at her leg. “Certainly not today.”\nKarris followed Corvan’s eyes. Oops. She’d managed to tear the slit in\nher dress practically to her hip, and sitting on a horse didn’t help. Well,\nwhat was she going to do? Go change?\n“Time’s up!” Corvan shouted to his men. “We head for the docks!\nCatch up or die.” One of his officers came to him with a question, and he\nwas swallowed up by his duties.\nWhich left Karris with Kip. She would prefer to be unencumbered\nduring a battle, but she wasn’t going to abandon him, not again. There were\nthings more important than her freedom. She sidled her horse over to the\nplatform. “Come here, Kip,” she said with a little more edge than she\nmeant.\nObviously dazed, Kip clambered up, and they were off.\nAt first, Karris thought they were going to get away cleanly.

The far end was blocked with wagons and carts that\nmust have just been set on fire moments before Corvan’s men arrived or\nthey would have seen the smoke.\nThe men at the front of the column skidded to a stop, and the men\nwho’d been running behind them collided with them, collapsing the column\nand causing chaos. Corvan, mounted near the front, was trying to extricate\nsome drafters from the crush to get them to work on clearing the flaming\nbarricades. It would only take a minute or two, in normal circumstances.\nNear to the back of the column, Karris pulled up sharply and started\nshouting at the men near her to form a rear guard. “Load muskets, affix\nmatches!” She wheeled around in time to see the first of the color wights\npursuing them.\nKarris had never seen anything like it. She’d known green wights\ncould change their joints to give their legs immense springiness, but the\ngreens weren’t the only color wights leaping from roof to roof behind them.\nA yellow wight, limbs all aglow, ran straight toward the edge of a flat\nroof, gathering luxin in both hands. She leapt off the edge, and threw her\nhands down, releasing a jet of yellow at the ground, using the recoil to\nthrow her up high enough to make it to the next roof. Like she was playing\nleapfrog in midair.\nA flash of green, much closer.\nKarris shot a ball of green up, intercepting the green wight as it\ndescended. Her shot blasted the green wight off its trajectory, lifting it so\nthat instead of landing among the terrified soldiers, it collided with the side\nof a building. The soldiers around it recovered before the wight did. Karris\nheard a rattle of musket fire.\nDamn! Veterans would have dispatched it with their blades, saving\nprecious shots for more active enemies.\nAnother green wight streaked through the air, and Karris missed it. It\ncrashed through the back ranks, scattering men. Others, terrified, leveled\ntheir muskets and fired, most of them missing the wight and hitting their\nown friends.\nBy the time they put that one down, wights of every color were\nconverging on them. Lord Omnichrome’s army was rounding a corner, not\nthree hundred paces away, jogging, picking up speed for a charge. Half a\ndozen of Omnichrome’s red and sub-red drafters were mounted. They\nclosed within two hundred paces and lobbed great flaming missiles toward\nCorvan’s massed, trapped men.\nA blue wight, all glittering angles and blades, was the next across the\nrooftops to the left. A sub-red was leaping across roofs on the right, bald,\nher whole body literally aflame.\nOut of nowhere, a big drafter dropped into the street straight in front of\nKarris, his back to Corvan’s men. He stood, arms spread out as if he were\nholding ropes and expecting a heavy load. His arms snapped out just as the\nblue wight and sub-red wight leapt to attack.\nBoth color wights jerked hard as the invisible superviolet luxin ropes\naround their necks went taut.

The blue wight’s body went abruptly\nhorizontal, all the luxin it had held going to jelly in an instant as it lost\nconcentration. It crashed to the ground in front of the rear guard.\nThe sub-red wight, without the benefit of blue armor around her neck,\nbarely changed directions. Her body landed on the next roof and fell, and\nher flaming head rolled right into the river.\nThe drafter who’d saved them shot a glance back, making sure the\ncolor wights were dead. It took Karris’s breath away. It was Usef Tep, the\nPurple Bear himself, the hero of the False Prism’s War. Even as Karris\nregistered the fact, she saw the flaming missiles that were arcing toward the\nrear guard suddenly veer left and right in the air, exploding at a safe\ndistance.\nAnother green wight she hadn’t even seen crashed into the ground,\nriddled with blue luxin knives. Karris saw Eleleph Corzin, skin luminous\nblue, step out of an alley.\n“We’ve got your backs. Go!” a woman yelled.\nKarris turned to see at least a dozen drafters stand on the last rooftop.\nIt was like Karris had stepped into a heroes gallery. The woman who’d\nyelled was Samila Sayeh. Deedee Falling Leaf stood next to her, skin\nwrapped in vines of pure green luxin. Flamehands stood on the corner of\nthe building, a steady stream of fireballs popping from each hand. Sisters\nTala and Tayri to the right. Talon Gim bleeding heavily, left arm useless, but\ngoing to stand beside Usef Tep in the street. And others that Karris\nrecognized from her youth, or who’d fought for Dazen and whom she’d\nheard described in vivid detail.\n“Damn you! You and that boy are the only ones who can save Gavin.\nTake him and get the hell out of here!” Samila Sayeh yelled, her eyes\nflashing.\nCorvan’s men surged as the barricades gave way. Karris felt Kip\nstirring behind her. Lord Omnichrome’s army was like an onrushing tide.\nKarris spurred her horse on, only shooting glances back at the magical\nconflagration behind her.\nIt was enough. All of Corvan’s men made it over the bridge. From\nthere, it was a straight adrenaline-fueled shot to the docks.\nKarris made it with the last group. Corvan, up at the front, was moving\ntoward Gavin down on the docks. Gavin was working, drafting barges, it\nlooked like. Someone alerted Gavin, and Karris saw a flash of his crooked\nsmile toward Corvan.\nAnd in that moment, Karris knew. It was like she’d been clubbed. Her\nthroat tightened. The pieces spun together. A thousand pieces from the past\nsixteen years, and the last few in the past few days: That grin. Patting\nCorvan’s shoulder on the wall this morning.

They had reasons to work together, right. But\nseamless command and instant obedience come only with time and trust.\nHow could these men trust each other?\nWho comes back from war a better man?\nGavin had said, “What’s in that note, it isn’t true. I swear it isn’t true.”\nWhy would Gavin double down on a lie that he knew was going to be\nexposed minutes later?\nBecause it wasn’t a lie.\nOh shit.\nChapter 91\nShaken from his torpor by Karris dismounting, Kip looked from one side to\nthe other, squinting, head pounding. One moment, he’d been holding on to\nthe woman, more concerned that as he clung to her his arms were touching\nher breasts and she was going to think he was groping her than worried\nabout the exploding guns and coruscating magic.\nHe was, by any rational account, a moron.\nAnd then, abruptly, they were at the docks. Kip couldn’t follow things\nwell. At first the men were challenging Corvan, and then welcoming him,\nand Corvan was giving orders and disappearing into the men, talking with\nthis person and that. Kip felt simultaneously dizzy and as strong as a bear.\nKarris cursed aloud, but he didn’t understand why. She pulled at his arms,\nstill clamped around her waist. He released her, and almost fell when she\nslipped out of the saddle.\n“I’ll be back for you in a little while.” Karris patted his arm. Suddenly,\nher face came into tight focus. Like he was looking through her, like he was\nunderstanding her. She looked… vulnerable.\nVulnerable? Karris White Oak? At another time, Kip would have\nlaughed at the thought. Now his focus was too great. Her eyes were tight.\nSome of that was concern for Kip, but that pat of his forearm was a “You’ll\nbe fine in a little while” pat. She wasn’t worried about Kip. She was\nnervous about something else.\nKarris turned and Kip saw her square her shoulders. Her shoulders\nlifted—she was taking a deep breath. Then she strode down the dock as if\nshe were as confident as always in between soldiers, drafters, sailors, and\nscared civilians. Despite the bustle and the nerves and the not-so-distant\nfighting, the crowd parted for this vision of war and beauty: knotted\nmuscles and femininity, the luxin sword on her back still smoking, soot on\nher naked shoulders and cleavage, a clawed bich’hwa in her fist, barefoot,\nblack hair windblown, her stride fearless.\nShe stopped behind a copper-haired drafter who was working on a\ngreat barge. Spoke. The man’s head whipped around like it was on a swivel.\nNot just any man. The Prism.\nGavin swept Karris into a huge hug immediately. Relief.\nKarris’s body was stiff, her arms still at her sides, either shocked or\nrepulsed, Kip couldn’t tell. Then, slowly, the stiffness in her arms and\nshoulders seemed to melt by degrees.

What did I say?\nBut Karris was storming off, not answering.\nGavin looked from her to Kip to the unfinished barge behind him.\nThrew his hands down. Kip could swear he heard the curse all the way from\nhere. He wanted to shrink into himself. It was like he’d just seen his parents\nfighting. All he wanted was to be gone.\nHe turned toward the city. His vision was still intensely focusing on\none thing at a time, losing the wholes for the parts. The lightsickness. He\nknew it was an army there in front of him, but he only saw this man\nchecking the fuse on his matchlock; this one with half of his mustache\nburned off fiddling with his musket’s ramrod, spinning it in its rest; this\nman with his plug bayonet out, using it as a back-scratcher and joking with\nhis comrades as if he were totally unafraid, while his tight, dead eyes told\notherwise; this man talking nonstop while no one paid him any attention.\nKip looked over empty slips at the dock. Not a single ship left. Even\nthe smallest dory was gone. Almost on the dock parallel to theirs, he saw a\nhuge swarthy man chased down and surrounded by a dozen Mirrormen.\nSomething defiant was written in the man’s stance, but the Mirrormen had\nmuskets on him from every angle.\nIronfist.\n“Have I gone mad or is that Commander Ironfist?” Kip asked.\n“Sir?” a man standing next to Kip’s horse asked.\n“Move!” Kip shouted. “Move!” With a few curses, the men parted for\nhim.\n“Kip! What are you doing?” Corvan Danavis shouted. From his angle,\nhe couldn’t see Ironfist.\nKip barely heard him. He dug his heels into the horse and held on for\ndear life. Breaking free of hundreds of nervous men, the horse ran. Kip was\ntossed around like a sack of pomegranates being crushed to juice and seeds.\nThe horse galloped along the edge of the docks, going in the right general\ndirection—but it wasn’t slowing down. Kip pulled hard on the reins, but the\nhorse had its bit in its teeth. And it wasn’t letting go.\nThe Mirrormen saw Kip coming and yelled. A few had time to\ndischarge shots. Kip swore a musket ball licked his ear with a hot tongue.\nI am the stupidest person I have ever met. As the horse streaked toward\nIronfist and his captors, still not slowing, Kip kicked his feet free of the\nstirrups and jumped out of the saddle, diving for the Mirrormen.\nWhatever he’d done before with all the green luxin that had cushioned\neverything—this time he didn’t do it.

It felt like fire traced through every joint in his\nhand. He smacked his head, skidded on his back, clothes tangling him up,\nand tried to stand.\nHe was facing the city. There was no one that direction. He turned\ntoward Commander Ironfist, got his feet tangled, fell. Caught himself with\nhis left hand. Tears sprang out of his eyes unbidden. Agony.\n“No!” Ironfist screamed.\nKip was tottering on one knee, dizzy, propped up only by his shrieking\nleft hand. He wanted to fall on his back, show these men he wasn’t a threat,\nbeg them not to hurt him.\nI spend more time on my back than a rent girl. Enough.\nOne of the men had his bayonet fixed. He was stepping toward Kip.\nKip pushed himself up—off his left hand. The fire of pain shot up his arm.\nKip just pointed his ruined left hand at the Mirrorman and made that\nfire shoot back down, propping himself up on his good hand. Flame roared\nout and engulfed the man. He baked, his mirror armor useless.\nStaggering to his feet, Kip threw more and more fire into the guards.\nAnd then he found out why Corvan had said he wouldn’t want to draft for a\nmonth when you were lightsick. His stomach boiled; he puked.\nHe couldn’t keep his feet. The dizziness and nausea dropped him like\nhe’d been cut off at the knees. His stomach cramped so hard he bent in half,\ncurling into a fetal position, still puking, splattering vomit on his own pants.\nOnce again, Kip the Charging White Knight manages to do nothing.\nHe was dead. He knew he had to be dead. The men had been charging\nat him and he’d killed at least one of them. They should have killed him by\nnow.\n“Let go of the rest of the luxin. It’ll make you sick again, but it’s\nbetter, I promise. Now, boy! I can’t carry you and draft at the same time!”\n“Ironfist?”\nKip cracked his eyes open, saw dead men scattered around and Ironfist\nstanding over him, his fists bearing spikes of bloodied blue luxin. Ironfist\nhad cuts and dried blood and powder burns everywhere. He wore blue\nspectacles close to his eyes, the earpieces tied tight around the back of his\nhead. His ghotra had been knocked off his head, and his hair was singed on\none side. How had the man gotten away after commandeering a cannon?\nSurely the whole of King Garadul’s army had fallen on him.\nNonetheless, here he was. Bruised, exhausted, injured, but not so hurt\nthat he couldn’t save Kip one more time.\n“Now!” Ironfist demanded. “I’m lightsick myself. I know what I’m\nasking!”\nKip let go of the rest of the luxin and threw up again, his insides\nheaving, all of his viscera trying to rush out of his mouth.\nBut then, miraculously, he did feel better.

The confined space was all\nthat kept Gavin’s men from being overwhelmed. The front lines were a\nmess of bayonets and swords, a few spears and hoes and scythes and long-\nhandled orange limb shears and magic being thrown and blocked each way.\nBehind the front lines, Gavin and some other drafters were just finishing the\nlast barge, unable to join the fighting because their drafting talents were\nneeded for shipbuilding.\nThe mass of invaders was pushing Gavin’s men steadily backward,\ntheir sheer weight unstoppable. To Kip, it looked like they were already too\nlate. And he was still sick, still dizzy, still feeling stronger than ever in his\nlife, torn between wanting to lie down and feeling like he needed to go\nrunning or he would burn up.\n“Follow me,” Ironfist said. “Stay as close as you can. It doesn’t float\nfor long.”\nWith no more explanation—float? what was floating?—Ironfist ran\nstraight off the side of the dock, one hand spraying blue luxin out in a wide\nstream.\nKip followed, charging down the slick surface, holding his pants tight\nin his left hand and praying he didn’t fall. The blue path dove off the end of\nthe dock steeply and then leveled out at the water, floating on top of the\nsurface like a very unsteady boat.\n“Keep running!” Ironfist said.\nIn front of them, the defense was crumbling just as the great luxin\nbarge pushed off the dock. The last remnants of the defenders were trying to\nfight and retreat at the same time. Some turned and were cut down as they\ntried to run to make the jump to the barge. Others abandoned the idea of\nmaking it to the ship themselves and stood their ground.\nLord Omichrome’s army, though, was so huge and had so much pent-\nup pressure that without a hundred soldiers pushing it back, it burst down\nthe dock, the men behind shoving the men in front of them so hard and so\nrelentlessly that both defenders and the front lines of Lord Omnichrome’s\nmen were pushed straight off the edge of the dock. Dozens, perhaps a\nhundred men and women splashed into the bay.\nWe’re not going to make it. There’s nowhere for us to go!\nBut Ironfist merely turned his blue path over the waves out.

More water jumped to each side of\nthem.\nThey’re shooting at us!\nLungs heaving, head swimming, in front of them Kip saw magic\nsetting the air alight between the barge and the dock. Gavin was standing at\nthe stern of the boat, throwing out great swathes of flame, darts, light\ngrenadoes—a veritable artillery barrage of chromaturgy. A space cleared\naround him on the barge as everyone else shrank back, stunned, awed,\nafraid of anyone who could handle so much magic. Gavin was fighting all\nthe drafters on the dock—by himself. And winning.\nThat’s my father. I can’t let him down. I’ve screwed up everything\nelse. I’m going to get to that damned boat.\n“I can’t keep this up,” Ironfist shouted, his voice strained. “I’ve got to\nmake it narrower, Kip, or we won’t make it!”\n“Do it!” Kip yelled.\nThe platform abruptly shrank to barely three hand’s breadths wide. It\nsank into the water even as Kip ran across it, his feet splashing water.\nBut they had only thirty paces to go. The path started arching up, out\nof the water to attach to the side of the barge, out of the way of all the\nmagic going back and forth.\nKip looked up at Gavin, and saw that someone had stepped into the\nempty circle behind the Prism. Though the boy wore peasant’s garb, Kip\nrecognized him instantly. Zymun! Zymun had snuck onto the barge with the\nrest of the refugees, and he was holding a box. Kip’s box. The last thing\nKip’s mother had ever given him. The only thing she’d ever given him.\nGavin was still hurling magic and deflecting magic. Everyone was\neither watching him or had crowded to the side of the barge and was\nwatching Ironfist and Kip come in. Ironfist was looking down at the path he\nwas drafting, intent on the magic. Kip was the only person who saw a\ngleaming knife come out of that box.\nKip’s next step missed the narrow luxin platform. He plunged hard\ninto the water. Clumsy Kip. Stupid Kip. His huge splash would make even\nmore of a distraction for Zymun to take advantage of.\nLord Omnichrome had sent Zymun to assassinate Gavin. Kip had seen\nit—and he’d decided to go somewhere else. He’d had a dozen chances to do\nthe right thing, and he’d missed them all. Even five minutes ago, if he\nhadn’t gone after Ironfist, he would have been on the barge. He could have\nstopped Zymun.\nKip wouldn’t fail again. He refused. He threw his hands down, opened\nhis eyes despite the water, and starting sucking in light. It hurt like hell. He\ndidn’t care. He sucked it in like he was the mouth of one of Gavin’s great\nskimmer engines. And threw it down."

And threw it down.\nHe shot out of the water. By Orholam’s own hand, or by all the luck\nthat had gone against him for his whole life now finally reversing course, he\nshot in the right direction. He flew onto the barge’s deck, blasting through\nhalf a dozen people gathered at the railing looking for him—and he kept his\nfeet, though he was at a crazy angle and had to run as fast as he could just to\nnot fall down.\nHe burst into the opening around Gavin just as Zymun closed on the\nPrism. Zymun sank the great white dagger into Gavin’s back an instant\nbefore Kip collided with him, the top of Kip’s head smashing Zymun’s\nnose. His momentum carried them both off the opposite side of the barge.\nThey landed with a great splash. Kip got a breath before they went\nunder and immediately began tearing at Zymun, punching him, ripping at\nthe dagger in his one hand and the sheath in the other. Zymun hadn’t taken a\nbreath. He let both go and flailed, trying to get away from Kip with panicky\nmotions. Kip tried to slash the other boy, still underwater, and missed.\nWith a gasp, Kip surfaced. Zymun surfaced five paces away, blood\nstreaming from his broken nose, staining the water.\nKip heard screams beyond Zymun. The sharks had come and were\nturning the water between Zymun and the docks to white froth in the frenzy.\n“Kip! Grab the rope! Grab the rope!” someone shouted. A coil hit the\nwater close to him.\nZymun gave Kip one hateful glance and started swimming for shore.\nHe was a good swimmer, too. Faster than Kip. It would be madness to go\nafter him. And he was bleeding.\n“Kip!”\nKip felt the first tremor of lightsickness hitting him. Oh shit.\nBut he’d lost his dagger before. It was everything. He wouldn’t lose it\nagain. Bobbing in the waves, trying to ignore at least another score of\ntriangular fins cutting the water headed for the dock, he sheathed the blade\nand tucked it inside his pants, and only then did he grab the rope.\nGood thing there was a loop on the end. Kip managed to pull it over\nhis head before he threw up the first time. There was nothing in his\nstomach, so he dry heaved as the barge towed him along for a way until the\nmen on deck could haul him out of the water.\n“Let go of the rest of the luxin, Kip,” someone was saying to him.\n“I can’t, I can’t.” He knew it was going to be bad. He couldn’t take any\nmore pain. He couldn’t even open his eyes.\n“Come on, Kip, do it for me,” Gavin said gently.\nKip let go of the last of the luxin. The last thing he was aware of was\npain shooting through his head, lances of light blotting out darkness, only to\nleave more behind.\nChapter 92"

The last thing he was aware of was\npain shooting through his head, lances of light blotting out darkness, only to\nleave more behind.\nChapter 92\nThe prisoner was full in the fever’s grip. The gash he’d cut across his chest\nand the foul hair he’d packed into the cut had done their work. Death or\nfreedom. It was time.\nHe tried to stand, but couldn’t. He was shaking too hard. Maybe he’d\nwaited too long. He’d wanted—needed—to wait until the fever was at its\nhottest in order to have any chance at all. If he’d miscalculated, he would\nsimply die, and end all of Dazen’s problems for him.\nThat would just be tragic.\nHe propped himself up, found his dirty little hair bowl close at hand,\ntried to inspect it for flaws for the thousandth time. He couldn’t tell. He felt\nlike weeping, the fever throwing his very emotions into disarray.\n“I’m sorry, Dazen. I failed you,” he said aloud. Meaningless words.\nFrom nowhere. The part of him that had marinated in blue for so many\nyears found that curious. Not unexpected, but still strange. Why should he\nfeel emotions simply because his blood was literally hotter than normal?\nStrange, but inconsequential.\nHe pulled the cut on his chest open, pulled out the chunky, dirty,\nblood-clotted wad of filth, and threw it aside. It didn’t all come out together.\nSome was stuck in the wound. With a grimy fingernail, he scratched out the\nremaining filth. It made him gag with pain.\nStupidity. He’d used his fingernail? When trying to clean a wound? He\nshould have drafted tweezers. He wasn’t thinking straight. He blinked, his\nbody tottering. No, there was no failure. Lesser men might fail. Not him.\nNot without trying his plan.\nGavin scooted over to the shallow bowl he’d scraped with his own\nhands over the course of sixteen years.\nWell, some men might have nothing to show for sixteen years of labor.\nHe laughed aloud.\nThe dead man in the wall looked concerned. Keep it together, Dazen.\nGavin. Whatever. Whoever you are, today you’re a prisoner, today you can\nbe a free man. Or a dead man, which is a freedom of its own, isn’t it?\nDazen took his finely woven hair bowl and laid it inside the stone bowl\nhe’d dug over the years. It fit perfectly, as well it might. He’d made it to fit,\nand checked it a thousand times as he crafted it. Sitting right in front of the\nbowl and its depression, Dazen untied his loincloth and shifted awkwardly\nuntil he could set it aside.\n“If only Karris could see us now, huh?” the dead man said. “How\ncould she choose him over this?”\nDazen barely glanced at the dead man, sitting in his shiny blue wall,\nmocking him, seated with legs spread grotesquely in front of a hair bowl\nand a shallow hole. “You can’t debase me,” Dazen told the dead man. “I do\nwhat I must.

He needed to be nearly dehydrated for this. His tongue felt\nthick.\nThe dead man said something in response, but Dazen ignored him. For\na moment, he forgot what was next. He needed to make water. He wanted to\nlie down. Orholam, he was tired. If only he could rest, he’d have the\nstrength…\nSlapping! That was what was next. A little more pain, and then\nfreedom, Dazen. A little more. You’re a Guile. You can’t be chained like\nthis. You’re the Prism. You’ve been wronged. The world needs to know\nyour vengeance.\nSeated still—there was no reason to move from here, he wouldn’t be\nable to make it back if he moved—he studied every surface of his body that\nwas visible.\nThen he started slapping himself. Everywhere that he would be able to\nsee. Hard.\n“This strikes you as rational?” the dead man asked. “Maybe sixteen\nyears in blue hasn’t been enough for you.”\nGavin—Dazen, damn it—ignored him. He slapped his forearms, his\nstomach, his chest everywhere except where the cut was—he didn’t want to\npass out this close to victory—and his legs. Every surface of his body that\nhe could see he slapped until it was insensitive, numb to the pain and, more\nimportant—red.\nGavin was only human. Though he was a superchromat, even he made\ntiny errors. That was Dazen’s bet. That was why Gavin hadn’t let anything\nwith color down here. If he’d made the blue light perfectly, all in only one\nincredibly tight spectrum, there would have been only blue light to reflect\nfrom any item. Gavin wouldn’t have had to worry even if his prisoner had\nred or green or yellow spectacles. But the tiny flash of green Dazen saw\nevery time he pissed into his bowl before it was leached of color told him\nthat there was some spectrum bleed.\nNow everything depended on how much and how fast he could draft.\nShivering, trembling hard from fever and from beating his skin nearly\nbloody, he pissed. Not straight into the depression. Not straight into the hair\nbowl. If he pissed too hard, he was worried he’d break right through the oil\nthat he’d so painstakingly smeared around the inside of the hair bowl. So he\npissed into his hand, and let the warm liquid flow gently into the hair bowl.\nYou’ve made me an animal, brother.\nBut if animal he was, Dazen was a fox. The dehydration had made his\nurine as shockingly yellow as his body could produce, and the woven, oiled\nhair bowl held. Dazen’s heart leapt—he wanted to weep—as he saw yellow\nfor the first time in sixteen years. Yellow! There was spectrum bleed! By\nOrholam, it was beautiful.\nHe drafted off of it. Just a tiny amount, it was like trying to suck water\nthrough a bag, even as the bowl slowly drained. He drafted a yellow ball,\nnot even as big as his thumb, into the palm of his left hand."

For the\nfirst time, Dazen saw his cell in something other than blue light. He saw his\nbody in something other than blue light. And yellow, being in the middle of\nthe spectrum rather than at the opposite end, made red a hell of a lot easier\nto see. And it had spectrum bleed both up and down.\nAnd Dazen’s whole body was red from him slapping it.\nDazen drafted red hard, as hard as he could, even as the little yellow\nmarble sputtered out and disappeared. It was enough. It had to be enough.\nThe skin down to his right arm looked dull in the blue light that once again\ndominated the cell, but he knew it was red.\nAnd now the whole reason he’d given himself a fever.\nDazen drafted heat from his own body. It was incredibly inefficient. It\nhad never worked before. He was shaking, the fever was so bad he couldn’t\nthink. Surely… surely…\nHe drew on his body’s heat, tried to imagine it rising in waves as from\na desert. A tiny flame, a spark was all he needed. He had as much as he\ncould get. Like an old man, Dazen propped himself up. Magic had weight,\nand with as much as he was planning to throw, he needed to not fall over as\nsoon as he started. He got up to his knees and grinned at the dead man.\nThe dead man grinned back, like he’d been expecting this. Like he’d\nbeen waiting for it for years.\nDazen brought his hands together. He threw a tiny starter stream of red\nout of his right hand, directly at the dead man’s face. His left hand let all the\nheat he’d gathered go at once—\nAnd made a tiny spark.\nThe spark caught. The red blazed, and suddenly the blue cell was\nflooded with red light and heat. Dazen drafted more and more and released\nit in a hammer blow, straight at the dead man, straight at the weak spot in\nthe cell wall.\nThe concussion bowled him over despite his attempt to brace himself.\nHe’d thrown his fireball with so much will there’d been no way he could\ntake the force in his weakened body.\nHe didn’t think he lost consciousness, but when he opened his eyes,\nthe world was still blue. Failure. Dear Orholam, no.\nDazen rolled over, expecting to see the dead man leering at him. But\nthe dead man was gone. A hole stood in his place. Jagged, broken in the\nwall, the edges smoldering, glowing with sludgy low-burning red luxin. A\nhole, and a tunnel beyond.\nHe couldn’t stop himself. Dazen started weeping. Freedom. He\ncouldn’t stand, he was too weak, but he knew he had to get out. He had to\ngo as far as he could from here before Gavin discovered he was gone. So he\nstarted crawling.\nAs he crossed out of the blue luxin cell, he held his breath, sure there\nwould be some trap, or some alarm. Nothing. He breathed deep, fresh, clean\nair filling his lungs with strength, and began crawling to freedom.\nChapter 93"

He breathed deep, fresh, clean\nair filling his lungs with strength, and began crawling to freedom.\nChapter 93\nKip woke in a little blue room. Every surface was blue luxin, even the pallet\nwhere he was sleeping, though it had been softened with a heap of blankets.\nFrom the faint rocking motion, he realized he was on one of the blue barges.\nAnd his back hurt like hell. In fact, most of his body hurt. His left hand\nwas bandaged heavily and he could feel that a thick poultice had been\nspread all over it. His shoulders and both arms were bruised everywhere, he\nfelt like someone had beaten both of his legs with a board, his head was\nthrobbing, and he was sore pretty much any other place on his body he\ncould think of. He wiggled a pinky toe. Yep, that was sore too.\nAnd he was hungry. Unbelievable.\nYou’re on a refugee ship, Kip. There ain’t gonna be any food.\nHe tried to go back to sleep. That was the best thing for it. He’d feel\nbetter when he woke up. And they might catch some fish or something by\nthen. He rolled over, and his lower back still hurt. What the—He shifted,\nand realized he was lying on something.\nReaching down to his waistband, his fingers brushed something. His\neyes shot open. The knife. His inheritance. If it didn’t hurt so bad, he would\nhave laughed about it. Clearly, he’d been carried in here wrapped in\nblankets, and left. No one had even noticed. In an armada of ships with\nthousands of refugees and soldiers and maybe a hundred boats, with pirates\nand everything else to worry about, apparently Kip hadn’t been the first\nthing on Gavin’s mind. Well, what did I expect? They couldn’t strip me and\nget me dry clothes—there are no dry clothes.\nKip rolled off the knife and sat up. He groaned. He really was sore.\nAnd hungry. But that didn’t matter now.\nA figure passed the door, and Kip hid the knife by his leg hurriedly.\nGavin poked his head in. “You’re awake!” he said. “How do you\nfeel?”\n“Like an elephant sat on me,” Kip said.\nGavin grinned and came and sat on the edge of Kip’s pallet. “I heard\nyou were trying to be Ironfist for a while out there. He’s pretty steamed.\nHe’s supposed to be the one who saves my life, you know.”\n“He’s mad?” Kip asked, worried.\nGavin sobered. “No, Kip. No one’s mad at you. He won’t admit it, but\nhe’s proud of you.”\n“He is?”\n“And I am, too.”\n“I thought I was too late.” Gavin was proud of him? His mind couldn’t\nreally register the thought. His mother had always been ashamed of him,\nand the Prism himself was proud? Kip blinked quickly, looked away.\n“You’re really fine?” Kip asked.\nGavin smiled. “Never felt better,” he said. “Oh, did you… did you\nknow that boy? The assassin?”\nKip felt a lump in his throat. “He was one of the drafters who wiped"

Did he get\neaten?” Kip remembered the boy bleeding profusely, swimming toward all\nthose sharks.\n“I don’t know,” Gavin said. “My rule is, if you don’t see an enemy\ndead with your own eyes, assume they’re still alive.” He grinned, almost\ngrimly, at a private thought. “But,” he said, shaking himself out of it, “I\nguess that explains this.” He pulled out the rosewood box that had held\nKip’s dagger.\nGavin handed it to Kip. “It’s empty,” he said. “But I thought it looked\nlike that box your mother tried to give you. Either your Zymun stole it from\nKing Garadul, or this is a common style. Looks like it held a knife, but I\nguess that went into the waves. I’m sorry.”\nKip wanted to rush to confess, but the knife was his. Gavin might take\nit away from him. Kip hadn’t even gotten to see it yet, not really.\n“Anyway,” Gavin said, “you rest up.

It was like light bursting over hills to illuminate places in\nhis soul that had never seen it.\nThe lump in his throat grew huge, his eyes filled with tears. Gavin\nturned to go. “Wait! Father, wait!”\nKip froze, as did Gavin, outlined in the door. The last time Kip had\nused the word he was being a snot, and things hadn’t gone well.\nAnd then it got worse, as Kip suddenly realized Gavin had meant\n“son” like “young man.” Kip wished he could go jump back into the water\nfor the sharks. “I’m so sorry,” he said, “I didn’t—”\n“No!” Gavin cut him off with a hand. “Whatever else you did, you\nproved yourself a Guile today, Kip.”\nKip licked his lips. “Did Karris… I saw her hit you.

He paused, as if he was tasting\nthe word. “We’re done with that ‘nephew’ nonsense. The world will know\nyou’re my son.

The blade was a dazzling strange white metal with a\nspiraling core of black threaded from point to hilt. There was little\nornamentation except for seven clear, perfect diamonds on the hilt. Well, six\ndiamonds and maybe a sapphire. Kip didn’t really know his jewels, but six\nstones were clear as glass but brilliantly refractive. The seventh matched the\nothers in size and clarity, but it glowed a brilliant, magical blue. Kip\nsheathed the dagger.\nHow did my mother get such a thing? How did she not pawn it for\nhaze?\nKip opened the rosewood box to put the dagger away, and with his\nbandaged left hand he fumbled it, dropping it upside down in his lap. He\nturned it over and saw that the silk lining was loose, not attached to the box\nitself but to a frame that filled the box. He pulled on the frame, lifting it out.\nUnderneath was a thin compartment that held extra laces that matched the\ncolor of the sheath to tie it to different sizes of belt. It wasn’t a secret\ncompartment, but obviously Zymun hadn’t noticed it, nor had King\nGaradul, because there was a note there.\nWith trepidation, glancing at the door to make sure no one was\npassing, Kip read the note, written in his mother’s hard, deliberate strokes:\n“Kip, go to the Chromeria and kill the man who raped me and took away\neverything I had. Don’t listen to his lies. Swear you won’t fail me. If you\never loved me, if you’ve ever wanted to do anything good in this world, use\nthis dagger to kill your father. Kill Gavin Guile.”\nKip felt locked up, paralyzed. Someone was lying to him, betraying\nhim. Kip felt those deep, sucking pools of rage stirring. It had to be his\nmother. Addict. Whore. Liar. Kip’s mother would lie for haze: she would\nabandon Kip in a closet. Gavin had been hard on him, but he’d never lied to\nhim. He never would. Never. He was Kip’s family. The first Kip had ever\nhad.\nBut his mother had kept the dagger, and even the box. She could have\nsold either for a mountain of haze. She would have thought of them every\ntime the madness of craving had been on her. If this was more important to\nher than haze, why would she lie?\nKip shivered, feeling like he was being ripped out of his moorings. He\ndidn’t know the truth. But he would. He swore it.\nHe folded the note and saw a quick scribble on the back he’d missed\nbefore, written looser and faster than the rest, but undeniably in his\nmother’s hand: “I love you, Kip. I always have.” She’d never said those\nwords. Not once. Not in his whole life.\nHe threw the note away like it was a serpent. Pushed his face into the\nblankets so no one could hear.

He’d\nsucked up as much red luxin as he could before he’d left the blue cell, and if\nhe hadn’t been fevered, he would have kept a flame alive, but his thoughts\nwere still sluggish, stupid. All he could do was hold on to his anger, and the\nred had helped him do that at first.\nI will have my vengeance, he thought, but it was passionless. There\nwas only the pain in his hands and knees and the crawling. He refused to\nstop. This tunnel had curved and curved again, but it couldn’t go on forever.\nSoon, he would sleep, and either die or wake stronger. Strong enough to\ngather his strength and bring down Gavin. He laughed weakly and kept\ncrawling.\nDamn this sharp rock. What had his brother done? Carved his prison\nout of pure hellstone?\nSon of a bitch, that was exactly what Gavin had done. Spent a fortune\nsimply to cut Dazen up. The hateful bastard. But Dazen wasn’t so easy to\nstop. He kept crawling. Freedom would not be denied him so easily.\nStill, obsidian was so rare that lining an entire tunnel with the stuff\nwould have cost more than the Guile family made in a year. Why would\nGavin have done such a thing? The magic properties of the stuff meant that\nwith pure darkness and a direct connection—such as through blood or an\nopen cut—it could drain the luxin out of a drafter. No wonder the red luxin\nwasn’t helping Dazen feel hatred anymore. It had all been drained away.\nSomething niggled at Dazen’s mind. The bends in the tunnel, maybe\nthat was it. The tunnels had bent so that no blue light would spill from the\nblue cell into the tunnel. Thus the tunnel would be totally dark. So the\nobsidian would work.\nDamn Gavin to the evernight. He’s not stopping me. I don’t care if I’m\na bloody wreck. I’m getting out of here.\nPart of Dazen was telling him to stop, to think. That blue, rational part\nof him. But he couldn’t stop. If he didn’t keep moving, he’d never get\nanywhere. He was so sick, so fevered that if he stopped he might never\nmove again. Gavin wanted to paralyze him.\nNo. No no no. Dazen pushed on. The floor here felt different. Not\nobsidian. He’d gotten past it. He crawled farther. He could swear there was\na glow ahead of him. Dear Orholam, there was—\nThe floor dropped out from under him, swinging open on hidden\nhinges. Dazen tumbled down, rolling over and over, unable to stop himself,\ndown a chute that snapped shut behind him. He rolled over, bathed in green\nlight.\nGreen?\nAn entire, round chamber, with green walls like trees. A hole up top for\nwater and food and air, and a hole in the bottom for waste. Dazen looked\ndesperately at his skin for the red luxin. It was gone. All gone, all sucked up\nby the obsidian tunnel.\nDazen started laughing stupidly, desperately, madly. A green prison,"

One for every color, and in sixteen years, he had only\nescaped the first.\nHe laughed and sobbed. In one luminous green wall, the dead man\nlaughed with him. At him.\nChapter 95\n“Not bad for a defeat,” said Corvan Danavis, coming into Gavin’s cabin.\nGavin sat up, blinking the sleep from his eyes. His “quick nap” after\ntalking to Kip had left him wooly. But he’d drafted so much over the past\nweek, it was no wonder he felt off. He said, “We lost a city, three-quarters\nof the Blackguard, and hundreds if not thousands of soldiers. My natural\nson—whom I just acknowledged—publicly murdered a rightful satrap,\nwhich will make the other satraps worry I’m trying to rule the world again.\nWe have thousands of refugees that we have to put Orholam knows where;\nthere’s some pagan army in charge of Garriston; and I’ve built them a damn\nnear unassailable wall, which will now protect my enemies. Oh, and your\ndaughter has joined our foes. If that’s not bad for a defeat, I’m not really\nsure what is.”\n“Could be worse,” Corvan said.\nGavin rubbed his cheek where Karris had slapped him. It was worse,\nCorvan, he wanted to say. He’d been so delighted to see Karris alive that\nhe’d hugged her without thinking. He’d deserved the slap for that alone.\nBut she’d clung to him, for half a moment. Maybe she just felt relieved to\nbe safe, away from King Garadul’s army, but he’d hoped it was something\nmore.\nThen she’d whispered, “I know your big secret, you asshole. Why\ncouldn’t you be man enough to tell me yourself?”\nBig secret? His heart froze up in his chest. Which big secret?\nShe released him and stared into his eyes. Unable to take it, he’d\nglanced away—and saw Kip. Kip, whom he’d thought was most likely\ndead. Like a moron, he said, “Kip?”\nHe hadn’t meant Kip was his big secret. That would be stupid. Of\ncourse she knew about Kip. But his brain wasn’t working. Her closeness,\nthe battle, the effects of his drafting so much, and the sudden sense of\nexposure throttled his thoughts.\nShe’d slapped him. He’d deserved it.\nGavin said to Corvan, “It can always be worse. Is the weather\nholding?” He sat up. If he had to make these barges weather a storm, he was\ngoing to have a lot of work to do.\n“Hold up,” Corvan said. “Your attitude when you go out there\nmatters.”\nGavin stopped. Corvan had talked to him like this before, but not since\nthe war. “What are you talking about?”\n“I mean this Lord Omnichrome doesn’t care about Garriston. The only"

The only\nthing Garriston was to him was a chance to take a victory from us, and\nframe you for murdering a satrap so he could mobilize people to fight you.\nWhat he wants is to destroy the Chromeria. He wants to drive out the belief\nin Orholam and set up a new order. And we don’t even know what that new\norder is yet.”\n“So let’s rephrase ‘defeat’ as ‘crushing defeat,’ huh?” Gavin knew he\nwas being childish, but Corvan was the only person around whom he could\ncomplain. It felt good to have his friend back.\n“We have to get ready for war,” Corvan said. “A bigger war than over\none little city.”\n“You think people are going to join him?”\n“In droves,” Corvan said. “My daughter did, and she’s not stupid. So\nwe have to believe he’s charismatic, and we’ve already seen that he’s smart\nenough to defeat us and get all he wants. So we have to look at what we\nhave, and prepare.”\n“I’m sorry she joined him, Corvan. She seemed like such a sensible\ngirl. I should have watched out for her better while she was—”\n“She is a sensible girl. I’m not worried about her. She’ll come back,”\nCorvan said. There was an edge on his voice, as well there should be. He\nwas trying to convince himself too. But Gavin knew not to push it.\n“So what do we have?” Gavin asked.\n“We have you and me. We got Karris back and Kip back and Ironfist\nback, when we could have easily lost all three. We have the devotion,\nloyalty, awe, and motivation of thirty thousand people who now believe in\nGavin Guile to the core of their souls. I call that the start of an army. You’re\nthe Prism. How is some pagan king going to stand up to you?”\nGavin laughed, because both of them knew that there were about a\nthousand ways. It was also a little scary, how Corvan thought. How he saw\nthrough things. Gavin would have to be careful. There are things you can’t\ntell even your best friend. Great purposes best achieved by misdirection.\nPensive, Gavin said, “You know, I came up with a list of things I want\nto accomplish before I die, and the best thing on that list was to free\nGarriston. What I let happen there after the war was… I don’t know if it’s\nthe worst thing I’ve done, that’s a crowded field, but I let what was\nhappening in Garriston keep happening. For sixteen years. With all my\npower, I could never get the Spectrum to stop it.”\n“I knew a man once who had a knack of changing the rules when he\ncouldn’t win. He didn’t give up when others said he’d already lost,” Corvan\nsaid. “So… Garriston is a collection of ramshackle buildings with\nindefensible walls.”\n“So I built new walls, I changed the rules. I tried, Corvan! I lost!”\nGavin grimaced, light dawning. “Oh, and you’re going to say next, ‘You"

I lost!”\nGavin grimaced, light dawning. “Oh, and you’re going to say next, ‘You\nlost a collection of ramshackle buildings.’ And I’m going to say, ‘Yes!\nWe’ve established that.’ And you’re going to point out that when I decided\nto free Garriston, I probably wasn’t worried about the misery of the\nbuildings, but the misery of the people.”\n“And then I’ll point out that all those people you wanted to free are\nhere. And then you’ll admit my superior wisdom.”\nGavin laughed. In some moments, it was like a day hadn’t passed since\nthey’d been separated. “Well, we know one of those things isn’t going to\nhappen.”\nCorvan grinned. He was right, though. “So,” he said, “go out there and\nsmile, and pat your soldiers on the back, and act like an emperor with a\ngreat purpose before him—a promachos who will accomplish that great\npurpose. You have freed these people. You are going to protect them, and\nyou will give them a new home. You will give them justice. And they’re\ngoing to help you.”\n“Sometimes I think you should have been the leader, not me,” Gavin\nsaid.\n“Me too,” Corvan said. He grinned. “Orholam’s ways are mysterious.\nIn some cases, very mysterious.”\n“Thanks,” Gavin said. Then they laughed together. It felt good. Food\nfor a hungry soul.\n“By the by, how’s your back? I could’ve sworn that little weasel\nstabbed you. Kip’s being hailed as a hero for stopping him, you know.”\n“He got him right in the nick of time, I guess,” Gavin said, though he\nmust have taken a shot in the kidney from the boy’s fist as Kip had tackled\nhim, because he had felt a searing pain. He pulled his shirt around and\nshowed it to Corvan. The shirt was cut over his kidney, but his skin was\nunbroken. “A near thing,” he said.\nCorvan whistled. “Orholam’s hand must be on you, my friend.”\nGavin grunted. From how his head felt, he wished Orholam’s hand\nwere a little gentler. “Well, time to go play emperor, then,” he said.\nTogether, they walked to the door of the cabin—and who had drafted cabins\nonto the barge?\nGavin paused. “Corvan, something was bothering me.”\n“Yes?”\n“All those years you spent in that little town. Seems like an awful\ncoincidence that both you and Kip were in the same place.”\n“Not a coincidence,” Corvan said soberly.\n“You tracked him down. You were looking out for him. Watching\nhim.” Gavin didn’t need Corvan to confirm it. He knew. “But you never got\nvery close to him.”\n“Tried not to, anyway. He’s a good boy. But he is who he is,” Corvan\nsaid. He meant, He is your brother’s son. Corvan looked down at his hands\nand lowered his voice, so that even if someone had been eavesdropping just\noutside the room, they couldn’t have made out the words. “I knew you"

I didn’t want to make it harder than it\nhad to be.”\nNeither said anything for a long moment.\nThe Danavis motto was Fealty to One. Corvan didn’t believe in\nOrholam, or the Chromeria, or any creed. He believed in Gavin. Sometimes\nit was frightening to have someone believe in you like that. For a second,\nGavin considered telling Corvan his seventh and final purpose. Trusting\nhim. But no. Safer this way. He’d tell him when the time came.\n“Some world,” Corvan said finally.\n“Some day,” Gavin said, looking out on the gray skies. Blah.\nCorvan grunted. “At least it’s nice out,” he said, and went on his way.\nSometimes Corvan’s sarcasm was so deadpan.\nGavin shrugged and went around patting shoulders, checking on the\nwounded, asking about supplies and their course, mostly being seen and\nbeing seen to care and to be in charge. Karris watched him the whole time,\nbut never said a word to him. There was another problem he’d have to\naddress.\nHe checked in on Kip. The boy was curled up, asleep. As well he\nmight be. Gavin was still sorting out the tales. According to the stories, Kip\nhad drafted green, blue, red, and maybe yellow. At fifteen years of age.\nGavin had hoped to buy them both some time by falsifying the testing\nstone; Kip’s road was going to be hard enough as it was. Too late now.\nSmart, brave, and now a polychrome, the boy had more than proven himself\na Guile—Gavin would have to work twice as hard to keep the truth from\nhim.\nThere was a lot of work to do.\nNot least of which was facing his father and telling him his wife was\ndead, that his bastard grandson had killed a satrap, and trying to fend off a\nconversation about marrying some satrap’s daughter in order to patch things\nup—a conversation Gavin was going to lose.\nHe went to the side of the barge to draft a scull to head over to the\nother barge. He looked around for something blue to draft from. There was\nnothing. He looked up. There were no clouds. He was on a barge on the sea\nunder a bright sky. But something was wrong.\nHe tried to draft blue. He was a Prism; he could split white light into\nanything.\nBut nothing happened.\nA bolt of panic flashed through Gavin. He counted off his colors on his\nfingertips, thumb to forefinger first, down then up. Sub-red, red, orange,\nyellow, green, bl—Nothing. He stared at his offending middle finger as if\nthis were its fault. There was no blue. He couldn’t draft it. He couldn’t even\nsee it. It was starting. Not on the seventh year. Now. He’d never even\nknown how a Prism knew when the end began. Now he knew. He was\nlosing his colors. He didn’t have five years left; it was starting now.

Gavin\nwas dying.\nAcknowledgments\nTwo years ago, I sent my Night Angel trilogy into the world with the typical\ntriumph and terror. I’ve burned to be a novelist since I was thirteen. This\nwas my shot, my chance to run the gauntlet of the masses. A hundred things\ncan bury a debut, and just to push off the necessity of getting a real job, I\nneeded my debut to do better than most. But dreams burn to the ground\nevery day. Tragedies happen.\nBut so do miracles.\nSo my first thank-you is to you readers who gave an unknown guy\nwith some ninja novel a chance. And thank you especially to you readers\nwho then handed my book to a friend and said, “Try this. No, really, try it.”\nAnd a double especially with whip and a chocolate-covered espresso bean\nto those of you who work at bookstores who did that, from Albuquerque to\nPerth. You all have changed my life. It is a huge privilege to get to write for\na living, so thank you.\nKristi, you are grace and tenacity. I wouldn’t be living the dream\nwithout you, and I wouldn’t want to. Thanks for having that crazy\nimpractical streak where it comes to me, an inch wide and a mile deep.\nDon, thank you for not just wrangling deals, but also knowing when to\nsay no to them. Thank you for steering me to work with people who will be\npassionate about my books. Cameron, thanks for foisting my books on the\nunwary all over the world.\nDevi, thank you for using the fierce Eye of Sauron—no, not on me!—\nbut secretly on my behalf. And to you and Tim, Alex, Jack, and Jennifer, I\npromised you this book would be my shortest, and it turned into my longest,\ncausing headaches for everyone. Rather than beating me to get the next\nproduct in the supply chain, you’ve allowed me a huge amount of\nautonomy. I appreciate your faith in me and all you do to make me\nsuccessful. You guys are fearless and brilliant, and it’s great to work with\nyou.\nThanks to all the other folks at Hachette, from the nameless unpaid\ninterns (hang in there!), to the guy who keeps the computers running, to\nGina (I really owe you several nice dinners, don’t I?), to the patient\nproduction people who have good reason to hate me. But I pass all hatred\nalong to my editor, Devi. (She also likes unsolicited manuscripts! Here’s\nher home phone number and personal email @\n.)\nHeather and Andrew, thank you for all your work in managing the\nforum. You’ve allowed me to connect with my fans—and still have time to\nwrite. Thank you thank you thank you.\nI’m afraid I’ve rewarded the friends and family who tolerated many\nemail updates over the years (how many words can you use to say “still no\nbook sale”?) by being so busy in the last two years that I hardly ever update\nthem at all. If you were in the first acknowledgments, thank you again.\nCody L., your enthusiasm is better than coffee. Shaun and Diane M.,\nthank you for your wise counsel and friendship. Scot and Kariann B.,"
