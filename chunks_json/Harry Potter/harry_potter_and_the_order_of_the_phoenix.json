Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and\nlawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use\nof hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual\ncar-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet\nDrive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows\nthrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The\nonly person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his\nback in a flower bed outside number four.\nHe was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the\npinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a\nshort space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy\nand faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the up-\npers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,\nwho were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be pun-\nishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea\nbush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only\n1\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nway he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia\nstuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight\ndown into the flower bed below.\nOn the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his"

        "text": "stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight\ndown into the flower bed below.\nOn the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his\nidea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on\nthe hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at\nhim, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or\nshooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had\ntried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his\naunt and uncle.\nAlmost as though this thought had fluttered through the open win-\ndow, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the\nboy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”\n“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the\nhouse.”\nUncle Vernon grunted.\n“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what\nhe’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dud-\nley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime\nMinister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on\nour news —”\n“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”\n“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”\nThe Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N\nBran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving\nold lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was\nfrowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was\nconcealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking\nhim around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had\nrounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s\nvoice floated out of the window again.\n2\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\n“Dudders out for tea?”\n“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many lit-\ntle friends, he’s so popular . . .”\nHarry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were as-\ntonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his\ndim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang\nevery night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that\nDudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every\nevening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and\nthrowing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at\nit during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent\nmost of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers\nfrom bins along the way.\nThe opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock\nnews reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps\ntonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night —\n“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the\nSpanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”\n“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the"

If anything had happened,\nit would surely have been the first item on the news; death and de-\nstruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . .\nHe let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.\nEvery day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expecta-\ntion, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and\nalways, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why noth-\ning had happened yet. . . .\nHe kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not rec-\nognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained\ndisappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the\n3\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nbaggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the\nSoutheast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,\n“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter\nthat had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s di-\nvorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid\naffairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively\nin every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).\nHarry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the\nnewsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel\nway of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feath-\ners in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find\nout more. . . .”\nHarry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing\nbudgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cau-\ntiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows,\npreparing to crawl out from under the window.\nHe had moved about two inches when several things happened in\nvery quick succession.\nA loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat\nstreaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a\nbellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Durs-\nleys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this\nsignal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waist-\nband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a\nsword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of\nhis head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant\ncrash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.\nHarry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he\nswayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,\nbut he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple\nhands reached through the open window and closed tightly around\nhis throat.\n4"

Then, as\nthe pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Un-\ncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an\nelectric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through\nhis nephew, making him impossible to hold.\nPanting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened\nup, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud\ncracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various\nnearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans\nand tried to look innocent.\n“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number\nSeven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear\nthat car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”\nHe continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious\nneighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin\nbecame a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\nHarry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the\npoint at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their\nstrangling.\n“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a\ncroaky voice that trembled with fury.\n“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left\nand right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made\nthe cracking noise.\n“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”\n“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.\nAunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Ver-\nnon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid.\n5\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\n“Why were you lurking under our window?”\n“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our\nwindow, boy?”\n“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.\nHis aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\n“Listening to the news! Again?”\n“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.\n“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re re-\nally up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news\ntosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .”\n“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon low-\nered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot\ndon’t get on our news!”\n“That’s all you know,” said Harry.\nThe Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia"

What are all those —” she too lowered\nher voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls —\ndoing if they’re not bringing you news?”\n“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that\none, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pesti-\nlential birds!”\nHarry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the\ntruth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly\nknow how bad Harry felt at admitting it.\n“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.\n“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.\n“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\n“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.\n“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.\n“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before\nthe Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the\n6\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nfront lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up\nthe street.\nHe was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his\naunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not\ncare very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing mat-\nters on his mind.\nHarry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone\nApparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the\nhouse-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that\nDobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right\nat this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and\nstared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely de-\nserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to\nbecome invisible. . . .\nHe walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had\npounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his fa-\nvorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his\nshoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt\nPetunias dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to\nhim, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?\nAnd then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked\naway.\nPerhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so\ndesperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he\nbelonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.\nCould he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking in-\nside a neighbor’s house?\nHarry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he\nknew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer\nrolled over him once again. . . .\nTomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five\n7"

Harry\nmerely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days;\nwhen the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was\nback it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry\ncared about.\nIf he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his\nbest friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had\nthat their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.\n“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been\ntold not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .”\n“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair\namount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .”\nBut when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too both-\nered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be see-\ning you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As\nfar as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione\nand Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.\nHe could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the\nBurrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at\nthem that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes\nchocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating\nthe wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.\nAnd what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he,\nHarry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much\nmore than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it\nbeen he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being\nmurdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?\nDon’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth\ntime that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the grave-\nyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments\ntoo.\n8\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nHe turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he\npassed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had\nfirst clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to under-\nstand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty\nof proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained\nwords of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:\n“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose clean\nand everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do anything\nrash. . . .”\nWell, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into\nMagnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had"

        "text": "rash. . . .”\nWell, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into\nMagnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had\n(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temp-\ntation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow\nby himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good\nconsidering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet\nDrive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hear-\ning something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.\nNevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man\nwho had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,\nattempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the\nfirst place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . .\nHarry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the\nparched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets.\nWhen he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley\nand his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around\nthe chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to\nhide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to\nthink of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he\nhad nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night,\nbecause even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unset-\ntling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and\nlocked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the\n9\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\ntrapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his\nforehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that\nRon or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any-\nmore. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was\ngetting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would\nprobably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be ex-\npected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .\nThe injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell\nwith fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known\nVoldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whing-\ning for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world,\nreduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear\nabout water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgot-\nten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without\ninviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure\nSirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the tempta-\ntion to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Volde-\nmort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s\nhead, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell\naround him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only\nsound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park\nrailings.\nHe did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the"

The street-\nlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong\nenough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the\npark. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were\nlaughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing\nbikes that they were wheeling along.\nHarry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmis-\ntakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accom-\npanied by his faithful gang.\n10\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nDudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discov-\nery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As\nUncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had\nrecently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Cham-\npion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it,\nhad made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry\nin the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first\npunching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore\nbut he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and\nmore accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all\naround were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of\n“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooli-\ngan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal\nBoys.\nHarry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered\nwhom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found\nhimself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m\nsitting here all alone. . . . Come and have ago. . . .\nIf Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to\nmake a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He\nwouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of\nprovoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s\ndilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond\n. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he\nhad his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frus-\ntration on the boys who had once made his life hell —\nBut they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were al-\nmost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.\n. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use\nmagic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . .\nDudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along\nMagnolia Road.\n11\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nThere you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully.

Uncle Vernon had\nthreatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley\nagain, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park\ngate.\nMagnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses\nwith perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners\nwho drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred\nLittle Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches\nof jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing\ndisapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he\npassed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along\nMagnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying\ntheir farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped\ninto the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.\n“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws\nfrom the others.\n“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.\n“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.\n“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.\n“See you then,” said Dudley.\n“Bye Dud!”\n“See ya, Big D!”\nHarry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off\nagain. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the\ncorner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon\ncame within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his\nease, humming tunelessly.\n“Hey, Big D!”\n12\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nDudley turned.\n“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”\n“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.\n“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.\n“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his\ncousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”\n“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled\ninto fists.\n“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”\n“Shut your face.”\n“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and\n‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”\nDudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting\nHarry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.\n“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin\nfading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights\nago —”\n“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.\n“Oh yeah?”\n“He cheeked me.”\n“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on\nits hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”"

It gave Harry enormous\nsatisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as\nthough he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the\nonly outlet he had.\nThey turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had\nfirst seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia\nCrescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the\nstreets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps\nwere muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on\nthe other.\n13\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\n“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley\nsaid after a few seconds.\n“What thing?”\n“That — that thing you’re hiding.”\nHarry grinned again.\n“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,\nyou wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”\nHarry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\n“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.\nYou’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”\n“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”\n“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely\nconvinced. Harry laughed softly.\n“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have\nyou?” Dudley snarled.\n“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat\nup a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on\nabout? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”\n“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was\nout cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was\ntwice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing\nout —”\n“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ fright-\nened of nasty Harry’s wand?”\n“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.\n“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all\ndark like this.”\n“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.\nHe had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.\nFrom the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a\nstrangely triumphant look.\n“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely\n14\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nnonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or\nsomething?”\n“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your\nsleep.

Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s\nCedric — your boyfriend?”\n“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had\ngone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know\nabout Cedric?\n“‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad!

Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of\nDudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,\nto jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,\nstruck dumb, sprouting feelers —\n“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you under-\nstand me?”\n“Point that thing somewhere else!”\n“I said, do you understand me?”\n“Point it somewhere else!”\n“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”\n“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”\nDudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been\ndoused in icy water.\n15\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nSomething had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky\nwas suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the\nmisty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished.

He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley\nfence, stumbling.\n“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT\nIT!”\nThere was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps\nstopped.

It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have\nnever died. . . .”\nHe was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —\nAnd their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for\nbreath —\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”\nAn enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its\nantlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have\nbeen; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag\ncharged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.\n“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he\nsprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?\nDUDLEY!”\nHe had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley\nwas curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de-\n18\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUDLEY DEMENTED\nmentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy\nhands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded\nhead toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .\n“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the\nsilver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The de-\nmentor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver\nantlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its\nfellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag\ncantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.\nMoon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze\nswept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mun-\ndane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry\nstood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to\nnormality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was stick-\ning to him; he was drenched in sweat.\nHe could not believe what had just happened.

Did he use — his thing?”\nSlowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.\n“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and\nUncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t\nme, it was —”\nBut at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the\nkitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it\nsoared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it\nwas carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips\nof its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside\nagain and off across the garden.\n“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his tem-\nple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS\nAGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY\nHOUSE!”\nBut Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out\nthe letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his\nAdam’s apple.\nDear Mr. Potter,\nWe have received intelligence that you performed the Pa-\ntronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening\nin a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.\nThe severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-\n26\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PECK OF OWLS\nable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your ex-\npulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nMinistry representatives will be calling at your place of resi-\ndence shortly to destroy your wand.\nAs you have already received an official warning for a\nprevious offense under section 13 of the International Con-\nfederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform\nyou that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at\nthe Ministry of Magic at 9 on August 12th.\na.m.\nHoping you are well,\nYours sincerely,"

He was only vaguely aware of\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his\nhead, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his conscious-\nness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all\nover. He was never going back.\nHe looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced,\nshouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dud-\nley, who was retching again.\nHarry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry\nrepresentatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy\nyour wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run —\nnow. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain\nof one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an\nalmost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the\nkitchen.\n27\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\n“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When\nHarry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the door-\nway into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!”\n“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.\n“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”\n“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry,\nraising the wand.\n“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know\nyou’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!”\n“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do\nwhatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —”\nA resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed,\nUncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night\nHarry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He\nspotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting\noutside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed\nwindow.\nIgnoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed\nthe room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl\nstuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its\nfeathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.\nHands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was writ-\nten very hastily and blotchily in black ink.\nHarry —\nDumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to\nsort it all out.

Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hog-\nwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost\nimmediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to\nsurrender his wand without doing magic? He’d have to duel with the\nMinistry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape\nAzkaban, let alone expulsion.\nHis mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being cap-\ntured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here.\nHe was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that\nMr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumble-\ndore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . .\n“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.”\nHe flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and\nAunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt\nchange of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon.\nThe vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than\never.\n“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled.\n“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said\nHarry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case\nthe Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and\nquieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have him start rag-\ning and bellowing. “The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he\nworks at the Ministry.”\n“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in\ngovernment? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the\ncountry’s going to the dogs. . . .”\nWhen Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then\nspat, “And why have you been expelled?”\n29\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\n“Because I did magic.”\n“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of\nthe fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks top-\npled out and burst on the floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to\nDudley?”\n“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That wasn’t me —”\n“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and\nAunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him\nwhile they both bent low over Dudley.\n“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?”\n“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.\n“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled.\n“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use —” Harry began angrily, but . . .\n“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.\n“Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about\nfuriously.\n“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. “Everything dark."

They ob-\nviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.\n“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petu-\nnia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.\nBut Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and\nshook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that\nhad settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain\ncuriosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of\ntheir life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have\nbeen forced to hear?\n“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-\n30\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PECK OF OWLS\nrally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a\nvery ill person.\n“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —”\nHe gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was re-\nmembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happi-\nness were sucked out of you.\n“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.”\n“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt\nPetunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s forehead to feel his temper-\nature. “What happened then, Dudders?”\n“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if. . . as if . . .”\n“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied tonelessly.\n“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling.\n“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable\nvolume as he straightened up. “So you put some crackpot spell on my\nson so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery,\nor something, did you?”\n“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and\nvoice rising together. “It wasn’t me!

Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s\nbrain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia?\n“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished.\nAunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself.

Harry tore a second official-looking en-\nvelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped\nback out into the night.\n“Enough — effing — owls . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distract-\nedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.\nDear Mr. Potter,\nFurther to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes\nago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy\nyour wand forthwith.

The\nmiserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he\nwas not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means ban-\nished.

They didn’t take — he’s still got his —”\nShe seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though test-\ning to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.\n“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said\nHarry, exasperated.\n“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the\nappearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a\nplane he understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?”\n“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said Harry through\nclenched teeth.\n“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he\nall empty, then?”\n“Because I used the Patronus —”\nWHOOSH.

Wasn’t anybody going to say\n“well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly?

Dudley was staring stupidly at his\nmother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry\nwas watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to\nburst.\n“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?”\nShe raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.\n“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly.\n“W-what?”\n40\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PECK OF OWLS\n“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her\nfeet again.\n“He . . . but Petunia . . .”\n“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she said. She was re-\ngaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still\nvery pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where\nhe’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.”\nUncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.\n“But Petunia, dear —”\nAunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.\n“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to leave the\nhouse. Now get to bed.”"

He addressed\nthe first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His\nowl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk.\nHarry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head\npounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and\nitched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home,\nand the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit\nhim were throbbing painfully.\nUp and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration,\ngrinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at\nthe empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Demen-\ntors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him\nin secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Min-\nistry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.\n42\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ADVANCED GUARD\nAnd what, what, had that Howler been about?

Understand?”\nHedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.\n“Get going, then,” said Harry.\nShe took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw\nhimself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark\nceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty\nthat he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at\nnumber four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came\nback with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers.\nThey were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ig-\nnore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat\nletters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the\nBurrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling\nall further thought.\n43\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\n(cid:145) (cid:145) (cid:145)\nBut Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his\nbedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day\nAunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle\nVernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her\napproaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might\nas well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.\nOtherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t\nsee the point of forcing his company on them; another row would\nachieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he’d perform\nmore illegal magic.\nSo it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with\nrestless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during\nwhich he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them\nfor leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete\nthat he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into\nspace, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.\nWhat if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his\nwand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go?\nHe could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now\nthat he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.\n. . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house,\nas Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee\nfrom the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone,\ngiven that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he\nwent next be decided for him; had his breach of the International\nStatute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azka-\nban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his\nbed and began pacing again.\nOn the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in\none of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind\n44\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ADVANCED GUARD"

Harry looked\nslowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an\nexpression of enormous smugness.\n“We’re going out,” he said.\n“Sorry?”\n“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.”\n“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.\n“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.”\n“Okay.”\n“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our\npossessions.”\n“Right.”\n“You are not to steal food from the fridge.”\n“Okay.”\n“I am going to lock your door.”\n“You do that.”\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of ar-\ngument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind\nhim. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s foot-\nsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the\nslamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable\nsound of the car sweeping out of the drive.\nHarry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made\nno difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could\nnot even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light.\nThe room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the\nnight sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting\nfor the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.\nThe empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry\nlay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in\nmisery.\nAnd then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.\n45\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nHe sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be\nback, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car.\nThere was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.\nBurglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split\nsecond later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices\ndown, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly\nnot troubling to do so.\nHe snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing\nhis bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he\njumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.\nHarry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark\nupstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.\nHe hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of\nhis room to the head of the stairs.\nHis heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing\nin the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing\nthrough the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could\nsee, looking up at him.\n“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a\nlow, growling voice."

He knew that voice,\nbut he did not lower his wand.\n“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.\n“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never\ngot round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you\nproperly.”\nHarry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor\ndid he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had re-\ncently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye\nMoody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an\nimpostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before\n46\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ADVANCED GUARD\nbeing unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to\ndo next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.\n“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”\nHarry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t\nheard it for more than a year.\n“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?”\n“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one\ncompletely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.”\nA wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry\nblinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs,\ngazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.\nRemus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young,\nLupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when\nHarry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched\nand shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry,\nwho tried to smile back through his shock.\n“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who\nwas holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had\na pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that\nwas a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!”\n“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard\nstanding farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single\ngold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.”\n“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the\nback. “Lily’s eyes.”\nMad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large\nchunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry\nthrough his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and\nbeady, the other large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that\ncould see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.\n“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice\n47\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nlookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him.

Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!”\n“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman\nasked Mad-Eye interestedly.\n“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back\npocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers\nabout it anymore. . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw\nthat,” he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.\nLupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s.\n“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.\n“F-fine . . .”\nHarry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing,\nnot the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and\nsuddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in\nthe house as though this were a long-standing arrangement.

He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his\nhair for four days.\n“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he mumbled.\n“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured\nthem out of the way.

If one of us is killed —”\n“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored\nhim.\n“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they\ntake out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing\nby to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.”\n“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this\nseriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s\ncage into a harness hanging from her broom.\n“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to\ndeliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —”\n“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep,\ncalming voice.\n“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply,\npointing into the sky.\nFar, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among\nthe stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung\nhis right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it\nvibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in\nthe air once more.\n“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green\nthis time, exploded high above them.\nHarry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed\nthrough his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away,\nshrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and\nevery thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as\nthough the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though\n55\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nhis heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, fly-\ning away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer,\nhe was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems\nseemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.\n“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody\nfrom behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching\nhis trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height.\n. . . Give it another quarter of a mile!”\nHarry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see\nnothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights\nand streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Ver-\nnon’s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty\nhouse right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition\n. . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was\ndrowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the har-\nness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their\nears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month,\nor this happy. . . .\n“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!”"

He wished he had thought to put on a\ncoat; he was starting to shiver.\nThey altered their course every now and then according to Mad-\nEye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy\nwind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember be-\ning this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch\n56\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ADVANCED GUARD\nmatch against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a\nstorm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant\nbirds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they\nhad been flying; it felt like an hour at least.\n“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the\nmotorway!”\nHarry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment\nof the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even\nmore longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfort-\nable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames.\n. . .

If we keep going off course we’re not\ngoing to get there until next week! We’re nearly there now!”\n“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks,\nHarry!”\nHarry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest\ncollection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing\nmass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deep-\nest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual\nheadlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. He\nwanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that some-\none would have to unfreeze him from his broom.\n“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.\nHarry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch\nof unkempt grass in the middle of a small square.

The grimy\n57\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nfronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them\nhad broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-\nlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish\nlay outside several sets of front steps.\n“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.”\nMoody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with\ncold.\n“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette\nlighter into the air and clicking it.\nThe nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the un-\nlighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every\nlamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square\ncame from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.\n“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the\nPut-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the win-\ndow, see? Now, come on, quick.”\nHe took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass,\nacross the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed,\ncarrying Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with\ntheir wands out, flanking them.\nThe muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper win-\ndow in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came\nfrom the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.\n“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward\nHarry’s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as\nto illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.”\nHarry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting\nwas vaguely familiar. It said:\nThe headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at\nnumber twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.\n58\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R F O U R\nNUMBER TWELVE,\nGRIMMAULD PLACE\nW\nhat’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began.\n“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!”\nHe pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire\nto it with his wand tip. As the message curled into flames and floated\nto the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were\nstanding outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw num-\nber ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.\n“But where’s — ?”\n“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.\nHarry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-\nber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of\nnowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by\ndirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had\ninflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it.\nThe stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles in-"

Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door\nknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or\nletterbox.\nLupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard\nmany loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a\nchain. The door creaked open.\n“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside\nand don’t touch anything.”\nHarry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of\nthe hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the\nplace had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoul-\nder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying\nhis trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and\nreleasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the street-\nlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed\nmomentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and\nclosed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.\n“Here —”\nHe rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as\nthough something hot was trickling down his back this time and\nknew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.\n“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,”\nMoody whispered.\nThe others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of fore-\nboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying\nperson. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas\nlamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insub-\nstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a\nlong, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered over-\nhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry\n60\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nNUMBER TWELVE,\nGRIMMAULD PLACE\nheard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier\nand the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.\nThere were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley,\nemerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in\nwelcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she\nwas rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen\nher.\n“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into\na rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining\nhim critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll\nhave to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid. . . .”\nShe turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered ur-"

Ron and\nHermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s\nover and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the\nhall,” she added in an urgent whisper.\n“Why?”\n“I don’t want to wake anything up.”\n“What d’you — ?”\n“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meet-\ning — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”\nPressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of\nlong, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must\nbe another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked\nas though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up\nthe dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on\n61\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\nplaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads be-\nlonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.\nHarry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on\nearth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to\nthe Darkest of wizards?\n“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”\n“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to\ndash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had\nreached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call\nyou when it’s over.”\nAnd she hurried off downstairs again.\nHarry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob,\nwhich was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.\nHe caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded\nroom, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even\nlouder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quan-\ntity of very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a\nhug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon,\nzoomed excitedly round and round their heads.\n“HARRY!

He seemed to have grown several more inches during\ntheir month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than\never, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.\n62\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nNUMBER TWELVE,\nGRIMMAULD PLACE\nHermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say\nanother word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white\nsoared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s\nshoulder.\n“Hedwig!”\nThe snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately\nas Harry stroked her feathers.\n“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death\nwhen she brought your last letters, look at this —”\nHe showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported\na half-healed but clearly deep cut.\n“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers,\nyou know. . . .”\n“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was\ngoing spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were\nstuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —”\n“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already\nsaid.”\nThe warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two\nbest friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his\nstomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid\nmonth — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.\nThere was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig auto-\nmatically, not looking at either of the others.\n“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breath-\nlessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.”\n“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks\nof Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.\n“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron\nbegan.\n“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been\nattacked by dementors this summer?”\n63\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\n“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the\nPhoenix tailing you all the time —”\nHarry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step\ngoing downstairs.

A blank\nstretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the\nbareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he\nheard someone lurking out of sight snigger.\n“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?”\nHarry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you —\ner — bother to ask him at all?”\nHe glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told\nhim he was behaving just as they had feared he would.

The last he had heard, the\nthird Weasley brother was working in the Department of Interna-\ntional Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.\nAt these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly\nsignificant looks.\n“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and\nDad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice.\n“Why not?”\n“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks what-\never he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said.\n“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly.\n“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacter-\nistically ugly look on his face.\n“What’s happened?” Harry said.\n“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row\nwith anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. . . .”\n“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were\n70\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nNUMBER TWELVE,\nGRIMMAULD PLACE\nabout to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d\nbeen promoted.”\n“You’re kidding?” said Harry.\nThough he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious,\nHarry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his\nfirst job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large\noversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by\nLord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all\nthought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).\n“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into\na load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything.\nThey said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and\ninformed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge,\nhe wasn’t going to complain. . . .”\n“So how come they promoted him?”\n“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very\nkeen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped\nyelling. “He came home really pleased with himself — even more\npleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been\noffered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for some-\none only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister.\nHe expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.”\n“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.\n“Why not?” said Harry.\n“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry\nchecking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said\nGeorge.\n“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,” said\nFred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-Know-\nWho’s back.”\n“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with\nDumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George.\n71\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\n“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dum-\nbledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his\nMuggle obsession —”"

Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his\noffice because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and\nDumbledore.”\nHarry let out a low whistle.\n“Bet Percy loved that.”\nRon laughed in a hollow sort of way.\n“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of ter-\nrible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy\nreputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no\nambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a\nlot of money, I mean —”\n“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an an-\ngry cat.\n“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad\nwas an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was\nheading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and\nthat he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the\nMinistry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the\nMinistry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong\nto our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and\nleft. He’s living here in London now.”\nHarry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of\nRon’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things\nto Mr. Weasley.\n“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and\nstuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed\nthe door in her face.

Harry felt a sudden\nupsurge of affection for his godfather.\n“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly.\n“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports,\nhaving to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life\nwhile I’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . .\nasking me how the cleaning’s going —”\n“What cleaning?” asked Harry.\n“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius,\nwaving a hand around the dismal kitchen. “No one’s lived here for\nten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old\nhouse-elf, and he’s gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in\nages —”\n“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any\nattention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an\nempty goblet. “This solid silver, mate?”\n“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest fifteenth-\ncentury goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.”\n“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, polishing it\nwith his cuff.\n“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley\nshrieked.\nHarry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second\nlater, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a\nlarge cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy\nwooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air\ntoward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a\nhalt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden sur-\nface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents\neverywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed,\n83\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\npoint down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius’s right\nhand had been seconds before.\n“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE\nWAS NO NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BE-\nCAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU\nDON’T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY\nTINY LITTLE THING!”\n“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying for-\nward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius,\nmate — didn’t mean to —”\nHarry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had top-\npled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crook-\nshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from\nwhence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.\n“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of\nthe table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of re-"

Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met!\nPercy —”\nShe stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her\nhusband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.\n“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly.\n“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate\nfor her and handing it across the table.\nFor a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and\ncutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their\nfood. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been mean-\ning to tell you, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the\ndrawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just\n84\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ORDER OF\nTHE PHOENIX\nbe a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at\nit before we let it out.”\n“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently.\n“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. Weasley went\non. “I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.”\n“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his\nvoice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.\nOpposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by\ntransforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each\ntime with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s\nbedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape’s,\nshrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then\nsprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a\nregular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and\nGinny started requesting their favorite noses.\n“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .”\nTonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression\nthat a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.\nMr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion\nabout goblins.\n“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I still can’t work\nout whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer\nnot to take sides at all. Keep out of it.”\n“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr.\nWeasley, shaking his head. “They’ve suffered losses too. Remember\nthat goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near\nNottingham?”\n“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not\ntalking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying\nthem for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had\nany luck with Ragnok, Bill?”"

For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very\nnasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large\nrhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.\n“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in an\nundertone.\n“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very quietly.\n“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he\nwould, seeing as he’s one himself.

Mr. Weasley was lean-\ning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning\nwidely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured\nCrookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on\nthe floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.\n“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.\n“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and\nturning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought\nthe first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking\nquestions about Voldemort.”\nThe atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry as-\nsociated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had\nbeen sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone\naround the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who\nhad been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, look-\ning wary.\n“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but\nthey said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —”\n“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.”\nShe was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its\narms, every trace of drowsiness gone.\n“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to\nask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle\nhouse for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —”\n87\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.\n“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily.\n“We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you\nhaven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said George.\n“‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’” said Fred, in a high-\npitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not\neven of age!”\n“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,”\nsaid Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other\nhand —”\n“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs.\nWeasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You\nhaven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?”\n“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though ready-\ning himself for a fight.\n“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said\nMrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.\nRon, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to\nMrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling\namid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation\nwith her mouth slightly open.

He took off his glasses and\ncleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when\nhe had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore\nknows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will\nhave to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at head-\nquarters —”\n“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask\nwhatever he likes!”\n“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as\nMrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about\nto get an ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the\nfacts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled\nversion from . . . others.”\n89\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nHis expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least,\nknew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge.\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around\nthe table for support that did not come, “well . . .

He had been touched by what she\nhad said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at\nher mollycoddling. . . .

What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch\nthe Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces\nat the name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet,\nno funny deaths or anything —”\n91\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said\nSirius, “not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.”\n“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.\n“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew\nthat Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.\n“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the mo-\nment,” said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback\ndidn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it\nup.”\n“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied\nsmile.\n“How?” Harry asked perplexedly.\n“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from\nhis Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you sur-\nvived to bear witness.”\n“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the mo-\nment he got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure\nDumbledore knew at once.”\n“How has that helped?” Harry asked.\n“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. “Dumbledore was the\nonly one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!”\n“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the\nPhoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius.\n“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking around at\nthem all.\n“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out\nhis plans,” said Sirius.\n“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly.\n“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s\nshrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.”\n“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?”\n“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius. “In\n92\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ORDER OF\nTHE PHOENIX\nthe old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wiz-\nards he’d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death\nEaters, a great variety of Dark creatures.

He thinks Dumble-\ndore wants to be Minister of Magic.”\n“But Dumbledore doesn’t want —”\n“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never wanted the\nMinister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when\nMillicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s\nnever quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had,\neven though Dumbledore never applied for the job.”\n93\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is,\na much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he\nwas forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. “But\nit seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confi-\ndent. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince\nhimself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up\ntrouble for the sake of it.”\n“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How can he think\nDumbledore would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?”\n“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like\nthe Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said\nSirius bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much\nmore comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabi-\nlize him.”\n“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the Ministry insists\nthere is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people\nhe’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first\nplace. What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily\nProphet not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-\nmongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely un-\naware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the\nDeath Eaters if they’re using the Imperius Curse.”\n“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, looking around"

They reported that he’d been voted out of the\nChairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because\nhe’s getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he was voted out\nby Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort’s\nreturn.

Something he didn’t have last time.”\n“When he was powerful before?”\n“Yes.”\n“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than\nthe Avada Kedavra — ?”\n“That’s enough.”\nMrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had\nnot noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were\ncrossed and she looked furious.\n“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, looking around at\nFred, George, Ron, and Hermione.\n“You can’t boss us —” Fred began.\n“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as\nshe looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry plenty of information. Any\nmore and you might just as well induct him into the Order\nstraightaway.”\n“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, I want to\nfight —”\n“No.”\nIt was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.\n96\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ORDER OF\nTHE PHOENIX\n“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he said. “Wiz-\nards who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their\nmouths. “There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea,\nany of you . . . I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said enough.”\nSirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned im-\nperiously to her sons and Hermione.

The\nbedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had\non first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very\nslowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep.

Oh\nyeah . . . I forgot. . . .”\nHe crossed to the door and bolted it.\n“What’re you doing that for?”\n“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was\nhere he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you\ndon’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room.\nAnyway . . .” He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then\nturned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline\nby the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. “What d’you\nreckon?”\nHarry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.\n“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?”\nhe said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all\nthey’ve really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining\nVol —”\nThere was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.\n“— demort,” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using\nhis name?

A few\nseconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door;\nMrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or\nnot.\nHedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked\nagain and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and\nGeorge.\n“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully.\nHarry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had\nbeen so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie\nawake for hours mulling it all over.

In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and\ndown outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical\nCreatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry?

He ducked. . . .\nThe next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his\nbedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room."

Sirius had\nobviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait be-\ncause she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the\nhall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a\ndeep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s\njust relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a re-\nport for Dumbledore. . . .”\nFeeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regret-\nfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.\nMrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in\nGilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on\nthe sofa.\n“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and\ntheir teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d\nrather nobody needed it.”\nShe straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the cur-\ntains, and beckoned them all forward.\n“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said.\n“They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one\ngood squirt will paralyze them.

It was\npast midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf,\nsank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of dis-\ngust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer\nbuzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; un-\nconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside\na bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing\nand Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.\n“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.”"

Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black\n“Toujours Pur”\n“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the\ntree.\n“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred\nhole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother\nblasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of\nmuttering the story under his breath.”\n“You ran away from home?”\n“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.”\n“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.\n“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good\nabout it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out\nat your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seven-\nteen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent\nbit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why —\nanyway, after that I looked after myself.

A date of death (some fifteen years previously) fol-\nregulus black\nlowed the date of birth.\n“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as\nI was constantly reminded.”\n“But he died,” said Harry.\n“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.”\n“You’re kidding!”\n“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell\nwhat kind of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily.\n“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?”\n“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right\nidea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting\nrid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t\nalone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed\nhis true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . .\nThey got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get\npower, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right lit-\ntle hero for joining up at first.”\n“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.\n“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on\nVoldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important\nenough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out\nafter he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being\nasked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your\nresignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”\n“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice.\nShe was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge\ntray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip.

Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t\ntake orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the\nfamily asks him. . . .”\n“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.\n“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said\nSirius, examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here\neither, look —”\nHe pointed to another small round burn mark between two names,\nBellatrix and Narcissa.\n“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, re-\nspectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-\nborn, Ted Tonks, so —”\nSirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly.\nHarry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names\nto the right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold\nembroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single\nvertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.\n“You’re related to the Malfoys!”\n“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re\nonly going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your\nchoice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left.

The name had stirred something\nin his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he\ncouldn’t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation\nin the pit of his stomach.\n“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.\nHarry looked at him curiously.\n“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch,\nJunior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother,\nRabastan, was with them too.”\nAnd Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside\nDumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and\nmemories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes,\nwho had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to\nLord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his\ndownfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for\nher loyalty.\n“You never said she was your —”\n“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m\nconcerned, they’re not my family.

He\nturned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t\nlike being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I\nnever thought I’d be stuck in this house again.”\nHarry understood completely.

It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if\nthey’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protec-\ntion, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s\nSecret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquar-\nters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody\nshowed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. . . .” Sirius gave a\nshort, barklike laugh. “If my parents could see the use it was being put\nto now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea. . . .”\nHe scowled for a moment, then sighed.\n“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do some-\nthing useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your\nhearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral\nsupport, what d’you think?”\nHarry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty\ncarpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the\nprevious evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he\nliked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely\nflown his mind. At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of\ndread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all\ntucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they\nwent back to Hogwarts without him.\n“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius\nhad been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s\ndefinitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about be-\ning allowed to use magic to save your own life.”\n“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back\nhere and live with you?”\nSirius smiled sadly.\n115\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIX\n“We’ll see.”\n“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go\nback to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him.\n“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily."

Fortunately for him, it was a job\nthat required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there\nseemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a\nbad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had\ndeveloped an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.\n“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tap-\nping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must\nbe Wartcap powder in there.”\nHe threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing\nthe debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand\ncarefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already\ndoxy-filled pocket.\nThey found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something\nlike a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm\nlike a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his\nskin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled\nNature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box\nthat emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all\nfound themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny\nhad the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of\nthem could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an\nOrder of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grand-\nfather for “Services to the Ministry.”\n116\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE NOBLE AND MOST\nANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK\n“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously,\nthrowing the medal into the rubbish sack.\nSeveral times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to\nsmuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses\nevery time they caught him at it.

Harry could see red marks\nunder her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.\n“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of\nhope.\n“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and\nmore confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One\nof them had fallen.

The\ndementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we\nask them to.”\n“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask our-\nselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors\ninto that alleyway on the second of August.”\nIn the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the\nright of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.\nHe thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather\nsquat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a\nvery wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly\nbulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short\ncurly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a\nlong sticky tongue.\n“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecre-\ntary to the Minister,” said Fudge.\nThe witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took\nHarry aback; he had been expecting a croak.\n146\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE HEARING\n“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,”\nshe said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So\nsilly of me.

A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with\nher. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really\namused.\n“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Min-\nistry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry\nand his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at\nthe Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore po-\nlitely. “Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside\nMinistry control —”\n“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped\nFudge, who had turned brick red.\nDumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.\n“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into\nwhy two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they at-\ntacked without authorization.”\n“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does\nnot do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of\nwhich Uncle Vernon would have been proud.\n“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely ex-"

I am\nsure she would not object.”\n“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers be-\nfore him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”\n“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard\nfrom a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,”\nsaid Dumbledore.\n“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice.\n“Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull sto-\nries this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up\nhis flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten\nthe Hover Charm he used three years ago —”\n“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.\n“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s di-\nrection. “A house-elf!

Why, in\nthe few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has\nalready become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a\nsimple matter of underage magic!”\nA few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their\nseats.

He has been charged with a\nspecific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do\nnow is to await your verdict.”\nDumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more.\nFudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at\nDumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumble-\ndore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about\ntime they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed\noblivious to Harry’s attempt to catch his eye.

Nobody seemed to be paying\nhim the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s\nright, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ig-\nnoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting\nto ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined\nnot to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase,\nso he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody\ncalled him back, broke into a very fast walk.\nHe took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and al-\nmost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside,\nlooking pale and apprehensive.\n“Dumbledore didn’t say —”\n“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all\ncharges!”\n152\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS.

Cornelius Fudge and the toad-\nlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as\nthough Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the\nwitch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to\npass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and\nHarry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a\nhandful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines\naround Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he\ngave no sign that he had noticed his third son.\n“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the\ngood news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disap-\npeared up the stairs to the ninth level. I’ll drop you off on the way to\nthat toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on. . . .”\n“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grin-\nning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It\nwas starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.\n“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they\nmounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage,\nit’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry.

        "text": "was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talk-\ning to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy\nwas a Death Eater.\n“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”\ndrawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to\nwriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”\nMr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping. . . .”\nLucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.\n“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”\n“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.\n“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glanc-\ning toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were\nup on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves\nsneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?”\n“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s\nshoulder.\n“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.\n“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are\nany concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his\n154\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS. WEASLEY\nrobes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like\na full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s fa-\nvorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of\nus. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?”\n“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr.\nWeasley. “This way, Lucius.”\nThey strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not\nlet go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.\n“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got busi-\nness to do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing\ndown here?”\n“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr.\nWeasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as\nthough making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out\nwhether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore\nwhen I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge\nagain.”\n“What private business have they got together anyway?”\n“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving\ngenerously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the\nright people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want\npassed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy. . . .”\nThe lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that\nflapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the\nAtrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.\n“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death"

Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry. . . .”\n155\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\nThe doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-\ndeserted Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily\nProphet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain be-\nfore Harry remembered.\n“Wait. . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from\nhis pocket, he turned back to the fountain.\nHe looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry\nthought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a\nvapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of\ngoblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this\nsoppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of\ncreeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of\nwhat Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry\nturned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten\nGalleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.\n“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with\nstuff!”\n“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked\npositively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and\nwas now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case\nagainst you, none at all. . . .”\n“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew\nI’d get off,” said Harry, smiling.\nMrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George,\nand Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He\ngot off, he got off, he got off —”\n“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too\nwas smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”\n“What?” said Sirius sharply.\n“He got off, he got off, he got off —”\n“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level\n156\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS. WEASLEY\nnine, then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought\nto know.”\n“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”\n“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal\nGreen waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but\nKingsley might be dropping in for dinner —”\n“He got off, he got off, he got off —”\n“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley,"

The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcom-\ning all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his\nsnoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the\nnoise.\n“’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no\nway they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing\ngreat mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.\n“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound\nhighly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked\nto me, though. Or even looked at me.”\nAnd as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly\nthat he clapped his hand to it.\n“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.\n“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the\ntime now. . . .”\nNone of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now help-\ning themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape;\nFred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather\n157\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\nanxious, but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet\nDumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”\n“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a\nhuge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very\nbusy at the moment.”\n“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”\n“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.\nOver the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was\none person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not\nseem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sir-\nius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the\nnews, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them;\nsoon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to\neverybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut\nup in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.\n“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry\nhad confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they\nscrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.\n“You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s\nbeing selfish.”\n“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he at-\ntempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his"

He just got his hopes up that Harry\nwould be coming to live here with him.”\n“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He\nwouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”\n“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said\nHermione wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I\n158\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS. WEASLEY\nthink a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d\nboth be outcasts together.”\n“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely\nshrugged.\n“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sir-\nius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”\n“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.\n“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said\nHermione simply.\nAt this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.\n“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard.\n“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron\nbitterly. “D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we ar-\nrived here?”\n“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can\ndo your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”\n“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.\n“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, per-\nhaps you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully,\nas Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t\nbe a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the\ntime — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room,\nall proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —”\n“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably,\nbut only so Harry could hear him.\nHarry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more\nas the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid\nagain, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to\nthe Herbology greenhouses.

Though members of the Or-\nder of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for\nmeals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation,\nMrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out\nof earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sir-\nius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he\nhad heard on the night of his arrival.\nOn the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hed-\nwig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered\ntheir bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\n“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up\nto Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d\nforgotten, they usually come much earlier than this. . . .”\nHarry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw\nthe bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner,\nwhich swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It\ncontained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term\nstarted on the first of September, the other telling him which books he\nwould need for the coming year.\n“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book\nof Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory,\nby Wilbert Slinkhard.”\nCrack.\nFred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to\nthem doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.\n“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said\nFred conversationally.\n“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the\nDark Arts teacher,” said George.\n160\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS.

Harry looked around. Ron was standing very\nstill with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\n“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to\nlook over his shoulder at the parchment.\nFred’s mouth fell open too.\n“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?”\nGeorge leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and\nturned it upside down.

He\nstood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as\nRon bounded back through the door.\n“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Clean-\nsweep if she can.”\n“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had\nstopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”\nThe smile faded off Ron’s face.\n“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I\nthought it would be you!”\n“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.\n167\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our\ntrunks packed, hadn’t we?”\nIt was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered\nthemselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon\nto retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and\nstow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron\nkept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside\ntable, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lay-\ning it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the\nblack. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach\nit to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it\ntenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.\nMrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden\nwith books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown pa-\nper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.\n“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I\nwant you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of\nsight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of\nhis new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.\nDown in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner\nover the heavily laden dinner table, which read\ncongratulations\n. She looked in a better mood\nron and hermione — new prefects\nthan Harry had seen her all holiday.\n“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the\nroom. “Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both\nowls and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming.\nFred rolled his eyes."

Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go\nup and get rid of it, Molly?”\n“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have\nyour drink.

Harry had\nthe very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away\ntoward Sirius and Lupin.\n“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his\nnormal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose\nDumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he\nwouldn’t have appointed you. . . .”\nRon looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved\nthe trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest\nbrother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even\ncomplain that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was\nwearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places\nand declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody’s traveling\ncloak.\n“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone\nhad a drink.

Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”\n“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to ex-\nercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely\nsay that I failed dismally.”\nHarry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect ei-\nther. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up\nhis plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.\nRon was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would\nlisten.\n“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it?

It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint\nrattling noise was coming from them, even though they were com-\npletely stationary.\n“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the\nSkiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so\nwe’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”\n“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.\n“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his\nsaggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m\nnot taking a Knut under twenty.”\n“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.\n“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl\nquills,” said George."

It had just oc-\ncurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how\nFred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was\ninevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Tri-\nwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but\nwhat if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement?\nWould Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she\nfound out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a ca-\nreer she thought quite unsuitable?\nStanding where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty\nweight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound\nof his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even\nover the surrounding chatter.\n“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley.\n“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.\n“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”\npersisted Kingsley, “’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at\nhim every few days. . . .”\nHarry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to\nknow he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table,\nthough not remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated\nas quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.\nMad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained\nof his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because\nhe then tore a strip off it with his teeth.\n172\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WOES OF\nMRS.

Getting as unreliable as\nMundungus.”\n“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round.\nHe reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too,\nHarry. Be careful.”\n“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody,\nshaking Harry’s hand too. “And don’t forget, all of you — careful\nwhat you put in writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.”\n182\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\n“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, hugging Hermione\nand Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.”\nA warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform\nstarted hurrying onto the train.\n“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at ran-\ndom and catching Harry twice. “Write. . . . Be good. . . . If you’ve for-\ngotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry. . . .”\nFor one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs\nand placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley\nshoved Harry away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake\nact more like a dog, Sirius!”\n“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the train began\nto move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The\nfigures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank\nrapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wag-\nging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it\nchasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was\ngone.\n“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried\nvoice.\n“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for months,\npoor bloke.”\n“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around\nchatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee.

Fine.”\n“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione\nquickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy\nand Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.”\n“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, then.”\n“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry.\n“It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I\nmean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly.\n“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione\nand Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon\noff toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss.\nHe had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.\n“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to\nsave them places.”\n“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the\nhandle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor,\npeering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they\npassed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a\nlot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of\nthem nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met\nthis behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the\nDaily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying\nshow-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now star-\ning and whispering believed the stories.\nIn the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fel-\nlow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of\npulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his\nstruggling toad, Trevor.\n184\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\n“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I\ncan’t find a seat. . . .”\n“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past\nNeville to peer into the compartment behind him. “There’s room in\nthis one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here —”\nNeville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.\n“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.”\nShe slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and\nNeville followed.\n“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?”\nThe girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-\nlength, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes\nthat gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why\nNeville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an\naura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her\nwand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to\nwear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine\nupside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry.\nShe nodded."

The girl called Luna watched them\nover her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She\ndid not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared\nand stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now\nwished he had not.\n“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.\n“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes,\nit was quite enjoyable, you know. You’re Harry Potter,” she added.\n“I know I am,” said Harry.\nNeville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.\n“And I don’t know who you are.”\n185\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\n“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly.\n“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom —\nLuna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.”\n“Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said Luna in a\nsingsong voice.\nShe raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face\nand fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eye-\nbrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.\nThe train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It\nwas an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of\nsunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray\nclouds.\n“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville.\n“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike\ndevice Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his\nabysmal memory.\n“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost the old one\nages ago. . . . No, look at this. . . .”\nHe dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into\nhis schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what ap-\npeared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered\nwith what looked like boils rather than spines.\n“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly.\nHarry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the\nrather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.\n“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if\nthere’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show\nit to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria.\nI’m going to see if I can breed from it.”\nHarry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for\nthe life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted\nlittle plant.\n186\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\n“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.\n“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defen-\nsive mechanism — hold Trevor for me. . . .”"

Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of\nher upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing.\nNeville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue be-\ntween his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with\nthe tip of his quill.\nLiquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-\ngreen jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna\nLovegood’s magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of\nher face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy\ngreen hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the es-\ncape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.\nNeville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to\nget the worst out of his eyes.\n“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before. . . . Didn’t realize\nit would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poiso-\nnous,” he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.\nAt that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.\n“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?”\nHarry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A\nvery pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway\nsmiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch\nteam.\n“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly.\n“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye\nthen.”\nShe closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed.\nHarry slumped back in his seat and groaned.

Ron stared at the cover\nwith his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around\nat Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her\nknuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head,\nbemused, then checked his watch.\n“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told\nHarry and Neville, “and we can give out punishments if people are\nmisbehaving.

She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up\nand flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the\nluggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her magazine slipped\nout of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor.\n“That was funny!”\nHer prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring\nat Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were\nnow laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously\nprolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and\nforward, clutching her sides.\n“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her.\n“Baboon’s . . . backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.\nEveryone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at\nthe magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for\nit. Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front\nwas, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius\nFudge; Harry only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler\nhat. One of Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the\nother hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned:\nHow\nFar Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts?\nBeneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.\nCORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:\nHow the Tornados Are Taking Control\nSECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED\nSIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim?\n“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly.\nShe nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.\n190\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\nHarry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this mo-\nment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed\nMr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The\nQuibbler.

Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his\nwand out. The headline on the article read:\nSIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted?\nNotorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?\nHarry had to read this sentence several times before he was con-\nvinced that he had not misunderstood it.

In fact, says Doris\nPurkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may\nnot even have been present at the killings.\n“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is\na false name,” says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people\n191\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\nbelieve to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Board-\nman, lead singer of the popular singing group The\nHobgoblins, who retired from public life after being\nstruck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Nor-\nton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago.

I\nhave written to the Minister of Magic and am expect-\ning him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any\nday now.”\nHarry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps\nit was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof\nitems. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge.\nCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that\nhe had any plans to take over the running of the Wiz-\narding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister\nof Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted\nthat he wants nothing more than to “cooperate\npeacefully” with the guardians of our gold.\nBUT DOES HE?\nSources close to the Minister have recently dis-\nclosed that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize\ncontrol of the goblin gold supplies and that he will\nnot hesitate to use force if need be.\n“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a\nMinistry insider. “Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge,\nthat’s what his friends call him, if you could hear him\n192\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\nwhen he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always\ntalking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had\nthem drowned, he’s had them dropped off buildings,\nhe’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in\npies. . . .”\nHarry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but\nHarry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be\ncooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing\nevery few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were\nwinning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal\nbroom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who\nclaimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought\nback a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes,\nwhich at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler up-\nside down.

Slowly\nthey moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that\nlined the path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform\nand looked around, listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over\nhere . . . firs’ years . . .”\nBut it did not come.

Harry glanced\nquickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and\nHermione, then did a double take.\nThe coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures stand-\ning between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he\nsupposed he would have called them horses, though there was some-\nthing reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their\n196\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nLUNA LOVEGOOD\nblack coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visi-\nble. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and\nstaring.

Harry could not understand why the coaches were being\npulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of\nmoving along by themselves.\n“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry.\n“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, ea-\nger to consult Ron about Hagrid. “Where d’you reckon —”\n“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. “He’d better\nbe okay. . . .”\nA short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of\ncronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing\nsome timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get\na coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from\nthe crowd.\n“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear\nI’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s\nusing it to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?”\n“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is. . . .”\nGinny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming\nCrookshanks.\n“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. “Come on,\nlet’s get a carriage together before they all fill up. . . .”\n“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already head-\ning off toward the nearest unoccupied coach.

Ron, however, gave Harry a\nperplexed look.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“I’m talking about — look!”\nHarry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was\nface-to-face with the winged horse.

Hagrid can’t have left, can he?”\n“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a very good\nteacher, is he?”\n“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.\nHarry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said,\n“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.”\n“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna,\nunfazed.\n“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the\nwheels below them creaked into motion.\nLuna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary,\n200\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SORTING HAT’S\nNEW SONG\nshe simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly inter-\nesting television program.\nRattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road.\nWhen they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged\nboars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned\nforward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s\ncabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete\ndarkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering\nmass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window\nblazing fiery bright above them.\nThe carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the\noak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first.

If Luna was to be believed,\nthe beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry\nsuddenly see them, and why could Ron not?\n“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him.\n“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd hur-\nrying up the stone steps into the castle.\nThe entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with foot-\nsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double\ndoors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term\nfeast."

They lit first upon Professor Dumble-\ndore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long\nstaff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and\na matching hat.

She gave another little throat-\nclearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to be\nback at Hogwarts, I must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed\nteeth. “And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”\nHarry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked\nhappy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being\naddressed as though they were five years old.\n“I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and\nI’m sure we’ll be very good friends!”\nStudents exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely con-\ncealing grins.\n“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow that cardigan,”\nParvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent\ngiggles.\nProfessor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, hem”), but\nwhen she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her\nvoice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a\ndull learned-by-heart sound to them.\n“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of\nyoung witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts\nwith which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and\nhoned by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wiz-\narding community must be passed down through the generations lest\nwe lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge\namassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished\nby those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.”\nProfessor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her\nfellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGona-\ngall’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively\n212\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SORTING HAT’S\nNEW SONG\nhawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance\nwith Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “Hem, hem” and\nwent on with her speech.\n“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought\nsomething new to the weighty task of governing this historic school,\nand that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation\nand decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discour-\naged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A\nbalance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change,\nbetween tradition and innovation . . .”\nHarry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slip-\nping in and out of tune.

Mean-\nwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still\nstaring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was\nsure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the\nnew prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest.\nProfessor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her\naudience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have\nbroken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her\nspeech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and\nHermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke,\nthough judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.\n“. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will\ncome, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment.\nMeanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas\nothers, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned.

Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead,\nthough Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands to-\ngether only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in,\nbut most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not hav-\ning listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start\napplauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.\n“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illumi-\nnating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as I was saying, Quidditch\ntryouts will be held . . .”\n“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in a low voice.\n“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said quietly, turning a\nglazed face upon Hermione. “That was about the dullest speech I’ve\never heard, and I grew up with Percy.”\n“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained\na lot.”\n“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to me.”\n“There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Her-\nmione grimly.\n“Was there?” said Ron blankly.\n“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How\nabout ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’?”\n“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently.\n“I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means\nthe Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.”\nThere was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumb-\nledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was\nstanding up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking\nflustered."

They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had\nnot appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at\nthem. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified,\nnudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie\nlooked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt\nthe grin slide off his face like Stinksap.\n“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way\nout of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more\nwhispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed\nahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then\nhe hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short-\ncuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind.\nHe had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he\nwalked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone\nwas staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two\nmonths ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming\nto have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been\ntime last term to explain himself before everyone went home, even if\nhe had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the ter-\nrible events in that graveyard.\nHe had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common\nroom and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady\nbefore he realized that he did not know the new password.\n215\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n“Er . . .” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed\nthe folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.\n“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily.\n“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he\nturned to see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is?

A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people\nwere warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the\nother side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning some-\nthing up on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and\nheaded straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; he was not in\nmuch of a mood for talking at the moment.

They had been talking as Harry\npushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw\nhim. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then\nwhether he was being paranoid.\n“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.\n“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in\nthe West Ham colors. “Good holiday?”\n“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would\nhave taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. “You?”\n“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway,\nhe was just telling me.”\n216\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SORTING HAT’S\nNEW SONG\n“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his\nMimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.\nSeamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal\nof ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team\nwas quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry,\n“Me mam didn’t want me to come back.”\n“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.\n“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.”\nSeamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas\nout of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.\n“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus’s\nmother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she\nshould have come over so Dursley-ish.\nSeamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas.\n“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of you.”\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.

He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.\n“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er\n. . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .”\n“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar\nand Dumbledore’s an old fool?”\nSeamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like that.”\nHarry said nothing.

Fred and George sniggered.\n“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said\nFred, thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year,\nyou’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.”\n“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snack-\nbox?” asked Hermione.\n“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George.\n“So?”\n“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keep-\ning your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said\nFred with satisfaction.\n“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said\nGeorge happily. “Tears and tantrums . . .

Moronic though some of\nthis class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in\nyour O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.”\nHis gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.\n“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with\nme,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T.\nPotions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying\ngood-bye.”\nHis eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feel-\ning a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions\nafter fifth year.\n“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of\nfarewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt\nN.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon\nmaintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my\nO.W.L. students.\n“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary\nWizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and\nsoothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the\ningredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irre-\nversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are\ndoing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expres-\nsion one of the utmost attentiveness. “The ingredients and method”\n— Snape flicked his wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they ap-\npeared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his\n232\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nPROFESSOR UMBRIDGE\nwand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cup-\nboard sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half. . . .

The ingredients\nhad to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quan-\ntities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times,\nfirstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of\nthe flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the\nright level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient\nwas added.\n“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called\nSnape, with ten minutes left to go.\nHarry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the"

His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray\nsteam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prod-\nding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as\nthey had gone out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a\nshimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked\ndown his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he\ncould find nothing to criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape\nstopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face.\n“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”\nThe Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they\nloved hearing Snape taunt Harry.\n“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.\n“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”\nDraco Malfoy laughed.\n“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his\nwand.\n“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”\nHarry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the\n233\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\ninstructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the\ndungeon.\n“‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, al-\nlow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of\nhellebore.’”\nHis heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had pro-\nceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his\npotion to simmer for seven minutes.\n“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”\n“No,” said Harry very quietly.\n“I beg your pardon?”\n“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore. . . .”\n“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly\nworthless. Evanesco.”\nThe contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing fool-\nishly beside an empty cauldron.\n“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one\nflagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name,\nand bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework:\ntwelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its\nuses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”\nWhile everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away\nhis things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which\nwas now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had\nachieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was\nnow having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who\nwould be receiving zero marks for the day’s work.

We will be following a carefully structured, theory-\ncentered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.\nCopy down the following, please.”\nShe rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and\nwas replaced by:\n239\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nCourse aims:\n1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.\n2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic\ncan legally be used.\n3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for\npractical use.\nFor a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratch-\ning quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor\nUmbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of\nDefensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”\nThere was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.\n“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I\nask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Um-\nbridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of\nDefensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”\n“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room.\n“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to\npage five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be\nno need to talk.”\nProfessor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the\nchair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy\ntoad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical\nTheory and started to read.\nIt was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns.\nHe felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the\nsame line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few\nwords. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-\nmindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the\nsame spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to\nshake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy\n240\n(cid:145) (cid:145)"

She was staring fixedly at Professor Um-\nbridge with her hand in the air.\nHarry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when\ninstructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book\nthat came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she\nmerely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to\nanswer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who\nwas looking just as resolutely in another direction.\nAfter several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the\nonly one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed\nto read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to\nwatch Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye\nthan to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.”\nWhen more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather\nthan at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she\ncould ignore the situation no longer.\n“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she\nasked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.\n“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.\n“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing\nher small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with\nthem at the end of class.”\n“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.\nProfessor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.\n“And your name is — ?”\n“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.\n“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if\nyou read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice\nof determined sweetness.\n“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written\nup there about using defensive spells.”\n241\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nThere was a short silence in which many members of the class\nturned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on\nthe blackboard.\n“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little\nlaugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom\nthat would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You\nsurely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”\n“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.\n“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class,\nMr. — ?”\n“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.\nProfessor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on\nhim. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Pro-\nfessor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before\nshe addressed Hermione.\n“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”\n“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against\nthe Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”\n“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?”\nasked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.\n“No, but —”\n“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the"

As I was saying — you have been introduced\nto spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and\npotentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are\nlikely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”\n“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —”\n“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!”\nHermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from\nher.\n“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed il-\nlegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”\n“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas\nhotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads —”\n“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge.\n“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will\nbe more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which,\nafter all, is what school is all about. And your name is?” she added,\nstaring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.\n243\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against\nthe Dark Arts O.W.L.?

Professor Umbridge, however, did not\nflinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on\nher face.\n“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”\nThe classroom was silent and still.

They\nstared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her\neyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.\n“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly.\n“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had\n245\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nhardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening\nclassmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”\nProfessor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he\nthought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest,\nmost sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”\nHe kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and\nup to the teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its\nbreath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.\nProfessor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of\nher handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bot-\ntle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could\nnot see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she\nrolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself\nseamlessly so that he could not open it.\n“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Um-\nbridge, holding out the note to him.\nHe took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not\neven looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the class-\nroom door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor,\nthe note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a cor-\nner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man\nfloating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells.\n“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the\ninkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the\nwalls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.\n“Get out of it, Peeves.”\n“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry\nalong the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it\nthis time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions?

Her eyes zoomed from side to side\nbehind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written,\nand with each line they became narrower.\n“Come in here, Potter.”\nHe followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically\nbehind him.\n“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this\ntrue?”\n“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had\nintended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite.\n“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n“You called her a liar?”\n“Yes.”\n247\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”\n“Yes.”\nProfessor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry.\nThen she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.”\n“Have — what?”\n“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of\ncookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit\ndown.”\nThere had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be\ncaned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to\nthe Gryffindor Quidditch team.

I’m a really\nslow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be\nable to make lots more.”\n“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And\nyou’re covering them up with rubbish first?”\n“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back.\n“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to trick them into\npicking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not\nwant to be free.”\n“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though\nher face was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!”\nShe left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to\nthe girls’ dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.\n“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly.\n“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written\nthe title of Snape’s essay. “There’s no point trying to finish this now, I\ncan’t do it without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re sup-\nposed to do with moonstones, have you?”\n255\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nHarry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his\nright temple was getting worse.

Harry had a fleeting impression that\nSeamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the\nsoothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure\nany more provocation.\nThe following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous\none. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.\n“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly.\nHermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She\nlooked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her\nwhat she had to be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have\ngone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.”\n“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They might not\ncount as clothes.

Profes-\nsor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen\nminutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of\nO.W.L.s.\n“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeak-\nily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top\nof his desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for\nmany years to come!

I see no reason why\neverybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration\nas long as they put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbeliev-\ning noise. “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall.\n“There’s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So\n. . . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Con-\njuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T.\nlevel, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be\ntested on in your O.W.L.”\nShe was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly dif-\nficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed\nto vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said\nhopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the\nother hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earn-\ning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall.\nShe was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told\nto practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails\nthe following afternoon.\nNow panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had\nto do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up\nthe uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s slur\non her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them.

Professor\nGrubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Ha-\ngrid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many\ntwigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter\nsounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding to-\nward them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had\nclearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle,\nPansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they\ngathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of them\nkept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke\nwithout too much difficulty.\n“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the\nSlytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. “Let’s crack on then — who\ncan tell me what these things are called?”\nShe indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione’s hand\nshot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imita-\ntion of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question.\nPansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once\ninto a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed\nthemselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of\nwood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at\nthe end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair\nof beetle-brown eyes glittered.\n“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry:\nAnyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impres-\nsive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but\nthe salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the\nBlast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.\n“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-\nPlank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice\n258\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDETENTION WITH\nDOLORES\namong the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.\n“So — anyone know the names of these creatures?

Anybody know what they eat?”\n“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained why what\nHarry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. “But fairy eggs\nif they can get them.”\n“Good girl, take another five points.

Harry deliberately\ncircled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor\nGrubbly-Plank.\n“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing\nbowtruckles.\n“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively,\nwhich had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for\na class too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned\nacross Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle.\n“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could\nhear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.”\n“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of\nhis mouth.\n259\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you\nget my drift.”\nMalfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who sud-\ndenly felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death\nEater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that\nhad not yet reached the Order’s ears? He hurried back around the\ntable to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some\ndistance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still\nlong enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill,\ncrouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Mal-\nfoy had just said.\n“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,”\nsaid Hermione at once. “It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look\nworried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got\nto ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just\nso I can draw its face. . . .”\n“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them,\n“Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you\nknow, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to\ncrack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that over-\ngrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing\nstraight away.”\n“OUCH!”\nHarry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost\nsnapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its\nsharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there.

Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they\ntraipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to\nmake up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.\n“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said\nHarry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. “And don’t say\nthat Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly.\n“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly.\n“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully\naware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical\nCreatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.\nThe door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years\nspilled out of it, including Ginny.\n“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed.

Many of his classmates\nturned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said,\nwithout so much as a preliminary hello: “I believe He-Who-Must-\nNot-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped\nfrom him.”\n“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what\nlooked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati\nand Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and\npointing at her earlobes.\n261\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the\nimpression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had\nsaid rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there\nwere no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-\nHorned Snorkack!”\n“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently.\n“There weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the\nCrumple-Horned Snorkack.”\nLuna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swing-\ning madly.

At the same time, the\nwords had appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his\nskin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the\nshining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had\nbeen slightly redder than before but quite smooth.\nHarry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her\nwide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.\n“Yes?”\n“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.\nHe looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once\nmore, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of\nhis hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his\nskin, once again they healed over seconds later.\nAnd on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the\nparchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own\nblood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his\nhand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to\nparchment.\nDarkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when\nhe would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He\nknew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not go-\ning to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open\nhis own hand with this quill. . . .\n“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.\nHe stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked\ndown at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was\nred raw.\n“Hand,” she said.\nHe extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder\nas she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore\na number of ugly old rings.\n267\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,”\nshe said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow\nevening, won’t we?

He skipped breakfast\nnext morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Div-\nination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron\nkeeping him company.\n“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, as Ron stared\nwildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been\nfast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered some-\nthing about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and\nscrawled a few words.\n“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, “I’ve said I\ndreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything\nweird out of that, can she?”\nThey hurried off to North Tower together.\n“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make\nyou do?”\nHarry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, “Lines.”\n“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron.\n“Nope,” said Harry.\n“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?”\n“No,” said Harry.\nRon groaned sympathetically.\nIt was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Trans-\n268\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDETENTION WITH\nDOLORES\nfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all.

To cap it all,\nAngelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning\nthat he would not be able to attend Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him\nshe was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected play-\ners who wished to remain on the team to put training before their\nother commitments.\n“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away.\n“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or play-\ning Quidditch?”\n“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank\nback onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie,\nwhich he no longer fancied very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful\npunishment, really. . . .”\nHarry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded.

The skin on\nthe back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and\ninflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for\nlong. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge\nwould, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, how-\never, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his\ndismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but “Good evening”\nand “Good night.”\nHis homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when\nhe returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though ex-\nhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape’s moon-\nstone essay. It was half-past two by the time he had finished it. He\nknew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he\nhad something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next.\nHe then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall\nhad set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of\nbowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed,\nwhere he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep\nimmediately.\nThursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too,\nthough Harry could not see why he should be. Harry’s third detention\npassed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two\nhours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of\nHarry’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood.\nThe pause in the pointed quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge\nlook up.\n“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand\nherself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it?\nYou may leave for tonight.”\n270\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDETENTION WITH\nDOLORES\n“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up\nhis schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right.\n“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes,\nI think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s\nwork.”"

Though\nHarry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered\nthe Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he\nturned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as\nthe mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of\nyet another detention with Umbridge.\nTwo things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it\nwas almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final\ndetention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the\nQuidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to\nsee something of Ron’s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it\nwas true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his\npresent darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at\nHogwarts.\nAt five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s\noffice door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was\ntold to enter and did so.

At the same time, he had a most pe-\nculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.\nHe wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at\nher. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.\n“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly.\nHe did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast.

Sealing the parchment carefully he\nclimbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.\n“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick,\ndrifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked\ndown the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next\nperson to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.”\n“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?”\nasked Harry.\n“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored\nvoice. “Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point. I’m off to try\nand find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it.\n. . . See you, Harry. . . .”\n“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left,\ntaking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he\nwalked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had\ntraining later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last —\nSomething brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the care-\ntaker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned\nlamplike yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing be-\nhind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.\n“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after her. She had\nthe unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet\nHarry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the\nOwlery on a Saturday morning.\nThe sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the\n281\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nOwlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of\nsunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nes-\ntled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly\njust returned from hunting.

A great, reptilian winged\nhorse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery\nblack wings spread wide like a pterodactyl’s, rose up out of the trees\nlike a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle and then plunged\nonce more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly\nHarry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was\nhammering madly.\nThe Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turn-\ning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.\n282\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nPERCY AND PADFOOT\n“Hi,” said Harry automatically.\n“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think anyone would be\nup here this early. . . .

He wanted\nto say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terri-\nble winged horse was fresh in his mind.\n“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed\nto shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the\nweather. . . .\n“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. “Good Quid-\nditch conditions. I haven’t been out all week, have you?”\n“No,” said Harry.\nCho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down\nonto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach\nthe parcel.\n“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked.\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you know him?”\n“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he any good?”"

Hermione turned to Harry.\n“Was he lousy?”\n“No,” said Harry loyally.\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\n“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but\nit was only the first training session, like you said. . . .”\nNeither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their\nhomework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with\nhow badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself\nwas having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out\nof his head.\nThey spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in\n294\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nPERCY AND PADFOOT\ntheir books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It\nwas another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent\nthe day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the\nlast sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody\nhad been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.\n“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done\nduring the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside\nProfessor McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell\nand turned miserably to Professor Sinistra’s equally long and difficult\nessay about Jupiter’s moons."

At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them,\nyawning.\n“Nearly done?”\n“No,” said Ron shortly.\n“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said,\npointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s\nIo that’s got the volcanos.”\n“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.\n“Sorry, I only —”\n“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —”\n“Ron —”\n“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m\nup to my neck in it here —”\n295\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n“No — look!”\nHermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron\nboth looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the win-\ndowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.\n“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed.\n“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and get-\nting to his feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?”\nHe crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside,\nlanded upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was at-\ntached. Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky\nfootprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.\n“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into\nhis chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To\nRonald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other\ntwo. “What d’you reckon?”\n“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.\nRon unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the\nparchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl.\nWhen he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the let-\nter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it\ntogether:\nDear Ron,\nI have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister\nof Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor\nUmbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.\nI was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and\nmust firstly offer my congratulations.

Hopefully you will\nbe able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward\nquestions.\nFrom something the Minister let slip when telling me you are\nnow a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Pot-\nter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of\nlosing your badge more than continued fraternization with that\nboy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you\nwill say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but\nI feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at\nHogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very dif-\nferent — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behav-\nior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet\ntomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blow-\ning — and see if you can spot yours truly!\nSeriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same\nbrush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future\nprospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you\nmust be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Pot-\nter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole\nWizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He\ngot off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the peo-\nple I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.\nIt may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I\nknow that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent —\nbut if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything\nelse in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak\nto Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know\nwill be only too happy to advise you.\nThis leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted\n297\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nabove, Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your\nloyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Min-\nistry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is en-\ncountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make\nthose necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ar-\ndently desires (although she should find this easier from next\nweek — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this\n— a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Um-\nbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple\nof years!\nI am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the sum-"

Ha!”\nHarry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what\ngrade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as\nquickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information\nprivate.\nDetermined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson,\nHarry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard\nat least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution\nwas not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione’s but it was at\nleast blue rather than pink, like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it\nto Snape’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defi-\nance and relief.\n“Well, that wasn’t as bad as last week, was it?” said Hermione, as\nthey climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across\n309\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nthe entrance hall toward lunch. “And the homework didn’t go too\nbadly either, did it?”\nWhen neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, “I mean,\nall right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L.\nstandard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you\nsay?”\nHarry made a noncommittal noise in his throat.\n“Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we’ve got\nplenty of time to improve, but the grades we’re getting now are a sort\nof baseline, aren’t they? Something we can build on . . .”\nThey sat down together at the Gryffindor table.\n“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O —”\n“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know what grades\nwe got, ask.”\n“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me —”\n“I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. “Happy?”\n“Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said Fred, who had just ar-\nrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on\nHarry’s right. “Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.”\n“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for . . .”\n“‘Poor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, isn’t it?\n‘Dreadful’?”\nHarry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over\nhis roll.

He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione\nthat he had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved\nto work harder from now on.\n“You lot had an inspected lesson yet?” Fred asked them.\n“No,” said Hermione at once, “have you?”\n“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.”\n“What was it like?” Harry and Hermione asked together.\nFred shrugged.\n“Not that bad.

She then sat down, took her\nclipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting\nfor the class to begin.\nProfessor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly\ntrembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnify-\ning lenses. “We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams to-\nday,” she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her\nvoice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each\nother’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.”\nShe made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-\nbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Par-\nvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s\nmost recent dream.\nHarry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge\ncovertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now.

After a slight pause in which she\nseemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could\nreasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, “Nearly six-\nteen years.”\n“Quite a period,” said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her\nclipboard. “So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?”\n“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly.\n313\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nProfessor Umbridge made another note.\n“And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer\nCassandra Trelawney?”\n“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.\nAnother note on the clipboard.\n“But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the\nfirst in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?”\n“These things often skip — er — three generations,” said Professor\nTrelawney.\nProfessor Umbridge’s toadlike smile widened.\n“Of course,” she said sweetly, making yet another note. “Well, if\nyou could just predict something for me, then?”\nShe looked up inquiringly, still smiling.

But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively.”\n“Oh, you do, do you?” said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to\nwhisper and straightening up. “Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard’s\nopinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss\nGranger.”\n“But —” Hermione began.\n“That is enough,” said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the\nfront of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had\nshown at the beginning of the lesson gone. “Miss Granger, I am going\nto take five points from Gryffindor House.”\nThere was an outbreak of muttering at this.\n“What for?” said Harry angrily.\n“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered urgently to him.\n“For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,” said Profes-\nsor Umbridge smoothly. “I am here to teach you using a Ministry-\napproved method that does not include inviting students to give their\nopinions on matters about which they understand very little.

Most people\nwere able to answer well and Harry’s spirits lifted somewhat; at least\nthe class was not letting Hagrid down.\n“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-\nPlank’s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do\nyou, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose\n322\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE HOGWARTS\nHIGH INQUISITOR\nyou might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive\nenough support from the school management?”\n“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank\nheartily. “No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy\nindeed.”\nLooking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her\nclipboard and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this\nclass this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not\nreturn?”\n“Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up\nin O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Not much left to do —\nthey’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and\nkneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .”\n“Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Pro-\nfessor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry\ndid not like the emphasis she put on “you” and liked it even less when\nshe put her next question to Goyle: “Now, I hear there have been in-\njuries in this class?”\nGoyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question.\n“That was me,” he said. “I was slashed by a hippogriff.”\n“A hippogriff?” said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.\n“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him\nto do,” said Harry angrily.\nBoth Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her\nhead slowly in Harry’s direction.\n“Another night’s detention, I think,” she said softly. “Well, thank\nyou very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that’s all I need\nhere. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten\ndays.”\n“Jolly good,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-\nbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.\n323\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n(cid:145) (cid:145) (cid:145)\nIt was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge’s office that night,\nhis hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had\nwrapped around it.

Crookshanks curled around his\nlegs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down.\n“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks’s ears\nwith his left hand.\n“I still reckon you should complain about this,” said Ron in a low\nvoice.\n“No,” said Harry flatly.\n“McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —”\n“Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry. “And how long d’you\nreckon it’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who\ncomplains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?”\nRon opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a\nmoment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.\n“She’s an awful woman,” said Hermione in a small voice. “Awful.\nYou know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we’ve got to\ndo something about her.”\n“I suggested poison,” said Ron grimly.\n“No . . .

A light night breeze rattled the win-\ndowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered.\n“About me what?” said Harry.\n“I’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.”\nHarry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the\nexasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated\non far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry’s consternation, how-\never, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, appar-\nently thinking. Then he said, “That’s an idea.”\n“What’s an idea?” said Harry.\n“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.”\n“But . . .”\nHarry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.\n“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —”\n“Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark\nArts,” said Hermione.\n“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m\nnot, you’ve beaten me in every test —”\n“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our\nthird year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who\nactually knew the subject.

Still breathing hard,\nhe sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand\nwas throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the\nbowl of murtlap essence.\n“Well . . . think about it,” said Hermione quietly. “Please?”\nHarry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed\nof his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was\nagreeing to.\nHermione stood up.\n“Well, I’m off to bed,” she said in a voice that was clearly as natural\nas she could make it. “Erm . . . ’night.”\nRon had gotten to his feet too.\n“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry.\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “In . . . in a minute.

How would it be if we\ntell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk\nit over?”\n“Why do we have to do it outside school?” said Ron.\n“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese\nChomping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think Umbridge would\nbe very happy if she found out what we were up to.”\nHarry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogs-\nmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained\na stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of\n332\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nIN THE HOG’S HEAD\nSeptember; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they\ndid not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time\nthat Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway.\nWhat were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up\nthe street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of\nDraco Malfoy?\n“Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about,” said\nRon, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. “I\nmean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know\nthat can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And\nnow he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.”\nHermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on\nKreacher.\n“The trouble is,” she said to Harry, “until V-Voldemort — oh for\nheaven’s sake, Ron — comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have\nto stay hidden, isn’t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn’t going to re-\nalize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore’s been\ntelling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catch-\ning real Death Eaters again it’ll be obvious Sirius isn’t one . . . I mean,\nhe hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.”\n“I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron brac-\ningly. “Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumble-\ndore even if he doesn’t like what he hears.”\nWhen Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, “Listen,\nRon and I have been sounding out people who we thought might\nwant to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there\nare a couple who seem interested. We’ve told them to meet us in\nHogsmeade.”\n“Right,” said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\n“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione said quietly. “You’ve got enough\non your plate without Sirius too.”\nShe was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his\n333\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nhomework, though he was doing much better now that he was no"

Ron was\neven further behind with his work than Harry, because while they\nboth had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect du-\nties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of\nthem, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding\ntime to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting\nbetter; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the\nhats and the socks.\nThe morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Af-\nter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their\nnames to the long list of students who had permission from their par-\nents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry re-\nmembered that if it hadn’t been for Sirius, he would not have been\ngoing at all.\nWhen Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as\nthough trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he\ngave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on,\nout onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\n“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and\nHermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\n“I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,” said\nHarry with a small laugh. “I forgot to tell you . . .”\nAnd he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch\nbursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight sur-\nprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, in-\ndeed, than he did himself.\n“He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But\nwho had tipped him off?”\n“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging. “Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was\na laugh.”\nThey walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged\n334\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nIN THE HOG’S HEAD\nboars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whip-\nping their hair into their eyes.\n“Malfoy?” said Hermione, very skeptically. “Well . . . yes . . .\nmaybe . . .”\nAnd she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of\nHogsmeade.\n“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked. “The Three Broom-\nsticks?”\n“Oh — no,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “no, it’s al-\nways packed and really noisy.

A battered wooden\nsign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of\na wild boar’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around\nit. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them\nhesitated outside the door.\n“Well, come on,” said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the\nway inside.\nIt was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an\nimpression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog’s Head bar\ncomprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly\nof something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so\nencrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the\nroom, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough\nwooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as\nHarry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what\nseemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.\n335\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nHarry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year:\n“Yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head,” he had said, explaining\nhow he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there. At the\ntime Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the\nstranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw\nthat keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog’s\nHead. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in\ndirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless\nglasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth.\nTwo figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows;\nHarry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talk-\ning in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace\nsat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just\nsee the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.\n“I don’t know about this, Hermione,” Harry muttered, as they\ncrossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled\nwitch. “Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?”\nHermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.\n“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said quietly. “And\nanyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can\ndo to stop us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the\nschool rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor\nFlitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head,\nand he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses.\nAnd I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and\nhomework groups and they’re definitely allowed.

He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.\n336\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nIN THE HOG’S HEAD\n“What?” he grunted.\n“Three butterbeers, please,” said Hermione.\nThe man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very\ndusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.\n“Six Sickles,” he said.\n“I’ll get them,” said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The bar-\nman’s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his\nscar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry’s money in an ancient\nwooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry,\nRon, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and\nsat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages\nrapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking\ndrink from the barman.\n“You know what?” Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with\nenthusiasm. “We could order anything we liked in here, I bet that\nbloke would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to\ntry firewhisky —”\n“You — are — a — prefect,” snarled Hermione.\n“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah . . .”\n“So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked,\nwrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig.\n“Just a couple of people,” Hermione repeated, checking her watch\nand then looking anxiously toward the door. “I told them to be here\nabout now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this\nmight be them now —”\nThe door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight\nsplit the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the\nincoming rush of a crowd of people.\nFirst came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely fol-\nlowed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back\nflip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own\nand looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident)\n337\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nLuna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina John-\nson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-\nFletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait\ndown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw\nboys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Cor-\nner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with\nan upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member\nof the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and"

Possibly he had\nnever seen his pub so full.\n“Hi,” said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions\nquickly. “Could we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?”\nThe barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down\nhis rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very\nimportant, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the\nbar.\n“Cheers,” said Fred, handing them out. “Cough up, everyone, I\nhaven’t got enough gold for all of these. . . .”\nHarry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their\nbeers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could\nnot imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible\nthought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of\nspeech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\n“What have you been telling people?” he said in a low voice. “What\nare they expecting?”\n338\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nIN THE HOG’S HEAD\n“I’ve told you, they just want to hear what you’ve got to say,” said\nHermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously\nthat she added quickly, “You don’t have to do anything yet, I’ll speak\nto them first.”\n“Hi, Harry,” said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite\nHarry.\nHarry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was excep-\ntionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron’s right.\nHer friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but\ngave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that,\ngiven her way, she would not be here at all.\nIn twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and\nHermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Love-\ngood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a\nchair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\n“Er,” said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of\nnerves. “Well — er — hi.”\nThe group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes con-\ntinued to dart back regularly to Harry.\n“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here.

Cho’s friend shrieked\nand slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of invol-\nuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp\nthat he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked\nfixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\n“Well . . . that’s the plan anyway,” said Hermione. “If you want to\njoin us, we need to decide how we’re going to —”\n“Where’s the proof You-Know-Who’s back?” said the blond Huffle-\npuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\n“Well, Dumbledore believes it —” Hermione began.\n“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond boy, nod-\nding at Harry.\n“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely.\n“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to\nknow exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who’s back.”\n“Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what\nthis meeting was supposed to be about —”\n“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry.\nIt had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there.\nHe felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these\npeople — maybe even most of them — had turned up in the hope of\nhearing Harry’s story firsthand.\n“What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking\nZacharias straight in the face. “I saw him.

His temper, always so\nclose to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his\neyes from Zacharias Smith’s aggressive face, determined not to look at\nCho. “I don’t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that’s\nwhat you’re here for, you might as well clear out.”\nHe cast an angry look in Hermione’s direction. This was, he felt, all\nher fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of\ncourse they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . .\nBut none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he\ncontinued to gaze intently at Harry.\n“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . .\nlike I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need\nto work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet,\nand where we’re going to —”\n“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back,\nlooking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”\nThere was a murmur of interest around the group at this.\n“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.\n“A corporeal Patronus?”\n341\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nThe phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.\n“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.\nThe girl smiled.\n“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about\nyour hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew\nthat!”\n“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at\nHarry. “She said you got enough attention as it was.”\n“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people\nlaughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.\n“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s of-\nfice?” demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the\nwall told me when I was in there last year. . . .”\n“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.\nJustin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged\nawestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said “wow” softly. Harry was\nfeeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly look-\ning anywhere but at Cho.\n“And in our first year,” said Neville to the group at large, “he saved\nthat Sorcerous Stone —”\n“Sorcerer’s,” hissed Hermione."

For all that Hermione had said about study\nand homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this\none might be considered a lot more rebellious.\n“Right, well, we’ll try to find somewhere,” said Hermione. “We’ll\nsend a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place\nfor the first meeting.”\nShe rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill,\nthen hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say\nsomething.\n“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we\nknow who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that\nwe all ought to agree not to shout about what we’re doing.

He bounded forward, pulled open\nthe door, and set off up the spiral staircase.\nHe was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wail-\ning, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long,\nsmooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep\nrunning, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over\nbackward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on\nhis back at Harry’s feet.\n“Er — I don’t think we’re allowed in the girls’ dormitories,” said\nHarry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.\nTwo fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.\n“Oooh, who tried to get upstairs?” they giggled happily, leaping to\ntheir feet and ogling Harry and Ron.\n“Me,” said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. “I didn’t realize\nthat would happen. It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls\nheaded off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. “Hermione’s al-\nlowed in our dormitory, how come we’re not allowed — ?”\n“Well, it’s an old-fashioned rule,” said Hermione, who had just slid\nneatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet,\n“but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys\nwere less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get\nin there?”\n“To see you — look at this!” said Ron, dragging her over to the no-\ntice board.\nHermione’s eyes slid rapidly down the notice.

He glanced around to make sure\nthere were no teachers near them.\n“We’re going to do it anyway, of course,” he said quietly.\n“Knew you’d say that,” said George, beaming and thumping Harry\non the arm.\n“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and\nHermione.\n“Of course,” said Hermione coolly.\n“Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron, looking over\nhis shoulder. “And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one\nlooks very spotty.”\nHermione looked alarmed.\n“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look\n354\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nEDUCATIONAL DECREE\nNUMBER TWENTY-FOUR\nreally suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah,\ngesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. “Later!\nWe’ll — talk — to — you — later!”\n“I’ll tell Michael,” said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her\nbench. “The fool, honestly . . .”\nShe hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go.\nCho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she\nhad brought along to the Hog’s Head.

Harry looked around. Hedwig was\nperched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass\nat him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had\njust had breakfast, why on earth hadn’t she delivered the letter then, as\nusual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other\ntoo.\n“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” Harry heard\nLavender sigh to Parvati.\nHe glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his\nnotes, serenely unaware that the class’s attention was even less focused\nupon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched\ndown, and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the\ncatch and opened it very slowly.\nHe had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could re-\nmove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the\nwindow was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully.\nHe closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns,\ncrouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his\nshoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap, and\nmade to remove the letter tied to her leg.\nIt was only then that he realized that Hedwig’s feathers were oddly\nruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of\nher wings at an odd angle.\n“She’s hurt!” Harry whispered, bending his head low over her.\nHermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her\nquill. “Look — there’s something wrong with her wing —”\nHedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she\n356\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nEDUCATIONAL DECREE\nNUMBER TWENTY-FOUR\ngave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating\nherself, and gazed at him reproachfully.\n“Professor Binns,” said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class\nturned to look at him. “I’m not feeling well.”\nProfessor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as\nalways, to find the room in front of him full of people.\n“Not feeling well?” he repeated hazily.\n“Not at all well,” said Harry firmly, getting to his feet while con-\ncealing Hedwig behind his back. “So I think I’ll need to go to the hos-\npital wing.”\n“Yes,” said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. “Yes\n. . . yes, hospital wing . . . well, off you go, then, Perkins . . .”\nOnce outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and"

His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig\nwould have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where\nHagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-\nPlank and hope she would help.\nHe peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There\nwas no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid’s cabin; if she was not teach-\ning, she was probably in the staffroom. He set off downstairs, Hedwig\nhooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.\nTwo stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As Harry ap-\nproached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.”\n“This is urgent,” said Harry curtly.\n“Ooooh, urgent, is it?” said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched\nvoice. “Well, that’s put us in our place, hasn’t it?”\nHarry knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door opened and\nhe found himself face-to-face with Professor McGonagall.\n“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said at once, her\nsquare spectacles flashing alarmingly.\n“No, Professor!” said Harry hastily.\n357\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n“Well then, why are you out of class?”\n“It’s urgent, apparently,” said the second gargoyle snidely.\n“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry explained. “It’s\nmy owl, she’s injured.”\n“Injured owl, did you say?”\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall’s\nshoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet.\n“Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, “she\nturned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look —”\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth\nand took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.\n“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly\nas she talked. “Looks like something’s attacked her. Can’t think what\nwould have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for\nbirds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained\nnot to touch owls . . .”\nHarry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted\nto know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall,\nhowever, looked sharply at Harry and said, “Do you know how far\nthis owl’s traveled, Potter?”\n“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.”\nHe met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood “London” to\nmean “number twelve, Grimmauld Place” by the way her eyebrows\nhad joined in the middle.\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her\nrobes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I"

Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then\ndisappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at\nHarry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this.\nFeeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall\ncalled him back.\n“Potter!”\n“Yes, Professor?”\nShe glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming\nfrom both directions.\n“Bear in mind,” she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll\nin his hand, “that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts\nmay be being watched, won’t you?”\n“I —” said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corri-\ndor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod\nand retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into\nthe courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and Hermione al-\nready standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up\nagainst the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them\nand found five words in Sirius’s handwriting:\nToday, same time, same place.\n“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was\nwithin earshot.\n“Where did you take her?” asked Ron.\n“To Grubbly-Plank,” said Harry. “And I met McGonagall. . . .\nListen. . . .”\nAnd he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his\n359\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nsurprise, neither of the others looked shocked; on the contrary, they\nexchanged significant looks.\n“What?” said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back\nagain.\n“Well, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to in-\ntercept Hedwig? I mean, she’s never been hurt on a flight before, has\nshe?”\n“Who’s the letter from anyway?” asked Ron, taking the note from\nHarry.\n“Snuffles,” said Harry quietly.\n“‘Same time, same place’? Does he mean the fire in the common\nroom?”\n“Obviously,” said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked un-\neasy. “I just hope nobody else has read this. . . .”\n“But it was still sealed and everything,” said Harry, trying to con-\nvince himself as much as her. “And nobody would understand what it"

I think\nthe Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.”\nSnape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.\n“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she\nasked, her quill poised over her clipboard.\n“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable.\nHis eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed\nmenacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.\n“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I\nbelieve?” Professor Umbridge asked Snape.\n“Yes,” said Snape quietly.\n“But you were unsuccessful?”\nSnape’s lip curled.\n“Obviously.”\n363\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nProfessor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.\n“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark\nArts post since you first joined the school, I believe?”\n“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very\nangry.\n“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused\nto appoint you?” asked Umbridge.\n“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily.\n“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.\n“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.\n“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a\nthorough understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds. . . .”\nShe turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began ques-\ntioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their\neyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion,\nwhich was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of\nburned rubber.\n“No marks again, then, Potter,” said Snape maliciously, emptying\nHarry’s cauldron with a wave of his wand. “You will write me an essay\non the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why\nyou went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?”\n“Yes,” said Harry furiously.

Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Or-\nacle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her\nlips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and\nDean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into\nNeville’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf.\n“Well, carry on!” said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high\npitched and somewhat hysterical. “You know what to do! Or am I such\na substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?”\nThe class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other. Harry,\nhowever, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor\nTrelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher’s chair, her mag-\nnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron’s and\nmuttered, “I think she’s got the results of her inspection back.”\n“Professor?” said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender\nhad always rather admired Professor Trelawney). “Professor, is there\nanything — er — wrong?”\n“Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emo-\ntion. “Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly. . . . Insinuations\n365\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nhave been made against me. . . . Unfounded accusations levelled . . .\nbut no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not. . . .”\nShe took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati,\nangry tears spilling from under her glasses.\n“I say nothing,” she choked, “of sixteen years’ devoted service. . . .\nIt has passed, apparently, unnoticed. . . . But I shall not be insulted,\nno, I shall not!”\n“But Professor, who’s insulting you?” asked Parvati timidly."

Of course, we Seers have always\nbeen feared, always persecuted. . . . It is — alas — our fate. . . .”\nShe gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl,\nand then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve,\ninto which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blow-\ning a raspberry.

Lavender shot him a disgusted look.\n“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you mean . . . is it something Profes-\nsor Umbridge . . . ?”\n“Do not speak to me about that woman!” cried Professor\nTrelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles\nflashing. “Kindly continue with your work!”\nAnd she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still\nleaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats\nunder her breath.\n“. . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on proba-\ntion . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . .”\n“You and Umbridge have got something in common,” Harry told\nHermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark\nArts. “She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too. . . .

There was also an in-\ncredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared fi-\nnally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were\ntaking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.\nFirst, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at\nwhich he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in\nfront of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew,\nat which the vomiting would immediately cease.

Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and\nsound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George’s bucket were\npunctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if any-\nthing, more distracting.\n“Just go and stop them, then!” he said irritably, after crossing out\nthe wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.\n“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” said Her-\nmione through gritted teeth. “They’re quite within their rights to eat\nthe foul things themselves, and I can’t find a rule that says the other\nidiots aren’t entitled to buy them, not unless they’re proven to be dan-\ngerous in some way, and it doesn’t look as though they are. . . .”\nShe, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the\nbucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming\nwith his arms wide to protracted applause.\n“You know, I don’t get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s\neach,” said Harry, watching as Fred, George, and Lee collected gold\nfrom the eager crowd. “They really know their stuff. . . .”\n368\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nEDUCATIONAL DECREE\nNUMBER TWENTY-FOUR\n“Oh, they only know flashy stuff that’s no real use to anyone,” said\nHermione disparagingly.\n“No real use?” said Ron in a strained voice. “Hermione, they’ve got\nabout twenty-six Galleons already. . . .”\nIt was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed,"

At long\nlast, Fred closed the doorway to the boys’ dormitories behind him,\nrattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled.\nHarry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, de-\ncided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who\nwas dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke,\nlooked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!”\nHarry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the\nfire again.\n“Hi,” he said, grinning.\n“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling\ndown upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and ap-\nproached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to\nSirius’s.\n“How’re things?” said Sirius.\n“Not that good,” said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks\nback to stop him singeing his whiskers. “The Ministry’s forced\nthrough another decree, which means we’re not allowed to have Quid-\nditch teams —”\n“— or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?” said Sirius.\nThere was a short pause.\n“How did you know about that?” Harry demanded.\n“You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,” said Sir-\nius, grinning still more broadly. “The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . .”\n369\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n“Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!” said Hermione\ndefensively. “That’s always packed with people —”\n“— which means you’d have been harder to overhear,” said Sirius.\n“You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.”\n“Who overheard us?” Harry demanded.\n“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they all looked\npuzzled he laughed. “He was the witch under the veil.”\n“That was Mundungus?” Harry said, stunned. “What was he doing\nin the Hog’s Head?”\n“What do you think he was doing?” said Sirius impatiently. “Keep-\ning an eye on you, of course.”\n“I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily.\n“Yeah, you are,” said Sirius, “and just as well, isn’t it, if the first\nthing you’re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal de-\nfense group.”\nBut he looked neither angry nor worried; on the contrary, he was\nlooking at Harry with distinct pride.\n“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, sounding disap-\npointed. “We’d’ve liked to’ve seen him.”\n“He was banned from the Hog’s Head twenty years ago,” said Sirius,\n“and that barman’s got a long memory.

He had no\nidea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was hav-\ning enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were\npracticing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he\nhad to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it.

The wind was\n379\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\npicking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pound-\ning sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake.\nAngelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding de-\nfeat. She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing\nrooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though\nwithout any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were look-\ning particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with\nevery movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as\nhe toweled his hair dry.\n“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a hollow voice.\n“Mine haven’t,” said George, wincing. “They’re throbbing like mad\n. . . feel bigger if anything . . .”\n“OUCH!” said Harry.\nHe pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain."

What he had not expected was for Dobby to\ngive a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together.\n“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily. “Dobby\nheard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts,\nsir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the\nRoom of Requirement!”\n“Why?” said Harry curiously.\n“Because it is a room that a person can only enter,” said Dobby se-\nriously, “when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and\nsometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the\n386\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUMBLEDORE’S ARMY\nseeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his voice\nand looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden\nher in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to\nbutterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she\nsleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra\ncleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and —”\n“— and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly re-\nmembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the pre-\nvious Christmas, “would it fill itself with chamber pots?”\n“Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding earnestly. “It is a\nmost amazing room, sir.”\n“How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting up straighter\nin his chair.\n“Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it,\nsir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is\nalways there waiting to be called into service, sir.”\n“It sounds brilliant,” said Harry, his heart racing. “It sounds per-\nfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?”\n“Anytime, Harry Potter, sir,” said Dobby, looking delighted at\nHarry’s enthusiasm. “We could go now, if you like!”\nFor a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out\nof his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when,\nnot for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione’s whispered in\nhis ear: reckless.

Harry reached out, seized the brass handle,\npulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with\nflickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors\nbelow.\nThe walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs\nthere were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far\nend of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes,\nSecrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure\nhad hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody’s office.\n“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” said Ron\nenthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.\n“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a\nfinger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. “A Com-\npendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark\nArts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .” She looked\naround at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of\nhundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they\nwere doing was right. “Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we\nneed here!”\nAnd without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf,\nsank onto the nearest cushion, and began to read.\nThere was a gentle knock on the door.

I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expel-\nliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it’s pretty basic but\nI’ve found it really useful —”\n“Oh please,” said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his\narms. “I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against\nYou-Know-Who, do you?”\n“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last\nJune.”\nSmith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very\nquiet.\n“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.\nSmith did not move. Nor did anybody else.\n“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all\nthose eyes upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and\npractice.”\nIt felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as\n392\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUMBLEDORE’S ARMY\nseeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided\nup. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.\n“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — on the\ncount of three, then — one, two, three —”\nThe room was suddenly full of shouts of “Expelliarmus!”: Wands\nflew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them\nflying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went\nspinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and\nlanded with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry re-\ntrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he\nhad been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was\na lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding\nin disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump\nbackward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over\nthem.\n“Expelliarmus!” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his\nwand fly out of his hand.\n“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I\nDID IT!”\n“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out\nthat in a real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be star-\ning in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side."

Something very odd\nwas happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth\nto disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his\nhand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not\nhave to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and\nGeorge were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point\ntheir wands at his back.\n393\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye.\n“Couldn’t resist . . .”\nHarry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who\nwere doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner;\nshe was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or un-\nwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnec-\nessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey\nbrothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all\nthe books leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood was\nsimilarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley’s wand\nspinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to\nstand on end.\n“Okay, stop!” Harry shouted. “Stop! STOP!”\nI need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on\ntop of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Every-\none lowered their wands.\n“That wasn’t bad,” said Harry, “but there’s definite room for im-\nprovement.” Zacharias Smith glared at him. “Let’s try again. . . .”\nHe moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to\nmake suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. He\navoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking\ntwice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore\nthem any longer.\n“Oh no,” said Cho rather wildly as he approached. “Expelliarmious!\nI mean, Expellimellius! I — oh, sorry, Marietta!”\nHer curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extin-\nguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his\nfault.\n“You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!” Cho told\nHarry ruefully.\n“That was quite good,” Harry lied, but when she raised her eye-\n394\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nDUMBLEDORE’S ARMY\nbrows he said, “Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it prop-\nerly, I was watching from over there. . . .”\nShe laughed.

He and the D.A. were resisting her under her very nose,\ndoing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared, and when-\never he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard’s book during\nher lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most re-\ncent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed\nHermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx af-\nter three meetings’ hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a\ngood Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the\nSneakoscopes to dust.\nHe was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the\nweek for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate\nQuidditch teams’ practices, which were often rearranged depending on\nthe weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, he had a\nfeeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings\n397\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nunpredictable.

She gave each of the members of\nthe D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the\nbasket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold).\n“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione\nsaid, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meet-\ning.

She looked around at all\nthe faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted.\n“Well — I thought it was a good idea,” she said uncertainly, “I\nmean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s\nnothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you\ndon’t want to use them . . .”\n“You can do a Protean Charm?” said Terry Boot.\n“Yes,” said Hermione.\n“But that’s . . . that’s N.E.W.T. standard, that is,” he said weakly.\n“Oh,” said Hermione, trying to look modest. “Oh . . . well . . . yes,\nI suppose it is. . . .”\n398\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LION AND\nTHE SERPENT\n“How come you’re not in Ravenclaw?” he demanded, staring at\nHermione with something close to wonder. “With brains like yours?”\n“Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Raven-\nclaw during my Sorting,” said Hermione brightly, “but it decided on\nGryffindor in the end. So does that mean we’re using the Galleons?”\nThere was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to\ncollect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione.\n“You know what these remind me of?”\n“No, what’s that?”\n“The Death Eaters’ scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all\ntheir scars burn, and they know they’ve got to join him.”\n“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione quietly. “That is where I got the idea\n. . . but you’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal\nrather than on our members’ skin. . . .”\n“Yeah . . .

The fact that the Quid-\nditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the in-\nterest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game.

Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked\ndirectly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed\nto seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t\nwant to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to\npractice, won’t you?”\nSnape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quid-\nditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had\ndifficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the\nmany reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the\ncorridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with\nher eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision\nand obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have at-\ntempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to\nthe fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the\nSlytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx\nwhile she worked in the library.\nHarry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all,\nnever lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing\nto Wood’s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve.\nHis greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he\nmade a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was\ntherefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron\nmake some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one\nmemorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and\nkicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the\nlength of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The\nrest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made re-\ncently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland’s\ntop Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might\n400\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LION AND\nTHE SERPENT\nyet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously consid-\nering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured\nRon they had been trying to deny for four years.\nThe only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was al-\nlowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even\ngot onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide com-\nments for more than four years, so whispers of, “Hey, Potty, I heard\nWarrington’s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,” far"

When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and consid-\nerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, “Got\nyour bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?” he did not laugh, but\nturned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron\ndropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of\neach other), Ron’s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he\nwas likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.\nOctober extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving\nrain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every\nmorning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies\nand the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the moun-\ntains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in\nthe castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protec-\ntive dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons.\nThe morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry\nawoke he looked around at Ron’s bed and saw him sitting bolt up-\nright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space.\n“You all right?” said Harry.\nRon nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the\n401\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\ntime that Ron had accidentally put a slug-vomiting charm on himself.\nHe looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to men-\ntion as reluctant to open his mouth.\n“You just need some breakfast,” Harry said bracingly. “C’mon.”\nThe Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk\nlouder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the\nSlytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around\nand saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the\nusual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of\nwhat seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of them waved at\nRon, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on\nthe badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past\ntheir table quickly to linger long enough to read them.\nThey received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where\neveryone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron’s spirits\nthe cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the\nnearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal.\n“I must’ve been mental to do this,” he said in a croaky whisper.\n“Mental.”\n“Don’t be thick,” said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals.\n“You’re going to be fine. It’s normal to be nervous.”"

Harry\nlooked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table.\nMany people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and point-\ning; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion’s\nhead, which was perched precariously on her head.\n“I’m supporting Gryffindor,” said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at\nher hat. “Look what it does. . . .”\nShe reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its\nmouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone\nin the vicinity jump.\n“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna happily. “I wanted to have it chewing\nup a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn’t time.\nAnyway . . . good luck, Ronald!”\nShe drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of\nLuna’s hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied\nby Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to\nnormal by Madam Pomfrey.\n“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’re going to go straight down to\nthe pitch, check out conditions and change.”\n“We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assured her. “Ron’s just got to have\nsome breakfast.”\nIt became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capa-\nble of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him\n403\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\ndown to the changing rooms.

It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black trav-\neling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough\nto carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door.\nHagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as\nbroad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle\nover it.\n“What happened to you?” Harry demanded, while Fang danced\naround them all, trying to lick their faces.\n421\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n“Told yeh, nuthin’,” said Hagrid firmly. “Want a cuppa?”\n“Come off it,” said Ron, “you’re in a right state!”\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, I’m fine,” said Hagrid, straightening up and turn-\ning to beam at them all, but wincing. “Blimey, it’s good ter see you\nthree again — had good summers, did yeh?”\n“Hagrid, you’ve been attacked!” said Ron.\n“Fer the las’ time, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid firmly.\n“Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound\nof mince instead of a face?” Ron demanded.\n“You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,” said Hermi-\none anxiously. “Some of those cuts look nasty.”\n“I’m dealin’ with it, all righ’?” said Hagrid repressively.\nHe walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the\nmiddle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying\non it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger\nthan the average car tire.\n“You’re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?” said Ron, leaning\nin for a closer look. “It looks poisonous.”\n“It’s s’posed ter look like that, it’s dragon meat,” Hagrid said. “An’ I\ndidn’ get it ter eat.”\nHe picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face.\nGreenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of\nsatisfaction."

I’m really sorry,” said Hermione in a very small\nvoice.\nHagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. “No need,” he said shortly.\n“Can’ remember her much. Wasn’ a great mother.”\nThey were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and\nRon, plainly wanting them to speak.\n“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,”\nRon said, gesturing toward Hagrid’s bloodstained face.\n“Or why you’re back so late,” said Harry. “Sirius says Madame\nMaxime got back ages ago —”\n“Who attacked you?” said Ron.\n“I haven’ bin attacked!” said Hagrid emphatically. “I —”\nBut the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of\nrapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her\nfingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared\nat the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small\nand squat rippled across the thin curtain.\n“It’s her!” Ron whispered.\n“Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak\nhe whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the\ntable and dived beneath the cloak as well.

She bent and peered under the bed. She\nopened Hagrid’s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry ac-\ntually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully\ninside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled\naround again and said, “What has happened to you? How did you\nsustain those injuries?”\nHagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in\nHarry’s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising\n436\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHAGRID’S TALE\nall around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large\namount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. “Oh, I . . . had a bit\nof an accident,” he said lamely.\n“What sort of accident?”\n“I-I tripped.”\n“You tripped,” she repeated coolly.\n“Yeah, tha’s right.

Then she\nhoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said,\n“I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.”\n“Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding.\n“You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortu-\nnate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers.

Harry made to\npull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.\n“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear. “She might not be gone yet.”\nHagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the\nroom and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.\n“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he said in a low voice. “Blimey . . .\ninspectin’ people, is she?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off. “Trelawney’s on probation\nalready. . . .”\n“Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class,\nHagrid?” asked Hermione.\n“Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons\nplanned,” said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak\nfrom the table and slapping it over his eye again. “I’ve bin keepin’ a\n438\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHAGRID’S TALE\ncouple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re some-\nthin’ really special.”\n“Erm . . . special in what way?” asked Hermione tentatively.\n“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid happily. “I don’ want ter spoil the\nsurprise.”\n“Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense,\n“Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to\nclass that’s too dangerous —”\n“Dangerous?” said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. “Don’ be"

She\npulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot\nair streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which\nbegan to steam as they dried out. “He wasn’t even there when I ar-\nrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came\nstumping out of the forest —”\nHarry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of\ncreatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. “What’s he keeping in\nthere?

He still won’t\nsay how he got all those injuries. . . .”\nHagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was\nnot greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George,\nand Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the\nGryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid’s enormous hand;\nothers, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook\ntheir heads.

He did not present a reassuring sight; the\nbruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with\ngreen and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding.\nHarry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked\nby some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from\nhealing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was\ncarrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.\n“We’re workin’ in here today!” Hagrid called happily to the ap-\nproaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind\nhim. “Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark. . . .”\n“What prefers the dark?” Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to\nCrabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. “What did he say\nprefers the dark — did you hear?”\nHarry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered\nthe forest before now; he had not been very brave then either. He\nsmiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused\nMalfoy discomfort was all right with him.\n“Ready?” said Hagrid happily, looking around at the class. “Right,\nwell, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought\nwe’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what\nwe’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y per-\nson in Britain who’s managed ter train ’em —”\n“And you’re sure they’re trained, are you?” said Malfoy, the panic in\nhis voice even more pronounced now. “Only it wouldn’t be the first\ntime you’d brought wild stuff to class, would it?”\nThe Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked\nas though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too.\n443\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n“’Course they’re trained,” said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the\ndead cow a little higher on his shoulder.\n“So what happened to your face, then?” demanded Malfoy.\n“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid, angrily. “Now if yeh’ve fin-\nished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!”\nHe turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed\nmuch disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who\nsighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading\nthe rest of the class.\nThey walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place\nwhere the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight\nand there was no snow on the ground at all.

A minute passed in which the\nclass continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around\ntrees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then,\nas Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enor-\nmous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space be-\ntween two gnarled yew trees.\nA pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through\nthe gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then\nskeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the dark-\n444\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE EYE OF THE SNAKE\nness.

He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring\naround into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why\ndoesn’t Hagrid call again?”\nMost of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused\nand nervously expectant as Ron’s and were still gazing everywhere but\nat the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other peo-\nple who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing\njust behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of\ngreat distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the\nswishing progress of the long black tail.\n“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” said Hagrid proudly, as a second\nblack horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings\ncloser to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. “Now . . .\nput yer hands up, who can see ’em?”\nImmensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the\nmystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand.

They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the\ncastle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end\nand is trying to strangle you with it,” said Ron), to watch over first\nand second years spending their break times inside because of the bit-\nter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely\nweren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol\nthe corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holi-\nday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got\ndung for brains, that one,” said Ron furiously). They were so busy that\nHermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was\ndown to her last three.\n“All those poor elves I haven’t set free yet, having to stay over dur-\ning Christmas because there aren’t enough hats!”\nHarry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking\neverything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In\nany case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time\nin his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away\nfrom Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether\nor not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resent-\nful toward the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked\nforward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over\nthe holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the\ntime with their families.

He wondered whether he could possibly persuade\nMrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart\nfrom the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sir-\nius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs.\nWeasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sir-\nius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire,\nand although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch\nit would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think\nof Sirius alone in his mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely\ncracker with Kreacher.\nHarry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A."

He jumped out from under\nit. “Good thinking,” said Luna very seriously. “It’s often infested with\nnargles.”\nHarry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the\narrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breath-\nless and looked very cold.\n“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it\ninto a corner, “we’ve replaced you.”\n“Replaced me?” said Harry blankly.\n“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently. “We’ve got an-\nother Seeker!”\n“Who?” said Harry quickly.\n“Ginny Weasley,” said Katie.\nHarry gaped at her.\n“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her\narm. “But she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,” she\nsaid, throwing him a very dirty look, “but as we can’t have you . . .”\nHarry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: Did she imagine\nfor a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hun-\ndred times more than she did?\n“And what about the Beaters?” he asked, trying to keep his voice\neven.\n“Andrew Kirke,” said Alicia without enthusiasm, “and Jack Sloper.\nNeither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots\nwho turned up . . .”\nThe arrival of Ron, Hermione, and Neville brought this depressing\ndiscussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full\nenough to prevent him seeing Angelina’s burning, reproachful looks.\n“Okay,” he said, calling them all to order. “I thought this evening\nwe should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last\n453\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nmeeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything\nnew right before a three-week break —”\n“We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a dis-\ngruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. “If I’d\nknown that, I wouldn’t have come. . . .”"

Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the fa-\nmiliar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a\nstep going downstairs.\n“We can practice in pairs,” said Harry. “We’ll start with the Im-\npediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions\nand try Stunning again.”\nThey all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual.\nThe room was soon full of intermittent cries of “Impedimenta!” People\nfroze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare\naimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would\nunfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.\nNeville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when\nHarry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and\nHermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the\nothers. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temp-\ntation to walk past her several more times.\nAfter ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions\nall over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was\nreally too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the\ngroup observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt\nhimself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True,\nNeville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been\naiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else\nhad made enormous progress.\nAt the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.\n454\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE EYE OF THE SNAKE\n“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them.\n“When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the\nbig stuff — maybe even Patronuses.”\nThere was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the\nusual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas\nas they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron\nand Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left\nbefore he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he\nwas hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her.\n“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his\nheart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s\napple.\nHe pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite\nsure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he\nheard a hearty sniff.\nHe turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears\npouring down her face.\n“Wha — ?”\nHe didn’t know what to do.

His mouth was very dry. “It’s probably full of\nnargles, though.”\n“What are nargles?”\n“No idea,” said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to\nhave been Stunned. “You’d have to ask Loony.

Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he\nhad imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured\na Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sob-\nbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.\n“Who’re you writing the novel to anyway?” Ron asked Hermione,\ntrying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor.\nHermione hitched it up out of sight.\n“Viktor.”\n460\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE EYE OF THE SNAKE\n“Krum?”\n“How many other Viktors do we know?”\nRon said nothing, but looked disgruntled.

MUNGO’S HOSPITAL\nFOR MAGICAL MALADIES\nAND INJURIES\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split\nin two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously up-\nward like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the mov-\ning stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were\nmoving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished\noak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.\nThough it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming\nfrom inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though\nDumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.\nProfessor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker,\nand the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them\nall off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall\nled Harry and Ron inside.\nThe room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments\nstanding on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emit-\nting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old headmas-\nters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their\nframes. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a\nswan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.\n“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.”\nDumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he\nleaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers\nlaid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered\npurple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but\nseemed wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently\nupon Professor McGonagall.\n“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,”\nsaid Professor McGonagall. “He says . . .”\n“It wasn’t a nightmare,” said Harry quickly.\nProfessor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly.\n“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.”\n“I . . . well, I was asleep. . . .” said Harry and even in his terror and\n467\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nhis desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irri-\ntated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his\nown interlocked fingers. “But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was\nreal. . . .

I saw it happen. . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad —\nMr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.”\nThe words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them,\nslightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumble-\ndore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked\nfrom Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.\n“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not look-\ning at Harry.\n“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it\nmatter? “Inside my head, I suppose —”\n“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm\ntone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were posi-\ntioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing\nbeside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?”\nThis was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore;\nit was almost as though he knew . . .\n“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw it all from the snake’s point of\nview. . . .”\nNobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking\nat Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is\nArthur seriously injured?”\n“Yes,” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the\nuptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that\nlong pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the\ncourtesy of looking at him?\nBut Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and ad-\ndressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.\n“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!”\nA sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch\n468\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL\nFOR MAGICAL MALADIES\nAND INJURIES\nwith long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom\nseemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes\nimmediately.\n“You were listening?” said Dumbledore.\nThe wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”\n“The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore. “Everard,\nyou will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right\npeople —”\nBoth nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead\nof emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hog-\nwarts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a\nbackdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.\nHarry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on\nthe walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept\nsneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly under-\nstood who had been talking when they had knocked.\n“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads,”\nDumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor\nMcGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his\nperch beside the door. “Their renown is such that both have portraits\nhanging in other important Wizarding institutions.

Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra\nchairs . . .”\nProfessor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her\ndressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air,\nstraight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz\narmchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.\n469\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nHarry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumble-\ndore was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.\nThe phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high\nand observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.\n“We will need,” said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, “a\nwarning.”\nThere was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.\nDumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver in-\nstruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to\nhis desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip\nof his wand.\nThe instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking\nnoises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule sil-\nver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow\nfurrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady\nstream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent’s\nhead grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry won-\ndered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked\neagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore\ndid not look up.\n“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Dumbledore apparently to him-\nself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of\nsurprise. “But in essence divided?”\nHarry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The\nsmoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both\ncoiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction\nDumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand:\nThe clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew\nfaint, became a formless haze, and vanished.\nDumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table;\nHarry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him\nwith their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily\n470\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nST.

Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later.\nHe doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida\nCragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —”\n“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I\ntake it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —”\nAnd moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in\nher picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes,\nthey’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . .

He raised his wand and murmured\n“Portus”; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue\nlight, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever.\nDumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a\nclever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted\nwearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently\nsleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he\nattempted to rouse him.\n“Phineas.

Kreacher’s footsteps had\nstopped on the stairs outside.\n“It was —” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGona-\ngall and Dumbledore. “I had a — a kind of — vision. . . .”\nAnd he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story\nso that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the\nsnake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . .\n475\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nRon, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not\nspeak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued\nto stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was\nimagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in\ntheir looks. Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the\nattack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the\nsnake at the time. . . .\n“Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.\n“She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,” said Sirius.\n“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could in-\nterfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now.”\n“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said Ginny urgently. She looked\naround at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas. “Sir-\nius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ?”\n“Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius.\n“’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a\nmulish expression, “he’s our dad!”\n“And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was at-\ntacked before the hospital even let his wife know?”\n“What does that matter?” said George hotly.\n“It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that\nHarry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles\naway!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry"

Harry looked at Ron,\nwho made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug,\nand they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute,\nthen took seats on either side of Ginny.\n“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragingly, “come on, let’s all . . . let’s\nall have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!”\nHe raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying\ntoward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the\ndebris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them.\nThey all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crack-\nling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.\nHarry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands.\nHis stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not\nbe here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed.

No one took any notice.\nThen a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of\nthem and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a\nthud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail\nfeather.\n“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s\nnot Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your\nmother — here —”\nHe thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and\nread aloud, “Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay\nwhere you are. I will send news as soon as I can.

It sounded to Harry too as\nthough Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death.\nStill exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as\nthough it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the\nparchment out of George’s hands and read it for himself, then looked\nup at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again\nand clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.\nIf Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could\nnot remember it.

We can all go and see him later. Bill’s sitting with him\nnow, he’s going to take the morning off work.”\nFred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George\nand Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged\nher. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer\nin one.\n“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet.\n“Where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!”\nBut Kreacher did not answer the summons.\n“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front\nof him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs,\nI think, and some tea, and toast —”\nHarry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude\nupon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when\nMrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had\nbarely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them\nout of his hands and pulled him into a hug.\n“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you,\n479\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nHarry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found\nArthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to\nyou he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover\nstory for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he\nwould have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis. . . .”\nHarry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon\nreleased him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her chil-\ndren through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have\nbeen able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as\nMr. Weasley was in hospital.\n“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a little\nwhile and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that\nmight mean we’re here for Christmas. . . .”\n“The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that\nMrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help\nwith breakfast.\n“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer.\n“Can I have a quick word? Er — now?”\nHe walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without pre-\namble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had,\nincluding the fact that he himself had been the snake who had at-\ntacked Mr. Weasley.\nWhen he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore\nthis?”"

He went\nup to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while\nRon crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully\nclothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping\nhimself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze,\nterrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake\nto find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house\nafter one of the others. . . .\nWhen Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing\nnap too.

They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception\narea where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden\nchairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies\nof Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as ele-\nphant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was\nscarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were\nmaking very peculiar noises.

No cure at all.”\n“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he\nsafe in a public ward? Shouldn’t he be in a private room?”\n“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly.\n“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know,\ntrying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I\nsaid to him — didn’t mention names, of course — but I said I knew a\nwerewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite\neasy to manage. . . .”\n“What did he say?” asked George.\n488\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL\nFOR MAGICAL MALADIES\nAND INJURIES\n“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley\nsadly. “And that woman over there,” he indicated the only other occu-\npied bed, which was right beside the door, “won’t tell the Healers what\nbit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was\nhandling illegally.

The thing You-Know-Who’s after?”\n“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley.\n“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, “this time Willy’s\nbeen caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don’t think\nhe’ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this arti-\ncle, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for\nemergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it,\nMuggles in St. Mungo’s! I wonder which ward they’re in?”\nAnd he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.\n“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred,\nlooking at his father for a reaction. “A massive one? You saw it the\nnight he returned, didn’t you?”\n“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks\nare outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you.

Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them,\nafraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet,\nwith catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face\nof Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quir-\nrell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering\nwhat it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . .\nHe felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some\ndeadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the\nhospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were\nfree of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake,\nhe had been the snake, he knew it now. . . .\nAnd then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bob-\nbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and\nsquirm like serpents. . . .\n“What’s he after apart from followers?”\n“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t\nhave last time.”\n492\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHRISTMAS ON THE\nCLOSED WARD\nI’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were\npumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat\nas he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Volde-\nmort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I\ngo, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working,\nthey can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . .

He’ll know who’s in\nthe Order and where Sirius is . . . and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t\nhave, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. . . .\nThere was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grim-\nmauld Place straightaway.

Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas\nof his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with\nan amused expression on his face.\n“Not running away, no,” said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a\nfew more feet across the room.\n“I thought,” said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard,\n“that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave?\n494\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHRISTMAS ON THE\nCLOSED WARD"

His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas\nNigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.”\nHarry spun around.\n“What is it?”\n“Stay where you are.”\n“I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob.\n“So what’s the message?”\n“I have just given it to you, dolt,” said Phineas Nigellus smoothly.\n“Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.’”\n“Why?” said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. “Why\ndoes he want me to stay?

Hagrid had\nsent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably sup-\nposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry\nputting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s\npresent was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry\nwatched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version;\nRon had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and\nMrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies;\nand Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been\ndone by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see\nwhether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and\nGeorge Apparated at the foot of his bed.\n“Merry Christmas,” said George. “Don’t go downstairs for a bit.”\n“Why not?” said Ron.\n“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his\nChristmas jumper.”\n“Without a note,” added George. “Hasn’t asked how Dad is or vis-\nited him or anything. . . .”\n“We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to\nlook at Harry’s portrait. “Told her Percy’s nothing more than a hu-\nmongous pile of rat droppings —”\n“— didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate\nFrog. “So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go\ndown for breakfast, I reckon.”\n“What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at\nDobby’s painting. “Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.”\n“It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at the back of the picture. “Says\nso on the back!”\n“Good likeness,” said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new home-\nwork diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it\nsaid happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do\nwhatever you please!”\n502\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHRISTMAS ON THE\nCLOSED WARD\nThey got up and dressed; they could hear various inhabitants of the\nhouse calling “Merry Christmas” to each other. On their way down-\nstairs they met Hermione. “Thanks for the book, Harry!” she said\nhappily. “I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages!\nAnd that perfume is really unusual, Ron.”\n“No problem,” said Ron. “Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nod-\nding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.\n“Kreacher,” said Hermione brightly.\n“It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what\nSirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!”\n“It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d cer-\ntainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No,\nit’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.”\n“What bedroom?” said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as\nthey were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother.\n“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of —"

I\nthink we’d better knock . . .”\nRon rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.\n“He must be sneaking around upstairs,” he said, and without fur-\nther ado pulled open the door. “Urgh.”\nHarry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a\nvery large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot’s space underneath\n503\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nthe pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a\nnest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on\nthe floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where\nKreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the\nmaterial were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far\ncorner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher\nhad saved, magpielike, from Sirius’s purge of the house, and he had\nalso managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that\nSirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shat-\ntered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered\nhaughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach —\nthe dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dum-\nbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was\nKreacher’s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the\nothers and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.\n“I think I’ll just leave his present here,” said Hermione, laying the\npackage neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets\nand closing the door quietly. “He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine. . . .”\n“Come to think of it,” said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carry-\ning a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, “has anyone\nactually seen Kreacher lately?”\n“I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,” said Harry.\n“You were ordering him out of the kitchen.”\n“Yeah . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “You know, I think that’s the last\ntime I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere. . . .”\n“He couldn’t have left, could he?” said Harry. “I mean, when you\nsaid ‘out,’ maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house?”\n“No, no, house-elves can’t leave unless they’re given clothes, they’re"

He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.”\n504\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHRISTMAS ON THE\nCLOSED WARD\nSirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, “I’ll\nlook for him later, I expect I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out\nover my mother’s old bloomers or something. . . . Of course, he might\nhave crawled into the airing cupboard and died. . . . But I mustn’t get\nmy hopes up. . . .”\nFred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked\nreproachful.\nOnce they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry\nand Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, es-\ncorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for\nChristmas pudding and trifle, having managed to “borrow” a car for\nthe occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The\ncar, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowl-\nedge or consent of its owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put\nupon it as the Weasleys’ old Ford Anglia; although normally propor-\ntioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit\ninto it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of get-\nting inside; Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was bat-\ntling with her dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold\noutside and her children’s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself\ninto the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace.\nThe journey to St. Mungo’s was quite quick, as there was very little\ntraffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creep-\ning furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital.\nHarry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off\naround the corner to wait for them; they strolled casually toward the\nwindow where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one,\nstepped through the glass.\nThe reception area looked pleasantly festive: The crystal orbs that\nilluminated St. Mungo’s had been turned to red and gold so that they\nbecame gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every\ndoorway, and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow\n505\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nand icicles glittered in every corner, each topped with a gleaming gold\nstar. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, al-\nthough halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside\nby a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril.\n“Family argument, eh?” smirked the blonde witch behind the desk.\n“You’re the third I’ve seen today . . .

What did you all get for\nChristmas? Oh, Harry — this is absolutely wonderful —”\nFor he had just opened Harry’s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.\nMrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s an-\nswer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry’s hand, she peered at\nthe bandaging under his nightshirt.\n“Arthur,” she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap,\n“you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your ban-\ndages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need\ndoing until tomorrow.”\n“What?” said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the\nbed covers higher up his chest. “No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I —”\nHe seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley’s piercing gaze.\n“Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an\nidea. . . . He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and\nvery interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . .

Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the\nwerewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the\ncrowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting\nhimself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him,\ngrinning.\n“Do you mean to tell me,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing\nlouder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visi-\ntors were scurrying for cover, “that you have been messing about with\nMuggle remedies?”\n“Not messing about, Molly, dear,” said Mr. Weasley imploringly.\n“It was just — just something Pye and I thought we’d try — only,\nmost unfortunately — well, with these particular kinds of wounds —\nit doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped —”\n“Meaning?”\n“Well . . . well, I don’t know whether you know what — what\nstitches are?”\n“It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back to-"

Ron was\nseriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly\nhad a bad case of spattergroit.\n“And what’s that supposed to be?” he asked angrily, as the Healer\npursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of\nthe way.\n“’Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will\nleave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now —”\n“Watch who you’re calling gruesome!” said Ron, his ears turning red.\n“The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about\nyour throat, stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels’ eyes —”\n“I have not got spattergroit!”\n“But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master —”\n“They’re freckles!” said Ron furiously. “Now get back in your own\npicture and leave me alone!”\nHe rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly\nstraight faces.\n“What floor’s this?”\n“I think it’s the fifth,” said Hermione.\n“Nah, it’s the fourth,” said Harry, “one more —”\nBut as he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt, star-\ning at the small window set into the double doors that marked the\nstart of a corridor signposted .

At the\nfar end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds\nto give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.\n“Here you are, Agnes,” said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced\nwoman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. “See, not for-\ngotten, are you? And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight,\nso that’s nice, isn’t it?”\nAgnes gave several loud barks.\n“And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely\ncalendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they’ll\nbrighten things up, won’t they?” said the Healer, bustling along to the\nmumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tenta-\ncles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her\nwand. “And — oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?”\nHarry’s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from\nthe two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking\nback down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch\nwearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat\ndecorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and, trailing\nbehind her looking thoroughly depressed — Neville.\nWith a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the\npeople in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some\nmeans of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward\nunnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of\nthe name “Longbottom” too, and before Harry could stop him had\ncalled, “Neville!”\nNeville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly\nmissed him.\n“It’s us, Neville!” said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. “Have you\nseen?

A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he\nwas not making eye contact with any of them.\n“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and stick-\ning out a shriveled, clawlike hand for him to shake. “Yes, yes, I know\nwho you are, of course.

In fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking\nforward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean\nplacing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge,\nwho had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in\ntheir absence. Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now\nthat he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden\nof homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; Dumble-\ndore remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A.,\nHarry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave\nHogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.\nThen, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened\nthat made Harry positively dread his return to school.\n“Harry dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, poking her head into his and\nRon’s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess\nwatched by Hermione, Ginny, and Crookshanks, “could you come\ndown to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.”\nHarry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his\ncastles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron’s, and he\nwas egging it on enthusiastically.\n“Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry,\nMrs. Weasley, what did you say?”\n“Professor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He’d like a word.”\nHarry’s mouth fell open in horror. He looked around at Ron,\nHermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him. Crook-\nshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the\npast quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the\npieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices.\n“Snape?” said Harry blankly.\n“Professor Snape, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. “Now come\non, quickly, he says he can’t stay long.”\n“What’s he want with you?” said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs.\nWeasley withdrew from the room.\n517\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“You haven’t done anything, have you?”\n“No!” said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he\ncould have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld\nPlace. Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?\nHe pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sir-\nius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in oppo-\nsite directions. The silence between them was heavy with mutual\ndislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius."

It’s my house, you see.”\nAn ugly flush suffused Snape’s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair\nbeside Sirius, facing Snape across the table.\n“I was supposed to see you alone, Potter,” said Snape, the familiar\nsneer curling his mouth, “but Black —”\n“I’m his godfather,” said Sirius, louder than ever.\n“I am here on Dumbledore’s orders,” said Snape, whose voice, by\ncontrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, “but by all\nmeans stay, Black, I know you like to feel . . . involved.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Sirius, letting his chair fall\nback onto all four legs with a loud bang.\n“Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact\nthat you can do nothing useful,” Snape laid a delicate stress on the\nword, “for the Order.”\nIt was Sirius’s turn to flush. Snape’s lip curled in triumph as he\nturned to Harry.\n“The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish\nfor you to study Occlumency this term.”\n518\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOCCLUMENCY\n“Study what?” said Harry blankly.\nSnape’s sneer became more pronounced.\n“Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against ex-\nternal penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful\none.\nHarry’s heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defense against ex-\nternal penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all\nagreed on that. . . .\n“Why do I have to study Occlu — thing?” he blurted out.\n“Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea,” said Snape\nsmoothly. “You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will\nnot tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge.\nYou understand?”\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Who’s going to be teaching me?”\nSnape raised an eyebrow.\n“I am,” he said.\nHarry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Ex-\ntra lessons with Snape — what on earth had he done to deserve this?\nHe looked quickly around at Sirius for support.\n“Why can’t Dumbledore teach Harry?” asked Sirius aggressively.\n“Why you?”\n“I suppose because it is a headmaster’s privilege to delegate less en-\njoyable tasks,” said Snape silkily. “I assure you I did not beg for the\njob.” He got to his feet. “I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday\nevening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial\nPotions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need\nthem.”"

He was rather\ntaller than Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled his fist in the pocket\nof his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. “If\nI hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard\ntime, you’ll have me to answer to.”\n“How touching,” Snape sneered. “But surely you have noticed that\nPotter is very like his father?”\n“Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly.\n“Well then, you’ll know he’s so arrogant that criticism simply\nbounces off him,” Snape said sleekly.\nSirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table\ntoward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out\nhis own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid,\nSnape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius’s wand tip to his face.\n“Sirius!” said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\n“I’ve warned you, Snivellus,” said Sirius, his face barely a foot from\nSnape’s, “I don’t care if Dumbledore thinks you’ve reformed, I know\nbetter —”\n“Oh, but why don’t you tell him so?” whispered Snape. “Or are you\nafraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding in-\nside his mother’s house for six months very seriously?”\n“Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days?

Harry looked from one\nto the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the\nunexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought\nthem to their senses. Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across\nthe kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he\nlooked back.\n“Six o’clock Monday evening, Potter.”\nHe was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.\n“But what’s been going on?” asked Mr. Weasley again.\n“Nothing, Arthur,” said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though\nhe had just run a long distance. “Just a friendly little chat between two\nold school friends. . . .” With what looked like an enormous effort, he\nsmiled. “So . . . you’re cured? That’s great news, really great. . . .”\n521\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into\na chair. “Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an\nantidote to whatever that snake’s got in its fangs, and Arthur’s learned\nhis lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven’t you, dear?” she\nadded, rather menacingly.\n“Yes, Molly dear,” said Mr. Weasley meekly.\nThat night’s meal should have been a cheerful one with Mr.\nWeasley back amongst them; Harry could tell Sirius was trying to\nmake it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh\nloudly at Fred and George’s jokes or offering everyone more food, his\nface fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated\nfrom him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer\nMr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell\nhim that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was\ngoading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sir-\nius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in\nGrimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered\noccasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he would\nhave dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and\nHermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons\nwith Snape.\n“Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Volde-\nmort,” said Hermione at once. “Well, you won’t be sorry not to have\nthem anymore, will you?”"

He\nhad a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they\nwould next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to\nsay something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid — Harry\nwas worried that Snape’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so\nbadly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond\nGrimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sir-\nius had beckoned him to his side.\n“I want you to take this,” he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped\npackage roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.\n“What is it?” Harry asked.\n“A way of letting me know if Snape’s giving you a hard time. No,\ndon’t open it in here!” said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley,\nwho was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. “I\ndoubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need\nme, all right?”\n“Okay,” said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket\nof his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It\nwould not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no\nmatter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlu-\nmency classes.\n“Let’s go, then,” said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and\nsmiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were\nheading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front\ndoor, surrounded by Weasleys.\n“Good-bye, Harry, take care,” said Mrs. Weasley, hugging him.\n“See you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!” said Mr.\nWeasley genially, shaking his hand.\n“Right — yeah,” said Harry distractedly.

Hey — CHO!”\nHe ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.\n“Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valen-\ntine’s Day?”\n“Oooh, yes!” she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him.\n“Right . . . well . . . that’s settled then,” said Harry, and feeling that\nthe day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he headed off to\nthe library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon\nlessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.\nBy six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of having suc-\ncessfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the omi-\nnous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward\nSnape’s office.\nHe paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were al-\nmost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered.\nIt was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass\njars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in\nvariously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard full of in-\ngredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not without\nreason — of robbing. Harry’s attention was drawn toward the desk,\nhowever, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and sym-\nbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once — Dum-\nbledore’s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he\njumped when Snape’s cold voice came out of the corner.\n“Shut the door behind you, Potter.”\nHarry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was im-\nprisoning himself as he did so. When he turned back to face the room\nSnape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair\nopposite his desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black\neyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his\nface.\n529\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The head-\nmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency.

As I told you back in your dear godfather’s\nkitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion\nand influence.”\n“And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?” said\nHarry, looking directly into Snape’s dark, cold eyes and wondering\nwhether he would answer.\nSnape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptu-\nously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter?\nThe Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency —”\n“What’s that? Sir?”\n“It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another per-\nson’s mind —”\n“He can read minds?” said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed.\n“You have no subtlety, Potter,” said Snape, his dark eyes glittering.\n“You do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcom-\nings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.”\nSnape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of\ninsulting Harry, before continuing, “Only Muggles talk of ‘mind\nreading.’ The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined\nat leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be\nperused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered\nthing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are. . . .” He smirked. “It is\ntrue, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, un-\n530\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOCCLUMENCY\nder certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to\ninterpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost\nalways knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at\nOcclumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that\ncontradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without\ndetection.”\nWhatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to\nHarry and he did not like the sound of it at all.\n“So he could know what we’re thinking right now? Sir?”\n“The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and\ngrounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms\nto ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within\nthem,” said Snape. “Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye con-\ntact is often essential to Legilimency.”\n“Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?”\nSnape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as\nhe did so.\n“The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse\nthat failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection\nbetween you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times,\nwhen your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are\nasleep, for instance — you are sharing the Dark Lord’s thoughts and"

The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue.\nHe wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark\nLord.”\nHarry’s heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.\n“But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?” he asked\nabruptly. “I don’t like it much, but it’s been useful, hasn’t it? I mean\n. . . I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor\nDumbledore wouldn’t have been able to save him, would he? Sir?”\nSnape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth\n531\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nwith his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as\nthough he weighed every word.\n“It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection\nbetween you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that\nyou have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts\nwithout his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly\nbefore Christmas —”\n“The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?”\n“Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said Snape in a dangerous voice. “As\nI was saying . . . the vision you had shortly before Christmas repre-\nsented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord’s thoughts —”\n“I saw inside the snake’s head, not his!”\n“I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?”\nBut Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be\ngetting to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his\nchair so that, without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge,\ntense as though poised for flight.\n“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s\nthoughts I’m sharing?”\n“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” spat Snape.\nThere was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the\nPensieve.\n“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.\n“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered.\n“While he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of\nus . . .” He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the\nspot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin.\n“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back\nto politeness, “why —”\n“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where\nthe Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He\n532\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOCCLUMENCY\nwas possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were in-\nside it too. . . .”\n“And Vol — he — realized I was there?”\n“It seems so,” said Snape coolly.\n“How do you know?” said Harry urgently. “Is this just Professor\nDumbledore guessing, or — ?”\n“I told you,” said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, “to call me\n‘sir.’”"

He has also deduced that the\nprocess is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realized that\nhe might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return —”\n“And he might try and make me do things?” asked Harry. “Sir?” he\nadded hurriedly.\n“He might,” said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. “Which\nbrings us back to Occlumency.”\nSnape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and\nHarry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his\ntemple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he\nwithdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from tem-\nple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the\nwand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it\nswirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more Snape\nraised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance\ninto the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his\nbehavior, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf\nout of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at\nthe ready.\n“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.”\n533\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nHarry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with\nthe desk between them.\n“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend your-\nself in any other way you can think of,” said Snape.\n“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand\napprehensively.\n“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly.\n“We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you\nhave already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. . . . You\nwill find that similar powers are needed for this. . . . Brace yourself,\nnow. . . .

Repel me with your brain and you will not need\nto resort to your wand.”\n“I’m trying,” said Harry angrily, “but you’re not telling me how!”\n“Manners, Potter,” said Snape dangerously. “Now, I want you to\nclose your eyes.”\nHarry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told.

In their confu-\nsion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only\nother explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumble-\ndore had been expounding since the previous year.\nIt was not only the students’ mood that had changed. It was now\nquite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low,\nurgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the\nmoment they saw students approaching.\n“They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,” said\nHermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors\nMcGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the\nCharms classroom one day. “Not with Umbridge there.”\n“Reckon they know anything new?” said Ron, gazing back over his\nshoulder at the three teachers.\n“If they do, we’re not going to hear about it, are we?” said Harry an-\ngrily. “Not after Decree . . .

It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch\nstadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands\nand felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. . . .\n“You really miss it, don’t you?” said Cho.\nHe looked around and saw her watching him.\n“Yeah,” sighed Harry. “I do.”\n“Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third\nyear?” she asked him.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “You kept blocking me.”\n“And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my\nbroom if you had to,” said Cho, smiling reminiscently. “I heard he got\ntaken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?”\n“Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last\nyear.”\n“Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same camp-\nsite. It was really good, wasn’t it?”\nThe subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way\ndown the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe\nhow easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking\nto Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and\ncheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including\nPansy Parkinson.\n557\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n“Potter and Chang!” screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles.\n“Urgh, Chang, I don’t think much of your taste. . . .

At least Diggory\nwas good-looking!”\nThey sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with\nmany exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embar-\nrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say\nabout Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n“So . . . where d’you want to go?” Harry asked as they entered\nHogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and\ndown, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on\nthe pavements.\n“Oh . . . I don’t mind,” said Cho, shrugging. “Um . . . shall we just\nhave a look in the shops or something?”\nThey wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had\nbeen stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at\nit. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry\nfound himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped\nDeath Eaters. The poster (“By Order of the Ministry of Magic”) of-\nfered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with infor-\nmation relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n“It’s funny, isn’t it,” said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the\npictures of the Death Eaters. “Remember when that Sirius Black es-\ncaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for\nhim? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren’t de-\nmentors anywhere. . . .”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange’s\nface to glance up and down the High Street. “Yeah, it is weird. . . .”\nHe was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he\ncame to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not\nonly let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for\nthem. . . . It looked as though they really were outside Ministry con-\ntrol now.\n558\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BEETLE AT BAY\nThe ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window\nhe and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold,\nheavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck.\n“Um . . . d’you want to get a coffee?” said Cho tentatively, as the\nrain began to fall more heavily.\n“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, looking around. “Where — ?”\n“Oh, there’s a really nice place just up here, haven’t you ever been\nto Madam Puddifoot’s?” she said brightly, and she led him up a side\nroad and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It\nwas a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have\nbeen decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly\nof Umbridge’s office.\n“Cute, isn’t it?” said Cho happily.\n“Er . . . yeah,” said Harry untruthfully.\n“Look, she’s decorated it for Valentine’s Day!” said Cho, indicating"

Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain,\nwas sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They\nwere holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, par-\nticularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of\nnothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would\nexpect him to hold her hand.\n“What can I get you, m’dears?” said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout\nwoman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and\nRoger Davies’s with great difficulty.\n“Two coffees, please,” said Cho.\nIn the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his\ngirlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they\nwouldn’t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho\n559\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nwould soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and\ntried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he could not\nsee the street outside. To postpone the moment when he had to look\nat Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork\nand received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering\ncherub.\nAfter a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge;\nHarry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy\nmoments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly\ncanvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell\nagain. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from\nthe table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.\n“Er . . . listen, d’you want to come with me to the Three Broom-\nsticks at lunchtime? I’m meeting Hermione Granger there.”\nCho raised her eyebrows.\n“You’re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?”\n“Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D’you want to\ncome with me? She said it wouldn’t matter if you did.”\n“Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.”\nBut Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all; on\nthe contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather\nforbidding.\nA few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his cof-\nfee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Next door, Roger\nDavies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips.\nCho’s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and Harry was\nfeeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it.

Roger. I turned him down, though.”\nHarry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lung-\ning movement across the table, could not think why she was telling\nhim this. If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being\nheartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with\nhim?\nHe said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti\nover them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had\nbeen about to drink.\n“I came in here with Cedric last year,” said Cho.\nIn the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said,\nHarry’s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted\nto talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and\na cherub floated over their heads.\nCho’s voice was rather higher when she spoke again.\n“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric — did he\nm-m-mention me at all before he died?”\nThis was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and\nleast of all with Cho.\n“Well — no —” he said quietly. “There — there wasn’t time for\nhim to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d’you . . . d’you get to see a lot of\nQuidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?”\nHis voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw\nthat her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been af-\nter the last D.A. meeting before Christmas.\n“Look,” he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could\noverhear, “let’s not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let’s talk about\nsomething else. . . .”\nBut this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.\n561\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n“I thought,” she said, tears spattering down onto the table. “I\nthought you’d u-u-understand!

I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn’t\nyou?”\nEverything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies’ girl-\nfriend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying.\n“Well — I have talked about it,” Harry said in a whisper, “to Ron\nand Hermione, but —”\n“Oh, you’ll talk to Hermione Granger!” she said shrilly, her face\nnow shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart\nto stare. “But you won’t talk to me!

How many are\nyou meeting after Hermione?”\n“It’s not like that!” said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally un-\nderstanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he\nrealized a split second too late was a mistake.\nCho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and every-\nbody was watching them now.\n“I’ll see you around, Harry,” she said dramatically, and hiccuping\nslightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open, and hurried off into\nthe pouring rain.\n“Cho!” Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut\nbehind her with a tuneful tinkle.\nThere was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon\n562\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BEETLE AT BAY\nHarry. He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti\nout of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door.\nIt was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He sim-\nply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had\nbeen getting along fine.\n“Women!” he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed\nstreet with his hands in his pockets. “What did she want to talk about\nCedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject\nthat makes her act like a human hosepipe?”\nHe turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes\nhe was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew\nhe was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there\nwould be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening\ntime. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid\nwas sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.\n“Hi, Hagrid!” he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed\ntables and pulled up a chair beside him.\nHagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely rec-\nognized him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and sev-\neral new bruises.\n“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said Hagrid. “You all righ’?”\n“Yeah, I’m fine,” lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and\nmournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he did not have much to complain\nabout. “Er — are you okay?”\n“Me?” said Hagrid. “Oh yeah, I’m grand, Harry, grand. . . .”"

But be-\nfore Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice\ncalling his name.\n“Harry! Harry, over here!”\nHermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He\ngot up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He\nwas still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not\nalone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking\nmates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other\nthan Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of\nHermione’s least favorite people in the world.\n564\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BEETLE AT BAY\n“You’re early!” said Hermione, moving along to give him room to\nsit down. “I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for\nanother hour at least!”\n“Cho?” said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly\nat Harry. “A girl?”\nShe snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it."

Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap,\nshe snapped her bag shut again.\n“What are you up to?” Harry asked, sitting down and staring from\nRita to Luna to Hermione.\n“Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,”\nsaid Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. “I suppose I’m allowed to\ntalk to him, am I?” she shot at Hermione.\n“Yes, I suppose you are,” said Hermione coldly.\nUnemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set\nin elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The\nscarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a cou-\nple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another\ngreat gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth,\n“Pretty girl, is she, Harry?”\n“One more word about Harry’s love life and the deal’s off and that’s\na promise,” said Hermione irritably.\n“What deal?” said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand.\n“You haven’t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn\nup. Oh, one of these days . . .” She took a deep shuddering breath.\n“Yes, yes, one of these days you’ll write more horrible stories about\nHarry and me,” said Hermione indifferently. “Find someone who\ncares, why don’t you?”\n“They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year\n565\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nwithout my help,” said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the\ntop of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made\nyou feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?”\n“He feels angry, of course,” said Hermione in a hard, clear voice.\n“Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s\ntoo much of an idiot to believe him.”\n“So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-\nNamed is back?” said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to\na piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the\ncrocodile bag. “You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore’s been\ntelling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the\nsole witness — ?”\n“I wasn’t the sole witness,” snarled Harry. “There were a dozen-odd\nDeath Eaters there as well.

If Zacharias Smith\nbeats us I might have to kill myself.”\n“Kill him, more like,” said Fred firmly.\n“That’s the trouble with Quidditch,” said Hermione absentmind-\nedly, once again bent over her Rune translation, “it creates all this bad\nfeeling and tension between the Houses.”\n574\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSEEN AND UNFORESEEN\nShe looked up to find her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary and caught\nFred, George, and Harry looking at her with expressions of mingled\ndisgust and incredulity on their faces.\n“Well, it does!” she said impatiently. “It’s only a game, isn’t it?”\n“Hermione,” said Harry, shaking his head, “you’re good on feelings\nand stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.”\n“Maybe not,” she said darkly, returning to her translation again, “but\nat least my happiness doesn’t depend on Ron’s goalkeeping ability.”\nAnd though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy\nTower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the\nfollowing Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not\nto care about Quidditch either.\nThe very best thing you could say about the match was that it was\nshort; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two min-\nutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry\nthought it was a close-run contest between Ron’s fourteenth failed save,\nSloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his\nbat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacha-\nrias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that\nGryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch\nfrom right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby’s nose, so that the final\nscore was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.\n“Good catch,” Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where\nthe atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.\n“I was lucky,” she shrugged. “It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Sum-\nmerby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong"

Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of “Weasley\nIs Our King” sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now\nfavorites to win the Quidditch Cup.\nFred and George wandered over.\n“I haven’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even,” said\nFred, looking over at Ron’s crumpled figure. “Mind you . . . when he\nmissed the fourteenth . . .”\nHe made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright\ndoggy-paddle.\n“Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh?”\nRon dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for\nhis feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory\nhimself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure\nenough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little\ntoo loudly to be entirely plausible.\nHarry got into bed, thinking about the match.

The pages carrying\nHarry’s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from text-\nbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank\nuntil they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single\nperson in the school had read it.\nThe teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the in-\nterview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found\nways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout\nawarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering\ncan; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar\nmice on him at the end of Charms, said “Shh!” and hurried away; and\nProfessor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and\nannounced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge,\nthat Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would\n582\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSEEN AND UNFORESEEN\nlive to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve\nchildren.\nBut what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as\nhe was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew\nwhat had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his\near, “I’m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave . . . it made\nme cry.”\nHe was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very\nglad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when\nshe gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again.

Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it\ninterfered with her concentration, and ended up going to bed early\nout of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as\nfunny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had\nstarted to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like\n“Dung” and “Umbridge” at more and more frequent intervals in a\nprogressively higher voice.

I used to work in the department after —\nafter all. . . .”\n“Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.”\n“Bode could never have taken it, Master. . . . Bode would have\nknown he could not. . . . Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard\nagainst Malfoy’s Imperius Curse. . . .”\n“Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered Harry.\nThe kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was\npockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He\nremained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a\nbow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry’s face.\n“You have done well to tell me this,” said Harry. “Very well . . . I\nhave wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems. . . . But no matter\n. . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude,\nRookwood. . . .”\n“My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,” gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse\nwith relief.\n“I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give\nme.”\n“Of course, My Lord, of course . . . anything . . .”\n“Very well . . . you may go.

A face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits for pupils . . .\n“NOOOOOOOOO!”\n“What?” yelled a voice nearby.\nHarry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and\nfell out of his bed.

When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few\nmoments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and\nGeorge, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from\nunder their cloaks on the other side of the yard.\n“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her\ngaze from Fred and George at last. “When Bode tried to steal this\nweapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be\ndefensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it.\nThat’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he\ncouldn’t talk.

When people were\nnot discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today, they\nwere laughing at Gryffindor’s abysmal performance in their match\nagainst Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing “Weasley Is Our King”\nso loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from\nthe corridors out of sheer irritation.\nThe week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two\nmore D’s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get\nthe sack, and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in\nwhich he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron\nand Hermione again because he did not want another telling-off from\nHermione.

He was find-\ning it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the\nrush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. “You mean\nthe one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?”\n“No,” said Snape softly. “I mean the one concerning a man kneel-\ning in the middle of a darkened room. . . .”\n“It’s . . . nothing,” said Harry."

There was a shocked murmur\naround the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther\n597\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nbackward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for\nthe newcomer.\nThrough the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a\ndark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and\nastonishingly blue eyes, the head and torso of a man joined to the\npalomino body of a horse.\n“This is Firenze,” said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck\nUmbridge. “I think you’ll find him suitable.”\n598\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T W E N T Y - S E V E N\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\nI\n’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you,\nHermione?” asked Parvati, smirking.\nIt was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor\nTrelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and\nexamining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their\nfirst lesson with Firenze that morning.\n“Not really,” said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the\nDaily Prophet. “I’ve never really liked horses.”\nShe turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.\n“He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked.\n“A gorgeous centaur . . .” sighed Parvati.\n“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly. “Any-\nway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?”\n“We are!” Lavender assured her. “We went up to her office to see\nher, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s\ngot, nice ones. . . .”\n“How is she?” asked Harry.\n“Not very good, poor thing,” said Lavender sympathetically. “She\n599\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\nwas crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay\nhere if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her.

You saw the\nlook on her face when she saw Firenze. . . .”\nAfter breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and\nHarry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall,\nheading for Divination.\n“Aren’t we going up to North Tower?” asked Ron, looking puzzled,\nas Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.\nParvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him.\n“How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in class-\nroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.”\nClassroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading\noff the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry\nknew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly,\nand that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or\nstoreroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found him-\nself right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momen-\ntarily stunned.\n“What the — ?”\nThe classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were\ngrowing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and\nwindows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled,\ngreen light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the\nearthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders,\n600\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\narms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests,\nlooking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were\nno trees, stood Firenze.\n“Harry Potter,” he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.\n“Er — hi,” said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who sur-\nveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did\nnot smile. “Er — good to see you . . .”\n“And you,” said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. “It\nwas foretold that we would meet again.”\nHarry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise\non Firenze’s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the\nfloor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently\ndeeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom\nthey seemed to find intimidating.\nWhen the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon\na tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around\nthe room.\n“Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,”\nsaid Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my\nnatural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden\nForest, which was — until Monday — my home . . . but this is not\npossible.”\n“Please — er — sir —” said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand,\n“why not? We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!”"

We’ve been in there with Hagrid, we’re not frightened!”\n“It is not a question of your bravery,” said Firenze, “but of my po-\nsition. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.”\n“Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she\nwas thinking of cows. “What — oh!” Comprehension dawned on her\nface. “There are more of you?” she said, stunned.\n“Did Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?” asked Dean eagerly.\nFirenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to\nrealize at once that he had said something very offensive.\n601\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n“I didn’t — I meant — sorry,” he finished in a hushed voice.\n“Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,” said\nFirenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.\n“Please, sir . . . why have the other centaurs banished you?”\n“Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,” said\nFirenze. “They see this as a betrayal of our kind.”\nHarry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane\nhad shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his\nback, calling him a “common mule.” He wondered whether it had\nbeen Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.\n“Let us begin,” said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail,\nraised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it\nslowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they\nnow seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars\nemerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said\naudibly, “Blimey!”\n“Lie back upon the floor,” said Firenze in his calm voice, “and ob-\nserve the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune\nof our races.”\nHarry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling. A\ntwinkling red star winked at him from overhead.\n“I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their\nmoons in Astronomy,” said Firenze’s calm voice, “and that you have\nmapped the stars’ progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unrav-\neled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings\nteach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us. . . .”\n“Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us!” said Parvati excitedly,\nraising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay\non her back. “Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that,\nand when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now” — she drew a right\nangle in the air above her — “that means that people need to be extra\ncareful when handling hot things —”\n602\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\n“That,” said Firenze calmly, “is human nonsense.”"

She looked very\noffended, as did several of the people surrounding her.\n“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued\nFirenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up\nand down before them, “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the\nself-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am\nhere to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and im-\npartial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are\nsometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we\nare seeing.”\nFirenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.\n“In the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is\nliving through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars.\nMars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the\nfight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to\ndivine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation\nof fume and flame. . . .”\nIt was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did\nindeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and\nFirenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pun-\ngent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of\nthem could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans\n603\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\nwere hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to\nbecome competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to\nput too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs\nsometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human\nteacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach\nthem what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing,\nnot even centaurs’ knowledge, was foolproof.\n“He’s not very definite on anything, is he?” said Ron in a low voice,\nas they put out their mallowsweet fire. “I mean, I could do with a few\nmore details about this war we’re about to have, couldn’t you?”\nThe bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone\njumped; Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the\ncastle, quite convinced that he was really in the forest.

The centaur advanced a little toward him. Ron\nhesitated.\n“You may stay,” Firenze told him. “But close the door, please.”\nRon hastened to obey.\n“Harry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid’s, are you not?” said the\ncentaur.\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n“Then give him a warning from me. His attempt is not working.\nHe would do better to abandon it.”\n“His attempt is not working?” Harry repeated blankly.\n“And he would do better to abandon it,” said Firenze, nodding. “I\nwould warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise\nfor me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough,\nwithout a centaurs’ battle.”\n“But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously.\nFirenze looked at Harry impassively.\n“Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service,” said Firenze,\n604\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\n“and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all liv-\ning creatures.

As a dull March blurred into a squally\nApril, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and\nproblems again.\nUmbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures\nlessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Ha-\ngrid. At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy\nof Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after\nclass one day. When he passed on Firenze’s message, Hagrid gazed at\nhim for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken\naback. Then he seemed to pull himself together.\n“Nice bloke, Firenze,” he said gruffly, “but he don’ know what he’s\ntalkin’ abou’ on this.

If you’re doing anything you shouldn’t\nbe —”\n“There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid,\nthough his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl\ndroppings crashed to the floor. “Don’ worry abou’ me, Harry, jus’ get\nalong now, there’s a good lad. . . .”\nHarry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all\nover his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up\nto the castle.\nMeanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding"

He sometimes felt that he was living\nfor the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but\nthoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as\nhe looked around at his fellow D.A. members and saw how far they\nhad come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was\ngoing to react when all the members of the D.A. received “Outstand-\ning” in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s.\nThey had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had\nbeen very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them,\nproducing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when\nthey were not under threat was very different to producing it when\nconfronted by something like a dementor.\n“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her sil-\nvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement\nduring their last lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”\n“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect\nyou,” said Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or some-\nthing; that’s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the bog-\ngart was pretending to be a dementor —”\n“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting\npuffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still —\ncan’t — do it!” she added angrily.\nNeville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concen-\ntration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip.\n“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.\n“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his\nround face was actually shining with sweat.\n“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been\n606\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\nbrought along to his first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah —\nit’s gone. . . .

Pro-\nfessor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense.\nCornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and for-\nward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with\nthe situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry\ndid not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either\nside of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of\nPercy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy\nscroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes.\nThe portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not sham-\nming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening\nbelow, alert and serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neigh-\nboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors’ ears.\nHarry pulled himself free of Umbridge’s grasp as the door swung\nshut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of\nvicious satisfaction upon his face.\n“Well,” he said. “Well, well, well . . .”\nHarry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart\ndrummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.\n“He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Umbridge. There\nwas an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure\nHarry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with\nmisery in the entrance hall. “The Malfoy boy cornered him.”\n“Did he, did he?” said Fudge appreciatively. “I must remember to\ntell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here?”\nHarry fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”: His mouth\nhad opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of\n610\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\nDumbledore’s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry;\nhis eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry\nstared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.\nHarry changed direction mid-word.\n“Yeh — no.”\n“I beg your pardon?” said Fudge.\n“No,” said Harry, firmly.\n“You don’t know why you are here?”\n“No, I don’t,” said Harry.\nFudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge;\nHarry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another\nquick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods\nand the shadow of a wink.\n“So you have no idea,” said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with\nsarcasm, “why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You\nare not aware that you have broken any school rules?”\n“School rules?” said Harry. “No.”\n“Or Ministry decrees?” amended Fudge angrily.\n“Not that I’m aware of,” said Harry blandly."

If somebody had tipped\noff Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be\npacking his trunk right now.\n“So it’s news to you, is it,” said Fudge, his voice now thick with\nanger, “that an illegal student organization has been discovered within\nthis school?”\n“Yes, it is,” said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent\nsurprise onto his face.\n“I think, Minister,” said Umbridge silkily from beside him, “we\nmight make better progress if I fetch our informant.”\n611\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n“Yes, yes, do,” said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at\nDumbledore as Umbridge left the room. “There’s nothing like a good\nwitness, is there, Dumbledore?”\n“Nothing at all, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his\nhead.\nThere was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at\neach other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge\nmoved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho’s curly-\nhaired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.\n“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened,” said Professor Um-\nbridge softly, patting her on the back, “it’s quite all right, now.

Marietta’s mother,\nMinister,” she added, looking up at Fudge, “is Madam Edgecombe\nfrom the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network of-\nfice — she’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.”\n“Jolly good, jolly good!” said Fudge heartily. “Like mother, like\ndaughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s\nhear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles!”\nAs Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly\nlanding himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his\ncloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and\npulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the\nwhole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series\nof close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks\nto form the word “SNEAK.”\n“Never mind the spots now, dear,” said Umbridge impatiently, “just\ntake your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister —”\nBut Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head\nfrantically.\n“Oh, very well, you silly girl, I’ll tell him,” snapped Umbridge. She\nhitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister,\n612"

She\nsaid that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, some-\ntimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out some-\nthing to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she\nadmitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortu-\nnately at that point this hex,” she waved impatiently at Marietta’s con-\ncealed face, “came into operation and upon catching sight of her face\nin my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.”\n“Well, now,” said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently\nimagined was a kind and fatherly look. “It is very brave of you, my\ndear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right\nthing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What\nwas its purpose? Who was there?”\nBut Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again,\nher eyes wide and fearful.\n“Haven’t we got a counterjinx for this?” Fudge asked Umbridge\nimpatiently, gesturing at Marietta’s face. “So she can speak freely?”\n“I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge admitted grudg-\ningly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione’s jinxing ability.\n“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from\nhere.\n“You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in Oc-\ntober that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s\nHead in Hogsmeade —”\n“And what is your evidence for that?” cut in Professor McGonagall.\n“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who hap-\npened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true,\nbut his hearing was quite unimpaired,” said Umbridge smugly. “He\nheard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to re-\nport to me —”\n“Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those\n613\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\nregurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eye-\nbrows. “What an interesting insight into our justice system!”\n“Blatant corruption!” roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-\nnosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk. “The Ministry\ndid not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!”\n“Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly.\n“The purpose of Potter’s meeting with these students,” continued\nProfessor Umbridge, “was to persuade them to join an illegal society,\nwhose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are\ninappropriate for school-age —”\n“I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Dolores,” said Dumbledore"

He could not see how Dumbledore was going\nto talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard\nevery word he said in the Hog’s Head there was simply no escaping it.\n“Oho!” said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet\nagain. “Yes, do let’s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull\nPotter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on — Willy\nWiddershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter’s identical twin in the\nHog’s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involv-\ning a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of\ninvisible dementors?”\nPercy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.\n“Oh, very good, Minister, very good!”\nHarry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment,\nthat Dumbledore was smiling gently too.\n“Cornelius, I do not deny — and nor, I am sure, does Harry —\nthat he was in the Hog’s Head that day, nor that he was trying to re-\ncruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely\npointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group\nwas, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree ban-\n614\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE CENTAUR AND\nTHE SNEAK\nning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after\nHarry’s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the\nHog’s Head at all.”\nPercy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something\nvery heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth\nhanging open.\nUmbridge recovered first.\n“That’s all very fine, Headmaster,” she said, smiling sweetly. “But\nwe are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational\nDecree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all\nthose that have happened since most certainly are.”\n“Well,” said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over\nthe top of his interlocked fingers, “they certainly would be, if they had\ncontinued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence\nthat these meetings continued?”\nAs Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather\nthought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that\nhe felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a\ndraft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.\n“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike\nsmile. “Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think\nMiss Edgecombe is here?”\n“Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings?” said\nDumbledore, raising his eyebrows. “I was under the impression that\nshe was merely reporting a meeting tonight.”\n“Miss Edgecombe,” said Umbridge at once, “tell us how long these"

Harry\nsaw his hand drift, almost casually, toward his pocket.\n“Don’t be silly, Dawlish,” said Dumbledore kindly. “I’m sure you\nare an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Out-\nstanding’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring\nme in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.”\nThe man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish.

A hand grabbed the scruff of\nHarry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash\nwent off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a\ncloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark fig-\nure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him. There was a shriek\nand a thud and somebody cried, “No!” Then the sound of breaking\nglass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan — and silence.\nHarry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw\nProfessor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him\nand Marietta out of harm’s way. Dust was still floating gently down\nthrough the air onto them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall fig-\nure moving toward them.\n“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore.\n“Yes!” said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry\nand Marietta with her.\nThe dust was clearing.

Harry leaned for-\nward over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once\nagain, looking down into a room as though through a circular win-\ndow in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was\nlooking down upon the Great Hall. . . .\nHis breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape’s thoughts. . . .\nHis brain seemed to be in limbo. . . . It would be insane to do the\nthing that he was so strongly tempted to do. . . . He was trembling.\n. . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of\nCho’s anger, of Malfoy’s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.\nHe took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface\nof Snape’s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping\nHarry headfirst into the Pensieve. . . .\nHe was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he\nwent, and then —\nHe was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four\nHouse tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred\nsmaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student,\nhead bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was\nthe scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted\ntheir parchment. It was clearly exam time.\nSunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent\nheads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light.\nHarry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere. . . .\nThis was his memory. . . .\nAnd there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared.\nSnape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant\n640\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSNAPE’S WORST\nMEMORY\nkept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto\nthe table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the\nparchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and\nread the heading of the examination paper:\ndefense against the dark arts —\nordinary wizarding level\nSo Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry’s own age. His\nhand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot\nmore than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule\nand cramped.\n“Five more minutes!”\nThe voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor\nFlitwick’s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Pro-\nfessor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very\nuntidy black hair. . . ."

Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across\ntwo aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy’s head\ndrew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting\ndown his quill, pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to\nreread what he had written. . . .\nHarry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-\nyear-old father.\nExcitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he\nwas looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James’s eyes were\nhazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry’s, and there was no scar\non his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same\neyebrows. James’s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry’s did, his\nhands could have been Harry’s, and Harry could tell that when James\nstood up, they would be within an inch of each other’s heights.\nJames yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even\n641\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\nmessier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor\nFlitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats\nbehind him.\nWith another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the\nthumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back\non two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes\nwith a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor Harry’s could ever\nhave achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully,\nthough he didn’t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this\ngirl — Harry’s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm — was Re-\nmus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon ap-\nproaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers\nhe scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.\nSo that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . .\nand sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-\nhaired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was\nchewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground\nwith his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neigh-\nbor’s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at\nJames, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had\ndrawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they\nstand for?\n“Quills down, please!” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “That means\nyou too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parch-\nment!

Round-shouldered yet angu-\nlar, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair\nswinging about his face.\nA gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius,\nand by planting himself in the midst of this group, Harry managed to\nkeep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of\nJames and his friends.\n“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged\ninto the entrance hall.\n“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “‘Give five signs that identify the\nwerewolf.’ Excellent question.”\n“D’you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones\nof mock concern.\n“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd throng-\ning around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.\n“One: He’s sitting on my chair.

To his intense relief, however,\nwhen James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the\nlake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with\nno fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him,\nHarry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.\n“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say.\n“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.”\n“Me too,” said James.

He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as\never, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech\nand the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree.\nThe sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the\nbank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great\nHall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the\nwater.\nLupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around\nat the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and\nbored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the\nSnitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but\nalways grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with\nhis mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch,\n644\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSNAPE’S WORST\nMEMORY\nWormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry\nwondered why James didn’t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but\nJames seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father\nhad a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not\nget too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the wa-\nter’s edge.\n“Put that away, will you?” said Sirius finally, as James made a fine\ncatch and Wormtail let out a cheer. “Before Wormtail wets himself\nfrom excitement.”\nWormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned.\n“If it bothers you,” he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket.\nHarry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for\nwhom James would have stopped showing off.\n“I’m bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.”\n“You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We’ve still\ngot Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me. . . .

It was\nlate on Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor\nTower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice.\n“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. “How\ncome you’re not at practice?”\n“It’s over,” said Ginny. “Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hos-\npital wing.”\n“Why?”\n“Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his\nown bat.” She sighed heavily. “Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it’s\nonly just got through Umbridge’s new screening process. . . .”\nShe hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had\nclearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a\nscribbled note across it in red ink, reading\ninspected and passed by\n.\nthe hogwarts high inquisitor\n“It’s Easter eggs from Mum,” said Ginny. “There’s one for you. . . .\nThere you go. . . .”\nShe handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small,\niced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of\nFizzing Whizbees.

Times of individual appoint-\nments are listed below.\nHarry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Pro-\nfessor McGonagall’s office at half-past two on Monday, which would\nmean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent\na considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all\nthe career information that had been left there for their perusal.\n“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the\nholidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-\nand-wand emblem of St. Mungo’s on its front. “It says here you need\nat least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration,\nCharms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the\nopposite direction: It was now or never.\n“Harry — please!” said Hermione weakly.\nBut he had made up his mind — hitching his bag more securely\nonto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students\n667\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nnow hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was\nabout in the east wing. . . .\nHarry reached the corridor where Umbridge’s office was situated\nand found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose\nhelmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized\nSirius’s knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly\nand carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the\ncorridor until he reached Umbridge’s door.\nHe inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it\nand moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny\nclick, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed\nthe door quickly behind him, and looked around.\nIt was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on\nthe plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated\nbroomsticks.\nHarry pulled off his cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found\nwhat he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glit-"

Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch\nof powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him.\nThey exploded at once into emerald-green flames.\n“Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!” Harry said loudly and clearly.\nIt was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced;\nhe had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been\nhis entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through\nthe network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country:\nThis time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge’s\noffice, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . .\nAnd then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling\n668\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCAREER ADVICE\nrather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler\naround his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up\nout of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat\nporing over a piece of parchment.\n“Sirius?”\nThe man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.\n“Harry!” he said, looking thoroughly shocked. “What are you —\nwhat’s happened, is everything all right?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a —\na chat with Sirius.”\n“I’ll call him,” said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed.\n“He went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the at-\ntic again. . . .”\nAnd Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left\nwith nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why\nSirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak\nout of the fire — his knees were already objecting painfully to their\nprolonged contact with Umbridge’s hard stone floor.\nLupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\n“What is it?” said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out\nof his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he\nand Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very con-\ncerned. “Are you all right? Do you need help?”\n“No,” said Harry, “it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk\n. . . about my dad. . . .”\nThey exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have\ntime to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer\nby the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed\nfrom the start of the diversion — George had only guaranteed him\ntwenty.

Then Lupin said quietly, “I wouldn’t like you to judge your\nfather on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen —”\n“I’m fifteen!” said Harry heatedly.\n“Look, Harry,” said Sirius placatingly, “James and Snape hated each\nother from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of\nthose things, you can understand that, can’t you? I think James was\neverything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at\nQuidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this\nlittle oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James —\nwhatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry — always hated\nthe Dark Arts.”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason,\njust because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he fin-\nished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\n“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.\nLupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, “Look, Harry, what\nyou’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in\nthe school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the\nheight of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —”\n“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.\nLupin smiled.\n“He kept messing up his hair,” said Harry in a pained voice.\nSirius and Lupin laughed.\n“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.\n“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and\nLupin beamed reminiscently. “Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an\nidiot.”\n“Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were\nall idiots! Well — not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at\nLupin, but Lupin shook his head.\n670\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCAREER ADVICE\n“Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the\nguts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”\n“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves\nsometimes. . . . That was something. . . .”\n“And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was\non his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the\nlake, hoping they were watching him!”\n“Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was\naround,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn’t stop himself showing off\nwhenever he got near her.”\n“How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated\nhim!”\n“Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius.\n“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.\n“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.\n“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.\n“Even Snape?” said Harry."

A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen.

There was a great deal of shouting and\nmovement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble\nstaircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled\nthere.\nIt was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Stu-\ndents were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them,\nHarry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap);\nteachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the on-\nlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all look-\ning exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was\nbobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in\nthe middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who\nhad just been cornered.\n“So!” said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was\n673\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nstanding just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down\nupon her prey. “So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor\ninto a swamp, do you?”\n“Pretty amusing, yeah,” said Fred, looking back up at her without\nthe slightest sign of fear.\nFilch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with\nhappiness.\n“I’ve got the form, Headmistress,” he said hoarsely, waving the\npiece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. “I’ve\ngot the form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it\nnow. . . .”\n“Very good, Argus,” she said. “You two,” she went on, gazing down\nat Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers\nin my school.”"

Looking to\nhis left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks,\none still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge\nhad fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor to-\nward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and\nstopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on\nthe flagged stone floor.\n“We won’t be seeing you,” Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging\nhis leg over his broomstick.\n674\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCAREER ADVICE\n“Yeah, don’t bother to keep in touch,” said George, mounting his\nown.\nFred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent,\nwatchful crowd.\n“If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated up-\nstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley — Weasleys’ Wiz-\narding Wheezes,” he said in a loud voice. “Our new premises!”\n“Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they’re going to\nuse our products to get rid of this old bat,” added George, pointing at\nProfessor Umbridge.\n“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the In-\nquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor,\nshooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously\nbelow. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his\nlevel above the crowd.\n“Give her hell from us, Peeves.”\nAnd Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a stu-\ndent before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute\nas Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the\nstudents below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious\nsunset.\n675\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T H I R T Y\nGRAWP\nT\nhe story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so of-\nten over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon\nbecome the stuff of Hogwarts legend.

For one thing, they had not left instructions on how\nto remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of\nthe east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different\nmeans of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was\nroped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of\npunting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that\n676\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRAWP\nteachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp\nin an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire\nWhiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.\nThen there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge’s\noffice door, through which Fred and George’s Cleansweeps had\nsmashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed\nHarry’s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge\nhad set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were\nfar from over.\nInspired by Fred and George’s example, a great number of students\nwere now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-\nChief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-\nsnouted niffler into Umbridge’s office, which promptly tore the place\napart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge on her reen-\ntrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs\nand Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it be-\ncame the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms\non themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of\nfresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of\nwearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.\nFilch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands,\ndesperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were\nnow so many of them that he did not know which way to turn. The\nInquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him, but odd things kept\nhappening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch\nteam reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that\nmade him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy\nParkinson, to Hermione’s delight, missed all her lessons the following\nday, as she had sprouted antlers.\nMeanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred\nand George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts.

Cackling madly, he soared through the school,\nupending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues\nand vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which\nshe was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. He smashed\nlanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the\nheads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment\nto topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when\nhe pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantu-\nlas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he\nfancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge\nand blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.\nNone of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help\nher. Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure Harry witnessed\nProfessor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was deter-\nminedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard\nher tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews\nthe other way.”\nTo cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn\nin the toilet. He remained confused and disorientated and his parents\nwere to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive,\nlooking extremely angry.\n“Should we say something?” said Hermione in a worried voice,\npressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see\n678\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRAWP\nMr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. “About what happened to\nhim? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?”\n“’Course not, he’ll recover,” said Ron indifferently.\n“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?” said Harry in a sat-\nisfied voice.\nHe and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be\ncharming with their wands. Harry’s spouted four very short legs that\nwould not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron’s\ngrew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with\ngreat difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the\ncup to crack into two.\n“Reparo!” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave\nof her wand. “That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s perma-\nnently injured?”\n“Who cares?” said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly\nagain, trembling violently at the knees. “Montague shouldn’t have"

So save\nyour breath, Hermione.”\n“I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!” she said in\nan injured voice.\nRon snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty\nlook.\n“No, I wasn’t!” she said angrily. “As a matter of fact, I was going to\nask Harry when he’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlu-\nmency lessons again!”\nHarry’s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred\nand George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many\nhours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As\nHarry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to\nSirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell\nthem. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted\nHarry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this\never since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept revert-\ning to it when Harry least expected it.\n“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione\nsaid now, “because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your\nsleep again. . . .”\nHarry threw Ron a furious look.

Although\nSlytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last\nmatch, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly\n(though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron’s abysmal goalkeep-\ning record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.\n“I mean, I can’t get any worse, can I?” he told Harry and Hermione\ngrimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. “Nothing to lose\nnow, is there?”\n“You know,” said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the\npitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, “I think Ron\nmight do better without Fred and George around.

He glanced sideways\nat Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly\nopen. She looked utterly terrified.\n“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the\nsleeping creature, “who is he?”\nHarry found this an odd question. . . . “What is it?” was the one he\nhad been planning on asking."

The\nrim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which\nseemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon’s, directly upon the shoulders\nwith little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like\na dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly to-\ngether, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a lit-\ntle at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under\nthe body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet,\nlarge as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest\nfloor.\n“You want us to teach him,” Harry said in a hollow voice. He now\nunderstood what Firenze’s warning had meant. His attempt is not work-\ning. He would do better to abandon it.

In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp\nwas rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enor-\nmous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head\nto see who and what had disturbed him.\n“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, back-\ning away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again.\n“Had a nice sleep, eh?”\n694\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRAWP\nHarry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keep-\ning the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he\nhad not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face,\nwhich resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the\nclearing. It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great\nstone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided\nand full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small\neyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed\ntogether with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls\nto his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself\nto his feet with surprising speed and agility.\n“Oh my . . .” Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.\nThe trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp’s\nwrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid\nhad said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached\nout a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird’s nest from the\nupper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a\nroar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — eggs fell\nlike grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his\nhead to protect himself.\n“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in\ncase of further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh.\nRemember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have\nter go on a little trip an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Re-\nmember that, Grawpy?”\nBut Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say\nwhether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the\nsounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of\nthe pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple\npleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go."

Look\ndown, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!”\n“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already\nraised the bough again and gave Grawp’s knee a sharp poke.\nThe giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menac-\ningly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down.\n“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione\nstood, “is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit\nyeh if I have ter go away, understand?”\nThe giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were\nthere. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boul-\nder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.\n“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her —” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to\nHermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermi-\none? On’y it’s a difficult name fer him ter remember. . . .”\n“No, not at all,” squeaked Hermione.\n“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n tha’\nnice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter — GRAWPY, NO!”\nGrawp’s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione — Harry\nseized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp’s\nfist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.\n“BAD BOY, GRAWPY!” Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione\nclung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. “VERY\nBAD BOY! YEH DON’ GRAB — OUCH!”\nHarry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid\nlying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing in-\nterest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling\nback the pine as far as it would go.\n“Righ’,” said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his\n696\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRAWP\nbleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow. “Well . . . there\nyeh are. . . . Yeh’ve met him an’ — an’ now he’ll know yeh when yeh\ncome back.

Hagrid shouldered his crossbow\nagain and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.\nNobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant\ncrash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last.\nHermione’s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single\nthing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody\nfound out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And he had\npromised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid’s to-\ntally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid,\neven with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged mon-\nsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit\nto mix with humans?\n“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were\nstruggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled\nan arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the\ncrossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had\nstopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.\n“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly.\n“I thought that we told you, Hagrid,” said a deep male voice, “that\nyou are no longer welcome here?”\nA man’s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward\nthem through the dappled green half-light. Then they saw that his\nwaist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body. This centaur had\n697\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY\na proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he\nwas armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his\nshoulders.\n“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily.\nThe trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged\nbehind him. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane,\nwhom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met\nFirenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.\n“So,” he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning\nimmediately to Magorian. “We agreed, I think, what we would do if\nthis human showed his face in the forest again?”\n“‘This human’ now, am I?” said Hagrid testily. “Jus’ fer stoppin’ all\nof yeh committin’ murder?”\n“You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian. “Our\nways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dis-\nhonored us.”\n“I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently. “He’s\ndone nothin’ except help Albus Dumbledore —”\n“Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,” said a gray centaur\nwith a hard, deeply lined face."

It’s not up ter you who comes\nan’ goes in here —”\n698\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRAWP\n“No more is it up to you, Hagrid,” said Magorian smoothly. “I shall\nlet you pass today because you are accompanied by your young —”\n“They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously. “Students,\nMagorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited\nfrom the traitor Firenze’s teachings. . . .”\n“Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a\nterrible crime. . . . We do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you\npass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friend-\nship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.”\n“I won’ be kept outta the fores’ by a bunch of mules like you!” said\nHagrid loudly.\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as\nboth Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, “let’s go, please\nlets go!\nHagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his\neyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.\n“We know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!” Magorian\ncalled after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. “And our toler-\nance is waning!”\nHagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk\nstraight back to Magorian again.\n“You’ll tolerate him as long as he’s here, it’s as much his forest as\nyours!” he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all\ntheir might against Hagrid’s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep\nhim moving forward. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression\nchanged to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him. He\nseemed not to have felt it.\n“Calm down, you two,” he said, turning to walk on while they\npanted along behind him. “Ruddy old nags though, eh?”\n“Hagrid,” said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles\nthey had passed on their way there, “if the centaurs don’t want\n699\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY\nhumans in the forest, it doesn’t really look as though Harry and I will\nbe able —”\n“Ah, you heard what they said,” said Hagrid dismissively “They"

They were able to see patches of clear blue sky\nagain and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and\nshouting.\n“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of\nthe trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. “Or d’you reckon\nthe match is over?”\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked\nmuch the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves,\nher robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous\nscratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better.\n“I reckon it’s over, yeh know!” said Hagrid, still squinting toward\nthe stadium. “Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two\nhurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you\nweren’t there!”\n“Good idea,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid. . . .”\n“I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the\nmoment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. “I don’t believe him. I\nreally don’t believe him. . . .”\n“Calm down,” said Harry.\n“Calm down!” she said feverishly. “A giant! A giant in the forest!\nAnd we’re supposed to give him English lessons!

None of\nthese things actually works you know —”\n“Dragon claw does work!” said Ron. “It’s supposed to be incredible,\nreally gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few\nhours — Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt —”\n“This stuff can,” said Hermione grimly. “I’ve had a look at it, and\nit’s actually dried doxy droppings.”\nThis information took the edge off Harry and Ron’s desire for brain\nstimulants.\nThey received their examination schedules and details of the proce-\ndure for O.W.L.s during their next Transfiguration lesson.\n“As you can see,” Professor McGonagall told the class while they\ncopied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard,\n“your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the\ntheory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons.\nYour practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at\nnight.\n“Now, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating\nCharms have been applied to your examination papers.

Well, he thought, at least he\nwould be sure of one bit of post next summer. . . .\nTheir first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday\nmorning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but\nregretted it almost at once. She was very agitated and kept snatching\nthe book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer com-\npletely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge\nof Achievements in Charming.\n“Why don’t you just do it yourself?” he said firmly, handing the\nbook back to her, his eyes watering.\n709\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nMeanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his\nfingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat\non his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive\nCharm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells,\nGrade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic loco-\nmotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around\nthe edge of the table.\nDinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk\nmuch, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on\nthe other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving un-\nder the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check\nsome fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a de-\ncent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from\nher limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.\n“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall.\n“Is that them? Is that the examiners?”\nHarry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the\ndoors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a\nsmall group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge,\nHarry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.\n“Shall we go and have a closer look?” said Ron.\nHarry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double\ndoors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the\nthreshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Profes-\nsor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it\nlooked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was\nspeaking to her very deferentially.

When Harry’s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at\nhim and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting\nthumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.\nThe Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well\nenough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of\nJupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was\ninhabited by mice.

He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there,\nbut something distracted him. Pausing with his quill suspended over\nthe parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw\nhalf a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been mov-\ning, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads,\nthey would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on\nwhich they stood.

He\nhas done nothing, nothing to warrant such —”\nHermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four\nStunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor\nMcGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams col-\nlided with her. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an\neerie red glow, then was lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her\nback, and moved no more.\n“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to\n721\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nhave forgotten the exam completely. “Not so much as a warning!

Indeed,\nhe was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious\ncolleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with\nFang still hung around his neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning\nSpell after him but it missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the\ndistant gates, disappeared into the darkness.\nThere was a long minute’s quivering silence, everybody gazing\nopenmouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty’s voice said fee-\nbly, “Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody . . .”\nThough he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was\ndesperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and\nHermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders\nand dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were\ngoing to bed — they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot\nof the stairs about what they had witnessed.\n“That evil woman!” gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having\ndifficulty talking due to rage. “Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the\ndead of night!”\n722\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nO.W.L.S\n“She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney’s,” said\nErnie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.\n“Hagrid did well, didn’t he?” said Ron, who looked more alarmed\nthan impressed. “How come all the spells bounced off him?”\n“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to\nStun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor\nMcGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not ex-\nactly young, is she?”\n“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously.\n“Well, I’m off to bed. . . . ’Night, all . . .”\nPeople around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about\nwhat they had just seen.\n“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron.\n“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?”\n“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is aw-\nful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now\nwe’ve lost Hagrid too. . . .”\nThey traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full.\nThe commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who\nhad hastened to rouse their friends.

Harry felt wide awake — the image of Hagrid sprinting away\ninto the dark was haunting him. He was so angry with Umbridge he\ncould not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron’s\nsuggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts\nhad its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and\narose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\nTheir final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that\nafternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after\nbreakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-\nminute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the\ncommon room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through\nsome of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione\nhad lent him.\nThe fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o’clock and took their\nplaces in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt ex-\nhausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep.\nThen tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch\npitch — he was going to have a fly on Ron’s broom and savor their\nfreedom from studying. . . .\n724\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nO.W.L.S\n“Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front\nof the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. “You may begin. . . .”\nHarry stared fixedly at the first question.

Harry, they can help.”\nHarry and Ron looked at her.\n“Listen,” she said urgently, “Harry, we need to establish whether\nSirius really has left headquarters —”\n“I’ve told you, I saw —”\n“Harry, I’m begging you, please!” said Hermione desperately.\n“Please let’s just check that Sirius isn’t at home before we go charging\noff to London — if we find out he’s not there then I swear I won’t try\nand stop you, I’ll come, I’ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save\nhim —”\n735\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n“Sirius is being tortured NOW!” shouted Harry. “We haven’t got\ntime to waste —”\n“But if this is a trick of V-Voldemort’s — Harry, we’ve got to check,\nwe’ve got to —”\n“How?” Harry demanded. “How’re we going to check?”\n“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire and see if we can contact him,”\nsaid Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. “We’ll\ndraw Umbridge away again, but we’ll need lookouts, and that’s where\nwe can use Ginny and Luna.”\nThough clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny\nsaid immediately, “Yeah, we’ll do it,” and Luna said, “When you say\n‘Sirius,’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman?”\nNobody answered her.\n“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can\nthink of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m go-\ning to the Department of Mysteries right now —”\n“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly sur-\nprised. “But how are you going to get there?”\nAgain, Harry ignored her.\n“Right,” said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up"

Two floors up he\nmet Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they\nwere planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the com-\nmon room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the por-\ntrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market\nbutterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the In-\nvisibility Cloak and Sirius’s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed\nhe had left them.\n“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle\nreckons he could sell us some firewhisky. . . .”\nBut Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a\ncouple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron,\nHermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end\nof Umbridge’s corridor.\n“Got it,” he panted. “Ready to go, then?”\n“All right,” whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years\npassed them. “So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny,\nLuna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry\nand I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear. . . .”\nRon strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the\npassage. Meanwhile, Ginny’s equally vivid head bobbed between the\njostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by\nLuna’s blonde one.\n“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and\npulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval\nwizard stood muttering to itself on a column. “Are — are you sure\nyou’re okay, Harry? You’re still very pale. . . .”\n“I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out\nof his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he\nthought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. It had hurt much\nworse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . . .\n738\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOUT OF THE FIRE\n“Here,” he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them\nand they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the\nbust in front of them.\n“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd. “No,\nsorry, you’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase,\nsomeone’s let off Garroting Gas just along here —”\nThey could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, “I can’t\nsee no gas . . .”\n“That’s because it’s colorless,” said Ginny in a convincingly exas-\nperated voice, “but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we’ll\nhave your body as proof for the next idiot who didn’t believe us. . . .”\nSlowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas\nseemed to have spread — people were not coming this way anymore."

Luna was\nstanding with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they\npassed Ginny, Hermione whispered, “Good one . . . don’t forget the\nsignal . . .”\n“What’s the signal?” muttered Harry, as they approached Urn-\nbridge’s door.\n“A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge com-\ning,” replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in\nthe crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they en-\ntered the office.\nThe garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine\nwarming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as\nlast time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.\n“I thought she might have added extra security after the second\nniffler. . . .”\nThey pulled off the cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window\n739\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\nand stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand\nout. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder,\nand threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into\nlife there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing\nfire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!”\nHis head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground\nride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office\nfloor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when\nthe spinning stopped, he opened them to find himself looking out\nupon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.\nThere was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not pre-\npared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst\nthrough his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room.\n“Sirius?” he shouted. “Sirius, are you there?”\nHis voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except\na tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire.\n“Who’s there?” he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.\nKreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. He looked highly\ndelighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sus-\ntained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.\n“It’s the Potter boy’s head in the fire,” Kreacher informed the empty\nkitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. “What\nhas he come for, Kreacher wonders?”\n“Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?” Harry demanded.\nThe house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. “Master has gone out, Harry\nPotter.”\n“Where’s he gone? Where’s he gone, Kreacher?”\nKreacher merely cackled.\n“I’m warning you!” said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflict-\ning punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position."

Harry could just make out the back\nof his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.\n“Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,” said the elf\nquietly.\n“But you know!” shouted Harry. “Don’t you? You know where\nhe is!”\nThere was a moment’s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle\nyet. “Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!”\nhe said gleefully. “Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again!”\nAnd he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the\nhall.\n“You — !”\nBut before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great\npain at the top of his head. He inhaled a lot of ash and, choking,\nfound himself being dragged backward through the flames until, with\na horrible abruptness, he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of\nProfessor Umbridge, who had dragged him backward out of the fire\nby the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as\nthough she was going to slit his throat.\n“You think,” she whispered, bending Harry’s neck back even far-\nther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, “that after\ntwo nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature\nenter my office without my knowledge?

You had your\nhead in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?”\n“No one —” said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt sev-\neral hairs part company with his scalp."

Now he could see Hermione pinioned against\nthe wall by Millicent Bulstrode.

All four of them had\nbeen gagged.\n“Got ’em all,” said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into\nthe room. “That one.” he poked a thick finger at Neville, “tried to stop\nme taking her,” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins\nof the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.”\n“Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching Ginny’s struggles. “Well,\nit looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone,\ndoesn’t it?”\nMalfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her\n742\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOUT OF THE FIRE\nwide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered arm-\nchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.\n“So, Potter,” she said. “You stationed lookouts around my office\nand you sent this buffoon,” she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed\neven louder, “to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the\nTransfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was\nbusy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr.\nFilch having just informed me so.\n“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it\nAlbus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Min-\nerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone. . . .”\nMalfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad\nlaughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and ha-\ntred he was shaking.\n“It’s none of your business who I talk to,” he snarled.\nUmbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten.\n“Very well,” she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice.\n“Very well, Mr. Potter . . .

Draco — fetch\nProfessor Snape.”\nMalfoy stowed Harry’s wand inside his robes and left the room\nsmirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized some-\nthing; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He\nhad thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could\nhelp him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong.

On Professor\nDumbledore’s orders, of course?”\n748\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOUT OF THE FIRE\n“Y-y-yes,” gasped Hermione. “But he had to leave before it was fin-\nished and n-n-now we’ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can’t find him\nt-t-to tell him!”\n“What kind of weapon is it?” said Umbridge harshly, her stubby\nhands still tight on Hermione’s shoulders.\n“We don’t r-r-really understand it,” said Hermione, sniffing loudly.\n“We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to\ndo . . .”\nUmbridge straightened up, looking exultant.\n“Lead me to the weapon,” she said.\n“I’m not showing . . . them,” said Hermione shrilly, looking around\nat the Slytherins through her fingers.\n“It is not for you to set conditions,” said Professor Umbridge\nharshly.\n“Fine,” said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again, “fine\n. . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you!

Th-that would serve\nyou right — oh, I’d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was,\nand how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they’ll be able\nto s-sort you out!”\nThese words had a powerful impact on Umbridge.

He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was\nwalking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged\nbreathing.\nHermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall. The\ndin of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out\nof the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry\nthat twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, cele-\nbrating the end of exams, not a care in the world. . . .\nHermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the\nstone steps into the balmy evening air.

The air was suddenly full of the sound of\nhooves.

Around fifty centaurs\nwere emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at\nHarry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center\nof the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror.\nHarry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant\nsmile.\n753\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“Who are you?” said a voice.\nHarry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian\nwas walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others’,\nwas raised. On Harry’s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her\nwand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.\n“I asked you who are you, human,” said Magorian roughly.\n“I am Dolores Umbridge!” said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terri-\nfied voice. “Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Head-\nmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!”\n“You are from the Ministry of Magic?” said Magorian, as many of\nthe centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.\n“That’s right!” said Umbridge in an even higher voice. “So be very\ncareful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation\nand Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as\nyourselves on a human —”\n“What did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur,\nwhom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry mut-\ntering and tightening of bowstrings around them.\n“Don’t call them that!” Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did\nnot appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at\nMagorian, she continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any at-\ntack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelli-\ngence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions —’”\n“‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and sev-\neral others roared with rage and pawed the ground. “We consider that\na great insult, human!

The sound of their wild, neighing laughter\nechoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing\nhooves was extremely unnerving.\n“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.\n“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her\nhead. “Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!”\n“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late — Umbridge\npointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, “Incarcerous!”\nRopes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves\ntightly around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry\nof rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while\nthe other centaurs charged.\nHarry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown\non the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered\naround him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing\nand screaming with rage.\n“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shriek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior\nUndersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . .\nnooooo!”\nHe saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun\none of them — then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few\ninches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by\nBane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.\nHer wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if\nhe could just reach it —\nBut as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended\nupon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.\n755\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“Now!” roared a voice in Harry’s ear and a thick hairy arm de-\nscended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had\nbeen pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and\nheads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through\nthe trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and\nfainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves\nsurrounding them.\n“And these?” said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione.\n“They are young,” said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry.\n“We do not attack foals.”\n“They brought her here, Ronan,” replied the centaur who had such\na firm grip on Harry. “And they are not so young. . . . He is nearing\nmanhood, this one. . . .”\nHe shook Harry by the neck of his robes.\n“Please,” said Hermione breathlessly, “please, don’t attack us, we\ndon’t think like her, we aren’t Ministry of Magic employees!

We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies\nlike obedient hounds?”\n“No!” said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. “Please — I didn’t\nmean that!

We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we\ndid your bidding!”\n756\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFIGHT AND FLIGHT\n“We’re not going to say anything like that!” Harry shouted. “We\nknow you didn’t do anything because we wanted you to —”\nBut nobody seemed to be listening to him. A bearded centaur to-\nward the back of the crowd shouted, “They came here unasked, they\nmust pay the consequences!”\nA roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur\nshouted, “They can join the woman!”\n“You said you didn’t hurt the innocent!” shouted Hermione, real\ntears sliding down her face now. “We haven’t done anything to hurt\nyou, we haven’t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to\nschool, please let us go back —”\n“We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!” shouted the\ngray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows.\n“Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient peo-\nple who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recog-\nnize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are —”\nBut they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment\nthere came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all\nof them — Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the\nclearing — looked around. Harry’s centaur let him fall to the ground\nagain as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione\nhad been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree\ntrunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant\nappeared in the gap.\nThe centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing\nwas now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing\nupward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from\njust beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp’s lopsided mouth\nwas gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glim-\nmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he\nsquinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from\nboth ankles."

Not only\nhad Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the mid-\ndle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.\n“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury.\n“Really smart plan.

Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the\nwindow and followed.

His scar gave another, more painful,\ntwinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have\ntime to argue.\n“Okay, fine, it’s your choice,” he said curtly. “But unless we can find\nmore thestrals you’re not going to be able —”\n“Oh, more of them will come,” said Ginny confidently, who like\nRon was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the\nimpression that she was looking at the horses.\n“What makes you think that?”\n“Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both\ncovered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thes-\ntrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the\nfirst place. . . .”\nHarry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down\nto see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with\nGrawp’s blood.\n“Okay, then,” he said, a bright idea occurring. “Ron and I will take\nthese two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three\nand she’ll attract more thestrals —”\n“I’m not staying behind!” said Hermione furiously.\n“There’s no need,” said Luna, smiling. “Look, here come more\nnow. . . . You two must really smell. . . .”\nHarry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking\ntheir way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded\ntight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He\nhad no excuse now. . . ."

How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All\nHarry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort\nwanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would\ncause him to feel Voldemort’s jubilation or fury course through his\nown body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr.\nWeasley was attacked. . . .\nOn they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry’s face felt stiff\nand cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral’s sides so tightly,\nbut he did not dare shift positions lest he slip. . . .

He made as though to\nstride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its\nhindquarters and almost fell over again. “Never, ever again . . . that\nwas the worst —”\nHermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him.

The scavenging thes-\ntrals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and\nwith a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Min-\nistry of Magic.\nA chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up\ntheir bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he\ncould in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see\nwhether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed\nto be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by\nday. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the\n768\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEPARTMENT\nOF MYSTERIES\nwalls, but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols\ncontinued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.\n“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the\nwoman’s voice.\nThe door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of\nit, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was\nthe steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the\nwands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the\ntip of the goblin’s hat, and the house-elf’s ears continued to gush into\nthe surrounding pool.\n“Come on,” said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off\ndown the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk\nwhere the security man who had weighed Harry’s wand had sat and\nwhich was now deserted.\nHarry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure\nthat their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding\nincreased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He\npressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost\nimmediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clank-\ning, and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button,\nthe grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling\nand rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the\nday that he had come with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din\nwould raise every security person within the building, yet when the\nlift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and\nthe grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where\nnothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of\nair from the lift.\nHarry turned toward the plain black door.

He turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as\nit had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading\nthe others over the threshold.\nThey were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here\nwas black including the floor and ceiling — identical, unmarked,\nhandle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls,\ninterspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their\ncool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it\nlooked as though there was dark water underfoot.\n“Someone shut the door,” Harry muttered.\nHe regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it.\nWithout the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind\nthem, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they\ncould see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and\ntheir ghostly reflections in the floor below.\nIn his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this\nroom to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on.\nBut there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead\nat the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one,\nthere was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move side-\nways. The circular wall was rotating.\nHermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor\nmight move too, but it did not. For a few seconds the blue flames\naround them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped\n770\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEPARTMENT\nOF MYSTERIES\naround and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling\nstopped and everything became stationary once again.\nHarry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could\nsee.\n“What was that about?” whispered Ron fearfully.\n“I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,”\nsaid Ginny in a hushed voice.\nHarry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have\npicked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-\nblack floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to pro-\nceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them.\n“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.\n“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to\ntry and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand\ntighter than ever. “We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”\n“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but\nHarry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as\nquiet as possible for the time being.\n“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.\n“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went\nthrough the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark\nroom — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into"

It\nswung open easily.\nAfter the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on\ngolden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rec-\ntangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering,\nshimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place\n771\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\nwas quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the\nroom, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all\nof them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects\nthat were drifting around lazily in the liquid.\n“What’re those things?” whispered Ron.\n“Dunno,” said Harry.\n“Are they fish?” breathed Ginny.\n“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna excitedly. “Dad said the Ministry\nwere breeding —”\n“No,” said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to\nlook through the side of the tank. “They’re brains.”\n“Brains?”\n“Yes . . . I wonder what they’re doing with them?”\nHarry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mis-\ntake now that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they\ndrifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking\nsomething like slimy cauliflowers.\n“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry. “This isn’t right, we need to try\nanother door —”\n“There are doors here too,” said Ron, pointing around the walls.\nHarry’s heart sank; how big was this place?\n“In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,”\nhe said. “I think we should go back and try from there.”\nSo they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly\nshapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry’s eyes instead\nof the blue candle flames.\n“Wait!” said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of\nthe brain room behind them. “Flagrate!”\nShe drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the\ndoor. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there\nwas a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very\nfast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue,\n772\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEPARTMENT\nOF MYSTERIES\nand when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing\nthe door they had already tried.\n“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Okay, let’s try this one —”\nAgain he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open,\nhis wand still raised, the others at his heels."

They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to\nbe stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep\nsteps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been\ntried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was\na raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon this dais\nstood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling\nthat Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by\nany surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black cur-\ntain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surround-\ning air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.\n“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below.\nThere was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway.\n“Careful!” whispered Hermione.\nHarry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the\nstone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he\nwalked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much\ntaller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down\non it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had\njust passed through it.\n“Sirius?” Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he\nwas nearer.\nHe had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right\nbehind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand\nvery tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All\nthat could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.\n773\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\n“Let’s go,” called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. “This\nisn’t right, Harry, come on, let’s go. . . .”\nShe sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room\nwhere the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of\nbeauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued\nhim; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk\nthrough it.\n“Harry, let’s go, okay?” said Hermione more forcefully.\n“Okay,” he said, but he did not move. He had just heard some-\nthing. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from\nthe other side of the veil.\n“What are you saying?” he said very loudly, so that the words\nechoed all around the surrounding stone benches.\n“Nobody’s talking, Harry!” said Hermione, now moving over to\nhim.\n“Someone’s whispering behind there,” he said, moving out of her\nreach and continuing to frown at the veil. “Is that you, Ron?”\n“I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appearing around the side of the arch-\nway.\n“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering"

He led the way forward down the narrow space be-\ntween the lines of the desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for\nthe source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that\nstood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering\nwind.\n“Oh look!” said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very\nheart of the bell jar.\n776\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEPARTMENT\nOF MYSTERIES\nDrifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-\nbright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird\nemerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on\nthe draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the\ntime it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been en-\nclosed once more in its egg.\n“Keep going!” said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of\nwanting to stop and watch the egg’s progress back into a bird.\n“You dawdled enough by that old arch!” she said crossly, but fol-\nlowed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.\n“This is it,” Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so\nhard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech. “It’s through\nhere —”\nHe glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and\nlooked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door\nand pushed. It swung open.\nThey were there, they had found the place: high as a church and\nfull of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs."

Ron was pointing at one of the small\nglass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very\ndusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.\n“My name?” said Harry blankly.\nHe stepped forward.

As\nhe did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna\nrose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened.

He pointed his wand at it and muttered,\n“Portus.” The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the\nwooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.\n“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked\nup the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. “You haven’t got\nauthorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in\nfront of the Minister of Magic, you — you —”\nHis voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over\nhis half-moon spectacles.\n“You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hog-\nwarts,” said Dumbledore. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching\nfor my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to\nwork.

The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-\nlegged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the\nheadmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads\nlolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures. Harry\nlooked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along\nthe horizon: Dawn was approaching.\nThe silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or\nsnuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his sur-\nroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures\nwould have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet,\nbeautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to\nthink. . . . There was no escape. . . .\nIt was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had\n820\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nnot been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not\nbeen so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he\nhad only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as\nHermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero . . .\nIt was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand\nit. . . . There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel\nor examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had van-\nished. He did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent\nspace, he could not stand it —\nA picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and\na cool voice said, “Ah . . . Harry Potter . . .”\nPhineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he\nwatched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes.\n“And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?” said\nPhineas. “This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful\nheadmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . .”\nHe gave another shuddering yawn. “Another message for my worth-\nless great-great-grandson?”\nHarry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius\nwas dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to\nmake it final, absolute, irretrievable.\nA few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being inter-\nrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.\nIt would not turn. He was shut in.\n“I hope this means,” said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who\nhung on the wall behind Dumbledore’s desk, “that Dumbledore will\nsoon be back with us?”\nHarry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry\nnodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it\nremained immovable.\n“Oh good,” said the wizard. “It has been very dull without him,\nvery dull indeed.”\n821\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nHe settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been"

Holds you in great esteem.”\nThe guilt filling the whole of Harry’s chest like some monstrous,\nweighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand\nthis, he could not stand being Harry anymore. . . . He had never felt\nmore trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely\nthat he could be somebody — anybody — else. . . .\nThe empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry\nleap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate.\nAs Dumbledore’s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards\nand witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them\ngave cries of welcome.\n“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly.\nHe did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch be-\nside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the\ntiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of\nsoft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usu-\nally stood.\n“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the\nbaby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow stu-\ndents are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.”\nHarry tried to say “Good,” but no sound came out. It seemed to\nhim that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage\nhe had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was\nfor once looking at him directly, and though his expression was kindly\nrather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes.\n“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumble-\ndore. “Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St.\nMungo’s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.”\n822\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nHarry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was\ngrowing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure that all the\nportraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dum-\nbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been\nand why there had been injuries.\n“I know how you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore very\nquietly.\n“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and\nstrong. White-hot anger leapt inside him. Dumbledore knew nothing\nabout his feelings.\n“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly. “Never try to\nunderstand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be\ntragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —”\n“That’s enough, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.\nHarry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly\nout of the opposite window.

You don’t know . . .”\n“What don’t I know?” asked Dumbledore calmly.\nIt was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.\n823\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\n“I don’t want to talk about how I feel, all right?”\n“Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is\npart of being human —”\n“THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN!”\nHarry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from\nthe spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It\nshattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the\npictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando\nDippet said, “Really!”\n“I DON’T CARE!” Harry yelled at them, snatching up a luna-\nscope and throwing it into the fireplace. “I’VE HAD ENOUGH,\nI’VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I\nDON’T CARE ANYMORE —”\nHe seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and\nthrew that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in dif-\nferent directions.\n“You do care,” said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a\nsingle move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was\ncalm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will\nbleed to death with the pain of it.”\n“I — DON’T!” Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat\nmight tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and\nbreak him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make\nhim feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry.\n“Oh yes, you do,” said Dumbledore, still more calmly. “You have\nnow lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent\nyou have ever known. Of course you care.”\n“YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!” Harry roared. “YOU —\nSTANDING THERE — YOU —”\nBut words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more\nhelp.

If you are to attack me, as I know\nyou are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.”\n“What are you talking — ?”\n“It is my fault that Sirius died,” said Dumbledore clearly. “Or I\nshould say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to\nclaim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and ener-\ngetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hid-\ning while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should\nnever have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you\nto go to the Department of Mysteries tonight.

He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, lis-\ntening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.\n“Please sit down,” said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a\nrequest.\nHarry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered\nwith silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dum-\nbledore’s desk.\n“Am I to understand,” said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry’s\nleft, “that my great-great-grandson — the last of the Blacks — is\ndead?”\n“Yes, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.\n“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely.\nHarry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his"

He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait,\ncalling for Sirius through the house. . . .\n“Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore. “An explana-\ntion of an old man’s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done,\nand not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the fail-\nings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men\nare guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have\nforgotten lately. . . .”\nThe sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling or-\nange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and\nbright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eye-\nbrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face.\n“I guessed, fifteen years ago,” said Dumbledore, “when I saw the\n826\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nscar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might\nbe the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.”\n“You’ve told me this before, Professor,” said Harry bluntly. He did\nnot care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much\nanymore.\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore apologetically. “Yes, but you see — it is\nnecessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after\nyou rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar\nwas giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else\nfeeling powerful emotion.”\n“I know,” said Harry wearily.\n“And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort’s presence, even\nwhen he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emo-\ntions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since\nVoldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.”\nHarry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.\n“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that\nVoldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure\nenough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and\nthoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the\nnight when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.”\n“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered.\n“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “But\ndid you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why\nI did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked\nat you for months?”\nHarry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad\nand tired.\n“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Yeah, I wondered.”\n“You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily “I believed it could not\nbe long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind,\nto manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to\n827\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN"

I was sure that if he realized that\nour relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of head-\nmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to\nspy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibil-\nity that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to\nthink that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On\nthose rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a\nshadow of him stir behind your eyes. . . . I was trying, in distancing\nmyself from you, to protect you. An old man’s mistake . . .”\nHarry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in\nhim, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore\nmade eye contact.\n“Voldemort’s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight,\nwould not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He\nhoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would\nsacrifice you in the hope of killing him.”\nHe sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He\nwould have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and\nnow it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that\nwas the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered . . .\n“Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very\nnight that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley’s attack. I knew at\nonce that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had\nrealized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Volde-\nmort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with\nProfessor Snape.”\nHe paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly\nacross the polished surface of Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver\nink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the por-\ntraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumble-\ndore’s explanation. He could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the\nslight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . .\n828\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\n“Professor Snape discovered,” Dumbledore resumed, “that you had\nbeen dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for\nmonths.

He said it aloud to try and ease the\ndead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some\nof the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. “I didn’t practice, I didn’t\nbother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione\nkept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me\nwhere to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —”\nSomething was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need to justify him-\nself, to explain —\n“I tried to check he’d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge’s of-\nfice, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn’t there, he\nsaid he’d gone!”\n“Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore calmly. “You are not his master,\nhe could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher\nintended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.”\n“He — he sent me on purpose?”\n“Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one\nmaster for months.”\n“How?” said Harry blankly. “He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld\nPlace for years.”\n829\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\n“Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said\nDumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’\nHe took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the\nhouse. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had\nany respect left. . . . Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife\nof Lucius Malfoy.”\n“How do you know all this?” Harry said. His heart was beating very\nfast. He felt sick.

Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grim-\nmauld Place.\n“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest\nwith Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still\nbelieved Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s. He alerted certain\nOrder members at once.”\nDumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, “Alastor Moody,\nNymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at\nheadquarters when he made contact.

He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not\ngive the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order’s con-\nfidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal.

But he gave Narcissa\ninformation of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must\nhave seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from\nrepeating it.”\n“Like what?” said Harry.\n“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world\nwas you,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Like the fact that you were com-\ning to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.

Then, if you decided to\ncheck whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to\npretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yester-\nday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire,\nSirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.”\nThere seemed to be very little air in Harry’s lungs, his breathing was\nquick and shallow.\n“And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?” he croaked.\n831\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\n“He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a suffi-\nciently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied\nto and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for\nthe Department of Mysteries.”\n“And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees,\n“and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him —”\n“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius\nwhen we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that"

His existence has been as miserable as\nyour friend Dobby’s. He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sir-\nius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no\ntrue loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher’s faults, it must be admit-\nted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher’s lot easier —”\n“DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled.\nHe was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who\nhad plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much\nhe had suffered . . .\n“What about Snape?” Harry spat. “You’re not talking about him,\nare you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me\nas usual —”\n“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pre-\ntend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,” said\n832\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nDumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order\nas soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced\nwhere you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was\nhe too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was\nattempting to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts. . . .”\nHarry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape,\nit seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted\nto hear Dumbledore agree with him.\n“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he\nmade out Sirius was a coward —”\n“Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble\ntaunts to hurt him,” said Dumbledore.\n“Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!” Harry snarled.\n“He threw me out of his office!”\n“I am aware of it,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I have already said\nthat it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was\nsure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than\nto open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my\npresence —”\n“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with\nhim —” Harry remembered Ron’s thoughts on the subject and"

I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about\nyour father — I was wrong.”\n“But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces\nand disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. “It’s\nokay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate\nKreacher?”\n“Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said Dumbledore. “He regarded\n833\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nhim as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference\nand neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . .\nThe fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mis-\ntreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping\nour reward.”\n“SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry\nyelled.\n“I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore\nreplied quietly. “Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves\nin general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living\nreminder of the home Sirius had hated.”\n“Yeah, he did hate it!” said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his\nback on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the\nroom now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked,\nwithout realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all.\n“You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why\nhe wanted to get out last night —”\n“I was trying to keep Sirius alive,” said Dumbledore quietly.\n“People don’t like being locked up!” Harry said furiously, rounding\non him. “You did it to me all last summer —”\nDumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered\nhands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaus-\ntion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften\nhim. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was\nshowing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when\nHarry wanted to rage and storm at him.\nDumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his\nhalf-moon glasses.\n“It is time,” he said, “for me to tell you what I should have told you\nfive years ago, Harry.

Dumbledore stared for a mo-\nment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at\nHarry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe\nand whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole.\nYou had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and\nuncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and diffi-\ncult years.”\nHe paused. Harry said nothing.\n“You might ask — and with good reason — why it had to be so.\nWhy could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many\nwould have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and\ndelighted to raise you as a son.\n“My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in\nmore danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had\nbeen vanquished hours before, but his supporters — and many of\nthem are almost as terrible as he — were still at large, angry, desper-\nate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the\nyears ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I\nknew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he re-\nturned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing\nhim as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.\n“I knew that Voldemort’s knowledge of magic is perhaps more ex-\ntensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and\npowerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if\nhe ever returned to full power.\n“But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my\ndecision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which\nhe knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,\n835\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nunderestimated — to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact\nthat your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection\nhe never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I\nput my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood. I delivered you to her\nsister, her only remaining relative.”\n“She doesn’t love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn’t give a\ndamn —”\n“But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have\ntaken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took\nyou, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your\nmother’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could\ngive you.”\n“I still don’t —”\n“While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood\ndwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He\nshed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became\nyour refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you\ncan still call it home, there he cannot hurt you.

You told her to remember — it was your\nvoice —”\n“I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she\nmight need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I sus-\npected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of\nhaving you as a surrogate son.”\n“It did,” said Harry quietly. “Well — my uncle more than her. He\nwanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she — she said I\n836\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nhad to stay.” He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, “But\nwhat’s this got to do with . . .”\nHe could not say Sirius’s name.\n“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had\nnot paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy\nnor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and\nhealthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as\nI could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was\nworking well.\n“And then . . . well, you will remember the events of your first year\nat Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the\nchallenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had\nanticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You sur-\nvived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and\nstrength. You fought a man’s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can\nsay.\n“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumb-\nledore. “An obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undo-\ning of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan\nshould succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin\nit. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was\nmy first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle\nwith Voldemort.”\n“I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry.\n“Don’t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing,\nwhy Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?”\nHarry nodded.\n“Ought I to have told you then?”\nHarry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was\nracing again.\n“You do not see the flaw in the plan yet?

We came very, very close to the subject.\nWhy did I not tell you everything?\n“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than\neleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my pres-\nence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of\nunease that I ought, perhaps, have told you then, it was swiftly si-\nlenced.

Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now?\nI had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could\navoid, that I must avoid.”\n“I don’t —”\n“I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared\nmore for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your\npeace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that\nmight be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as\nVoldemort expects we fools who love to act.\n“Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have —\n838\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST PROPHECY\nand I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined —\nnot to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered.\nWhat did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and crea-\ntures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you\nwere alive, and well, and happy?

My only\ndefense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens\nthan any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could\nnot bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.”\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.\n“I still don’t understand.”\n“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a\nprophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had\nbeen made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to\nkill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the\nterms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mis-\ntaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his\nreturn to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape\nfrom him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in\n839\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\nits entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously\nsince his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”\nThe sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it.\nThe glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided\ngleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry\nhad thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the\nbaby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.\n“The prophecy’s smashed,” Harry said blankly. “I was pulling\nNeville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was,\nand I ripped his robes and it fell. . . .”\n“The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy\nkept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to\nsomebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.”\n“Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the an-\nswer already.\n“I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago,\nin a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn. I had gone there to see\nan applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against\nmy inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all.\nThe applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very\nfamous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet\nher. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the\ngift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she\nwould be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.”\nDumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cab-\ninet that stood beside Fawkes’s perch. He bent down, slid back a\ncatch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with\nrunes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father torment-\ning Snape.

Neither Dumbledore\nnor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had\nfallen silent.\n“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore,\nstill staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. “It . . .\ndid that mean . . . What did that mean?”\n“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only\nchance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end\nof July, nearly sixteen years ago.

He chose, not the pureblood\n(which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being\nor knowing), but the half-blood, like himself.

The Ministry is currently publishing guides to\nelementary home and personal defense that will be\n845\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\ndelivered free to all Wizarding homes within the\ncoming month.”\nThe Minister’s statement was met with dismay and\nalarm from the Wizarding community, which as re-\ncently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry as-\nsurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these\npersistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating\namongst us once more.”\nDetails of the events that led to the Ministry turn-\naround are still hazy, though it is believed that He-\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of\nfollowers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to\nthe Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.\nAlbus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster\nof Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, re-\ninstated member of the International Confederation\nof Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wiz-\nengamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He\nhas insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not\ndead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruit-\ning followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize\npower. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived —\n“There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,”\nsaid Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him.\nThey were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of\nRon’s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front\npage of the Sunday Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in\na trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione’s\nbed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size\nand shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had\ndropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was\n846\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nreading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a\nword Hermione was saying.\n“He’s ‘the Boy Who Lived’ again now, though, isn’t he?” said Ron\ndarkly. “Not such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?”\nHe helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the im-"

There\nwere still deep welts on his forearms where the brain’s tentacles had\nwrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could\nleave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had\nstarted applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unc-\ntion, there seemed to be some improvement.\n“Yes, they’re very complimentary about you now, Harry,” said\nHermione, now scanning down the article. “‘A lone voice of truth . . .\nperceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear\nridicule and slander . . .’ Hmmm,” said Hermione, frowning, “I notice\nthey don’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing\nand slandering, though. . . .”\nShe winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov\nhad used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he\nbeen able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in\nMadam Pomfrey’s words, “quite enough damage to be going on with.”\nHermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day\nand although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the\nhospital wing.\n“‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What\nthe Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Al-\nbus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Pot-\nter, page nine . . .’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up the newspaper\nand throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.\nAnd that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in\nThe Quibbler months ago. . . .”\n847\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n“Daddy sold it to them,” said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The\nQuibbler. “He got a very good price for it too, so we’re going to go on\nan expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a\nCrumple-Horned Snorkack.”\nHermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said,\n“That sounds lovely.”\nGinny caught Harry’s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.\n“So anyway,” said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and winc-\ning again, “what’s going on in school?”\n“Well, Flitwick’s got rid of Fred and George’s swamp,” said Ginny.\n“He did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the\nwindow and he’s roped it off —”\n“Why?” said Hermione, looking startled.\n“Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,” said Ginny,\nshrugging.\n“I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,” said Ron\nthrough a mouthful of chocolate. “They sent me all these, you know,”\nhe told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him."

Professor Umbridge was lying in a\nbed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode\nalone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had\ndone it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor\nUmbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and\n848\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nUmbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the cas-\ntle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. No-\nbody really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat\nmousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it,\nbut otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n“Madam Pomfrey says she’s just in shock,” whispered Hermione.\n“Sulking, more like,” said Ginny\n“Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,” said Ron, and with his\ntongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright,\nlooking wildly around.\n“Anything wrong, Professor?” called Madam Pomfrey, poking her\nhead around her office door.\n“No . . . no . . .” said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows,\n“no, I must have been dreaming. . . .”\nHermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n“Speaking of centaurs,” said Hermione, when she had recovered a\nlittle, “who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?”\n“He’s got to,” said Harry, “the other centaurs won’t take him back,\nwill they?”\n“It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,” said\nGinny.\n“Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for\ngood,” said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. “Mind you,\nthe whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better. . . .”\n“How can you say that?” Hermione demanded. “After we’ve just\nfound out that there are real prophecies?”\nHarry’s heart began to race.

Everybody was\nclearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and\nthe prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or\nhomework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering\nout of windows as he went. He could see people messing around in\nthe air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming\nin the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.\nHe was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted\nto be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to\nget away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought\nhe might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him\nproperly since he had returned. . . .\nHarry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall\nwhen Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right\nthat Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry\nstopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the\nonly sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the\nhall from the grounds through the open front doors.\n850\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nMalfoy glanced around. Harry knew he was checking for signs of\nteachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice,\n“You’re dead, Potter.”\nHarry raised his eyebrows. “Funny,” he said, “you’d think I’d have\nstopped walking around. . . .”\nMalfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind\nof detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted\nwith rage.\n“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a\nwhisper. “I’m going to make you pay for what you’ve done to my\nfather. . . .”"

Not\nscared of him, are you?”\n“You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing\nnow, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. “You wait. I’ll have you. You\ncan’t land my father in prison —”\n“I thought I just had,” said Harry.\n“The dementors have left Azkaban,” said Malfoy quietly. “Dad and\nthe others’ll be out in no time. . . .”\n“Yeah, I expect they will,” said Harry. “Still, at least everyone\nknows what scumbags they are now —”\nMalfoy’s hand flew toward his wand, but Harry was too quick for\nhim. He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy’s fingers had even\nentered the pocket of his robes.\n“Potter!”\nThe voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the\nstaircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a\ngreat rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy. . . .

I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-\nglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to —”\n“Add some more?”\nProfessor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the\ncastle. She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning\nheavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite\nwell.\n“Professor McGonagall!” said Snape, striding forward. “Out of St.\nMungo’s, I see!”\n“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off\nher traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe —\nGoyle —”\nShe beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling\ntheir large feet and looking awkward.\n“Here,” said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into\nCrabbe’s chest and her cloak into Goyle’s, “take these up to my office\nfor me.”\nThey turned and stumped away up the marble staircase."

He thrust his wand back inside\nhis robes and headed straight for the front doors without another\nglance at Snape and Malfoy.\nThe hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns\ntoward Hagrid’s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sun-\nbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets\nlooked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else\nwaved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided\nhe was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He\nhad no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days\nago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it\nthat way.\nHe thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid’s cabin door that\nhe was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and al-\nmost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome.

The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the\nforest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was posi-\ntively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy nec-\nessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again,\nand with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large\ngulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.\n“Ev’ryone knows you’ve bin tellin’ the truth now, Harry,” said Ha-\ngrid softly and unexpectedly. “Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it?”\nHarry shrugged.\n“Look . . .” Hagrid leaned toward him across the table, “I knew\n854\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nSirius longer ’n you did. . . .

Sirius had given it to him\njust inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need\nme, all right?\nHarry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out\nfell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry\nheld it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.\nHe turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled\nnote from Sirius.\n857\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\nThis is a two-way mirror.

He looked back at the mirror, raised it in\nfront of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly,\n“Sirius.”\nHis breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even\ncloser, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at\nhim through the fog were definitely his own.\nHe wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang\nclearly through the room, “Sirius Black!”\nNothing happened.

They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his\nCharms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconso-\nlately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the\nfeast . . .\nBut just as he had given up hope he saw it — a translucent some-\nbody drifting across the end of the corridor.\n“Hey — hey Nick! NICK!”\nThe ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extrav-\nagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de\nMimsy-Porpington.\n“Good evening,” he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the\nsolid stone and smiling at Harry. “I am not the only one who is late,\nthen? Though,” he sighed, “in rather different senses, of course . . .”\n“Nick, can I ask you something?”\nA most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick’s face as\nhe inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little\nstraighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only\nwhen his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.\n“Er — now, Harry?” said Nick, looking discomforted. “Can’t it\nwait until after the feast?”\n859\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n“No — Nick — please,” said Harry, “I really need to talk to you.\nCan we go in here?”\nHarry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Head-\nless Nick sighed.\n“Oh very well,” he said, looking resigned. “I can’t pretend I haven’t\nbeen expecting it.”\nHarry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through\nthe wall instead."

But you’re still here, aren’t you?”\nNick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.\n“That’s right, isn’t it?” Harry urged him. “You died, but I’m talking\nto you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can’t you?”\n“Yes,” said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, “I walk and talk, yes.”\n“So, you came back, didn’t you?” said Harry urgently. “People can\ncome back, right? As ghosts. They don’t have to disappear completely.\nWell?” he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.\nNearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come\nback as a ghost.”\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.\n“Only . . . only wizards.”\n“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s\nokay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come\nback, right?”\n860\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nNick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at\nHarry. “He won’t come back.”\n“Who?”\n“Sirius Black,” said Nick.\n“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back — you’re dead\nand you didn’t disappear —”\n“Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to\nwalk palely where their living selves once trod,” said Nick miserably.\n“But very few wizards choose that path.”\n“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius\nwon’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!”\nAnd so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to\ncheck the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius,\npearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward\nhim.\n“He will not come back,” repeated Nick quietly. “He will have . . .\ngone on.”\n“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” said Harry quickly. “Gone on\nwhere? Listen — what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you\ngo? Why doesn’t everyone come back? Why isn’t this place full of\nghosts? Why — ?”\n“I cannot answer,” said Nick.\n“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Harry exasperatedly. “Who can an-\nswer better than you?”\n“I was afraid of death,” said Nick. “I chose to remain behind. I"

In fact, I am neither here nor there. . . .” He gave\na small sad chuckle. “I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for\nI chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards\nstudy the matter in the Department of Mysteries —”\n“Don’t talk to me about that place!” said Harry fiercely.\n861\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n“I am sorry not to have been more help,” said Nick gently. “Well\n. . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .”\nAnd he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at\nthe wall through which Nick had disappeared.\nHarry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again\nin losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once\nmore. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty\ncastle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.\nHe had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady’s corridor when he\nsaw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A sec-\nond glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding\nplaces nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any\ncase, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the\nmoment.\n“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped\nback from the notice.\n“How come you’re not at the feast?” Harry asked.\n“Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions,” said Luna serenely. “Peo-\nple take them and hide them, you know. But as it’s the last night, I re-\nally do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.”\nShe gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough,\nshe had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea\nfor their return.\nAn odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from\nthe anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death. It was a few\nmoments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna.\n“How come people hide your stuff?” he asked her, frowning.\n“Oh . . . well . . .” She shrugged. “I think they think I’m a bit odd,\nyou know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.”\nHarry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather\npainfully.\n862\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\n“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly.\n“D’you want help finding them?”\n“Oh no,” she said, smiling at him. “They’ll come back, they always\ndo in the end.

That man the Death Eaters killed\nwas your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.”\nHarry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not\nmind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she too\ncould see thestrals.\n“Have you . . .” he began. “I mean, who . . . has anyone you’ve\nknown ever died?”\n“Yes,” said Luna simply, “my mother. She was a quite extraordinary\nwitch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells\nwent rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.”\n“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.\n“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said Luna conversationally. “I still feel\nvery sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s\nnot as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it?”\n“Er — isn’t it?” said Harry uncertainly.\nShe shook her head in disbelief. “Oh, come on. You heard them,\njust behind the veil, didn’t you?”\n“You mean . . .”\n“In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of\nsight, that’s all. You heard them.”\nThey looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not\nknow what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary\nthings . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil\ntoo. . . .\n863\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\n“Are you sure you don’t want me to help you look for your stuff?”\nhe said.\n“Oh no,” said Luna. “No, I think I’ll just go down and have some\npudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end.\n. . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.”\n“Yeah . . . yeah, you too.”\nShe walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that\nthe terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.\nThe journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in\nseveral ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been\nwaiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher wit-\nnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he\nmade his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded\nhad it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the at-\ntack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw\nwhat was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to\nHarry’s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan\nBones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot\nhad finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had\ntaught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much\nas three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry,\nErnie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them\nthere to ooze."

Ernie had never quite got over the\nindignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief\nspell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.\n“Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had\ncome to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads better-\n864\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nlooking now. . . .

Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again,\nGinny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his\nMimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year\nand now made odd crooning noises when touched.\nHarry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard\nchess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now\nfull of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Min-\nistry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that\nthe writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very\nmorning. . . .\n“It hasn’t really started yet,” sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up\nthe newspaper again. “But it won’t be long now. . . .”\n“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the\ncorridor.\nHarry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta\nEdgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho’s eyes met for\na moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down\nat the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its\nsquare by Ron’s knight.\n“What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?” Ron asked\nquietly.\n“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.\n“I — er — heard she’s going out with someone else now,” said\nHermione tentatively.\nHarry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at\nall.

Ron looked highly delighted.\n“Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding\nhis queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle. “Good for you.\nJust choose someone — better — next time.”\nHe cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.\n“Well, I’ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he’s better?” asked\nGinny vaguely.\n“WHAT?” shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks\nwent plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered\nand hooted angrily from overhead.\nAs the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, Harry\nthought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleet-\ningly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained\n866\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SECOND\nWAR BEGINS\nstubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would\ntake him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill,\nhowever, he lifted down Hedwig’s cage and prepared to drag his trunk\nfrom the train as usual.\nWhen the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione\nthat it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms\nnine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other\nside: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not\nexpected at all.\nThere was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his\nbowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done\nwithout it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped\nin a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her\nbright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering\nthrough the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans\nand a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend .\nthe weird sisters\nNext to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and\nthreadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the\nfront of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Mug-\ngle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new\njackets in some lurid green, scaly material.\n“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging\nher children tightly. “Oh, and Harry dear — how are you?”\n“Fine,” lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace.

Sure enough, Uncle\nVernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but\nchose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were\noutnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and\nembarrassed. She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody\nshe knew would see her in such company.
