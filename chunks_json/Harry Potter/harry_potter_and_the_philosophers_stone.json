He was a big, beefy man with hardl y any neck, al though he did\nhave a very large mus tache. Mrs. Durs ley was thin and blonde and had\nnear ly twice the usua l amount of neck, which came in very usef ul as she\nspent so much of her time cran ing over gard en fences, spyi ng on the neigh -\nbors. The Durs leys had a small son called Dudl ey and in their opin ion there\nwas no fin er boy any where.\nThe Durs leys had eve ryt hing they wante d, but they als o had a sec ret,\nand their greate st fear was that some body would dis cove r it. They didn’t\nthink they could bear it if anyo ne found out about the Pot ters. Mrs. Pot ter\nwas Mrs. Durs ley’s sist er, but they hadn’t met for seve r al years; in fact,\nMrs. Durs ley pret end ed she didn’t have a sis ter, bec ause her sis ter and her\ngood-f or- noth ing husb and were as un Durs ley ish as it was poss i ble to be.\nThe Durs leys shudd ered to think what the neigh bors would say if the Pot -\nters ar rived in the street. The Dursl eys knew that the Pot ters had a small\nson, too, but they had neve r even seen him.

He got in to his\ncar and backed out of numb er four’s drive.\nIt was on the corn er of the street that he not iced the first sign of\nsome thing pec ul iar — a cat read ing a map. For a seco nd, Mr. Durs ley didn’t\nre al ize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again.\nThere was a tab by cat stand ing on the corn er of Priv et Drive, but there\nwasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinki ng of? It must have\nbeen a trick of the light. Mr. Durs ley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared\nback. As Mr. Durs ley drove around the corn er and up the road, he watched\nthe cat in his mir ror. It was now read ing the sign that said Priv et Drive —\nno, look ing at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursl ey gave\nhims elf a lit tle shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove to ward\ntown he thought of noth ing exc ept a large or der of drills he was hop ing to\nget that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driv en out of his mind by some -\nthing else. As he sat in the usua l morn ing traffi c jam, he couldn’t help notic -\ning that there seemed to be a lot of strangel y dressed peop le about. Peo ple\nin cloaks. Mr. Durs ley couldn’t bear peop le who dressed in funn y clothes —\nthe getups you saw on young peop le! He supp osed this was some stupid\nnew fash ion. He drummed his fing ers on the steeri ng wheel and his eyes fell\non a hud dle of these weirdos stand ing quite close by. They were whisp eri ng\nexc ite dl y tog eth er. Mr. Durs ley was enr aged to see that a cou ple of them\nweren’t young at all; why, that man had to be old er than he was, and wear -\ning an emera ld-g reen cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Durs -\nley that this was proba bly some sill y stunt —these peop le were obv i ousl y\ncol lect ing for somet hing…yes, that would be it. The traffi c moved on and a\nfew minu tes late r, Mr. Durs ley ar rived in the Grun nings parki ng lot, his\nmind back on drills.\nMr. Durs ley al ways sat with his back to the win dow in his of fice on\nthe ninth floor.

Most of them had neve r seen an owl even\nat nightt ime. Mr. Durs ley, howe ve r, had a perf ectl y norm al, owl-f ree morn -\ning. He yelled at five diff er ent peop le. He made seve r al imp ort ant tele phone\ncalls and shout ed a bit more. He was in a very good mood un til lunchtime,\nwhen he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy him -\nself a bun from the bak ery.\nHe’d for got ten all about the peop le in cloaks un til he passed a\ngroup of them next to the bake r’s. He eyed them ang ri ly as he passed. He\ndidn’t know why, but they made him une asy. This bunch were whisp eri ng\nexc ite dl y, too, and he couldn’t see a sin gle col lect ing tin. It was on his way\nback past them, clutch ing a large dough nut in a bag, that he caught a few\nwords of what they were sayi ng.\n“The Pot ters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”\n“ — yes, their son, Harr y —”\nMr. Durs ley stopped dead. Fear flood ed him. He looked back at the\nwhisp ere rs as if he wante d to say some thing to them, but thought bet ter of\nit.\nHe dashed back across the road, hurr ied up to his of fice, snapped at\nhis secr e tary not to dis turb him, seized his tele phone, and had al most fin -\nished di ali ng his home num ber when he changed his mind. He put the re -\nceiv er back down and stroked his mus tache, thinki ng…no, he was bei ng\nstupid. Pott er wasn’t such an unu sua l name. He was sure there were lots of\npeop le called Pot ter who had a son called Har ry. Come to think of it, he\nwasn’t even sure his nephew was called Har ry. He’d neve r even seen the\nboy. It might have been Har vey. Or Harold. There was no point in wor ry ing\nMrs. Durs ley; she alw ays got so ups et at any men tion of her sis ter.

Rej oice, for You-K now- Who has gone at\nlast! Even Mugg les like yours elf should be cel ebrati ng, this hap py, happ y\nday!”\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Durs ley around the midd le and walked\noff.\nMr. Durs ley stood root ed to the spot. He had been hugged by a com -\nplete stranger. He al so thought he had been called a Mugg le, whate ve r that\nwas. He was ratt led. He hurr ied to his car and set off for home, hop ing he\nwas imagi n ing things, which he had neve r hoped bef ore, bec ause he didn’t\napp rove of imag ina tion.\nAs he pulled in to the drive way of num ber four, the first thing he saw\n— and it didn’t imp rove his mood — was the tab by cat he’d spot ted that\nmorn ing. It was now sitt ing on his gard en wall. He was sure it was the same\none; it had the same marki ngs around its eyes.\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Durs ley loudl y.\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this norm al\ncat beh avi or? Mr. Durs ley wond ered. Try ing to pull hims elf to geth er, he let\nhims elf in to the house. He was still det er mined not to men tion anyt hing to\nhis wife.\nMrs. Durs ley had had a nice, norm al day. She told him over din ner\nall about Mrs. Next Door’s probl ems with her daught er and how Dudl ey\nhad learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Durs ley tried to act norm all y.\nWhen Dudl ey had been put to bed, he went in to the livi ng room in time to\ncatch the last re port on the evening news:\n“And fi nal ly, bird- watche rs eve ryw here have re port ed that the na -\ntion’s owls have been beh avi ng very un usua l ly to day.

And a whis per, a whisp er about the Pott ers.…\nMrs. Durs ley came in to the livi ng room car ry ing two cups of tea. It\nwas no good. He’d have to say some thing to her. He cleared his throat ner -\nvousl y. “Er — Petu nia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sis ter late ly,\nhave you?”\nAs he had exp ecte d, Mrs. Durs ley looked shocked and ang ry. Af ter\nall, they norm all y pre tend ed she didn’t have a sist er.\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\n“Funn y stuff on the news,” Mr. Durs ley mumb led. “Owls…shooti ng\nstars…and there were a lot of funn y-l ook ing peo ple in town to day.…”\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Durs ley.\n“Well, I just thought…maybe…it was some thing to do with…you\nknow…her crowd.”\nMrs. Durs ley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Durs ley won -\ndered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Pot ter.” He dec id ed he\ndidn’t dare.

While Mrs. Durs ley was in the bath room, Mr. Durs ley crept to the bed -\nroom win dow and peered down int o the front gard en. The cat was still\nthere.

Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a pass age\nand twiste d around to see if it was a drago n, but too late — they plunged\neven deep er, passi ng an un derg round lake where huge sta lac tites and sta lag -\nmites grew from the ceili ng and floor.\n“I neve r know,” Har ry called to Ha grid over the noise of the cart,\n“what’s the diff er ence be tween a stal ag mite and a stal ac tite?”\n“Sta lag mite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Ha grid. “An’ don’ ask me ques -\ntions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last bes ide a\nsmall door in the pass age wall, Ha grid got out and had to lean against the\nwall to stop his knees from trem bling.\nGriphook un locked the door. A lot of green smoke came bill owi ng\nout, and as it cleared, Har ry gasped. In side were mounds of gold coins.\nColumns of sil ver. Heaps of lit tle bronze Knuts.\n“All yours,” smiled Ha grid.\nAll Har ry’s — it was in cred ible. The Durs leys couldn’t have known\nabout this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinki ng. How of ten\nhad they com plained how much Har ry cost them to keep? And all the time\nthere had been a small for tune be long ing to him, buried deep un der Lond on.\nHa grid helped Har ry pile some of it in to a bag.\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he exp lained. “Seve nt een silv er Sick -\nles to a Galleon and twent y- nine Knuts to a Sick le, it’s easy enough. Right,\nthat should be enough fer a cou ple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for\nyeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seve n hun dred and thir teen now,\nplease, and can we go more slow ly?”\n“One speed onl y,” said Griphook."

He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudl ey\nscreamed and ran from the room.\n“Er — Un cle Vern on?”\nUnc le Vern on grunt ed to show he was lis ten ing.\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross to mor row to — to go to Hog -\nwarts.”\nUnc le Vern on grunt ed again.\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\nGrunt. Har ry supp osed that meant yes.\n“Thank you.”\nHe was about to go back up stairs when Unc le Ver non act u al ly\nspoke.\n“Fun ny way to get to a wiz ards’ school, the train.

On the cont rary, he sat bolt upr ight and broke in to\na sweat.\n“Mid night on Sat ur day!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no —\nI’ve just rem emb ered — Charl ie’s lett er was in that book Mal foy took, he’s\ngo ing to know we’re gett ing rid of Nor bert.”\nHar ry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to ans wer.

Har ry could see a cleari ng ahead, through the\ntan gled branche s of an an cient oak.\n“Look —” he murm ured, hold ing out his arm to stop Mal foy.\nSomet hing bright white was gleam ing on the ground. They inched\nclos er.\nIt was the uni corn all right, and it was dead. Har ry had nev er seen\nanyt hing so beaut i ful and sad.

The\nhood ed fig ure raised its head and looked right at Har ry — uni corn blood\nwas drib bling down its front.

Half blinde d, he stag gered backw ard. He heard\nhooves beh ind him, gal lop ing, and some thing jumped clean over Har ry,\ncharg ing at the fig ure.\nThe pain in Har ry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a\nminute or two to pass. When he looked up, the fig ure had gone. A cent aur\nwas stand ing over him, not Ro nan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had\nwhite- blond hair and a palomin o body.\n“Are you all right?” said the cen taur, pulling Har ry to his feet.\n“Yes — thank you — what was that?”\nThe cent aur didn’t ans wer. He had ast on ish ing ly blue eyes, like pale\nsapp hires.
