Once a fine-\nlooking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around,\nthe Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\nThe Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.” Half a\ncentury ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something\nthat the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for\ngossip were scarce. The story had been picked over so many times, and had\nbeen embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the\ntruth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same\nplace: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the\nRiddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the\ndrawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\nThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as\nmany people as she could.\n“Lying there with their eyes wide open!

Nobody wasted their\nbreath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most\nunpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude,\nand their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers\ncared about was the identity of their murderer — for plainly, three apparently\nhealthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\nThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole\nvillage seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded\nfor leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their\nmidst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce\nhad just been arrested.\n“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”\nFrank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a run-down\ncottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the\nwar with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had\nbeen working for the Riddles ever since.\nThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\n“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening villagers, after\nher fourth sherry. “Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once,\nI’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn’t.”\n“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the\nquiet life. That’s no reason to —”\n“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook. “There’s\nbeen a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!\nNobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do\nwas creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping. . . .”\nThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\n“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,” grunted a\nman at the bar.\n“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.\n“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn’t I, Dot?”\nsaid an excited woman in the corner.\n“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I remember, when he was\na kid . . .”\nBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that\nFrank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\nBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and\ndingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he\nwas innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day\nof the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.\nNobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite\nsure that Frank had invented him.\nThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on\nthe Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.\nThe police had never read an odder report.

        "text": "Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on\nthe Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.\nThe police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined\nthe bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned,\nstabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.\nIn fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the\nRiddles all appeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact that they\nwere all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something\nwrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his\nor her face — but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people\nbeing frightened to death?\nAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police\nwere forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton\nchurchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To\neveryone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his\ncottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\n“’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what the police\nsay,” said Dot in the Hanged Man. “And if he had any decency, he’d leave\nhere, knowing as how we knows he did it.”\nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family\nwho lived in the Riddle House, and then the next — for neither family stayed\nlong. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was\na nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to\nfall into disrepair.\nThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there\nnor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,”\nthough nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner\ncontinued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his\nseventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could\nbe seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the\nweeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\nWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys\nfrom the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the\nRiddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard\nto keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They\nknew that old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to\nan obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden,\nbrandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed\nthe boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents,\nthought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw\nsomething very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had\ngone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\nIt was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in\nhis old age.

He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of\nrefilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the\nsink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights\nglimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The\nboys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of\nthe light, they had started a fire.\nFrank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the\npolice ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles’\ndeaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad\nleg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing\na rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick,\nwhich was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.\nThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did\nany of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he\nreached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it\ninto the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\nHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for\nmany years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the\ndoor into the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his nostrils full of the\nsmell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.\nHe reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned\nwindows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs,\nblessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of\nhis feet and stick.\nOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders\nwere: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light\nshone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.\nFrank edged closer and closer, grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet\nfrom the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\nThe fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he\nstopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the\nroom; it sounded timid and fearful.\n“There is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still hungry.”\n“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man — but it was\nstrangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something\nabout that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s neck stand up.\n“Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.”\nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came\nthe clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull\nscraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a\nglimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He"

        "text": "scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a\nglimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He\nwas wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his\nhead. Then he went out of sight again.\n“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.\n“I — I don’t know, my Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She set out to\nexplore the house, I think. . . .”\n“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second voice. “I\nwill need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.”\nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening\nvery hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.\n“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”\n“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The place is moderately\ncomfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before\nthe Quidditch World Cup is over.”\nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt,\nto a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a\nword at all.\n“The — the Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?” said Wormtail. (Frank dug\nhis finger still more vigorously into his ear.) “Forgive me, but — I do not\nunderstand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”\n“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country\nfrom all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be\non duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double-\nchecking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles\nnotice anything. So we wait.”\nFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words\n“Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these\nexpressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts\nof people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his\nhold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.\n“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.\n“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of menace in the\ncold voice now.\nA slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling\nfrom him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost\nhis nerve.\n“It could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.”\nAnother pause, more protracted, and then —\n“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly. “I see . . .”\n“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” said Wormtail, his\nvoice rising squeakily. “The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely\nthat if we were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — the thing\ncould be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a\nshort while — you know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could\nbe back here in as little as two days with a suitable person —”"

I wonder . . .\nperhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail?\nCould this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an\nattempt to desert me?”\n“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all —”\n“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can always tell, Wormtail!\nYou are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch\nwhen you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. . . .”\n“No! My devotion to Your Lordship —”\n“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if\nyou had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need\nfeeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”\n“But you seem so much stronger, my Lord —”\n“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, and a few days alone\nwould be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your\nclumsy care. Silence!”\nWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a\nfew seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second\nman spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.\n“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and\nI will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make\nno difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will\nbe effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail —\ncourage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord\nVoldemort’s wrath —”\n“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. “All\nthrough our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — my Lord, Bertha\nJorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I\nmurder —”\n“If?” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the\nMinistry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and\nwithout fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but in my present\ncondition . . . Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter\nis clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant\nwill have rejoined us —”\n“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his\nvoice.\n“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has\nnever wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”"

I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”\n“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused. “A stroke of\nbrilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if\ntruth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught\nher, were you?”\n“I — I thought she might be useful, my Lord —”\n“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced\nthan ever. “However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable.\nWithout it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have\nyour reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me,\none that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform. . . .”\n“R-really, my Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded terrified again.\n“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will\ncome at the very end . . . but I promise you, you will have the honor of being\njust as useful as Bertha Jorkins.”\n“You . . . you . . .” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his\nmouth had gone very dry. “You . . . are going . . . to kill me too?”\n“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why would I kill you? I\nkilled Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning,\nquite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had\ngone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays.\nWizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry\nof Magic witches at wayside inns. . . .”\nWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it\nmade the second man laugh — an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.\n“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken\nby a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult\nto her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.”\nOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping\nhis walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had\nkilled a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse — with\namusement. He was dangerous — a madman. And he was planning more\nmurders — this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —\nFrank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.\nHe would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in\nthe village . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained\nwhere he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.\n“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts . . . Harry Potter is\nas good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument."

I think I hear Nagini. . . .”\nAnd the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises such as\nFrank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing\nbreath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.\nAnd then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He\nturned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.\nSomething was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it\ndrew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it\nwas a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank\nstared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust\non the floor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do? The only means\nof escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he\nstayed where he was the snake would surely kill him —\nBut before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and\nthen, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting,\nhissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip\nof its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\nThere was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the hand on the walking\nstick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss,\nand Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. . . . This man could\ntalk to snakes.\nFrank didn’t understand what was going on. He wanted more than\nanything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that\nhis legs didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to\nmaster himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.\n“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.\n“In-indeed, my Lord?” said Wormtail.\n“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle\nstanding right outside this room, listening to every word we say.”\nFrank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps, and then\nthe door of the room was flung wide open.\nA short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery\neyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.\n“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?”\nThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but\nFrank couldn’t see the speaker. The snake, on the other hand, was curled up\non the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.\nWormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken,\nFrank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold.\nThe fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery\nshadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man\ninside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even\nsee the back of his head."

And I’ll tell you this too,” he\nadded, on a sudden inspiration, “my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t\ncome back —”\n“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly. “Nobody knows you\nare here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord\nVoldemort, Muggle, for he knows . . . he always knows. . . .”\n“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I don’t think much of\nyour manners, my Lord.

The snake lifted its\nugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its\nrug.\nAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His\nwalking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a\nscream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in\nthe chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing\nsound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.\nTwo hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\n— T W O —\nTHE SCAR\nH\narry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been\nrunning. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands\npressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a\nbolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just\npressed a white-hot wire to his skin.\nHe sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness\nfor his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his\nbedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was\nfiltering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window."

For there had definitely been an old man;\nHarry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused.\nHarry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on\nto the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his\ncupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on\nto them. . . . Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they\nhad killed, though Harry could not remember the name . . . and they had been\nplotting to kill someone else . . . him!\nHarry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his\nbedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened,\nthere were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large\nwooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron,\nbroomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered\nthat part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which\nhis snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book\nlay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The\npictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were\nzooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one\nanother.\nHarry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one of the\nwizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high\nhoop.

He placed\nFlying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew\nback the curtains to survey the street below.\nPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be\nexpected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were\nclosed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn’t a living\ncreature in sight, not even a cat.\nAnd yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down\non it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered\nhim; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from\nhis right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm\nhad been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last\nyear Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to\nbizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of\ntrouble.\nNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had\nhurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . . . But\nVoldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet\nDrive was absurd, impossible. . . .\nHarry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half-expecting to\nhear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as\nhe heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next\nroom.\nHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the\nhouse with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they\nwere plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.\nAsleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as though they\nwere ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley\nwere Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised\nmagic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their\nhouse as dry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long absences at Hogwarts\nover the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure\nCenter for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an\nunderage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but\nthey were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house.\nHarry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his\nlife in the Wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke,\nand telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about\nVoldemort, was laughable.\nAnd yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the\nDursleys in the first place. If it hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would not\nhave had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn’t been for Voldemort,\nHarry would still have had parents. . . .\nHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — the most powerful"

If it hadn’t been for Voldemort,\nHarry would still have had parents. . . .\nHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — the most powerful\nDark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for\neleven years — arrived at his house and killed his father and mother.\nVoldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse\nthat had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to\npower — and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy,\nthe curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing\nbut a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced\nto something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished,\nVoldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and\nwizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded,\nand Harry Potter had become famous.\nIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh\nbirthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out\nthat everyone in the hidden Wizarding world knew his name. Harry had\narrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him\nwherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he\nwould be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting\nthe days until he would be back at the castle again.\nBut there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He\nlooked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday\ncards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they\nsay if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?\nAt once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and\npanicky.\n“Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write to Professor Dumbledore!\nAnd I’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. . . . Maybe\nthere’s something in there about curse scars. . . .”\nYes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to the headmaster of\nHogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the\nwindow at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book\ncould help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have\nsurvived a curse like Voldemort’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he\nwould find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.\nAs for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went\nduring the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing\nDumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed\nhat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long\ncrooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that\nHedwig would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had never yet failed to deliver\na letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would he write?\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.\nYours sincerely, Harry Potter.\nEven inside his head the words sounded stupid."

But . . . but You-Know-Who can’t be near you now, can he? I\nmean . . . you’d know, wouldn’t you? He’d be trying to do you in again, wouldn’t\nhe? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit. . . . I’ll ask Dad. . . .”\nMr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of\nMuggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn’t have any\nparticular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case,\nHarry didn’t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he,\nHarry, was getting jumpy about a few moments’ pain. Mrs. Weasley would\nfuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron’s sixteen-year-old twin\nbrothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry’s\nfavorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay\nany time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World\nCup), and he somehow didn’t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries\nabout his scar.\nHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and\nit felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like — someone\nlike a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid,\nsomeone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . .\nAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that\nhe couldn’t believe it had taken so long — Sirius.\nHarry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his\ndesk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill\nwith ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his\nproblem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight\naway. But then, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all, he had only found\nout that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.\nThere was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete absence from Harry’s life\nuntil then — Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by\ncreatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to\nsearch for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been\ninnocent — the murders for which he had been convicted had been\ncommitted by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter, whom nearly everybody now\nbelieved dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had\ncome face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor\nDumbledore had believed their story.\nFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys\nat last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared.\nBut the chance had been snatched away from him — Wormtail had escaped"

        "text": "at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared.\nBut the chance had been snatched away from him — Wormtail had escaped\nbefore they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee\nfor his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called\nBuckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might\nhave had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It\nhad been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly\nescaped them forever.\nNevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn’t be\nwith him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his\nbedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general\nwish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his\npowers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs\nevery summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had\nfound out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for Harry\nhad conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.\nHarry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet\nDrive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but\nby large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these\nflashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her\nwater tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them;\nthey put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that,\nwherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he\nwas enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imagine dementors\nsurviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps that was why Sirius had gone\nsouth. Sirius’s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose\nfloorboard under Harry’s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had\nreminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to\nnow, all right. . . .\nHarry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes\nsunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his\nbedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be\nheard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia’s room, Harry cleared his desk of\ncrumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\nDear Sirius,\nThanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly\nget through my window.\nThings are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t going too well.\nMy aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They\ntold him they’d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he\ngot really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s\na sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now\nhe hasn’t even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off\nthings.\nI’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up\nand turn them all into bats if I ask you to.\nA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again."

My scar hurt again.\nLast time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts.\nBut I don’t reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you\nknow if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?\nI’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s off hunting at the\nmoment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.\nYes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the\ndream; he didn’t want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up\nthe parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned.\nThen he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more.\nWithout glancing at his reflection, he started to get dressed before going down\nto breakfast.\n— T H R E E —\nTHE INVITATION\nB\ny the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already\nseated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat\ndown. Uncle Vernon’s large red face was hidden behind the morning’s Daily\nMail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed\nover her horselike teeth.\nDudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up\neven more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up\nan entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter\nof unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley’s plate with a tremulous “There you\nare, Diddy darling,” Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most\nunpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year\nreport.\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad\nmarks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy\nwhose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that\n“he didn’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also\nskated over the accusations of bullying in the report — “He’s a boisterous little\nboy, but he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.\nHowever, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen\ncomments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt\nPetunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that\nDudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that\nhe was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the\nschool outfitters didn’t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore.\nThe school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it came\nto spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings\nand goings of the neighbors — simply refused to see: that far from needing\nextra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young\nkiller whale.\nSo — after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry’s bedroom\nfloor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia — the new regime had begun.

The\ndiet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to\nthe fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy\ndrinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit\nand vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food.”\nTo make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the\nwhole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry.\nHe noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley’s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel\nthat the best way to keep up Dudley’s morale was to make sure that he did, at\nleast, get more to eat than Harry.\nBut Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard\nupstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The\nmoment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the\nsummer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for\nhelp, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned\nfrom Hermione’s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks.\n(Hermione’s parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had\nobliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn’t\ntouched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid’s cooking.) Mrs.\nWeasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake\nand assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a\nfull five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry’s birthday\n(which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb\nbirthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still\nhad two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got\nback upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.\nUncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and\nlooked down at his own grapefruit quarter.\n“Is this it?” he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.\nAunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley,\nwho had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry’s\nwith a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.\nUncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache,\nand picked up his spoon.\nThe doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off\ndown the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle,\nDudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s grapefruit.\nHarry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon\nanswering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper\ncame from the hall.\nAunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around\nto see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn’t have to wait long to find\nout; after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid."

Now.”\nBewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this\ntime, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the\nnext room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.\n“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as\nthough he were about to pronounce him under arrest. “So.”\nHarry would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but he didn’t feel\nthat Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in the morning,\nespecially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He\ntherefore settled for looking politely puzzled.\n“This just arrived,” said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple\nwriting paper at Harry. “A letter. About you.”\nHarry’s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about\nhim? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to\nread aloud:\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,\nWe have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great\ndeal from Harry about my son Ron.\nAs Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup\ntakes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just\nmanaged to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department\nof Magical Games and Sports.\nI do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really\nis a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn’t hosted the Cup for\nthirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We would of\ncourse be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer\nholidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.\nIt would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as\npossible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never\ndelivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.\nHoping to see Harry soon,\nYours sincerely,\nP.S. I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.\nUncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket,\nand drew out something else.\n“Look at this,” he growled.\nHe held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s letter had come, and\nHarry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except\nfor a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the\nDursleys’ address in minute writing.\n“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry, trying to sound as\nthough Mrs. Weasley’s was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle’s eyes\nflashed.\n“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth. “Very interested to\nknow where this letter came from, he was. That’s why he rang the doorbell.\nSeemed to think it was funny.”\nHarry didn’t say anything.

Their worst fear was that someone would find out\nthat they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.\nUncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression\nneutral. If he didn’t do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat\nof a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely\ncontinued to glare. Harry decided to break the silence.\n“So — can I go then?” he asked.\nA slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon’s large purple face. The mustache\nbristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a\nfurious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental instincts came into\nconflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle\nVernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing\nHarry to disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid of\nhim two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon\nhated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he\nlooked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.\n“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with distaste.\n“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she was\nmeeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term.”\nHe had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was a sure way to get his\nuncle’s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud\nin the Dursley household.\nUncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember\nsomething very unpleasant.\n“Dumpy sort of woman?” he growled finally. “Load of children with red\nhair?”\nHarry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone\n“dumpy,” when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he’d been\nthreatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.\nUncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.\n“Quidditch,” he muttered under his breath. “Quidditch — what is this\nrubbish?”\nHarry felt a second stab of annoyance.\n“It’s a sport,” he said shortly. “Played on broom —”\n“All right, all right!” said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some\nsatisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves\ncouldn’t stand the sound of the word “broomsticks” in his living room. He\ntook refuge in perusing the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words\n“send us your answer . . . in the normal way.” He scowled.\n“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.\n“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added,\n“you know, owl post. That’s what’s normal for wizards.”\nUncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting\nswearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window,"

Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window,\nas though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed\nagainst the glass.\n“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness\nunder my roof?” he hissed, his face now a rich plum color. “You stand there, in\nthe clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back —”\n“Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry coldly, and indeed, he\nwas dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the\nsleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees\nof his extremely baggy jeans.\n“I will not be spoken to like that!” said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.\nBut Harry wasn’t going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had\nbeen forced to take every single one of the Dursleys’ stupid rules. He wasn’t\nfollowing Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him\nfrom going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a\ndeep, steadying breath and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I\ngo now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know —\nmy godfather.”\nHe had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple\nrecede blotchily from Uncle Vernon’s face, making it look like badly mixed\nblack currant ice cream.\n“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon, in a would-\nbe calm voice — but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with\nsudden fear.\n“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually. “It’s been a while since he heard from\nme, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking something’s wrong.”\nHe stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the\ncogs working under Uncle Vernon’s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried\nto stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated.\nIf he told Harry he couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would\nwrite and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was\nonly one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion\nforming in his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face were\ntransparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible.\nAnd then —\n“Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . . this\nWorld Cup thing. You write and tell these — these Weasleys they’re to pick\nyou up, mind. I haven’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country.\nAnd you can spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your —\nyour godfather . . . tell him . . . tell him you’re going.”\n“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.\nHe turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to"

        "text": "your godfather . . . tell him . . . tell him you’re going.”\n“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.\nHe turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to\njump into the air and whoop. He was going . . . he was going to the Weasleys’,\nhe was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\nOutside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind\nthe door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked\nto see the broad grin on Harry’s face.\n“That was an excellent breakfast, wasn’t it?” said Harry. “I feel really full,\ndon’t you?”\nLaughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face, Harry took the stairs\nthree at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.\nThe first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her\ncage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in\nthe way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was\nannoying her became apparent almost at once.\n“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis\nball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously,\nlooking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit\ninto the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose\nfirework. Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet.\nHarry bent down, recognized Ron’s handwriting, then tore open the envelope.\nInside was a hastily scribbled note.\nHarry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday\nnight. Mum’s writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already\nhave the letter, I don’t know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I’d send this\nwith Pig anyway.\nHarry stared at the word “Pig,” then looked up at the tiny owl now\nzooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything\nthat looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldn’t read Ron’s writing. He went\nback to the letter:\nWe’re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can’t miss the\nWorld Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it’s better if we pretend to ask their\npermission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and\nwe’ll come and get you at five o’clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back\npronto and we’ll come and get you at five o’clock on Sunday anyway.\nHermione’s arriving this afternoon. Percy’s started work — the\nDepartment of International Magical Cooperation. Don’t mention anything\nabout Abroad while you’re here unless you want the pants bored off you.\nSee you soon —\n“Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering\nmadly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the\nletter to the right person. “Come here, I need you to take my answer back!”\nThe owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage. Hedwig looked coldly up\nat it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.\nHarry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of\nparchment, and wrote:"

See you five o’clock tomorrow.\nCan’t wait.\nHe folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to\nthe tiny owl’s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the\nnote was secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out\nof sight.\nHarry turned to Hedwig.\n“Feeling up to a long journey?” he asked her.\nHedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.\n“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking up his letter. “Hang\non . . . I just want to finish it.”\nHe unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.\nIf you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend Ron Weasley’s for the rest of the\nsummer. His dad’s got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!\nThe letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept unusually still, as\nthough determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.\n“I’ll be at Ron’s when you get back, all right?” Harry told her.\nShe nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise,\nspread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.\nHarry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up\nthe loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat\nthere on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through\nhim. He had cake, and Dudley had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright\nsummer’s day, he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt\nperfectly normal again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup.\nIt was hard, just now, to feel worried about anything — even Lord Voldemort.\n— F O U R —\nBACK TO THE BURROW\nB\ny twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk was packed with his\nschool things and all his most prized possessions — the Invisibility\nCloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from\nSirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George\nWeasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard\nof all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for\nforgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting\ndown the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days\nremaining until his return to Hogwarts.\nThe atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The\nimminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the\nDursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed\nwhen Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o’clock\nthe very next day.\n“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” he snarled at once.\n“I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d better have the decency to put\non normal clothes, that’s all.”"

They’d better have the decency to put\non normal clothes, that’s all.”\nHarry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs.\nWeasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call “normal.” Their\nchildren might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs.\nWeasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn’t\nbothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about\nhow rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like\ntheir worst idea of wizards.\nUncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have\nlooked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle\nVernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other\nhand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last\ntaking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter\nwith a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his\ntrousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal\nat a private hospital in London. It wasn’t altogether surprising, therefore, that\nDudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking\nsideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the\nenemy.\nLunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even protest at the food\n(cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn’t eating anything at all.\nHer arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her\ntongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at\nHarry.\n“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked across the table.\n“Er,” said Harry.\nHe hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up?\nThey didn’t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was\ncurrently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley\nhad borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same\ntoday?\n“I think so,” said Harry.\nUncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would\nhave asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how\nbig and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon\nwould have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.\nHarry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn’t stand\nwatching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as\nthough there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a\nquarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.\nAunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was\npretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry\nwas sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an\napproaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands\nbeneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn’t take the"

Harry couldn’t take the\ntension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on\nhis watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.\nBut five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in\nhis suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew\nhis head quickly.\n“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.\n“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or something.”\nTen past five . . . then a quarter past five . . . Harry was starting to feel\nanxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\nconversing in terse mutters in the living room.\n“No consideration at all.”\n“We might’ve had an engagement.”\n“Maybe they think they’ll get invited to dinner if they’re late.”\n“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard\nhim stand up and start pacing the living room. “They’ll take the boy and go,\nthere’ll be no hanging around. That’s if they’re coming at all. Probably\nmistaken the day. I daresay their kind don’t set much store by punctuality.\nEither that or they drive some tin-pot car that’s broken d —\nAAAAAAAARRRRRGH!”\nHarry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the\nsounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next\nmoment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.\n“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”\nBut Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his\nbuttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into\nthe living room.\nLoud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys’\nboarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.\n“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was\nstaring, terrified, toward the fire. “What is it, Vernon?”\nBut they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard\nfrom inside the blocked fireplace.\n“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of mistake —\ntell George not to — OUCH! George, no, there’s no room, go back quickly\nand tell Ron —”\n“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able to let us out —”\nThere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.\n“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”\nThe Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.\n“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going on?”\n“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry, fighting a\nmad desire to laugh. “They can travel by fire — only you’ve blocked the\nfireplace — hang on —”\nHe approached the fireplace and called through the boards.\n“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”\nThe hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said, “Shh!”"

Somebody inside the chimney piece said, “Shh!”\n“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up. You won’t\nbe able to get through there.”\n“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did they want to block\nup the fireplace for?”\n“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.\n“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic, you say? With a plug?\nGracious, I must see that. . . . Let’s think . . . ouch, Ron!”\nRon’s voice now joined the others’.\n“What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?”\n“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically. “No, this is exactly\nwhere we wanted to end up.”\n“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said George, whose voice\nsounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.\n“Boys, boys . . .” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying to think what to\ndo. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry.”\nHarry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.\n“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What exactly are you going to\n—”\nBANG.\nThe electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst\noutward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble\nand loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee\ntable; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless,\nat the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George,\nwho were identical to the last freckle.\n“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green\nrobes and straightening his glasses. “Ah — you must be Harry’s aunt and\nuncle!”\nTall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand\noutstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt\nPetunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white\ndust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though\nhe had just aged thirty years.\n“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and\nlooking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. “It’s all my fault. It just\ndidn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get out at the other end. I had\nyour fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see — just for an\nafternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t\nsupposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but I’ve got a useful contact at\nthe Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy,\nthough, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can\nrepair your fireplace before I Disapparate.”"

        "text": "though, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can\nrepair your fireplace before I Disapparate.”\nHarry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t understood a single word of\nthis. They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia\nstaggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.\n“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your trunk ready?”\n“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.\n“We’ll get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the\nroom. They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having once rescued him from\nit in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for\na glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.\n“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find\nwords to break the very nasty silence. “Very — erm — very nice place you’ve\ngot here.”\nAs the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of\nbrick, this remark didn’t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon’s\nface purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again.\nHowever, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.\nMr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles.\nHarry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video\nrecorder.\n“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said knowledgeably. “Ah yes, I can\nsee the plugs. I collect plugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon. “And batteries. Got\na very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I’m mad, but there you are.”\nUncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so\nslightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought\nMr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\nDudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his\ntrunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the\nkitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified\neyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father.\nUnfortunately, Uncle Vernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt\nPetunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\n“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr. Weasley, taking another\nbrave stab at making conversation.\n“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”\nHe and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each\nother; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley\nwas still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley,\nhowever, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley’s peculiar behavior. Indeed,\nfrom the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr.\nWeasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was,\nexcept that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\n“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.\nDudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his\nmassive backside.\nFred and George came back into the room carrying Harry’s school trunk."

Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his\nmassive backside.\nFred and George came back into the room carrying Harry’s school trunk.\nThey glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked\ninto identical evil grins.\n“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking then.”\nHe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the\nDursleys draw back against the wall as one.\n“Incendio!” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall\nbehind him.\nFlames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had\nbeen burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his\npocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the\nflames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.\n“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on —”\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and the contents were now\nrolling in every direction — big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.\nFred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the\nDursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying\n“the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a\nwhooshing sound, and Fred vanished.\n“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the trunk.”\nHarry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it\nonto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh,\nGeorge had cried “the Burrow!” and vanished too.\n“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry,\nthen stepped into the fire, shouted “the Burrow!” and disappeared.\nNow Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.\n“Well . . .’bye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.\nThey didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he\nreached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him\nback. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.\n“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you hear him?”\n“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. “Honestly, I don’t\ncare.”\nMr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s shoulder.\n“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next summer,” he said to Uncle\nVernon in mild indignation. “Surely you’re going to say good-bye?”\nUncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught\nconsideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall\nseemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley’s wand was still\nin his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said,\nvery resentfully, “Good-bye, then.”\n“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames,"

At that moment, however, a horrible\ngagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.\nHarry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents.\nHe was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on\na foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One\nbewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley’s\ntongue — and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before\nhim.\nAunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end\nof his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth;\nunsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight\nher off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr.\nWeasley had to shout to make himself heard.\n“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his\nwand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw\nherself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.\n“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a simple process — it was\nthe toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only an\nEngorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it —”\nBut far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken;\nAunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley’s tongue as though\ndetermined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the\ncombined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had\nlost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and\nthrew it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to\nshatter in the blasted fireplace.\n“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. “I’m trying\nto help!”\nBellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another\nornament.\n“Harry, go! Just go!” Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. “I’ll\nsort this out!”\nHarry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament\nnarrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the\nsituation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as\nhe said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr.\nWeasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his wand,\nAunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley’s tongue\nlolling around like a great slimy python.

Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out\nhis hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face\nforward out of the Weasleys’ kitchen fire.\n“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his\nfeet.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up. “What was it?”\n“Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly. “George and I invented them,\nand we’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . .”\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that\nRon and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-\nhaired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who\nthey must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.\n“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and\nholding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters\nunder his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in\nRomania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and\nRon, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face,\nwhich was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his\narms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\nBill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand. Bill came as\nsomething of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the Wizarding bank,\nGringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always\nimagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and\nfond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was — there was no other\nword for it — cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a\nponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling\nfrom it. Bill’s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert,\nexcept that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of\ndragon hide.\nBefore any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise,\nand Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George’s shoulder. He was\nlooking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.\n“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted. “What on earth did you give that\nMuggle boy?”\n“I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another evil grin. “I just\ndropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to.”\n“You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley. “You knew he’d eat it,\nyou knew he was on a diet —”\n“How big did his tongue get?” George asked eagerly.\n“It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!”\nHarry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again."

I spend half my life campaigning against\nthe mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons —”\n“We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said Fred indignantly.\n“No, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying git,” said George. “Isn’t\nhe, Harry?”\n“Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.\n“That’s not the point!” raged Mr. Weasley. “You wait until I tell your\nmother —”\n“Tell me what?” said a voice behind them.\nMrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman\nwith a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.\n“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes\nsnapped back to her husband. “Tell me what, Arthur?”\nMr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with\nFred and George, he hadn’t really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had\nhappened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously.\nThen two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One,\nwith very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry’s and Ron’s\nfriend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was\nRon’s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back,\nwhich made Ginny go scarlet — she had been very taken with Harry ever since\nhis first visit to the Burrow.\n“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of\nvoice.\n“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but\nI’ve had words with them —”\n“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got anything to\ndo with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”\n“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione\nfrom the doorway.\n“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there last\n—”\n“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.\n“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”\n“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.\n“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.\nHarry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny\nset off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged\nthrough the house to the upper stories.\n“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.\nRon and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.\n“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and\nGeorge’s room,” said Ron quietly. “Great long price lists for stuff they’ve\ninvented.

It\nwas brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that . . .”\n“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never\nthought they were actually making things,” said Ginny. “We thought they just\nliked the noise.”\n“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous,”\nsaid Ron, “and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make\nsome money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren’t allowed to\nmake any more of it, and burned all the order forms. . . . She’s furious at them\nanyway. They didn’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.”\nO.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts\nstudents took at the age of fifteen.\n“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said, “because Mum wants them\nto go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to\ndo is open a joke shop.”\nJust then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out\nwearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.\n“Hi, Percy,” said Harry.\n“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy. “I was wondering who was making all the\nnoise. I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a report to finish for\nthe office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep\nthundering up and down the stairs.”\n“We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably. “We’re walking. Sorry if we’ve\ndisturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.”\n“What are you working on?” said Harry.\n“A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,” said\nPercy smugly. “We’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these\nforeign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a\nrate of almost three percent a year —”\n“That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron. “Front page of the\nDaily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.”\nPercy went slightly pink.\n“You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless some sort of\ninternational law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with\nflimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger —”\n“Yeah, yeah, all right,” said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy\nslammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed\nRon up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up\nto them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the\ntoffees.\nThe room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had\nthe last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron’s favorite\nQuidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls\nand sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously\nheld frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog.

Ron’s old rat,\nScabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had\ndelivered Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in\na small cage and twittering madly.\n“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that\nhad been squeezed into the room. “Fred and George are in here with us,\nbecause Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry. “Percy gets to keep\nhis room all to himself because he’s got to work.”\n“Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked Ron.\n“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny. “Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.”\n“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron sarcastically. “Ginny\nnamed him,” he explained to Harry. “She reckons it’s sweet. And I tried to\nchange it, but it was too late, he won’t answer to anything else. So now he’s\nPig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He\nannoys me too, come to that.”\nPigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew\nRon too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old\nrat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks,\nappeared to have eaten him.\n“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.\n“Out in the garden, I expect,” she said. “He likes chasing gnomes. He’s\nnever seen any before.”\n“Percy’s enjoying work, then?” said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds\nand watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the\nceiling.\n“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly. “I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad\ndidn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the subject of his\nboss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch\nis of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They’ll be announcing their\nengagement any day now.”\n“Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said Hermione. “Did you get our\nfood parcels and everything?”\n“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Harry. “They saved my life, those cakes.”\n“And have you heard from — ?” Ron began, but at a look from Hermione\nhe fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and\nHermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the\nMinistry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather\nas he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody\nbut themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had\nescaped, or believed in his innocence.\n“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to cover the awkward\nmoment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. “Shall we\ngo down and help your mum with dinner?”\n“Yeah, all right,” said Ron.

The four of them left Ron’s room and went back\ndownstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-\ntempered.\n“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they came in. “There’s just\nnot room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls?\nBill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,”\nshe said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she\nhad intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so\nfast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.\n“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan,\nwhich hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping\nup the potatoes. “Those two!” she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and\npans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. “I don’t\nknow what’s going to happen to them, I really don’t. No ambition, unless you\ncount making as much trouble as they possibly can. . . .”\nMrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table\nand began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the\nwand-tip as she stirred.\n“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” she continued irritably, taking\nthe saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand,\n“but they’re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon,\nthey’ll be in real trouble. I’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than\nthe rest put together. If they carry on the way they’re going, they’ll end up in\nfront of the Improper Use of Magic Office.”\nMrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open.\nHarry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it,\nflew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been\ntipped back into the sink by the dustpan.\n“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said Mrs. Weasley,\nputting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. “It’s been\nthe same for years, one thing after another, and they won’t listen to — OH\nNOT AGAIN!”\nShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud\nsqueak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.\n“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How many times have I told\nthem not to leave them lying around?”\nShe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the\nstove was smoking.\n“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the\nopen drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.”\nThey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.\nThey had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger cat,\nCrookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in the\nair, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.

Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very\nfast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the\nWellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the\ngnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to\nreach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other\nside of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered\nthe garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were\nmaking two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each\nother, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George\nwere cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the\nhedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\nBill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs\noff. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy’s\nhead poking out of a window on the second floor.\n“Will you keep it down?!” he bellowed.\n“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning. “How’re the cauldron bottoms coming\non?”\n“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut.\nChuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to\nend, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and\nconjured tablecloths from nowhere.\nBy seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of\nMrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and\nHermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky.\nTo somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all\nsummer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he\nhelped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.\nAt the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report\non cauldron bottoms.\n“I’ve told Mr. Crouch that I’ll have it ready by Tuesday,” Percy was saying\npompously. “That’s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top\nof things. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it in good time, I mean, it’s\nextremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for\nthe World Cup. We’re just not getting the support we need from the\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman —”\n“I like Ludo,” said Mr. Weasley mildly. “He was the one who got us such\ngood tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into\na spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the\nwhole thing over.”\n“Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy dismissively, “but how\nhe ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I compare him to Mr.\nCrouch!

Went on holiday to Albania and never\ncame back?”\n“Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “He says\nBertha’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say, if it was\nsomeone in my department, I’d be worried. . . .”\n“Oh Bertha’s hopeless, all right,” said Percy. “I hear she’s been shunted from\ndepartment to department for years, much more trouble than she’s worth . . .\nbut all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been\ntaking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you\nknow, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just\nkeeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in\nAustralia instead of Albania. However” — Percy heaved an impressive sigh and\ntook a deep swig of elderflower wine — “we’ve got quite enough on our plates\nat the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to\nfind members of other departments too. As you know, we’ve got another big\nevent to organize right after the World Cup.”\nPercy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the\ntable where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. “You know the one I’m\ntalking about, Father.” He raised his voice slightly. “The top-secret one.”\nRon rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, “He’s been\ntrying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably\nan exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.”\nIn the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his\nearring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.\n“. . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the\nbank?”\n“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home\nplenty of treasure,” said Bill patiently.\n“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand\nlovingly. “I wish you’d let me give it a trim. . . .”\n“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. “You’re so old-fashioned,\nMum. Anyway, it’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore’s. . . .”\nNext to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly\nabout the World Cup.\n“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato.\n“They flattened Peru in the semifinals.”\n“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.\n“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,” said Charlie shortly. “I\nwish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was.”\n“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his\nisolation from the Wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.\n“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,” said"

And Wales lost to Uganda, and\nScotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.”\nHarry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first\nyear at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a\nFirebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the\nmagical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor\nHouse team.\nMr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they\nhad their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished,\nmoths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with\nthe smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and\nat peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the\nrosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.\nRon looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were\nall busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, “So — have you heard\nfrom Sirius lately?”\nHermione looked around, listening closely.\n“Yeah,” said Harry softly, “twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday.\nHe might write back while I’m here.”\nHe suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a\nmoment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting\nagain, and about the dream that had awoken him . . . but he really didn’t want\nto worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and\npeaceful.\n“Look at the time,” Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch.\n“You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you — you’ll be up at the crack\nof dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I’ll get your\nthings for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I’m getting everyone else’s. There\nmight not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last\ntime.”\n“Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry enthusiastically.\n“Well, I certainly don’t,” said Percy sanctimoniously. “I shudder to think\nwhat the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days.”\n“Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?” said Fred.\n“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said Percy, going very red in\nthe face. “It was nothing personal!”\n“It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. “We sent\nit.”\n— S I X —\nTHE PORTKEY\nH\narry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in Ron’s room\nwhen he was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.\n“Time to go, Harry, dear,” she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.\nHarry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up.

He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater\nand a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick\nleather belt.\n“What d’you think?” he asked anxiously. “We’re supposed to go incognito\n— do I look like a Muggle, Harry?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, smiling, “very good.”\n“Where’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said George, failing to stifle\na huge yawn.\n“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large\npot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. “So they can\nhave a bit of a lie-in.”\nHarry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and\nreappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known any Hogwarts\nstudent to do it, and understood that it was very difficult.\n“So they’re still in bed?” said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge\ntoward him. “Why can’t we Apparate too?”\n“Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed your test,” snapped Mrs.\nWeasley. “And where have those girls got to?”\nShe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.\n“You have to pass a test to Apparate?” Harry asked.\n“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket\nof his jeans. “The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple\nof people the other day for Apparating without a license. It’s not easy,\nApparition, and when it’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications.\nThis pair I’m talking about went and Splinched themselves.”\nEveryone around the table except Harry winced.\n“Er — Splinched?” said Harry.\n“They left half of themselves behind,” said Mr. Weasley, now spooning\nlarge amounts of treacle onto his porridge. “So, of course, they were stuck.\nCouldn’t move either way.

You don’t mess around with\nApparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don’t bother with it. Prefer\nbrooms — slower, but safer.”\n“But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?”\n“Charlie had to take the test twice,” said Fred, grinning. “He failed the first\ntime, Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some\npoor old dear doing her shopping, remember?”\n“Yes, well, he passed the second time,” said Mrs. Weasley, marching back\ninto the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.\n“Percy only passed two weeks ago,” said George. “He’s been Apparating\ndownstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.”\nThere were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came\ninto the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.\n“Why do we have to be up so early?” Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and\nsitting down at the table.\n“We’ve got a bit of a walk,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“Walk?” said Harry. “What, are we walking to the World Cup?”\n“No, no, that’s miles away,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We only need to\nwalk a short way. It’s just that it’s very difficult for a large number of wizards\nto congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful\nabout how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the\nQuidditch World Cup —”\n“George!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.\n“What?” said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.\n“What is that in your pocket?”\n“Nothing!”\n“Don’t you lie to me!”\nMrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George’s pocket and said, “Accio!”\nSeveral small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George’s pocket; he\nmade a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley’s\noutstretched hand.\n“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up\nwhat were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. “We told you to get rid of\nthe lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!”\nIt was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle\nas many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her\nSummoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.\n“Accio! Accio! Accio!” she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of\nunlikely places, including the lining of George’s jacket and the turn-ups of\nFred’s jeans.\n“We spent six months developing those!” Fred shouted at his mother as she\nthrew the toffees away.\n“Oh a fine way to spend six months!” she shrieked. “No wonder you didn’t\nget more O.W.L.s!”\nAll in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure.\nMrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek,"

Only a dull, greenish tinge along\nthe horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry,\nhaving been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the\nQuidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.\n“So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?” he\nasked.\n“It’s been a massive organizational problem,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “The\ntrouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and\nof course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them\nall. There are places Muggles can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a\nhundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-\nquarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-\nMuggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for\nmonths. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper\ntickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle\ntransport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains —\nremember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of\ncourse, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from\nMuggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition point.\nFor those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys. They’re\nobjects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a\nprearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have\nbeen two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the\nnearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re\nheaded.”\nMr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond\nthe village of Ottery St. Catchpole.\n“What sort of objects are Portkeys?” said Harry curiously.\n“Well, they can be anything,” said Mr. Weasley. “Unobtrusive things,\nobviously, so Muggles don’t go picking them up and playing with them . . .\nstuff they’ll just think is litter. . . .”\nThey trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence\nbroken only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made\ntheir way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue.\nHarry’s hands and feet were freezing. Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch."

Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.\nThey didn’t have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb\nStoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on\nthick black tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and\nhis legs were starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.\n“Whew,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his\nsweater. “Well, we’ve made good time — we’ve got ten minutes. . . .”\nHermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.\n“Now we just need the Portkey,” said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and\nsquinting around at the ground. “It won’t be big. . . . Come on . . .”\nThey spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of\nminutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.\n“Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we’ve got it!”\nTwo tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of\nthe hilltop.\n“Amos!” said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had\nshouted. The rest of them followed.\nMr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby\nbrown beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.\n“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley. “He works for the\nDepartment for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think\nyou know his son, Cedric?”\nCedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He\nwas Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.\n“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.\nEverybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They\nhad never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first\nQuidditch match of the previous year.\n“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.\n“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley. “We live just on the other side of the\nvillage there. You?”\n“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got\nhis Apparition test. Still . . . not complaining . . . Quidditch World Cup,\nwouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that.\nMind you, looks like I got off easy. . . .” Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly\naround at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. “All these\nyours, Arthur?”\n“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.\n“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”\n“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry\nPotter?”\n“Er — yeah,” said Harry."

Harry\nPotter?”\n“Er — yeah,” said Harry.\nHarry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used\nto the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but\nit always made him feel uncomfortable.\n“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory. “Told us all about\nplaying against you last year. . . . I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be\nsomething to tell your grandchildren, that will. . . . You beat Harry Potter!”\nHarry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and\nGeorge were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.\n“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told you . . . it was an\naccident. . . .”\n“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his\nson on his back. “Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman . . . but the\nbest man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off\nhis broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the\nbetter flier!”\n“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch\nagain. “Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more, Amos?”\n“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts\ncouldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory. “There aren’t any more of us in this\narea, are there?”\n“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley. “Yes, it’s a minute off. . . . We’d\nbetter get ready. . . .”\nHe looked around at Harry and Hermione.\n“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do —”\nWith difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded\naround the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.\nThey all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.\nNobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a\nMuggle were to walk up here now . . . nine people, two of them grown men,\nclutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting. . . .\n“Three . . .” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, “two . . .\none . . .”\nIt happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel\nhad been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he\ncould feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging\ninto his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color;\nhis forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically\nonward and then —\nHis feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over;\nthe Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\nHarry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing,"

Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing,\nthough looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.\n“Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,” said a voice.\n— S E V E N —\nBAGMAN AND CROUCH\nH\narry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had\narrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor.\nIn front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom\nwas holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill.\nBoth were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the\nwatch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a\nponcho.\n“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to\nthe kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him;\nHarry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured\nfootball.\n“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily. “Not on duty, eh? It’s all right for\nsome. . . . We’ve been here all night. . . . You’d better get out of the way, we’ve\ngot a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five-fifteen. Hang on, I’ll\nfind your campsite. . . . Weasley . . . Weasley . . .” He consulted his parchment\nlist. “About a quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to. Site\nmanager’s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory . . . second field . . . ask for Mr.\nPayne.”\n“Thanks, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow\nhim.\nThey set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through\nthe mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate\nswam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of\nhundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field\ntoward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and\napproached the cottage door.\nA man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at\na glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard\ntheir footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.\n“Morning!” said Mr. Weasley brightly.\n“Morning,” said the Muggle.\n“Would you be Mr. Roberts?”\n“Aye, I would,” said Mr. Roberts. “And who’re you?”\n“Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago?”\n“Aye,” said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door. “You’ve got a\nspace up by the wood there. Just the one night?”\n“That’s it,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“You’ll be paying now, then?” said Mr. Roberts.\n“Ah — right — certainly —” said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a short\ndistance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. “Help me, Harry,”"

He retreated a short\ndistance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. “Help me, Harry,”\nhe muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to\npeel the notes apart. “This one’s a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number\non it now. . . . So this is a five?”\n“A twenty,” Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of\nMr. Roberts trying to catch every word.\n“Ah yes, so it is. . . . I don’t know, these little bits of paper . . .”\n“You foreign?” said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct\nnotes.\n“Foreign?” repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.\n“You’re not the first one who’s had trouble with money,” said Mr. Roberts,\nscrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. “I had two try and pay me with great gold\ncoins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.”\n“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley nervously.\nMr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.\n“Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking out over the misty\nfield again. “Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up. . . .”\n“Is that right?” said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr.\nRoberts didn’t give it to him.\n“Aye,” he said thoughtfully. “People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And\nnot just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There’s a bloke walking ’round in a\nkilt and a poncho.”\n“Shouldn’t he?” said Mr. Weasley anxiously.\n“It’s like some sort of . . . I dunno . . . like some sort of rally,” said Mr.\nRoberts. “They all seem to know each other. Like a big party.”\nAt that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr.\nRoberts’s front door.\n“Obliviate!” he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.\nInstantly, Mr. Roberts’s eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a\nlook of dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of\none who had just had his memory modified.\n“A map of the campsite for you,” Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley.\n“And your change.”\n“Thanks very much,” said Mr. Weasley.\nThe wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the\ncampsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were\ndeep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he\nmuttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a\nMemory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman’s not\nhelping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his\nvoice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I’ll be glad when this is\nover. See you later, Arthur.”\nHe Disapparated.\n“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,” said"

        "text": "over. See you later, Arthur.”\nHe Disapparated.\n“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,” said\nGinny, looking surprised. “He should know better than to talk about Bludgers\nnear Muggles, shouldn’t he?”\n“He should,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates\ninto the campsite, “but Ludo’s always been a bit . . . well . . . lax about\nsecurity. You couldn’t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports\ndepartment though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know.\nAnd he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.”\nThey trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked\nalmost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as\npossible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather\nvanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry\ncould hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up\nthe field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace,\nwith several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they\npassed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond\nthat was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath,\nsundial, and fountain.\n“Always the same,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We can’t resist showing off\nwhen we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.”\nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here\nwas an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read\nweezly.\n“Couldn’t have a better spot!” said Mr. Weasley happily. “The field is just\non the other side of the wood there, we’re as close as we could be.” He hoisted\nhis backpack from his shoulders. “Right,” he said excitedly, “no magic allowed,\nstrictly speaking, not when we’re out in these numbers on Muggle land. We’ll\nbe putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn’t be too difficult. . . . Muggles do\nit all the time. . . . Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?”\nHarry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him\non any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old\nneighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles\nand pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a\nhelp, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet,\nthey finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.\nAll of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these\ntents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble\nwas that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten.\nHermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical\nlook as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.\n“We’ll be a bit cramped,” he called, “but I think we’ll all squeeze in. Come\nand have a look.”"

Come\nand have a look.”\nHarry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had\nwalked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with\nbathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same\nsort of style as Mrs. Figg’s house: There were crocheted covers on the\nmismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\n“Well, it’s not for long,” said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a\nhandkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom.\n“I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn’t camp much anymore,\npoor fellow, he’s got lumbago.”\nHe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. “We’ll need water. . . .”\n“There’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,” said Ron, who had\nfollowed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its\nextraordinary inner proportions. “It’s on the other side of the field.”\n“Well, why don’t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water\nthen” — Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans —\n“and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?”\n“But we’ve got an oven,” said Ron. “Why can’t we just —”\n“Ron, anti-Muggle security!” said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with\nanticipation. “When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I’ve seen\nthem at it!”\nAfter a quick tour of the girls’ tent, which was slightly smaller than the\nboys’, though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off\nacross the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.\nNow, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city\nof tents that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through\nthe rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many\nwitches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought\nmuch about those in other countries.\nTheir fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families\nwith small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young\nbefore. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-\nshaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which\nwas swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his\nmother came hurrying out of the tent.\n“How many times, Kevin? You don’t — touch — Daddy’s — wand —\nyecchh!”\nShe had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after\nthem on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s yells — “You bust slug! You\nbust slug!”\nA short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin,\nwho were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes\nto skim the dewy grass.

A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he\nhurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, “In broad\ndaylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose —”\nHere and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents\nand starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them,\nconjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious\nlooks on their faces, as though sure this couldn’t work. Three African wizards\nsat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting\nwhat looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged\nAmerican witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched\nbetween their tents that read: the salem witches’ institute. Harry caught\nsnatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they\npassed, and though he couldn’t understand a word, the tone of every single\nvoice was excited.\n“Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?” said Ron.\nIt wasn’t just Ron’s eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all\ncovered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small,\noddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be\nseen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they\nheard their names.\n“Harry! Ron! Hermione!”\nIt was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting\nin front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who\nhad to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.\n“Like the decorations?” said Seamus, grinning. “The Ministry’s not too\nhappy.”\n“Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs. Finnigan. “You should\nsee what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You’ll be\nsupporting Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nbeadily. When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland,\nthey set off again, though, as Ron said, “Like we’d say anything else\nsurrounded by that lot.”\n“I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?” said\nHermione.\n“Let’s go and have a look,” said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents\nupfield, where the Bulgarian flag — white, green, and red — was fluttering in\nthe breeze.\nThe tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every\none of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face\nwith heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did\nwas blink and scowl.\n“Krum,” said Ron quietly.\n“What?” said Hermione.\n“Krum!” said Ron. “Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!”\n“He looks really grumpy,” said Hermione, looking around at the many\nKrums blinking and scowling at them.\n“‘Really grumpy’?” Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. “Who cares what he\nlooks like?

Only just eighteen or\nsomething. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight, you’ll see.”\nThere was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry,\nRon, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a\nheated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long\nflowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding\nout a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.\n“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk around like\nthat, the Muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious —”\n“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard stubbornly. “Muggles\nwear them.”\n“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,” said the\nMinistry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.\n“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation. “I like a healthy\nbreeze ’round my privates, thanks.”\nHermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point\nthat she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had\ncollected his water and moved away.\nWalking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made\ntheir way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar\nfaces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old\nCaptain of Harry’s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts,\ndragged Harry over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and told him\nexcitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.\nNext they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a\nlittle farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on\nthe Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot\nof water down his front as he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking\nthan anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom\nhe had never seen before.\n“Who d’you reckon they are?” he said. “They don’t go to Hogwarts, do\nthey?”\n“’Spect they go to some foreign school,” said Ron. “I know there are others.\nNever met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school\nin Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on an\nexchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t afford it. His penfriend got all\noffended when he said he wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his\nears shrivel up.”\nHarry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about\nother Wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so\nmany nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize\nthat Hogwarts couldn’t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked\nutterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news"

No doubt she had run across the news\nabout other Wizarding schools in some book or other.\n“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys’\ntents.\n“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not got that fire\nstarted yet?”\n“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.\nMr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn’t\nfor lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he\nlooked as though he was having the time of his life.\n“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in\nsurprise.\n“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly, taking the box from\nhim, and showing him how to do it properly.\nAt last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was\nhot enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited,\nhowever. Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of\nthoroughfare to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down\nit, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a\nrunning commentary, mainly for Harry’s and Hermione’s benefit; his own\nchildren knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.\n“That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. . . .\nHere comes Gilbert Wimple; he’s with the Committee on Experimental\nCharms; he’s had those horns for a while now. . . . Hello, Arnie . . . Arnold\nPeasegood, he’s an Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal\nSquad, you know. . . . and that’s Bode and Croaker . . . they’re\nUnspeakables. . . .”\n“They’re what?”\n“From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up\nto. . . .”\nAt last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and\nsausages when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward\nthem.\n“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly. “Ah, excellent, lunch!”\nThey were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr.\nWeasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding\ntoward them. “Aha!” he said. “The man of the moment! Ludo!”\nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far,\neven including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long\nQuidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An\nenormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest. He had the look of a\npowerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly\nacross a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played\nQuidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray\nBludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy\ncomplexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy."

He was walking as though he had\nsprings attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild\nexcitement.\n“Arthur, old man,” he puffed as he reached the campfire, “what a day, eh?\nWhat a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night\ncoming . . . and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements. . . . Not much for me\nto do!”\nBehind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past,\npointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending\nviolet sparks twenty feet into the air.\nPercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his\ndisapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him\nfrom wanting to make a good impression.\n“Ah — yes,” said Mr. Weasley, grinning, “this is my son Percy. He’s just\nstarted at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no, George, sorry — that’s Fred\n— Bill, Charlie, Ron — my daughter, Ginny — and Ron’s friends, Hermione\nGranger and Harry Potter.”\nBagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry’s name, and\nhis eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry’s forehead.\n“Everyone,” Mr. Weasley continued, “this is Ludo Bagman, you know who\nhe is, it’s thanks to him we’ve got such good tickets —”\nBagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.\n“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” he said eagerly, jingling what\nseemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black\nrobes. “I’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I\noffered him nice odds, considering Ireland’s front three are the strongest I’ve\nseen in years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm\non a week-long match.”\n“Oh . . . go on then,” said Mr. Weasley. “Let’s see . . . a Galleon on Ireland\nto win?”\n“A Galleon?” Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered\nhimself. “Very well, very well . . . any other takers?”\n“They’re a bit young to be gambling,” said Mr. Weasley. “Molly wouldn’t\nlike —”\n“We’ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,” said Fred as\nhe and George quickly pooled all their money, “that Ireland wins — but\nViktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand.”\n“You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that —” Percy\nhissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the\ncontrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and\nwhen the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman\nroared with laughter.\n“Excellent! I haven’t seen one that convincing in years! I’d pay five Galleons\nfor that!”"

Your mother —”\n“Don’t be a spoilsport, Arthur!” boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets\nexcitedly. “They’re old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland\nwill win but Krum’ll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance. . . . I’ll\ngive you excellent odds on that one. . . . We’ll add five Galleons for the funny\nwand, then, shall we. . . .”\nMr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook\nand quill and began jotting down the twins’ names.\n“Cheers,” said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him\nand tucking it away carefully. Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr.\nWeasley.\n“Couldn’t do me a brew, I suppose? I’m keeping an eye out for Barty\nCrouch. My Bulgarian opposite number’s making difficulties, and I can’t\nunderstand a word he’s saying. Barty’ll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a\nhundred and fifty languages.”\n“Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff\ndisapproval and positively writhing with excitement. “He speaks over two\nhundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll . . .”\n“Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively. “All you have to do is\npoint and grunt.”\nPercy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to\nbring the kettle back to the boil.\n“Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman\nsettled himself down on the grass beside them all.\n“Not a dicky bird,” said Bagman comfortably. “But she’ll turn up. Poor old\nBertha . . . memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you\ntake my word for it. She’ll wander back into the office sometime in October,\nthinking it’s still July.”\n“You don’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her?” Mr.\nWeasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.\n“Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his round eyes widening\ninnocently, “but we really can’t spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the\ndevil! Barty!”\nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made\nmore of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp\nrobes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably\ncrisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally\nstraight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it\nusing a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished.

Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules,\nand Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so\nthoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even\nUncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.\n“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside\nhim.\n“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in\nhis voice. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting\nwe add another twelve seats to the Top Box.”\n“Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman. “I thought the chap was\nasking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.”\n“Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of half-bow that\nmade him look like a hunchback. “Would you like a cup of tea?”\n“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. “Yes —\nthank you, Weatherby.”\nFred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the\nears, busied himself with the kettle.\n“Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,” said Mr. Crouch,\nhis sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. “Ali Bashir’s on the warpath. He\nwants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.”\nMr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.\n“I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve told him once I’ve told\nhim a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry\nof Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?”\n“I doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. “He’s desperate\nto export here.”\n“Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?” said Bagman.\n“Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle,” said Mr.\nCrouch. “I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve\n— but that was before carpets were banned, of course.”\nHe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his\nancestors had abided strictly by the law.\n“So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman breezily.\n“Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys across five continents\nis no mean feat, Ludo.”\n“I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over?” said Mr. Weasley.\nLudo Bagman looked shocked.\n“Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. . . . Still, it’s not as though we\nhaven’t got anything to look forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize,\neh?”\nMr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.\n“We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details —”\n“Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.\n“They’ve signed, haven’t they? They’ve agreed, haven’t they? I bet you"

By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering\nwith anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of\nwaiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretense disappeared: The Ministry seemed\nto have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic\nnow breaking out everywhere.\nSalesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts\nfull of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green for\nIreland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing the names of the players,\npointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves\nadorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played\ntheir national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts\nthat really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across\nthe palm of your hand, preening themselves.\n“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,” Ron told Harry as they\nand Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron\npurchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a\nsmall figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum\nwalked backward and forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up at the green\nrosette above him.\n“Wow, look at these!” said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with\nwhat looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts\nof weird knobs and dials.\n“Omnioculars,” said the saleswizard eagerly. “You can replay action . . . slow\neverything down . . . and they flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need\nit. Bargain — ten Galleons each.”\n“Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said Ron, gesturing at his dancing\nshamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.\n“Three pairs,” said Harry firmly to the wizard."

He was always touchy about the\nfact that Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much\nmore money than he did.\n“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” Harry told him, thrusting\nOmnioculars into his and Hermione’s hands. “For about ten years, mind.”\n“Fair enough,” said Ron, grinning.\n“Oooh, thanks, Harry,” said Hermione. “And I’ll get us some programs,\nlook —”\nTheir money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill,\nCharlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was\ncarrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given\nBagman all their gold.\nAnd then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods,\nand at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path\nto the field.\n“It’s time!” said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. “Come on,\nlet’s go!”\n— E I G H T —\nTHE QUIDDITCH\nWORLD CUP\nC\nlutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into\nthe wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of\nthousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of\nsinging. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry\ncouldn’t stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes,\ntalking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and\nfound themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could\nsee only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could\ntell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.\n“Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look\non Harry’s face. “Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it\nall year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles\nhave got anywhere near here all year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent\nappointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,” he added fondly,\nleading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by\na swarm of shouting witches and wizards.\n“Prime seats!” said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked\ntheir tickets. “Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.”\nThe stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered\nupward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors\ninto the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley’s party kept climbing, and\nat last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small\nbox, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway\nbetween the golden goalposts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in\ntwo rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked\ndown upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined."

Everything was suffused\nwith a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself.\nThe field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of\nthe field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at\nHarry’s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across\nit as though an invisible giant’s hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and\nthen wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing\nadvertisements across the field.\nThe Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — Safe, Reliable, and\nwith Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer . . . Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose\nMagical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear\n— London, Paris, Hogsmeade . . .\nHarry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see\nwho else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny\ncreature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them.\nThe creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the\nchair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in\nits hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .\n“Dobby?” said Harry incredulously.\nThe tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous\nbrown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t\nDobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby\nhad been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.\n“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its\nfingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering\nsqueak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with\na house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun\naround in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from\nHarry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in\ninterest.\n“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were someone I knew.”\n“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face,\nas though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. “My\nname is Winky, sir — and you, sir —” Her dark brown eyes widened to the\nsize of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar. “You is surely Harry\nPotter!”\n“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.\n“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very\nslightly and looking awestruck.\n“How is he?” said Harry. “How’s freedom suiting him?”\n“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir,"

Can’t get another position, sir.”\n“Why not?” said Harry.\nWinky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, “He is wanting\npaying for his work, sir.”\n“Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well — why shouldn’t he be paid?”\nWinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so\nthat her face was half-hidden again.\n“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled squeak. “No, no, no. I\nsays to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby.\nHe is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-\nelf.

I is not liking\nheights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box and\ngulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”\n“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said Harry,\nfrowning.\n“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very\nbusy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.\n“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does\nwhat she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”\nShe gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes\ncompletely again. Harry turned back to the others.\n“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”\n“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.\nRon pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into\nthe crowd on the other side of the stadium.\n“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old\nbloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . .”\nHermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered,\ntasseled program.\n“‘A display from the team mascots will precede the match,’” she read aloud.\n“Oh that’s always worth watching,” said Mr. Weasley. “National teams\nbring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.”"

Mr. Weasley\nkept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards.\nPercy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit\non a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself,\narrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly\nembarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his\nseat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like\nan old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry’s hand in a\nfatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on\neither side of him.\n“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was\nwearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to\nunderstand a word of English. “Harry Potter . . . oh come on now, you know\nwho he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he\nis —”\nThe Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling\nloudly and excitedly, pointing at it.\n“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily to Harry. “I’m no\ngreat shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see\nhis house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters\nhave been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to\nthree still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby\nthe house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman\nHarry supposed must be Draco’s mother.\nHarry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first\njourney to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair,\nDraco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim,\nshe would have been nice-looking if she hadn’t been wearing a look that\nsuggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.\n“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the\nMinister of Magic. “How are you? I don’t think you’ve met my wife, Narcissa?\nOr our son, Draco?”\n“How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs.\nMalfoy. “And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr.\n— well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can’t understand a word\nI’m saying anyway, so never mind. And let’s see who else — you know Arthur\nWeasley, I daresay?”\nIt was a tense moment.

Mr. Malfoy’s cold\ngray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row.\n“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you have to sell to get seats\nin the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn’t have fetched this much?”\nFudge, who wasn’t listening, said, “Lucius has just given a very generous\ncontribution to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries,\nArthur. He’s here as my guest.”\n“How — how nice,” said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile.\nMr. Malfoy’s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but\nstared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr.\nMalfoy’s lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being\npurebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like\nHermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic,\nMr. Malfoy didn’t dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley\nand continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and\nHermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother\nand father.\n“Slimy gits,” Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the\nfield again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.\n“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited\nEdam. “Minister — ready to go?”\n“Ready when you are, Ludo,” said Fudge comfortably.\nLudo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said\n“Sonorus!” and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the\npacked stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the\nstands.\n“Ladies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four\nhundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!”\nThe spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding\ntheir discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite\nBertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans\nthem was wiped clear of its last message (\n— A Risk with Every Mouthful!\n) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.\n“And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the Bulgarian\nNational Team Mascots!”\nThe right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared\nits approval.\n“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his\nseat. “Aaah!” He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly\non his robes. “Veela!”\n“What are veel — ?”\nBut a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry’s\nquestion was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful\nwomen Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren’t — they couldn’t be\n— human.

All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the\nveela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . .\nAnd as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started\nchasing through Harry’s dazed mind. He wanted to do something very\nimpressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good\nidea . . . but would it be good enough?\n“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice from a long way off.\nThe music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs\nwas resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude\nthat looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.\nAngry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn’t want the veela to go.\nHarry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he\nwondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest.\nRon, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr.\nWeasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his\nhands.\n“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their say.”\n“Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up\nalong one side of the field.\nHermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back\ninto his seat. “Honestly!” she said.\n“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put your wands in the\nair . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!”\nNext moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came\nzooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into\ntwo smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goalposts. A rainbow arced\nsuddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd\noooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow\nfaded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great\nshimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the\nstands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it —\n“Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold\ncoins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the\nshamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny\nlittle bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or\ngreen.\n“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the\ncrowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their\nchairs to retrieve the gold."

Now you’ve got to buy me a Christmas\npresent, ha!”\nThe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field\non the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to\nwatch the match.\n“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National\nQuidditch Team! I give you — Dimitrov!”\nA scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out\nonto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian\nsupporters.\n“Ivanova!”\nA second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.\n“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand — Krum!”\n“That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum with his\nOmnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.\nViktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose\nand thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was\nhard to believe he was only eighteen.\n“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!” yelled\nBagman. “Presenting — Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley!\nAaaaaand — Lynch!”\nSeven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side\nof his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word\n“Firebolt” on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver,\nupon their backs.\n“And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of\nthe International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!”\nA small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival\nUncle Vernon’s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out\nonto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and\nhe was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the\nother. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching\nclosely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open — four\nballs burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry\nsaw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule,\nwinged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into\nthe air after the balls.\n“Theeeeeeeey’re OFF!” screamed Bagman. “And it’s Mullet! Troy! Moran!\nDimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!”\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing\nhis Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of\nhis nose.

Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again,\npressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching\nin slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and\nthe noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\nHAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers\nzoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran,\nbearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made\nas though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian\nChaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian\nBeaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club,\nknocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and\ndropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it —\n“TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar\nof applause and cheers. “Ten zero to Ireland!”\n“What?” Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars.\n“But Levski’s got the Quaffle!”\n“Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss\nthings!” shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms\nin the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly\nover the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from\nthe sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering\nshamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\nFurious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play\nresumed.\nHarry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were\nsuperb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated\nthat they appeared to be reading one another’s minds as they positioned\nthemselves, and the rosette on Harry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy\n— Mullet — Moran!” And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more,\nbringing their lead to thirty–zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and\napplause from the green-clad supporters.\nThe match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the\nBulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the\nIrish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best\nmoves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to\nbreak through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first\ngoal.\n“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in\ncelebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the\ngame. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had\nstopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\n“Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!” roared Bagman."

Ivanova — oh I say!” roared Bagman.\nOne hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and\nLynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as\nthough they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry\nfollowed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the\nSnitch was —\n“They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to Harry.\nShe was half right — at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the\ndive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that\ncould be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish\nseats.\n“Fool!” moaned Mr. Weasley. “Krum was feinting!”\n“It’s time-out!” yelled Bagman’s voice, “as trained mediwizards hurry onto\nthe field to examine Aidan Lynch!”\n“He’ll be okay, he only got ploughed!” Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny,\nwho was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. “Which is\nwhat Krum was after, of course. . . .”\nHarry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his\nOmnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.\nHe watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE\nFEINT — DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses.\nHe saw Krum’s face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive\njust in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood — Krum hadn’t\nseen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never\nseen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a\nbroomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked\nunsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal\nand focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was\nbeing revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more\nclosely upon Krum’s face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a\nhundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look\nfor the Snitch without interference.\nLynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters,\nmounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to\ngive Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers\nmoved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\nAfter fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten\nmore goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten,\nand the game was starting to get dirtier.\nAs Mullet shot toward the goalposts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly\nunder her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever\nhappened was over so quickly Harry didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from\nthe Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a\nfoul."

He turned\nto look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.\n“Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.\nHarry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of\nthe dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his\nmuscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly.\n“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly\namused. “Somebody slap the referee!”\nA mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own\nears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to\nhimself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked\nexceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had\nstopped dancing and were looking mutinous.\n“And unless I’m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off\nthe Bulgarian team mascots!” said Bagman’s voice. “Now there’s something we\nhaven’t seen before. . . . Oh, this could turn nasty. . . .”\nIt did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side\nof Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the\nleprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words “HEE, HEE, HEE.”\nMostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians’ arguments, however; he was\njabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and\nwhen they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.\n“Two penalties for Ireland!” shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd\nhowled with anger. “And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those\nbrooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy takes the Quaffle . . .”\nPlay now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The\nBeaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in\nparticular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger\nor human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight\nat Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.\n“Foul!” roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of\ngreen.\n“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice. “Dimitrov skins"

At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched\nthemselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of\nfire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that\nthey didn’t look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were\nelongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were\nbursting from their shoulders —\n“And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below,\n“is why you should never go for looks alone!”\nMinistry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the\nleprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was\nnothing to the one taking place above.

The game recommenced immediately; now\nLevski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov —\nThe Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as\nhard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him\nfull in the face.\nThere was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose looked broken,\nthere was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle. He\nhad become distracted, and Harry couldn’t blame him; one of the veela had\nthrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.\nHarry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he\nwas supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron\nobviously felt the same.\n“Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look at him —”\n“Look at Lynch!” Harry yelled.\nFor the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite\nsure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing. . . .\n“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it! Look at him go!”\nHalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish\nsupporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . .\nbut Krum was on his tail.

Then, slowly, as though a\ngreat jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters\ngrew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.\n“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be\ntaken aback by the sudden end of the match. “KRUM GETS THE SNITCH\n— BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don’t think any of us were\nexpecting that!”\n“What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up\nand down, applauding with his hands over his head. “He ended it when\nIreland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!”\n“He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry shouted back over all\nthe noise, also applauding loudly. “The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He\nwanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. . . .”\n“He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said, leaning forward to watch\nKrum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling\nleprechauns and veela to get to him. “He looks a terrible mess. . . .”\nHarry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was\nhappening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the\nfield, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He\nlooked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team\nmembers were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short\nway away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold\ndescending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the\nIrish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into\ntheir usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.\n“Vell, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked\naround; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.\n“You can speak English!” said Fudge, sounding outraged. “And you’ve been\nletting me mime everything all day!”\n“Vell, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.\n“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots,"

Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a\nvast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was\nstill looking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign language all day for\nnothing.\n“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!” Bagman\nshouted.\nAnd up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players.\nThe crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands\nand thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.\nOne by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and\nBagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own\nminister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess.\nTwo black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still\nholding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on\nthe ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But\nwhen Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a\nresounding, earsplitting roar.\nAnd then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran\nand Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked\nstrangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the\nCup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry’s hands\nwere numb with clapping.\nAt last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of\nhonor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly’s, clutching\nhard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman\npointed his wand at his throat and muttered, “Quietus.”\n“They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said hoarsely, “a really\nunexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn’t have lasted longer. . . . Ah\nyes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?”\nFor Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and\nwere standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their\nhands outstretched.\n— N I N E —\nTHE DARK MARK\nD\non’t tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr. Weasley implored\nFred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple-\ncarpeted stairs.\n“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big plans for this\nmoney. We don’t want it confiscated.”\nMr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these\nbig plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn’t want to\nknow.\nThey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium"

When they\nfinally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of\nnoise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of\ncocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the\nmatch; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with\nCharlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and\nspilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the\nverbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went\ninto the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into\npajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite\nthey could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.\n“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. “I\nwouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they’ve got to stop celebrating.”\nHarry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas\nceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern\nflying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum’s more spectacular moves.\nHe was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski\nFeint. . . . Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his\nwriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like. . . . Harry saw\nhimself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of\nhearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman’s voice\nechoed throughout the stadium, “I give you . . .

Ron — Harry — come on now, get up, this is urgent!”\nHarry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.\n“’S’ matter?” he said.\nDimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite\nhad changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound\nof people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his\nclothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas,\nsaid, “No time, Harry — just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!”\nHarry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.\nBy the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people\nrunning away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the\nfield toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises\nlike gunfire.

Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting\ntoward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the\nscene.\nA crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands\npointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted\nat them. . . . They didn’t seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their\nheads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in\nmidair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It\nwas as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the\npeople above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose\nfrom the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.\nMore wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at\nthe floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled.\nOnce or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with\nhis wand. Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.\nThe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning\ntent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager.\nThe other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of\nthe marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her\nnightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover\nherself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.\n“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had\nbegun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply\nfrom side to side. “That is really sick. . . .”\nHermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their\nnightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill,\nCharlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’ tent, fully dressed, with their\nsleeves rolled up and their wands out.\n“We’re going to help the Ministry!” Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise,\nrolling up his own sleeves. “You lot — get into the woods, and stick together.\nI’ll come and fetch you when we’ve sorted this out!”\nBill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming\nmarchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them.

They all looked back\nas they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger\nthan ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the\nhooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty.

Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were\ncrying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in\nthe cold night air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people\nwhose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\n“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that\nHarry walked into her. “Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid — Lumos!”\nShe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path.\nRon was lying sprawled on the ground.\n“Tripped over a tree root,” he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\n“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” said a drawling voice from behind\nthem.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing\nalone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded,\nhe seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in\nthe trees.\nRon told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have\ndared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\n“Language, Weasley,” said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. “Hadn’t you\nbetter be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”\nHe nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb\nsounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees\naround them.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione defiantly.\n“Granger, they’re after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D’you want to be showing\noff your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around . . . they’re\nmoving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.”\n“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.\n“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. “If you\nthink they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.”\n“You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that\n“Mudblood” was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle\nparentage.\n“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron’s arm to restrain\nhim as he took a step toward Malfoy.\nThere came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than\nanything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled\nsoftly.\n“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose your daddy told you all\nto hide? What’s he up to — trying to rescue the Muggles?”\n“Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out there wearing\nmasks, are they?”\nMalfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\n“Well . . . if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?”\n“Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, “let’s go\nand find the others.”\n“Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered Malfoy.\n“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path\nagain."

Where have the others got to?”\nFred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was\npacked with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders\ntoward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas\nwas arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry,\nRon, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, “Où\nest Madame Maxime? Nous l’avons perdue —”\n“Er — what?” said Ron.\n“Oh . . .” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they\nwalked on they distinctly heard her say, “’Ogwarts.”\n“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.\n“Sorry?” said Harry.\n“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know . . .\nBeauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical\nEducation in Europe.”\n“Oh . . . yeah . . . right,” said Harry.\n“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand,\nlighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the\npockets of his jacket for his own wand — but it wasn’t there. The only thing\nhe could find was his Omnioculars.\n“Ah, no, I don’t believe it . . . I’ve lost my wand!”\n“You’re kidding!”\nRon and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow\nbeams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his\nwand was nowhere to be seen.\n“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.\n“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?” Hermione\nsuggested anxiously.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “maybe . . .”\nHe usually kept his wand with him at all times in the Wizarding world, and\nfinding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very\nvulnerable.\nA rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf\nwas fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a\nmost peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though\nsomeone invisible were trying to hold her back.\n“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned\nforward and labored to keep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky\nis getting out of the way!”\nAnd she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting\nand squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.\n“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. “Why can’t\nshe run properly?”\n“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was thinking of\nDobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like,"

        "text": "she run properly?”\n“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was thinking of\nDobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like,\nthe house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\n“You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!” said Hermione indignantly.\n“It’s slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of\nthe stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even\nrun when they start trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about\nit?”\n“Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said. “You heard old Winky\nback at the match . . . ‘House-elves is not supposed to have fun’ . . . that’s\nwhat she likes, being bossed around. . . .”\n“It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly, “who prop up rotten\nand unjust systems, just because they’re too lazy to —”\nAnother loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\n“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and Harry saw him glance\nedgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps\nHermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still\nsearching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn’t there.\nThey followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out\nfor Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were\ncackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the\nmatch, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite.\nFarther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when\nthey looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing\nin a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were\ntalking very loudly.\n“I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!” one of them\nshouted. “I’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous\nCreatures.”\n“No, you’re not!” yelled his friend. “You’re a dishwasher at the Leaky\nCauldron. . . . but I’m a vampire hunter, I’ve killed about ninety so far —”\nA third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery\nlight of the veela, now cut in, “I’m about to become the youngest-ever\nMinister of Magic, I am.”\nHarry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name\nwas Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight\nBus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron’s face had gone oddly slack, and next\nsecond Ron was yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach\nJupiter?”\n“Honestly!” said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the\narms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of\nthe veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart\nof the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter."

They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\nHarry looked around. “I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We’ll hear\nanyone coming a mile off.”\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged\nfrom behind a tree right ahead of them.\nEven by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great\nchange had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced;\nthere was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\n“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their\nfaces. “What are you doing in here, all alone?”\nThey looked at one another, surprised.\n“Well — there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.\nBagman stared at him.\n“What?”\n“At the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . . .”\nBagman swore loudly.\n“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word,\nhe Disapparated with a small pop!\n“Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?” said Hermione,\nfrowning.\n“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading the way off the path into\na small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.\n“The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was\nwith them.”\nHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the\nground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was\nslightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his\nsplayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the\ncampsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\n“I hope the others are okay,” said Hermione after a while.\n“They’ll be fine,” said Ron.\n“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said Harry, sitting down next\nto Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.\n“He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”\n“That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,” said Ron.\n“Those poor Muggles, though,” said Hermione nervously. “What if they\ncan’t get them down?”\n“They will,” said Ron reassuringly. “They’ll find a way.”\n“Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of\nMagic’s out here tonight!” said Hermione. “I mean, how do they expect to get\naway with it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are they just —”\nBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron\nlooked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering\ntoward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps\nbehind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\n“Hello?” called Harry.\nThere was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was\ntoo dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the\nrange of his vision."

It was\ntoo dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the\nrange of his vision.\n“Who’s there?” he said.\nAnd then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they\nhad heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what\nsounded like a spell.\n“MORSMORDRE!”\nAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of\ndarkness Harry’s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the\ntreetops and into the sky.\n“What the — ?” gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the\nthing that had appeared.\nFor a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation.\nThen he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like\nemerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they\nwatched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched\nagainst the black sky like a new constellation.\nSuddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn’t\nunderstand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the\nskull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like\nsome grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had\nconjured the skull, but he couldn’t see anyone.\n“Who’s there?” he called again.\n“Harry, come on, move!” Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and\nwas tugging him backward.\n“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her face so white and\nterrified.\n“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she\ncould. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”\n“Voldemort’s — ?”\n“Harry, come on!”\nHarry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the\nthree of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few\nhurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty\nwizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\nHarry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of\nthese wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,\nRon, and Hermione.\nWithout pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”\nHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\n“STUPEFY!” roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of flashes\nand Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had\nswept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery\nred light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one another,\nbouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —\n“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my son!”\nHarry’s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The\nwizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr.\nWeasley striding toward them, looking terrified.\n“Ron — Harry” — his voice sounded shaky — “Hermione — are you all\nright?”"

He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on\nthem. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch’s face was taut with rage.\n“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them.\n“Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?”\n“We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\n“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking\nindignantly at his father. “What did you want to attack us for?”\n“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly\nat Ron, and his eyes were popping — he looked slightly mad. “You have been\ndiscovered at the scene of the crime!”\n“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, “they’re kids,\nBarty, they’d never have been able to —”\n“Where did the Mark come from, you three?” said Mr. Weasley quickly.\n“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had\nheard the voice. “There was someone behind the trees . . . they shouted words\n— an incantation —”\n“Oh, stood over there, did they?” said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping\neyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. “Said an incantation,\ndid they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned,\nmissy —”\nBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it\nremotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the\ncontrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised their wands again and were\npointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\n“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her\nhead. “They’ll have Disapparated.”\n“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos\nDiggory, Cedric’s father. “Our Stunners went right through those trees. . . .\nThere’s a good chance we got them. . . .”\n“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory\nsquared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and\ndisappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands\nover her mouth.\nA few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\n“Yes! We got them! There’s someone here! Unconscious! It’s — but —\nblimey . . .”\n“You’ve got someone?” shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving.\n“Who? Who is it?”\nThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching\nfootsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a\ntiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was\nWinky."

It was\nWinky.\nMr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the\nground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch.\nFor a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white\nface as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.\n“This — cannot — be,” he said jerkily. “No —”\nHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place\nwhere he had found Winky.\n“No point, Mr. Crouch,” Mr. Diggory called after him. “There’s no one\nelse there.”\nBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could\nhear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes\naside, searching.\n“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky’s\nunconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house-elf . . . I mean to say . . .”\n“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you don’t seriously think it\nwas the elf? The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign. It requires a wand.”\n“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she had a wand.”\n“What?” said Mr. Weasley.\n“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley.\n“Had it in her hand. So that’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken,\nfor a start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.”\nJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to\nMr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot,\ngoggling upward at the emerald-green skull.\n“The Dark Mark!” he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned\ninquiringly to his colleagues. “Who did it? Did you get them? Barty! What’s\ngoing on?”\nMr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white,\nand his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.\n“Where have you been, Barty?” said Bagman. “Why weren’t you at the\nmatch? Your elf was saving you a seat too — gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had\njust noticed Winky lying at his feet. “What happened to her?”\n“I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky\nfashion, barely moving his lips. “And my elf has been Stunned.”\n“Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why — ?”\nComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman’s round, shiny face; he\nlooked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.\n“No!” he said. “Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn’t know how!\nShe’d need a wand, for a start!”\n“And she had one,” said Mr. Diggory. “I found her holding one, Ludo. If"

If\nit’s all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she’s got to\nsay for herself.”\nCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory\nseemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at\nWinky, and said, “Rennervate!”\nWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several\ntimes in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised\nherself shakily into a sitting position. She caught sight of Mr. Diggory’s feet,\nand slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more\nslowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull\nreflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly\naround the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.\n“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I am? I’m a member of\nthe Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!”\nWinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath\ncoming in sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his\nmoments of terrified disobedience.\n“As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,” said\nMr. Diggory. “And you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An\nexplanation, if you please!”\n“I — I — I is not doing it, sir!” Winky gasped. “I is not knowing how, sir!”\n“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory,\nbrandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was\nfilling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.\n“Hey — that’s mine!” he said.\nEveryone in the clearing looked at him.\n“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.\n“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”\n“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is this a confession?\nYou threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?”\n“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. “Is\nHarry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?”\n“Er — of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry . . . carried away . . .”\n“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the\ntrees beneath the skull. “I missed it right after we got into the wood.”\n“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky\nagain, cowering at his feet. “You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it\nup and thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?”\n“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky, tears streaming down\nthe sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. “I is . . .

She looked very nervous, speaking up in\nfront of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a\nsqueaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much\ndeeper!” She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. “It\ndidn’t sound anything like Winky, did it?”\n“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It definitely didn’t sound like an elf.”\n“Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.\n“Well, we’ll soon see,” growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. “There’s\na simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know\nthat?”\nWinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr.\nDiggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry’s.\n“Prior Incantato!” roared Mr. Diggory.\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull\nerupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of\nthe green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick\ngray smoke: the ghost of a spell.\n“Deletrius!” Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of\nsmoke.\n“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon\nWinky, who was still shaking convulsively.\n“I is not doing it!” she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. “I is not, I is not,\nI is not knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn’t using wands, I isn’t knowing\nhow!”\n“You’ve been caught red-handed, elf!” Mr. Diggory roared. “Caught with the\nguilty wand in your hand!”\n“Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it . . . precious few wizards\nknow how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it?”\n“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable,\n“that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?”\nThere was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked horrified.\n“Mr. Crouch . . . not . . . not at all . . .”\n“You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing\nwho are least likely to conjure that Mark!” barked Mr. Crouch. “Harry Potter\n— and myself! I suppose you are familiar with the boy’s story, Amos?”\n“Of course — everyone knows —” muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly\ndiscomforted.\n“And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career,\nthat I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?” Mr.\nCrouch shouted, his eyes bulging again."

Winky?” he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as\nthough he too was shouting at her. “Where exactly did you find Harry’s\nwand?”\nWinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying\nbeneath her fingers.\n“I — I is finding it . . . finding it there, sir. . . .” she whispered, “there . . . in\nthe trees, sir. . . .”\n“You see, Amos?” said Mr. Weasley. “Whoever conjured the Mark could\nhave Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind.

Did you see anyone?”\nWinky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr.\nDiggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said,\n“I is seeing no one, sir . . . no one . . .”\n“Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware that, in the ordinary\ncourse of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for\nquestioning. I ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.”\nMr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of this suggestion at\nall, but it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member\nof the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.\n“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch added coldly.\n“M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes\nbrimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .”\nMr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it\nmore deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.\n“Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed\npossible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay\nthere while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me.\nThis means clothes.”\n“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet. “No,\nmaster! Not clothes, not clothes!”"

Not clothes, not clothes!”\nHarry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with\nproper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel\nas she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.\n“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr.\nCrouch. “Your elf’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were\nlevitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!”\nMr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf,\nwhom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that\nwas contaminating his over-shined shoes.\n“I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly, looking over\nat Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her\nmaster, and to her master’s reputation.”\nWinky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There\nwas a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly,\n“Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody’s got any objections.\nAmos, that wand’s told us all it can — if Harry could have it back, please —”\nMr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.\n“Come on, you three,” Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn’t seem\nto want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. “Hermione!” Mr.\nWeasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of\nthe clearing and off through the trees.\n“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had\nleft the clearing.\n“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously. “Mr. Diggory,\ncalling her ‘elf’ all the time . . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it\nand he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or\nhow upset she was — it was like she wasn’t even human!”\n“Well, she’s not,” said Ron.\nHermione rounded on him.\n“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s disgusting the way —”\n“Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on,\n“but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as\nfast as we can. What happened to the others?”\n“We lost them in the dark,” said Ron. “Dad, why was everyone so uptight\nabout that skull thing?”\n“I’ll explain everything back at the tent,” said Mr. Weasley tensely.\nBut when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A\nlarge crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there,\nand when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged\nforward.\n“What’s going on in there?”\n“Who conjured it?”\n“Arthur — it’s not — Him?”"

Now excuse me, please, I want to\nget to bed.”\nHe led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the\ncampsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though\nseveral ruined tents were still smoking.\nCharlie’s head was poking out of the boys’ tent.\n“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark. “Fred, George, and\nGinny got back okay, but the others —”\n“I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the\ntent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\nBill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm,\nwhich was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy\nwas sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though\nshaken.\n“Did you get them, Dad?” said Bill sharply. “The person who conjured the\nMark?”\n“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barty Crouch’s elf holding Harry’s\nwand, but we’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark.”\n“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.\n“Harry’s wand?” said Fred.\n“Mr. Crouch’s elf?” said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\nWith some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley\nexplained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their\nstory, Percy swelled indignantly.\n“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!” he said.\n“Running away when he’d expressly told her not to . . . embarrassing him in\nfront of the whole Ministry . . . how would that have looked, if she’d been\nbrought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control —”\n“She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong\ntime!” Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione\nhad always got on fairly well with Percy — better, indeed, than any of the\nothers.\n“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf\nwho’s going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering\nhimself.\n“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione. “She just picked it up off the\nground!”\n“Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said Ron\nimpatiently. “It wasn’t hurting anyone. . . . Why’s it such a big deal?”\n“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said Hermione, before\nanyone else could answer. “I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark\nArts.”\n“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “Of\ncourse people panicked . . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back\nagain.”"

Just picture coming home and finding the Dark\nMark hovering over your house, and knowing what you’re about to find\ninside. . . .” Mr. Weasley winced. “Everyone’s worst fear . . . the very\nworst . . .”\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his\narm to check on his cut, said, “Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever\nconjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all\nDisapparated before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught\nthe Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They’re having their\nmemories modified right now.”\n“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”\n“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill. “I\nthink we saw what’s left of them tonight — the ones who managed to keep\nthemselves out of Azkaban, anyway.”\n“We can’t prove it was them, Bill,” said Mr. Weasley. “Though it probably\nwas,” he added hopelessly.\n“Yeah, I bet it was!” said Ron suddenly. “Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the\nwoods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks!\nAnd we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!”\n“But what were Voldemort’s supporters —” Harry began. Everybody\nflinched — like most of the Wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided\nsaying Voldemort’s name. “Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “What were You-\nKnow-Who’s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the\npoint?”\n“The point?” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. “Harry, that’s their idea\nof fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power\nwere done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn’t resist\nreminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for\nthem,” he finished disgustedly.\n“But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw\nthe Dark Mark?” said Ron. “They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t\nthey?”\n“Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill. “If they really were Death Eaters, they\nworked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power,\nand told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people.

I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased with\nthem, do you?”\n“So . . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark . . .” said Hermione slowly, “were\nthey doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?”\n“Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,” said Mr. Weasley. “But I’ll tell\nyou this . . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I’d\nbe very surprised if the person who did it hadn’t been a Death Eater once, even\nif they’re not now. . . . Listen, it’s very late, and if your mother hears what’s\nhappened she’ll be worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try\nand get an early Portkey out of here.”\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to\nfeel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake —\nwide-awake, and worried.\nThree days ago — it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days\n— he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in\nthirteen years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the sky. What did\nthese things mean?\nHe thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive.\nWould Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up\nat the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep,\nand it was a long time after Charlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally\ndozed off.\n— T E N —\nMAYHEM AT THE\nMINISTRY\nM\nr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used\nmagic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly\nas possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a\nstrange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague “Merry\nChristmas.”\n“He’ll be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the\nmoor. “Sometimes, when a person’s memory’s modified, it makes him a bit\ndisorientated for a while . . . and that was a big thing they had to make him\nforget.”\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys\nlay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and\nwizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get\naway from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried\ndiscussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old\nrubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They\nwalked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the\nBurrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted,\nand thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the\nBurrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\n“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”"

As they rounded the corner and the\nBurrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\n“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard,\ncame running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale\nand strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand.\n“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried —”\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell\nout of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline:\nSCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-\nwhite photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.\n“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr.\nWeasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, “you’re alive. . . . Oh\nboys . . .”\nAnd to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them\nboth into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.\n“Ouch! Mum — you’re strangling us —”\n“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s\nall I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the\nlast thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough O.W.L.s? Oh\nFred . . . George . . .”\n“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr. Weasley\nsoothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house.\n“Bill,” he added in an undertone, “pick up that paper, I want to see what it\nsays. . . .”\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had\nmade Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted\non pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhisky, Bill handed his father the\nnewspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his\nshoulder.\n“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry blunders . . . culprits not\napprehended . . . lax security . . . Dark wizards running unchecked . . . national\ndisgrace . . . Who wrote this? Ah . . . of course . . . Rita Skeeter.”\n“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!” said Percy furiously.\n“Last week she was saying we’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron\nthickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn’t specifically\nstated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard\nPart-Humans —”\n“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.”\n“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as\nhe reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.\n“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whisky. “If I’d\nseen that, I’d have known you were alive!”\n“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If the terrified wizards"

A Ministry\nofficial emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that\nnobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any more information. Whether this\nstatement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed\nfrom the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley\nin exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. “Nobody was hurt. What was I\nsupposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods . . .\nwell, there certainly will be rumors now she’s printed that.”\nHe heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go into the office; this\nis going to take some smoothing over.”\n“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly. “Mr. Crouch will need\nall hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.”\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset.\n“Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t got anything to do\nwith your office; surely they can handle this without you?”\n“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made things worse. I’ll just\nchange into my robes and I’ll be off. . . .”\n“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, “Hedwig\nhasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she?”\n“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No . . . no, there hasn’t\nbeen any post at all.”\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at\nboth of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room,\nRon?”\n“Yeah . . . think I will too,” said Ron at once. “Hermione?”\n“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen\nand up the stairs.\n“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the\nattic room behind them.\n“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said. “On Saturday morning,\nI woke up with my scar hurting again.”\nRon’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined\nthem back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started\nmaking suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and\neverybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse.\nRon simply looked dumbstruck.\n“But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean — last time your\nscar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn’t he?”\n“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I was dreaming\nabout him . . . him and Peter — you know, Wormtail. I can’t remember all of\nit now, but they were plotting to kill . . . someone.”\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying “me,” but couldn’t\nbring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did."

My scar hurts, and three days\nlater the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort’s sign’s up in the sky\nagain.”\n“Don’t — say — his — name!” Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\n“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” Harry went on, ignoring\nRon. “At the end of last year?”\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione’s\nterrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.\n“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud\nsays?”\n“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her. This time was\ndifferent. I told you, she went into a trance — a real one. And she said the\nDark Lord would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever before . . .\nand he’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him . . . and\nthat night Wormtail escaped.”\nThere was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in\nhis Chudley Cannons bedspread.\n“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?” Hermione asked. “Are\nyou expecting a letter?”\n“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging. “I’m waiting for his\nanswer.”\n“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I bet Sirius’ll know\nwhat to do!”\n“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.\n“But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere,\ncouldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to manage that\njourney in a few days.”\n“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as\nhe looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.\n“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,” said Ron.\n“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will\nplay. . . .

People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don’t open a\nHowler straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best\nquill reduced to cinders.”\n“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny, who was mending her\ncopy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in\nfront of the living room fire.\n“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said Percy. “They want\ncompensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher’s put in a claim\nfor a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I’ve got his number. I\nknow for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.”\nMrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked\nthis clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but\notherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was\nengraved with one of the Weasley family’s names. There were no numerals\naround the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be.\n“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,”\n“lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number twelve\nwould be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”\nEight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position, but Mr.\nWeasley’s, which was the longest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasley\nsighed.\n“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of\nYou-Know-Who,” she said. “They’re working him far too hard. His dinner’s\ngoing to be ruined if he doesn’t come home soon.”\n“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn’t\nhe?” said Percy. “If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public\nstatement without clearing it with his Head of Department first —”\n“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman\nwrote!” said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.\n“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was\ndisgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said Bill, who\nwas playing chess with Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good.\nRemember, she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once, and called\nme ‘a long-haired pillock’?”\n“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. “If you’d just let me\n—”\n“No, Mum.”\nRain lashed against the living room window.

The rain sounded even louder at\nthe top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the\nwind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic.\nPigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered.\nThe sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of\nexcitement.\n“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry.\n“It might shut him up.”\nHarry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s cage, then\nturned to his trunk. Hedwig’s cage stood next to it, still empty.\n“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at Hedwig’s deserted perch.\n“Ron, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?”\n“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron. “The Ministry\nwould want to show they’d caught someone, wouldn’t they?”\n“Yeah, I suppose. . . .”\n“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she’s got\nsome gold out of your vault for you . . . and she’s washed all your socks.”\nHe heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed and dropped the money\nbag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping.\nApart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had\na handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-\nmaking kit — he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of\nbelladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a\nloud noise of disgust behind him.\n“What is that supposed to be?”\nHe was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon\nvelvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace\ncuffs.\nThere was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an\narmful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.\n“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles. “Now, mind you pack\nthem properly so they don’t crease.”\n“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron, handing it out to\nher.\n“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for you. Dress robes.”\n“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.\n“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your school list that\nyou’re supposed to have dress robes this year . . . robes for formal occasions.”\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m not wearing that, no\nway.”\n“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “They’re all like\nthat! Your father’s got some for smart parties!”\n“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron stubbornly.\n“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to have dress robes,"

I got some for Harry too . . . show him, Harry. . . .”\nIn some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn’t\nas bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn’t have any lace on\nthem at all — in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones,\nexcept that they were bottle green instead of black.\n“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley\nfondly.\n“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at Harry’s robes. “Why\ncouldn’t I have some like that?”\n“Because . . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn’t a lot of\nchoice!” said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\nHarry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his\nGringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.\n“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly. “Never.”\n“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a\npicture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.”\nShe left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny\nspluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge\nOwl Treat.\n“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron furiously, striding across the\nroom to unstick Pigwidgeon’s beak.\n— E L E V E N —\nABOARD THE\nHOGWARTS EXPRESS\nT\nhere was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry\nawoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the\nwindow as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into\ntheir school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their\nway down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs,\nlooking harassed.\n“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent message from the\nMinistry!”\nHarry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past\nwith his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the\nothers entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the\ndrawers — “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending\nover the fire, talking to —\nHarry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they\nwere working properly.\nAmos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large,\nbearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks\nflying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n“. . .

More likely\nthere’s a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in\npotato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-\nEye, he’s had it — think of his record — we’ve got to get him off on a minor\ncharge, something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth?”\n“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow\nfurrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his wand? He didn’t actually attack anyone?”\n“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach\nthrough the window,” said Mr. Diggory, “but they’ll have a job proving it,\nthere aren’t any casualties.”\n“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with\nhis notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.\nMr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\n“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly, “bothering you so early and\neverything . . . but Arthur’s the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-\nEye’s supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last\nnight . . .”\n“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you won’t have a bit of toast\nor anything before you go?”\n“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.\nMrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen\ntable, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory’s mouth.\n“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.\nHarry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie,"

Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes\non the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\n“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Mr. Weasley to\nHarry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing\nto Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King’s\nCross?”\n“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-Eye, we’ll be fine.”\nAs Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.\n“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to now?”\n“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said Mrs.\nWeasley.\n“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his\ntoast. “Isn’t he that nutter —”\n“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs. Weasley\nsternly.\n“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as Mrs.\nWeasley left the room. “Birds of a feather . . .”\n“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.\n“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.\n“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he?” said Fred. “I\nmean, I know he’s a genius and everything . . .”\n“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.\n“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie. “I met him once\nwhen Dad took me in to work with him. He was an Auror — one of the\nbest . . . a Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank look. “Half\nthe cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of\nenemies, though . . . the families of people he caught, mainly . . . and I heard\nhe’s been getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn’t trust anyone anymore.\nSees Dark wizards everywhere.”\nBill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross\nstation, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get\nto work.\n“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the moment,” he told them.\n“Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.”\n“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously. “I reckon he’ll know\nyour name soon.”\nMrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order\nthree ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.\n“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs. Weasley whispered to\nHarry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving\nsix heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. “But there weren’t any to spare. . . .\nOh dear, they don’t look happy, do they?”\nHarry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely"

        "text": "Oh dear, they don’t look happy, do they?”\nHarry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely\ntransported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting\nracket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-\nHeat Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred’s trunk sprang open, causing\nthe driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his\nway up the man’s leg.\nThe journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in\nthe back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to\nrecover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at\nKing’s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and\nthey got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\nHarry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It\nwas a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier\ndividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an\nunobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in\ngroups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they\nwere accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned\ncasually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through\nit . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front\nof them.\nThe Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,\nclouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students\nand parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became\nnoisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their\nluggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back\ndown onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\n“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Charlie, grinning, as\nhe hugged Ginny good-bye.\n“Why?” said Fred keenly.\n“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I mentioned it . . . it’s\n‘classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,’\nafter all.”\n“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,” said Bill, hands in\nhis pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\n“Why?” said George impatiently.\n“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill, his eyes twinkling. “I\nmight even get time off to come and watch a bit of it. . . .”\n“A bit of what?” said Ron.\nBut at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them\ntoward the train doors.\n“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said Hermione as they\nclimbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to\nher.\n“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry."

Now, behave, won’t you?\nWon’t you, Fred? And you, George?”\nThe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.\n“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred bellowed out of the window\nas Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. “What rules are they\nchanging?”\nBut Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the\ncorner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain\nsplattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid\nhis trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over\nPigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his hooting.\n“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he said\ngrumpily, sitting down next to Harry. “At the World Cup, remember? But my\nown mother won’t say. Wonder what —”\n“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and\npointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and\nheard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.\n“. . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than\nHogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his\nopinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a Mudblood-lover — and\nDurmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea\nof me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more\nsensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students\nactually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .”\nHermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut,\nblocking out Malfoy’s voice.\n“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she said\nangrily. “I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up with him.”\n“Durmstrang’s another Wizarding school?” said Harry.\n“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible reputation. According\nto An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the\nDark Arts.”\n“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is it? What country?”\n“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her eyebrows."

What country?”\n“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.\n“Er — why not?” said Harry.\n“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.\nDurmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can\nsteal their secrets,” said Hermione matter-of-factly.\n“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh. “Durmstrang’s got to be about\nthe same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle?”\n“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise. “Everyone knows\nthat . . . well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts: A History, anyway.”\n“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on — how d’you hide a place like\nHogwarts?”\n“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a\nmoldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger, do not\nenter, unsafe.”\n“So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?”\n“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have Muggle-repelling\ncharms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from\nfinding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable —”\n“Come again?”\n“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a map, can’t\nyou?”\n“Er . . . if you say so,” said Harry.\n“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” said\nHermione thoughtfully. “Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes\nas part of their uniforms.”\n“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It would’ve been so easy\nto push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident. . . . Shame his\nmother likes him. . . .”\nThe rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The\nsky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by\nmidday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought\na large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.\nSeveral of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed,\nincluding Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-\nfaced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable\nwitch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of\nits magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking “Troy — Mullet\n— Moran!” but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour\nor so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself\nonce more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a\nSummoning Charm.\nNeville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup\nmatch.\n“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t buy tickets. It\nsounded amazing though.”\n“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. . . .”"

Behind him stood Crabbe and\nGoyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown\nat least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the\nconversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left\najar.\n“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry coolly.\n“Weasley . . . what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s cage. A\nsleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of\nthe train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.\nRon made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him;\nhe seized the sleeve and pulled.\n“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing\nCrabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of wearing these, were you?\nI mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890. . . .”\n“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he\nsnatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive\nlaughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.\n“So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the\nfamily name? There’s money involved as well, you know . . . you’d be able to\nafford some decent robes if you won. . . .”\n“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.\n“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated. “I suppose you will, Potter? You\nnever miss a chance to show off, do you?”\n“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione\ntestily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.\nA gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.\n“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly. “You’ve got a father\nand brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know? My God, my father told\nme about it ages ago . . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father’s\nalways associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s\ntoo junior to know about it, Weasley . . . yes . . . they probably don’t talk\nabout important stuff in front of him. . . .”\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three\nof them disappeared.\nRon got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard\nbehind them that the glass shattered."

He didn’t talk much\nas they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the\nHogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-\ndarkness of Hogsmeade station.\nAs the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead.\nHermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes\nover Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against\nthe downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as\nthough buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their\nheads.\n“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the\nplatform.\n“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at the feast if we\ndon’ drown!”\nFirst years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake\nwith Hagrid.\n“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione\nfervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest\nof the crowd.

I’m soak — ARRGH!”\nA large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto\nRon’s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways\ninto Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped — narrowly missing\nHermione, it burst at Harry’s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his\nsneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing\none another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and\nsaw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a\nbell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with\nconcentration as he took aim again.\n“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”\nProfessor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House,\nhad come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and\ngrabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.\n“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”\n“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.\n“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall, straightening\nher pointed hat and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.\n“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-\nyear girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. “Already wet, aren’t\nthey? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another bomb at a group of\nsecond years who had just arrived.\n“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “I’m warning\nyou, Peeves —”\nPeeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air,\nand zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.\n“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to the\nbedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall, come on!”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and\nthrough the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his\nbreath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.\nThe Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term\nfeast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and\nhundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House\ntables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat\nalong one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and\nthe Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of"

Pearly white and\nsemitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a\nparticularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive,\nand insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed\nneck.\n“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.\n“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.\n“Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.”\nThe Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every\nschool year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t\nbeen present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just\nthen, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.\n“Hiya, Harry!”\nIt was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.\n“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.\n“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother\nDennis!”\n“Er — good,” said Harry.\n“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his\nseat. “I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?”\n“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and\nNearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,\ndon’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had\nbeen put into Gryffindor.\n“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in\nRavenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t\nyou?”\nHarry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty\nseats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the\nlake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the\ndrying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and\nHarry couldn’t think who else was missing.\n“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,\nwho was also looking up at the teachers.\nThey had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had\nlasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin,\nwho had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was\ndefinitely no new face there.\n“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.\nHarry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the\nCharms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout,\nthe Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She\nwas talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor\nSinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions\nmaster, Snape — Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s loathing of"

        "text": "Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions\nmaster, Snape — Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s loathing of\nSnape was matched only by Snape’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if\npossible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under\nSnape’s overlarge nose — Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own\nschool days.\nOn Snape’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was\nProfessor McGonagall’s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat\nProfessor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard\nshining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with\nmany stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore’s long, thin fingers were\ntogether and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling\nthrough his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up\nat the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had\nnever seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across it,\nand as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across\nit.\n“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a hippogriff.”\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great\nHall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of\nfirst years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it\nwas nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum\nacross the lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a\ncombination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a\nhalt in a line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest of\nthe lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as\nHagrid’s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as\nthough he were draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded\nfrom over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up\nwith his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double\nthumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively delighted\nabout it.\nProfessor McGonagall now placed a four-legged stool on the ground before\nthe first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat.\nThe first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was\nsilence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat\nbroke into song:\nA thousand years or more ago,\nWhen I was newly sewn,\nThere lived four wizards of renown,\nWhose names are still well known:\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor,\nFair Ravenclaw, from glen,\nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,\nShrewd Slytherin, from fen.\nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream,\nThey hatched a daring plan\nTo educate young sorcerers\nThus Hogwarts School began.\nNow each of these four founders\nFormed their own House, for each\nDid value different virtues\nIn the ones they had to teach."

I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.”\nProfessor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.\n“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,”\nshe told the first years. “When the hat announces your House, you will go and\nsit at the appropriate table.\n“Ackerley, Stewart!”\nA boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the\nSorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.\n“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.\nStewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw\ntable, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the\nRavenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting\nsecond, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.\n“Baddock, Malcolm!”\n“SLYTHERIN!”\nThe table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see\nMalfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether\nBaddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and\nwizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat\ndown.\n“Branstone, Eleanor!”\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\n“Cauldwell, Owen!”\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\n“Creevey, Dennis!”\nTiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s moleskin,\njust as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’\ntable. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad,\nHagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly\nalarming — a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew\nHagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the\nend of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat."

He winked at them as he sat down at the\nend of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat.\nThe rip at the brim opened wide —\n“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.\nHagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming\nwidely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join\nhis brother.\n“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. “It\nwas brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in\nthe boat!”\n“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably the giant squid,\nDennis!”\n“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope\nfor more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and\npushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.\n“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and\nglasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?”\nHarry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting\nEmma Dobbs.\nThe Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their\nfaces moving one by one to the four-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as\nProfessor McGonagall passed the L’s.\n“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.\n“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly\nHeadless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.\n“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.\n“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly\nHeadless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor\ntable. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”\nGryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years\nin a row.\n“Pritchard, Graham!”\n“SLYTHERIN!”\n“Quirke, Orla!”\n“RAVENCLAW!”\nAnd finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.\nProfessor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.\n“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly\nat his golden plate.\nProfessor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the\nstudents, his arms opened wide in welcome.\n“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing\naround the Hall. “Tuck in.”\n“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically\nbefore their eyes.\nNearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nloaded their own plates.\n“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato.\n“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,” said Nearly Headless\nNick. “There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.”\n“Why?

He wanted to attend the feast — well, it’s quite\nout of the question, you know what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a\nplate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost’s council — the Fat Friar\nwas all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the\nBloody Baron put his foot down.”\nThe Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter\ncovered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could\nreally control Peeves.\n“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,” said Ron\ndarkly. “So what did he do in the kitchens?”\n“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. “Wreaked havoc and\nmayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the\nhouse-elves out of their wits —”\nClang.\nHermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread\nsteadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but\nHermione paid no attention.\n“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly\nHeadless Nick. “Here at Hogwarts?”\n“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction.\n“The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.”\n“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.\n“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said Nearly\nHeadless Nick. “They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the\nfires and so on. . . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s\nthe mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there?”\nHermione stared at him.\n“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays, don’t they? And — and\nsick leave, and pensions, and everything?”\nNearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head\nflopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still\nattached it to his neck.\n“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders\nand securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves don’t want sick leave and\npensions!”\nHermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her\nknife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.\n“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits\nof Yorkshire pudding. “Oops — sorry, ’Arry —” He swallowed. “You won’t\nget them sick leave by starving yourself!”\n“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. “That’s\nwhat made this dinner.

Another\nclap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed,\nilluminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and\nwere replaced, instantly, with puddings.\n“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward\nher. “Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!”\nBut Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that\nhe gave up.\nWhen the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had\nfaded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to\nhis feet again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so\nthat only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.\n“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. “Now that we are all\nfed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said Hermione) “I must once more ask for your\nattention, while I give out a few notices.\n“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects\nforbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming\nYo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list\ncomprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be\nviewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”\nThe corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I\nwould like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to\nstudents, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.\n“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch\nCup will not take place this year.”\n“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow\nmembers of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at\nDumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, “This is\ndue to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout\nthe school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy — but I am\nsure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that\nthis year at Hogwarts —”\nBut at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors\nof the Great Hall banged open.\nA man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black\ntraveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger,\nsuddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the\nceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray\nhair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.\nA dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached\nthe end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore.\nAnother flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.\nThe lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp relief, and it was a face\nunlike any Harry had ever seen.

It looked as though it had been carved out of\nweathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human\nfaces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every\ninch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and\na large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that made\nhim frightening.\nOne of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a\ncoin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without\nblinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently\nof the normal eye — and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of\nthe man’s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.\nThe stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as\nbadly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry\ncouldn’t hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who\nshook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded\nand gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.\nThe stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face,\npulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and\nsniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on\nthe end of it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages,\nbut the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the\nHall and the students.\n“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said\nDumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor Moody.”\nIt was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of\nthe staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put\ntheir hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the\nsilence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by\nMoody’s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.\n“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad\nwent to help this morning?”\n“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.\n“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What happened to his\nface?”\n“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.\nMoody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring\nthe jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling\ncloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his\narm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry\nsaw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed\nfoot.\nDumbledore cleared his throat.\n“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of\nwhom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are to have the\nhonor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that\nhas not been held for over a century.

It is my very great pleasure to inform you\nthat the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”\n“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.\nThe tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival suddenly\nbroke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\n“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it,\nI did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a\nleprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”\nProfessor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\n“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where\nwas I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know\nwhat this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me\nfor giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.\n“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years\nago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of\nwizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected\nto represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical\ntasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five\nyears, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties\nbetween young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is,\nthe death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”\n“Death toll?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not\nseem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were\nwhispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested\nin hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had\nhappened hundreds of years ago.\n“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the\ntournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very\nsuccessful. However, our own Departments of International Magical\nCooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for\nanother attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this\ntime, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.\n“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their\nshortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions\nwill take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are\nmost worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and\na thousand Galleons personal prize money.”\n“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with\nenthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only\nperson who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At\nevery House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore,\nor else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke\nagain, and the Hall quieted once more.\n“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to\nHogwarts,” he said, “the Heads of the participating schools, along with the\nMinistry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this"

Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or older\n— will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” —\nDumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of\noutrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious\n— “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still\nbe difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly\nunlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with\nthem. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our\nimpartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes\ntwinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I\ntherefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under\nseventeen.\n“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in\nOctober and remaining with us for the greater part of this year.

And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all\nto be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime!\nChop chop!”\nDumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There\nwas a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and\nswarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.\n“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd\nmoving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore.\n“We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?”\n“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at\nthe top table. “The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you’d never be\nallowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!”\n“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a thousand\nGalleons . . .”\n“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t\nmove.”\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred\nand George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who\nwere under seventeen from entering the tournament.\n“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions are?”\nsaid Harry.\n“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of\ndrops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”\n“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.\n“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said\nFred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter,\nhe’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are.\nDumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.”\n“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they"

Anyway, where’s\nthe fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round\nDumbledore? Fancy entering?”\n“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But\nI s’pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we’ve learned\nenough. . . .”\n“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and\nGeorge.\n“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going on about\nhow I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have to — oops. . . .”\nNeville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There\nwere many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of\nthe older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was\nnotoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him\nout, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing\nwheezily.\n“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.\nThey made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was\nconcealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.\n“Password?” she said as they approached.\n“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told me.”\nThe portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they\nall climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was\nfull of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames\na dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter “Slave labor,” before\nbidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’\ndormitory.\nHarry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they\nreached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five\nfour-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with\nits owner’s trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed;\nSeamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked\nup a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West\nHam football team was pinned right next to it.\n“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer\nplayers.\nHarry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone — a\nhouse-elf, no doubt — had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was\nextremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging\noutside.\n“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if\nFred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do\nyou?”\n“S’pose not. . . .”"

He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was\nseventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the\ngrounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom\nwere applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard\nTournament. . . .

A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were\ndiscussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the\nTriwizard Tournament.\n“Today’s not bad . . . outside all morning,” said Ron, who was running his\nfinger down his schedule. “Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of\nMagical Creatures . . . damn it, we’re still with the Slytherins. . . .”\n“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned, looking down.\nDivination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. Professor\nTrelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.\n“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?” said Hermione\nbriskly, buttering herself some toast. “Then you’d be doing something sensible\nlike Arithmancy.”\n“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal\namounts of jam to her toast too.\n“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,” said\nHermione haughtily.\n“Yeah . . . and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning.\nThere was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came\nsoaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively,\nHarry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and\ngray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters\nand packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville\nLongbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap — Neville almost always\nforgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy’s eagle\nowl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of\nsweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of\ndisappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge.

Indeed, they\nlooked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out\nof the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny\nswellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.\n“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly. “They need squeezing.\nYou will collect the pus —”\n“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.\n“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely valuable, so\ndon’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your\ndragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted,\nbubotuber pus.”\nSqueezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each\nswelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst\nforth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as\nProfessor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected\nseveral pints.\n“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout, stoppering the\nlast bottle with a cork. “An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of\nacne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to\nrid themselves of pimples.”\n“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed\nvoice. “She tried to curse hers off.”\n“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. “But Madam Pomfrey\nfixed her nose back on in the end.”\nA booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the\nend of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone\nsteps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction,\ndown the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which stood on\nthe edge of the Forbidden Forest.\nHagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his\nenormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on\nthe ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar,\napparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer,\nan odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like\nminor explosions.\n“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Be’er wait\nfer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this — Blast-Ended Skrewts!”\n“Come again?” said Ron.\nHagrid pointed down into the crates.\n“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward.\n“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry’s opinion.\nThey looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking,\nwith legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads.

There were\nabout a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling\nover one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were\ngiving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks\nwould fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be\npropelled forward several inches.\n“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be able ter raise ’em\nyerselves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!”\n“And why would we want to raise them?” said a cold voice.\nThe Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and\nGoyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.\nHagrid looked stumped at the question.\n“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy. “What is the point of them?”\nHagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few\nseconds’ pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’\nfeedin’ ’em today. Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I’ve\nnever had ’em before, not sure what they’ll go fer — I got ant eggs an’ frog\nlivers an’ a bit o’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each.”\n“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.\nNothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and\nHermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the\ncrates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion\nthat the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to\nhave mouths.\n“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. “It got me!”\nHagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.\n“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.\n“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid, nodding.\n“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again. “Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s that pointy\nthing on it?”\n“Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender\nquickly withdrew her hand from the box). “I reckon they’re the males. . . . The\nfemales’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter\nsuck blood.”\n“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,” said Malfoy\nsarcastically. “Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at\nonce?”\n“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not useful,”\nHermione snapped. “Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t\nwant a dragon for a pet, would you?”\nHarry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from\nbehind his bushy beard.

Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more\nlethal, the better.\n“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their way back\nup to the castle for lunch an hour later.\n“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated voice, “but once Hagrid’s\nfound out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.”\n“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something,\nwill it?” said Ron, grinning slyly at her.\n“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,” said\nHermione. “As a matter of fact I think he’s right. The best thing to do would\nbe to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.”\nThey sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops\nand potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.\n“Er — is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron. “You’re going to make\nyourself puke instead?”\n“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her\nmouth bulging with sprouts. “I just want to get to the library.”\n“What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione — it’s the first day back! We\nhaven’t even got homework yet!”\nHermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she\nhad not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!”\nand departed at high speed.\nWhen the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron\nset off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver\nstepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where\nProfessor Trelawney lived.\nThe familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they\nemerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the\ncircular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which\nwere all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the\nmass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat\ndown at the same small circular table.\n“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind\nHarry, making him jump.\nA very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too\nlarge for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the\ntragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large\namount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.\n“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry. “My inner\neye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say\nthat your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas . . .\nmost difficult . . . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . and\nperhaps sooner than you think. . . .”"

Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who\nlooked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in\na large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and\nParvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs\nvery close to her.\n“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she said. “The movements\nof the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who\nunderstand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered\nby the planetary rays, which intermingle . . .”\nBut Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel\nsleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune-\ntelling never held him exactly spellbound — though he couldn’t help thinking\nabout what she had just said to him. “‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed\ncome to pass . . .’”\nBut Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really\nwas an old fraud. He wasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all . . . well,\nunless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught . . . but what did\nProfessor Trelawney know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her\nbrand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky\nmanner.\nExcept, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made\nthe prediction about Voldemort rising again . . . and Dumbledore himself had\nsaid that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described\nit to him. . . .\n“Harry!” Ron muttered.\n“What?”\nHarry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight;\nhe had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.\n“I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful\ninfluence of Saturn,” said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in\nher voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.\n“Born under — what, sorry?” said Harry.\n“Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!” said Professor Trelawney, sounding\ndefinitely irritated that he wasn’t riveted by this news. “I was saying that\nSaturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your\nbirth. . . . Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in\nlife . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in\nmidwinter?”\n“No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.”\nRon hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.\nHalf an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular\nchart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment\nof birth. It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and\ncalculation of angles.\n“I’ve got two Neptunes here,” said Harry after a while, frowning down at\nhis piece of parchment, “that can’t be right, can it?”"

I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one’s that,\nProfessor?”\n“It is Uranus, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the\nchart.\n“Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?” said Ron.\nMost unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this,\nperhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.\n“A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming\nmonth will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,” she snapped,\nsounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self.\n“I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!”\n“Miserable old bat,” said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending\nthe staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. “That’ll take all weekend, that\nwill. . . .”\n“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching up with them.\n“Professor Vector didn’t give us any at all!”\n“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.\nThey reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for\ndinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out\nbehind them.\n“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were\nstanding there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.\n“What?” said Ron shortly.\n“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the\nDaily Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed\nentrance hall could hear. “Listen to this!\nFURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\nIt seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are not yet\nat an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent.

It’s almost as\nthough he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.\nEveryone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the\npaper with a flourish and read on:\nArnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying\ncar two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with\nseveral Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”) over a number of\nhighly aggressive dustbins.

Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed\nto the aid of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired\nfrom the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference\nbetween a handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly,\nMr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody’s heavily\nguarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false\nalarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories\nbefore he could escape from the policemen, but refused to\nanswer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the\nMinistry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing\nscene.\n“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and\nholding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call\nit a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?”\nRon was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.\n“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. . . .”\n“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?”\nsneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the\npicture?”\n“You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both he and Hermione\nhad grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at\nMalfoy — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose? Has\nshe always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?”\nMalfoy’s pale face went slightly pink.\n“Don’t you dare insult my mother, Potter.”\n“Keep your fat mouth shut, then,” said Harry, turning away.\nBANG!\nSeveral people screamed — Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of\nhis face — he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he’d\neven touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed\nthrough the entrance hall.\n“OH NO YOU DON’T, LADDIE!”\nHarry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble\nstaircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret,\nwhich was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been\nstanding.\nThere was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was\nmoving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry — at least, his normal eye\nwas looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.\n“Did he get you?” Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.\n“No,” said Harry, “missed.”\n“LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted.\n“Leave — what?” Harry said, bewildered.\n“Not you — him!” Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at\nCrabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that\nMoody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.\nMoody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a\nterrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons."

He got to his feet, wincing.\n“Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!” said Professor\nMcGonagall weakly. “Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?”\n“He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,” said Moody, scratching his chin\nunconcernedly, “but I thought a good sharp shock —”\n“We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender’s Head of House!”\n“I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.\nMalfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation,\nlooked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words\n“my father” were distinguishable.\n“Oh yeah?” said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk\nof his wooden leg echoing around the hall. “Well, I know your father of old,\nboy. . . .

Within five minutes, she had cleared her\nplate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred\nWeasley.\n“Moody!” he said. “How cool is he?”\n“Beyond cool,” said George, sitting down opposite Fred.\n“Supercool,” said the twins’ best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat\nbeside George. “We had him this afternoon,” he told Harry and Ron.\n“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.\nFred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.\n“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred.\n“He knows, man,” said Lee.\n“Knows what?” said Ron, leaning forward.\n“Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it,” said George impressively.\n“Doing what?” said Harry.\n“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred.\n“He’s seen it all,” said George.\n“’Mazing,” said Lee.\nRon dived into his bag for his schedule.\n“We haven’t got him till Thursday!” he said in a disappointed voice.\n— F O U R T E E N —\nTHE UNFORGIVABLE\nCURSES\nT\nhe next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted\nNeville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions.

        "text": "wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever\nHarry saw the two of them together — at mealtimes, or when they passed in\nthe corridors — he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding\nMoody’s eye, whether magical or normal.\n“I reckon Snape’s a bit scared of him, you know,” Harry said thoughtfully.\n“Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,” said Ron, his eyes\nmisting over, “and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . .”\nThe Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody’s first lesson so\nmuch that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside\nhis classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was\nHermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.\n“Been in the —”\n“Library.” Harry finished her sentence for her. “C’mon, quick, or we won’t\nget decent seats.”\nThey hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher’s desk, took out\ntheir copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited,\nunusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody’s distinctive clunking footsteps\ncoming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and\nfrightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding\nfrom underneath his robes.\n“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting\ndown, “those books. You won’t need them.”\nThey returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.\nMoody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of\nhis twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye\nmoving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing\nupon each student as he or she answered.\n“Right then,” he said, when the last person had declared themselves present,\n“I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a\npretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you’ve covered\nboggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that\nright?”\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\n“But you’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses,” said Moody.\n“So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other.\nI’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark —”\n“What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.\nMoody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely\napprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had\nseen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more\ntwisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he\never did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.\n“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said. “Your father got me out\nof a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.\nSpecial favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet\nretirement.”\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together."

        "text": "Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet\nretirement.”\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.\n“So — straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms.\nNow, according to the Ministry of Magic, I’m supposed to teach you\ncountercurses and leave it at that. I’m not supposed to show you what illegal\nDark curses look like until you’re in the sixth year. You’re not supposed to be\nold enough to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore’s got a higher\nopinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you\nknow what you’re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend\nyourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an\nillegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not\ngoing to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need\nto be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m\ntalking.”\nLavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed\nhoroscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could see through\nsolid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.\n“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by\nWizarding law?”\nSeveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.\nMoody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.\n“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called the\nImperius Curse, or something?”\n“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father would know that one.\nGave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”\nMoody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and\ntook out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it.\nHarry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated spiders.\nMoody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the\npalm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it\nand muttered, “Imperio!”\nThe spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to\nswing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs\nrigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk,\nwhere it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider\nrose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap\ndance.\nEveryone was laughing — everyone except Moody.\n“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did it\nto you?”\nThe laughter died away almost instantly.\n“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began\nto roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,\nthrow itself down one of your throats . . .”\nRon gave an involuntary shudder.\n“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the"

Better avoid being\nhit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone\njumped.\nMoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.\n“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”\nHermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,\ndid Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information\nwas Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at\nhis own daring.\n“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.\n“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct\nvoice.\nMoody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.\n“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to\ncheck the register again.\nNeville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning\nback to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed\nit upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to\nmove.\n“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you to\nget the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider. “Engorgio!”\nThe spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all\npretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as\npossible.\nMoody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered,\n“Crucio!”\nAt once, the spider’s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to\ntwitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry\nwas sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming.\nMoody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk\nmore violently —\n“Stop it!” Hermione said shrilly.\nHarry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at\nNeville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville’s hands were clenched\nupon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.\nMoody raised his wand. The spider’s legs relaxed, but it continued to\ntwitch.\n“Reducio,” Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size.\nHe put it back into the jar.\n“Pain,” said Moody softly. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to\ntorture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was\nvery popular once too.\n“Right . . . anyone know any others?”\nHarry looked around. From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they"

From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they\nwere all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione’s\nhand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.\n“Yes?” said Moody, looking at her.\n“Avada Kedavra,” Hermione whispered.\nSeveral people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.\n“Ah,” said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. “Yes,\nthe last and worst. Avada Kedavra . . . the Killing Curse.”\nHe put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was\ncoming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar,\ntrying to evade Moody’s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the\ndesktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.\nMoody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.\n“Avada Kedavra!” Moody roared.\nThere was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a\nvast, invisible something was soaring through the air — instantaneously the\nspider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of\nthe students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost\ntoppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\nMoody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.\n“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.\nThere’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s\nsitting right in front of me.”\nHarry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his\nown. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at\nthe blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at\nall. . . .\nSo that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they\nbeen unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green\nlight and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their\nbodies?\nHarry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three\nyears now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d\nfound out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’\nwhereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How\nVoldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold\nhim off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . Voldemort had\nadvanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry . . .\nhow she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her\nson . . . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on\nHarry. . . .\nHarry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices when he\nhad fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible power of the\ndementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives,\nand drown, powerless, in their own despair. . . .\nMoody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry.

With\na massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what\nMoody was saying.\n“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it —\nyou could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the\nwords, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter.\nI’m not here to teach you how to do it.\n“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you’ve got\nto know. You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find\nyourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he\nroared, and the whole class jumped again.\n“Now . . . those three curses — Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus —\nare known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow\nhuman being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what you’re\nup against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You\nneed arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing\nvigilance. Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . .”\nThey spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable\nCurses. No one spoke until the bell rang — but when Moody had dismissed\nthem and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most\npeople were discussing the curses in awed voices — “Did you see it twitch?”\n“— and when he killed it — just like that!”\nThey were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been\nsome sort of spectacular show, but he hadn’t found it very entertaining — and\nnor, it seemed, had Hermione.\n“Hurry up,” she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\n“Not the ruddy library again?” said Ron.\n“No,” said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. “Neville.”\nNeville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall\nopposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when\nMoody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\n“Neville?” Hermione said gently.\nNeville looked around.\n“Oh hello,” he said, his voice much higher than usual. “Interesting lesson,\nwasn’t it? I wonder what’s for dinner, I’m — I’m starving, aren’t you?”\n“Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.\n“Oh yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice.\n“Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what’s for eating?”\nRon gave Harry a startled look.\n“Neville, what — ?”\nBut an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see\nProfessor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching\nhim apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler\ngrowl than they had yet heard."

Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .”\nNeville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He\nneither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.\n“You all right, are you, Potter?”\n“Yes,” said Harry, almost defiantly.\nMoody’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then\nhe said, “You’ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know.\nNo point pretending . . . well . . . come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books\nthat might interest you.”\nNeville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say\nanything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one\nof Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.\n“What was that about?” said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the\ncorner.\n“I don’t know,” said Hermione, looking pensive.\n“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great\nHall. “Fred and George were right, weren’t they? He really knows his stuff,\nMoody, doesn’t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died,\njust snuffed it right —”\nBut Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and didn’t speak\nagain until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had\nbetter make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions tonight, since they\nwould take hours.\nHermione did not join in with Harry and Ron’s conversation during\ndinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and\nRon walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of\nnothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable\nCurses himself.\n“Wouldn’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they\nknew we’d seen the curses?” Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.\n“Yeah, probably,” said Ron. “But Dumbledore’s always done things his way,\nhasn’t he, and Moody’s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first\nand asks questions later — look at his dustbins. Balderdash.”\nThe Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed\ninto the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.\n“Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?” said Harry.\n“I s’pose,” Ron groaned.\nThey went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find\nNeville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer\nthan at the end of Moody’s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes\nwere rather red.\n“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.\n“Oh yes,” said Neville, “I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor\nMoody lent me. . . .”"

Just reading this book Professor\nMoody lent me. . . .”\nHe held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.\n“Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at\nHerbology,” Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that\nHarry had rarely heard there before. “He thought I’d like this.”\nTelling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a\nvery tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he\nwas good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have\ndone.\nHarry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the\ncommon room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the\ncoming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their\ntable was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and\nHarry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from\nProfessor Trelawney’s fire.\n“I haven’t got a clue what this lot’s supposed to mean,” he said, staring\ndown at a long list of calculations.\n“You know,” said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he\nhad run his fingers through it in frustration, “I think it’s back to the old\nDivination standby.”\n“What — make it up?”\n“Yeah,” said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table,\ndipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.\n“Next Monday,” he said as he scribbled, “I am likely to develop a cough,\nowing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.” He looked up at\nHarry. “You know her — just put in loads of misery, she’ll lap it up.”\n“Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the\nheads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. “Okay . . . on Monday, I\nwill be in danger of — er — burns.”\n“Yeah, you will be,” said Ron darkly, “we’re seeing the skrewts again on\nMonday. Okay, Tuesday, I’ll . . . erm . . .”\n“Lose a treasured possession,” said Harry, who was flicking through\nUnfogging the Future for ideas.\n“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down. “Because of . . . erm . . .

Okay, I’ll lose a bet.”\n“Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight. . . .”\nThey continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic)\nfor another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as\npeople went up to bed.

Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into\nan empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might\nlook if she knew they weren’t doing their homework properly.\nStaring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn’t\nyet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall,\nheads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most\nunusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently;\nthey usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention.\nThere was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece\nof parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing\nsomething back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order\nform for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it\nhad been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered\nwhether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.\nAs Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something\nwith his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the\nalmost deserted room, “No — that sounds like we’re accusing him. Got to be\ncareful . . .”\nThen George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and\nquickly returned to his predictions — he didn’t want George to think he was\neavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said\ngood night, and went off to bed.\nFred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole\nopened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of\nparchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the\nother. Crookshanks arched his back, purring.\n“Hello,” she said, “I’ve just finished!”\n“So have I!” said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.\nHermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair,\nand pulled Ron’s predictions toward her.\n“Not going to have a very good month, are you?” she said sardonically as\nCrookshanks curled up in her lap.\n“Ah well, at least I’m forewarned,” Ron yawned.\n“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.\n“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions. “I’d better change\none of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.”\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said Hermione.\n“How dare you!” said Ron, in mock outrage. “We’ve been working like\nhouse-elves here!”\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\n“It’s just an expression,” said Ron hastily.\nHarry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death\nby decapitation.\n“What’s in the box?” he asked, pointing at it.\n“Funny you should ask,” said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took\noff the lid and showed them the contents.\nInside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the\nsame letters: S.P.E.W."

Our long-term aims include changing the\nlaw about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the\nRegulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly\nunderrepresented.”\n“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.\n“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I thought two\nSickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet\ncampaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs —\nand Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I’m\nsaying now, as a record of our first meeting.”\nThere was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and\nHarry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look\non Ron’s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as\nthough he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window.\nHarry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by\nthe moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.\n“Hedwig!” he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across\nthe room to pull open the window.\nHedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top\nof Harry’s predictions.\n“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.\n“She’s got an answer!” said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of\nparchment tied to Hedwig’s leg.\nHarry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered\nonto his knee, hooting softly.\n“What does it say?” Hermione asked breathlessly.\nThe letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a"

Harry read it aloud:\nHarry —\nI’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a\nseries of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go\nstraight to Dumbledore — they’re saying he’s got Mad-Eye out of retirement,\nwhich means he’s reading the signs, even if no one else is.\nI’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open,\nHarry.\nHarry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.\n“He’s flying north?” Hermione whispered. “He’s coming back?”\n“Dumbledore’s reading what signs?” said Ron, looking perplexed. “Harry —\nwhat’s up?”\nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig\nout of his lap.\n“I shouldn’t’ve told him!” Harry said furiously.\n“What are you on about?” said Ron in surprise.\n“It’s made him think he’s got to come back!” said Harry, now slamming his\nfist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron’s chair, hooting\nindignantly. “Coming back, because he thinks I’m in trouble! And there’s\nnothing wrong with me! And I haven’t got anything for you,” Harry snapped\nat Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, “you’ll have to go up to the\nOwlery if you want food.”\nHedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open\nwindow, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.\n“Harry,” Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.\n“I’m going to bed,” said Harry shortly. “See you in the morning.”\nUpstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-\nposter, but he didn’t feel remotely tired.\nIf Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry’s, fault. Why\nhadn’t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab. . . .\nIf he’d just had the sense to keep it to himself. . . .\nHe heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not\nspeak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his\nbed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied,\nHarry would have realized that the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that\nhe was not the only one lying awake.\n— F I F T E E N —\nBEAUXBATONS AND\nDURMSTRANG\nE\narly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as\nthough his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up,\ndressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and\nwent back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of\nparchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and\nwrote the following letter:\nDear Sirius,\nI reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to"

There’s no point coming back, everything’s fine here. Don’t\nworry about me, my head feels completely normal.\nHe then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held\nup only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway\nalong the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was\nsituated at the top of West Tower.\nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none\nof the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl\ndroppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon\nhundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that\nrose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here\nand there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled\nbetween a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the\ndropping-strewn floor.\nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as\nshe kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was\nevidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end,\nit was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask\nRon to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to\ntie the letter to it.\n“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on\nhis arm to one of the holes in the wall. “Before the dementors do.”\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have\ndone, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she\nspread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of\nsight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so\nsure that Sirius’s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.\n“That was a lie, Harry,” said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told\nher and Ron what he had done. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting and you\nknow it.”\n“So what?” said Harry. “He’s not going back to Azkaban because of me.”\n“Drop it,” said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue\nsome more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.\nHarry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks.\nTrue, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning\nwhen the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent\nhimself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down\nsome dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his\ngodfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked\nso well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other\nhand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever\nbefore, particularly Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts."

On the other\nhand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever\nbefore, particularly Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts.\nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be\nputting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power\nand to see whether they could resist its effects.\n“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as\nMoody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear\nspace in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it against another human\nwas —”\n“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical\neye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. “If\nyou’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s putting it on you so they\ncan control you completely — fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink\nand muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry\nand Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat\nbubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.\nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius\nCurse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most\nextraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times\naround the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a\nsquirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would\ncertainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them\nseemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when\nMoody had removed it.\n“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.”\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that\nMoody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and\nsaid, “Imperio!”\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every\nthought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a\nvague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only\ndimly aware of everyone watching him.\nAnd then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant\nchamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk . . . jump onto the desk. . . .\nHarry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\nJump onto the desk. . . .\nWhy, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.\nStupid thing to do, really, said the voice.\nJump onto the desk. . . .\nNo, I don’t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly . . .\nno, I don’t really want to. . . .\nJump! NOW!\nThe next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and\ntried to prevent himself from jumping — the result was that he’d smashed\nheadlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs,\nfractured both his kneecaps.\n“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt\nthe empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear.

He remembered exactly what\nwas happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.\n“Look at that, you lot . . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near\nbeat it! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch\nhis eyes, that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll\nhave trouble controlling you!”\n“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against\nthe Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry\nthrough his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse\nentirely), “you’d think we were all going to be attacked any second.”\n“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had\nhad much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured\nhim the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about paranoid . . .” Ron\nglanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of\nearshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the\nMinistry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who\nshouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are we supposed to\nread up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we’ve got to do?”\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work\nthey were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,\nwhen the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration\nhomework she had assigned.\n“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”\nshe told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.\n“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”\n“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly.\n“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can\nget! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to\nturn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your\npincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a\npin!”\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to\nlook too pleased with herself.\nHarry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them\nthat they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination\nclass. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for\ntheir unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them — but they were\nless amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after\nnext; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.\nMeanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had\nthem writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.\nProfessor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes.

They took this one\nseriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before\nChristmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to\nread three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.\nEven Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were\ngrowing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they\nate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their “project,” suggested that they\ncome down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make\nnotes on their extraordinary behavior.\n“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with\nthe air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. “I see\nenough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.”\nHagrid’s smile faded off his face.\n“Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told,” he growled, “or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor\nMoody’s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”\nThe Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but\napparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still sufficiently painful to\nstop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at\nthe end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was\nparticularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get\nHagrid sacked the previous year.\nWhen they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to\nproceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling\naround a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase.\nRon, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of\nthem and read the sign aloud to the other two:\nTRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\nThe delegations from Beauxbatons and\nDurmstrang will be arriving at 6 o’clock on Friday\nthe 30th of October. Lessons will end half an\nhour early —\n“Brilliant!” said Harry. “It’s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won’t have\ntime to poison us all!”\nStudents will return their bags and books to their\ndormitories and assemble in front of the castle to\ngreet our guests before the Welcoming Feast.\n“Only a week away!” said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from\nthe crowd, his eyes gleaming. “I wonder if Cedric knows? Think I’ll go and tell\nhim. . . .”\n“Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.\n“Diggory,” said Harry. “He must be entering the tournament.”\n“That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed their way\nthrough the chattering crowd toward the staircase.\n“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at\nQuidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really good student — and he’s\na prefect.”\nShe spoke as though this settled the matter.\n“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron scathingly.\n“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said\nHermione indignantly."

During the following week, there seemed to be\nonly one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard\nTournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly\ncontagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the\ntournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and\nDurmstrang differed from themselves.\nHarry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-\nthorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the\ndispleasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly\nand wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly\ngleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was\nbehaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he\nterrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.\nOther members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.\n“Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can’t even perform a simple\nSwitching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!” Professor McGonagall\nbarked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had\naccidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.\nWhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of\nOctober, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight.\nEnormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a\nHogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle\nfor Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a\nsilver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers’ table, the largest banner of all\nbore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a\nlarge letter H.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the\nGryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from\neveryone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.\n“It’s a bummer, all right,” George was saying gloomily to Fred. “But if he\nwon’t talk to us in person, we’ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we’ll\nstuff it into his hand. He can’t avoid us forever.”\n“Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them.\n“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.\n“What’s a bummer?” Ron asked George.\n“Having a nosy git like you for a brother,” said George.\n“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked.\n“Thought any more about trying to enter?”\n“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn’t telling,”\nsaid George bitterly. “She just told me to shut up and get on with\nTransfiguring my raccoon.”"

We’ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .”\n“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred. “McGonagall\nsays the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done the\ntasks.”\n“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.\n“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said\nHermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all\nthree of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice\nthe champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.”\nShe noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of\nimpatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, “It’s all in\nHogwarts: A History. Though, of course, that book’s not entirely reliable. A\nRevised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased\nand Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the\nSchool.”\n“What are you on about?” said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what\nwas coming.\n“House-elves!” said Hermione, her eyes flashing. “Not once, in over a\nthousand pages, does Hogwarts: A History mention that we are all colluding in\nthe oppression of a hundred slaves!”\nHarry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and\nRon’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione’s\ndetermination to pursue justice for house-elves. True, both of them had paid\ntwo Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet.\nTheir Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have\nmade Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever\nsince, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she\nhad also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening,\ncornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.\n“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms\ncleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid\nand enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.\nSome people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from\nglowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but\nwere reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the\nwhole thing as a joke.\nRon now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in\nautumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both\ntwins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in\ntoward Hermione.\n“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?”\n“No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly think students are\nsupposed to —”\n“Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food."

They think they’ve got the best job in\nthe world —”\n“That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!” Hermione began\nhotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing\nnoise from overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry\nlooked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped\ntalking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered\ndown onto Harry’s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.\nHarry pulled off Sirius’s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which\nshe ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed\nin further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out\nSirius’s letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.\nNice try, Harry.\nI’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on\neverything that’s going on at Hogwarts. Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing\nowls, and don’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself. Don’t forget\nwhat I said about your scar.\n“Why d’you have to keep changing owls?” Ron asked in a low voice.\n“Hedwig’ll attract too much attention,” said Hermione at once. “She stands\nout. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding . . . I mean,\nthey’re not native birds, are they?”\nHarry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether\nhe felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to\nget back without being caught was something. He couldn’t deny either that\nthe idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn’t have\nto wait so long for a response every time he wrote.\n“Thanks, Hedwig,” he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her\nbeak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly\ndesperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.\nThere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was\nvery attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that\nevening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was\nmore bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang\nearly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited\ntheir bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and\nrushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.\nThe Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.\n“Weasley, straighten your hat,” Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron.\n“Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.”\nParvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of\nher plait.\n“Follow me, please,” said Professor McGonagall. “First years in front . . . no\npushing. . . .”\nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle.

It was a cold,\nclear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was\nalready shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and\nHermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively\nshivering with anticipation among the other first years.\n“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive\nthat led to the front gates. “How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?”\n“I doubt it,” said Hermione.\n“How, then? Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.\n“I don’t think so . . . not from that far away. . . .”\n“A Portkey?” Ron suggested. “Or they could Apparate — maybe you’re\nallowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?”\n“You can’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to\ntell you?” said Hermione impatiently.\nThey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving;\neverything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold.\nHe wished they’d hurry up. . . . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a\ndramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the\ncampsite before the Quidditch World Cup: “always the same — we can’t resist\nshowing off when we get together. . . .”\nAnd then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with\nthe other teachers —\n“Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons\napproaches!”\n“Where?” said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.\n“There!” yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.\nSomething large, much larger than a broomstick — or, indeed, a hundred\nbroomsticks — was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle,\ngrowing larger all the time.\n“It’s a dragon!” shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.\n“Don’t be stupid . . . it’s a flying house!” said Dennis Creevey.\nDennis’s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the\ntreetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle\nwindows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size\nof a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen\nwinged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.\nThe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever\nlower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed — then, with an almighty\ncrash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year’s foot, the\nhorses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the\ncarriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses\ntossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.\nHarry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms\n(two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.\nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward,\nfumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a"

He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining,\nhigh-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage — a shoe the\nsize of a child’s sled — followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he\nhad ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was\nimmediately explained. A few people gasped.\nHarry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and\nthat was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their\nheights. Yet somehow — maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid — this\nwoman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-\neyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light\nflooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-\nskinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her\nhair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed\nfrom head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her\nthroat and on her thick fingers.\nDumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into\napplause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this\nwoman.\nHer face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward\nDumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself,\nhad barely to bend to kiss it.\n“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said. “Welcome to Hogwarts.”\n“Dumbly-dorr,” said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. “I ’ope I find you\nwell?”\n“In excellent form, I thank you,” said Dumbledore.\n“My pupils,” said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands\ncarelessly behind her.\nHarry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame\nMaxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of\nthem, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now\nstanding behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was\nunsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none\nof them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around\ntheir heads. From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in\nMadame Maxime’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with\napprehensive looks on their faces.\n“’As Karkaroff arrived yet?” Madame Maxime asked.\n“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore. “Would you like to\nwait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a\ntrifle?”\n“Warm up, I think,” said Madame Maxime. “But ze ’orses —”\n“Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of\nthem,” said Dumbledore, “the moment he has returned from dealing with a\nslight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges.”\n“Skrewts,” Ron muttered to Harry, grinning."

Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the\nsilence was broken only by Madame Maxime’s huge horses snorting and\nstamping. But then —\n“Can you hear something?” said Ron suddenly.\nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from\nout of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an\nimmense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed. . . .\n“The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. “Look at the lake!”\nFrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they\nhad a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water — except that the\nsurface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place\ndeep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now\nwashing over the muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the\nlake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the\nlake’s floor. . . .\nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of\nthe whirlpool . . . and then Harry saw the rigging. . . .\n“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.\nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the\nmoonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a\nresurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes\nlooked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged\nentirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank."

Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged\nentirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank.\nA few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down\nin the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.\nPeople were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights\nin the ship’s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along\nthe lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . but then, as they drew nearer, walking up\nthe lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their\nbulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of\nshaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was\nwearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair.\n“Dumbledore!” he called heartily as he walked up the slope. “How are you,\nmy dear fellow, how are you?”\n“Blooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,” Dumbledore replied.\nKarkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light\npouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin\nlike Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a\nsmall curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached\nDumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.\n“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth\nwere rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes,\nwhich remained cold and shrewd. “How good it is to be here, how good. . . .\nViktor, come along, into the warmth . . . you don’t mind, Dumbledore?\nViktor has a slight head cold. . . .”\nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry\ncaught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He\ndidn’t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to\nrecognize that profile.\n“Harry — it’s Krum!”\n— S I X T E E N —\nTHE GOBLET OF FIRE\nI\ndon’t believe it!” Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students\nfiled back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. “Krum,\nHarry! Viktor Krum!”\n“For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player,” said Hermione.\n“Only a Quidditch player?” Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn’t\nbelieve his ears. “Hermione — he’s one of the best Seekers in the world! I had\nno idea he was still at school!”\nAs they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students\nheading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on\nthe soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum’s head. Several\nsixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked —\n“Oh I don’t believe it, I haven’t got a single quill on me —”"

Ron took care to sit\non the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang\nstudents were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they\nshould sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw\ntable. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on\ntheir faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their\nheads.\n“It’s not that cold,” said Hermione defensively. “Why didn’t they bring\ncloaks?”\n“Over here! Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed. “Over here! Hermione,\nbudge up, make a space —”\n“What?”\n“Too late,” said Ron bitterly.\nViktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at\nthe Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very\nsmug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.\n“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said Ron scathingly. “I bet\nKrum can see right through him, though . . . bet he gets people fawning over\nhim all the time. . . . Where d’you reckon they’re going to sleep? We could\noffer him a space in our dormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn’t mind giving him my\nbed, I could kip on a camp bed.”\nHermione snorted.\n“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry.\nThe Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up\nat the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were\npicking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently\nimpressed.\nUp at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing\nhis moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that\nhe added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore’s.\n“But there are only two extra people,” Harry said. “Why’s Filch putting out\nfour chairs, who else is coming?”\n“Eh?” said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.\nWhen all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House\ntables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in\nline were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime.\nWhen their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their\nfeet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared\nquite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame\nMaxime had sat down on Dumbledore’s left-hand side.

Dumbledore remained\nstanding, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.\n“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and — most particularly —\nguests,” said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. “I have\ngreat pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your\nstay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.”\nOne of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave\nwhat was unmistakably a derisive laugh.\n“No one’s making you stay!” Hermione whispered, bristling at her.\n“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,” said\nDumbledore. “I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at\nhome!”\nHe sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him\nin conversation.\nThe plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the\nkitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of\ndishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were\ndefinitely foreign.\n“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish\nstew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.\n“Bouillabaisse,” said Hermione.\n“Bless you,” said Ron.\n“It’s French,” said Hermione, “I had it on holiday summer before last. It’s\nvery nice.”\n“I’ll take your word for it,” said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.\nThe Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even\nthough there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was\nbecause their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black\nof the Hogwarts robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang\nstudents were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.\nHagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty\nminutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.\n“Skrewts doing all right, Hagrid?” Harry called.\n“Thrivin’,” Hagrid called back happily.\n“Yeah, I’ll just bet they are,” said Ron quietly. “Looks like they’ve finally\nfound a food they like, doesn’t it? Hagrid’s fingers.”\nAt that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze\nbouillabaisse?”\nIt was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s\nspeech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde\nhair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white,\neven teeth.\nRon went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but\nnothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.\n“Yeah, have it,” said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.\n“You ’ave finished wiz it?”\n“Yeah,” Ron said breathlessly. “Yeah, it was excellent.”\nThe girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw"

Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before.\nHarry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.\n“She’s a veela!” he said hoarsely to Harry.\n“Of course she isn’t!” said Hermione tartly. “I don’t see anyone else gaping\nat her like an idiot!”\nBut she wasn’t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many\nboys’ heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily\nspeechless, just like Ron.\n“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron, leaning sideways so he\ncould keep a clear view of her. “They don’t make them like that at Hogwarts!”\n“They make them okay at Hogwarts,” said Harry without thinking. Cho\nhappened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery\nhair.\n“When you’ve both put your eyes back in,” said Hermione briskly, “you’ll\nbe able to see who’s just arrived.”\nShe was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had\njust been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff’s other\nside, while Mr. Crouch, Percy’s boss, was next to Madame Maxime.\n“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.\n“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t they?” said Hermione.\n“I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.”\nWhen the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar\ndesserts too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then\nmoved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible\nfrom the Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have\neaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it.\nOnce the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again.\nA pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill\nof excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them,\nFred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great\nconcentration.\n“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of\nupturned faces. “The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to\nsay a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket —”\n“The what?” Harry muttered.\nRon shrugged.\n“— just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first,\nlet me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch,\nHead of the Department of International Magical Cooperation” — there was a\nsmattering of polite applause — “and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports.”\nThere was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch,\nperhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much\nmore likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius\nCrouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced.

His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked\nvery odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and beard.\n“Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few\nmonths on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,” Dumbledore\ncontinued, “and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame\nMaxime on the panel that will judge the champions’ efforts.”\nAt the mention of the word “champions,” the attentiveness of the listening\nstudents seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden\nstillness, for he smiled as he said, “The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.”\nFilch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now\napproached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels.\nIt looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching\nstudents; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but,\nbeing so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else’s.\n“The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already\nbeen examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,” said Dumbledore as Filch\nplaced the chest carefully on the table before him, “and they have made the\nnecessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced\nthroughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different\nways . . . their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction\n— and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.”\nAt this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody\nseemed to be breathing.\n“As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,” Dumbledore\nwent on calmly, “one from each of the participating schools. They will be\nmarked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the\nchampion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup.\nThe champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.”\nDumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of\nthe casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and\npulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely\nunremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.\nDumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it,\nwhere it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.\n“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name\nand school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said\nDumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put\ntheir names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the\nnames of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The\ngoblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely\naccessible to all those wishing to compete.\n“To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,” said\nDumbledore, “I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it\nhas been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will\nbe able to cross this line."

Once a champion has been\nselected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament\nthrough to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a\nbinding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have\nbecome a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly\nprepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is\ntime for bed. Good night to you all.”\n“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their\nway across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. “Well, that should be\nfooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn’t it? And once your name’s in that goblet,\nyou’re laughing — it can’t tell whether you’re seventeen or not!”\n“But I don’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,” said\nHermione, “we just haven’t learned enough . . .”\n“Speak for yourself,” said George shortly. “You’ll try and get in, won’t you,\nHarry?”\nHarry thought briefly of Dumbledore’s insistence that nobody under\nseventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself\nwinning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. . . . He wondered\nhow angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find\na way to get over the Age Line. . . .\n“Where is he?” said Ron, who wasn’t listening to a word of this\nconversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of\nKrum. “Dumbledore didn’t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did\nhe?”\nBut this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the\nSlytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.\n“Back to the ship, then,” he was saying. “Viktor, how are you feeling? Did\nyou eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?”\nHarry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on.\n“Professor, I vood like some vine,” said one of the other Durmstrang boys\nhopefully.\n“I wasn’t offering it to you, Poliakoff,” snapped Karkaroff, his warmly\npaternal air vanishing in an instant. “I notice you have dribbled food all down\nthe front of your robes again, disgusting boy —”\nKarkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at\nexactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let\nhim walk through first.\n“Thank you,” said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him.\nAnd then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at\nhim as though he couldn’t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the\nstudents from Durmstrang came to a halt too.

Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension\ndawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the\ngirl next to him and pointed openly at Harry’s forehead.\n“Yeah, that’s Harry Potter,” said a growling voice from behind them.\nProfessor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there,\nleaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the\nDurmstrang headmaster.\nThe color drained from Karkaroff’s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of\nmingled fury and fear came over him.\n“You!” he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.\n“Me,” said Moody grimly. “And unless you’ve got anything to say to Potter,\nKarkaroff, you might want to move. You’re blocking the doorway.”\nIt was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them,\nlooking over one another’s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.\nWithout another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with\nhim. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon\nhis back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.\nAs the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted\nlate. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much\nearlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the\nentrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them\neating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center\nof the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line\nhad been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every\ndirection.\n“Anyone put their name in yet?” Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.\n“All the Durmstrang lot,” she replied. “But I haven’t seen anyone from\nHogwarts yet.”\n“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,” said\nHarry. “I would’ve if it had been me . . . wouldn’t have wanted everyone\nwatching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?”\nSomeone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee\nJordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely\nexcited.\n“Done it,” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and\nHermione. “Just taken it.”\n“What?” said Ron.\n“The Aging Potion, dung brains,” said Fred.\n“One drop each,” said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. “We\nonly need to be a few months older.”\n“We’re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one\nof us wins,” said Lee, grinning broadly.\n“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said Hermione warningly.\n“I’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.”\nFred, George, and Lee ignored her.\n“Ready?” Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. “C’mon,\nthen — I’ll go first —”"

Fred walked right up to\nthe edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing\nfor a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall\nupon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.\nFor a split second Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought\nso, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment,\nthere was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden\ncircle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed\npainfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury,\nthere was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long\nwhite beards.\nThe entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once\nthey had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other’s beards.\n“I did warn you,” said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see\nProfessor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and\nGeorge, his eyes twinkling. “I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She\nis already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of\nHufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I\nmust say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.”\nFred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was\nhowling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in\nto breakfast.\nThe decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was\nHalloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling,\nwhile hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the\nway over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students\nof seventeen or over who might be entering.\n“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his\nname in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a\nsloth.”\nHarry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in\ndisgust.\n“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”\n“And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,” said Seamus\ncontemptuously. “But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his\ngood looks.”\n“Listen!” said Hermione suddenly.\nPeople were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in\ntheir seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an\nembarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor\nQuidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, “Well, I’ve\ndone it! Just put my name in!”\n“You’re kidding!” said Ron, looking impressed.\n“Are you seventeen, then?” asked Harry."

Those gathered around the Goblet of\nFire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.\nMadame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them\ninto a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line\nand dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name\nentered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.\n“What d’you reckon’ll happen to the ones who aren’t chosen?” Ron\nmuttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of\nFire. “Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the\ntournament?”\n“Dunno,” said Harry. “Hang around, I suppose. . . . Madame Maxime’s\nstaying to judge, isn’t she?”\nWhen all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame\nMaxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.\n“Where are they sleeping, then?” said Ron, moving toward the front doors\nand staring after them.\nA loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione’s reappearance\nwith the box of S.P.E.W. badges.\n“Oh good, hurry up,” said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps,\nkeeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the\nlawn with Madame Maxime.\nAs they neared Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the\nmystery of the Beauxbatons’ sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic\npowder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred\nyards from Hagrid’s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it.\nThe elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in\na makeshift paddock alongside it."

This wasn’t the worst of it, though; he had\nevidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be\naxle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried\na ponytail like Bill’s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn’t really\nsuit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously\ndeciding not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the skrewts?”\n“Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily. “They’re gettin’ massive,\nmus’ be nearly three foot long now. On’y trouble is, they’ve started killin’ each\nother.”\n“Oh no, really?” said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who,\nstaring at Hagrid’s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something\nabout it.\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid sadly. “’S’ okay, though, I’ve got ’em in separate boxes\nnow. Still got abou’ twenty.”\n“Well, that’s lucky,” said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\nHagrid’s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a\ngigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table\nand chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and\ndead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid\nstarted to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the\nTriwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\n“You wait,” he said, grinning. “You jus’ wait. Yer going ter see some stuff\nyeh’ve never seen before. Firs’ task . . . ah, but I’m not supposed ter say.”\n“Go on, Hagrid!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook\nhis head, grinning.\n“I don’ want ter spoil it fer yeh,” said Hagrid. “But it’s gonna be\nspectacular, I’ll tell yeh that. Them champions’re going ter have their work cut\nout. Never thought I’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!”\nThey ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn’t eat much —\nHagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione\nunearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites.\nHowever, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the\ntasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants\nwere likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and\nGeorge were beardless yet."

Yeh’d be makin’ ’em unhappy ter take away\ntheir work, an’ insultin’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.”\n“But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!” said\nHermione. “And we heard he’s asking for wages now!”\n“Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I’m not sayin’ there isn’t the\nodd elf who’d take freedom, but yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it —\nno, nothin’ doin’, Hermione.”\nHermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into\nher cloak pocket.\nBy half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione\ndecided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast — and,\nmore important, the announcement of the school champions.\n“I’ll come with yeh,” said Hagrid, putting away his darning. “Jus’ give us a\nsec.”\nHagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began\nsearching for something inside it. They didn’t pay too much attention until a\ntruly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, “Hagrid,\nwhat’s that?”\n“Eh?” said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. “Don’\nyeh like it?”\n“Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.\n“Er — eau de cologne,” Hagrid muttered. He was blushing. “Maybe it’s a\nbit much,” he said gruffly. “I’ll go take it off, hang on . . .”\nHe stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously\nin the water barrel outside the window.\n“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement. “Hagrid?”\n“And what’s with the hair and the suit?” said Harry in an undertone.\n“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window.\nHagrid had just straightened up and turned ’round. If he had been blushing\nbefore, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very\ncautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn’t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione\npeered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the\nBeauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set\noff for the feast too.

They couldn’t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was\ntalking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only\never seen him wear once before — when he had been looking at the baby\ndragon, Norbert.\n“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione indignantly. “I\nthought he was waiting for us!”\nWithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging\noff up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following\nin their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\n“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously. “Well, if they end up having\nchildren, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would\nweigh about a ton.”\nThey let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was\nsurprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around\nthemselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.\n“Ooh it’s them, look!” Hermione whispered.\nThe Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake.\nViktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other\nDurmstrang students were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum\nexcitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little\nahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them.\nWhen they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet\nof Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore’s empty\nchair at the teachers’ table. Fred and George — clean-shaven again — seemed\nto have taken their disappointment fairly well.\n“Hope it’s Angelina,” said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.\n“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Well, we’ll soon know!”\nThe Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps\nbecause it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn’t seem to fancy the\nextravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone\nelse in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient\nexpressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether\nDumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear,\nand to hear who had been selected as champions.\nAt long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there\nwas a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away\nalmost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him,\nProfessor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as\nanyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr.\nCrouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.\n“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore. “I\nestimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions’ names\nare called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk\nalong the staff table, and go through into the next chamber” — he indicated\nthe door behind the staff table — “where they will be receiving their first\ninstructions.”\nHe took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all"

The Goblet of Fire now shone\nmore brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-\nwhiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched,\nwaiting. . . . A few people kept checking their watches. . . .\n“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.\nThe flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly\nfrom it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of\nparchment fluttered out of it — the whole room gasped.\nDumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm’s length, so\nthat he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-\nwhite.\n“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be\nViktor Krum.”\n“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept\nthe Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up\ntoward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and\ndisappeared through the door into the next chamber.\n“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him,\neven over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”\nThe clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was\nfocused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A\nsecond piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.\n“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”\n“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got\ngracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up\nbetween the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.\n“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding\ntoward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of\nan understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected\nhad dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.\nWhen Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell\nagain, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost\ntaste it.

Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time\nbefore Dumbledore could make himself heard again.\n“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down.\n“Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of\nyou, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to\ngive your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your\nchampion on, you will contribute in a very real —”\nBut Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to\neverybody what had distracted him.\nThe fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it.\nA long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece\nof parchment.\nAutomatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized\nthe parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There\nwas a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands,\nand everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore\ncleared his throat and read out —\n“Harry Potter.”\n— S E V E N T E E N —\nTHE FOUR CHAMPIONS\nH\narry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned\nto look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely\ndreaming. He had not heard correctly.\nThere was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to\nfill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he\nsat, frozen, in his seat.\nUp at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept\npast Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor\nDumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.\nHarry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long\nGryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.\n“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly. “You know I didn’t.”\nBoth of them stared just as blankly back.\nAt the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to\nProfessor McGonagall.\n“Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”\n“Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.\nHarry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly.\nHe set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like\nan immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at\nall, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though\neach were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what\nseemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of\nall the teachers upon him.\n“Well . . . through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore.

He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed\nlike everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and\nfound himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards.\nA handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.\nThe faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a\nwizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it,\nwhich contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started\nwhispering in his ear.\nViktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around\nthe fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames.\nKrum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly\napart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back,\nstaring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and\nthrew back her sheet of long, silvery hair.\n“What is it?” she said. “Do zey want us back in ze Hall?”\nShe thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn’t know how to\nexplain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three\nchampions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.\nThere was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered\nthe room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.\n“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely\nextraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and\naddressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it may seem\n— the fourth Triwizard champion?”\nViktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry.\nCedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again\nas though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour,\nhowever, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester\nBagman.”\n“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just\ncame out of the Goblet of Fire!”\nKrum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely\nbewildered. Fleur frowned.\n“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to Bagman.\n“’E cannot compete. ’E is too young.”\n“Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling\ndown at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this\nyear as an extra safety measure. And as his name’s come out of the goblet . . . I\nmean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It’s down in\nthe rules, you’re obliged . . .

Harry heard\nthe buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before\nProfessor McGonagall closed the door.\n“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress.\n“Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!”\nSomewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little\nboy?\nMadame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height.\nThe top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her\ngigantic black-satin bosom swelled.\n“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” she said imperiously.\n“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff.\nHe was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Two\nHogwarts champions? I don’t remember anyone telling me the host school is\nallowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”\nHe gave a short and nasty laugh.\n“C’est impossible,” said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its\nmany superb opals was resting upon Fleur’s shoulder. “’Ogwarts cannot ’ave\ntwo champions. It is most injust.”\n“We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger\ncontestants, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though\nhis eyes were colder than ever. “Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought\nalong a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.”\n“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly. His black eyes\nwere alight with malice. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s\ndetermination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived\nhere —”\n“Thank you, Severus,” said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet,\nthough his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black\nhair.\nProfessor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right\nback at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon\nspectacles.\n“Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked calmly.\n“No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely.\nSnape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.\n“Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?”\nsaid Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.\n“No,” said Harry vehemently.\n“Ah, but of course ’e is lying!” cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now\nshaking his head, his lip curling.\n“He could not have crossed the Age Line,” said Professor McGonagall\nsharply. “I am sure we are all agreed on that —”\n“Dumbly-dorr must ’ave made a mistake wiz ze line,” said Madame\nMaxime, shrugging.\n“It is possible, of course,” said Dumbledore politely."

Harry could not have\ncrossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not\npersuade an older student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good\nenough for everybody else!”\nShe shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.\n“Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman,” said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once\nmore, “you are our — er — objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is\nmost irregular?”\nBagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at\nMr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half\nhidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look\nmuch older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke,\nhowever, it was in his usual curt voice.\n“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people\nwhose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the\ntournament.”\n“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming\nand turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter\nwas now closed.\n“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said\nKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face\nwore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more,\nand we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s\nonly fair, Dumbledore.”\n“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of\nFire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament\n—”\n“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded\nKarkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little\nexpected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!”\n“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t\nleave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.\nBinding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”\nMoody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with\nevery right step he took, there was a loud clunk.\n“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”\nHarry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody\nwas saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had\nballed themselves into fists.\n“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put\nPotter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came out.”\n“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!” said\nMadame Maxime."

I don’t hear him saying a word. . . .”\n“Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot.\n“’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t ’e? We ’ave all been ’oping to be chosen for\nweeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize\nmoney — zis is a chance many would die for!”\n“Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said Moody, with\nthe merest trace of a growl.\nAn extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was\nlooking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and\nsaid, “Moody, old man . . . what a thing to say!”\n“We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn’t\ndiscovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,” said Karkaroff loudly.\n“Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd\nquality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt\nyou had your reasons.”\n“Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody. “Seeing things, eh? It was a\nskilled witch or wizard who put the boy’s name in that goblet. . . .”\n“Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her\nhuge hands.\n“Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It\nwould have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle\nthat goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the\ntournament. . . . I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth\nschool, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . . .”\n“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” said\nKarkaroff coldly, “and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course, I\nheard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents\ncontained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before\nrealizing it was a carriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take you\nentirely seriously. . . .”\n“There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody\nretorted in a menacing voice. “It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do,\nKarkaroff — as you ought to remember. . . .”\n“Alastor!” said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment\nwhom he was speaking to, but then realized “Mad-Eye” could hardly be\nMoody’s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff\nwith satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was burning.\n“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to"

Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff\nwith satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was burning.\n“How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to\neveryone gathered in the room. “It seems to me, however, that we have no\nchoice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete\nin the tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . .”\n“Ah, but Dumbly-dorr —”\n“My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted\nto hear it.”\nDumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared.\nShe wasn’t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman,\nhowever, looked rather excited.\n“Well, shall we crack on, then?” he said, rubbing his hands together and\nsmiling around the room. “Got to give our champions their instructions,\nhaven’t we? Barty, want to do the honors?”\nMr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.\n“Yes,” he said, “instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .”\nHe moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill.\nThere were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his\nwrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.\n“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur,\nand Viktor, “so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the\nface of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . very\nimportant. . . .\n“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of\nthe other students and the panel of judges.\n“The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind\nfrom their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions\nwill face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive\ninformation about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the\ndemanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are\nexempted from end-of-year tests.”\nMr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.\n“I think that’s all, is it, Albus?”\n“I think so,” said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild\nconcern. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?”\n“No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,” said Mr. Crouch. “It is\na very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . . I’ve left young Weatherby\nin charge. . . . Very enthusiastic . . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be\ntold. . . .”\n“You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?” said Dumbledore.\n“Come on, Barty, I’m staying!” said Bagman brightly. “It’s all happening at\nHogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!”\n“I think not, Ludo,” said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.\n“Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?” said\nDumbledore.\nBut Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur’s shoulders and"

Harry could hear them both talking\nvery fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to\nKrum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.\n“Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,” said Dumbledore, smiling at\nboth of them. “I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate\nwith you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to\nmake a great deal of mess and noise.”\nHarry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.\nThe Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the\njagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.\n“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each other\nagain!”\n“I s’pose,” said Harry. He really couldn’t think of anything to say. The\ninside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had\nbeen ransacked.\n“So . . . tell me . . .” said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was\nnow lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. “How did you get\nyour name in?”\n“I didn’t,” said Harry, staring up at him. “I didn’t put it in. I was telling the\ntruth.”\n“Ah . . . okay,” said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him.\n“Well . . . see you, then.”\nInstead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its\nright. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then,\nslowly, he started to climb the marble ones.\nWas anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they\nall think he’d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think\nthat, when he was facing competitors who’d had three years’ more magical\neducation than he had — when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded\nvery dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of\npeople? Yes, he’d thought about it . . . he’d fantasized about it . . . but it had\nbeen a joke, really, an idle sort of dream . . . he’d never really, seriously\nconsidered entering. . . .\nBut someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted him in the\ntournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He\ndidn’t think so, somehow. . . .\nTo see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their\nwish. . . .\nBut to get him killed?\nWas Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have put\nHarry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want\nhim dead?\nHarry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead,\nsomeone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old . . . Lord\nVoldemort.

Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some\ndistant country, in hiding, alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . .\nYet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar\nhurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to\nWormtail . . . plotting Harry’s murder. . . .\nHarry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely\nnoticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she\nwas not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her\nneighbor’s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now\nsitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every\npicture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat\nLady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.\n“Well, well, well,” said the Fat Lady, “Violet’s just told me everything.\nWho’s just been chosen as school champion, then?”\n“Balderdash,” said Harry dully.\n“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.\n“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung\nforward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.\nThe blast of noise that met Harry’s ears when the portrait opened almost\nknocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside\nthe common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole\nof Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.\n“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half\nannoyed, half deeply impressed.\n“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.\n“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how —”\nBut Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it couldn’t be me,\nat least it’s a Gryffindor —”\n“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!”\nshrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.\n“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some —”\n“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —”\nBut nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear\nthat he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to\nhave noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had\nunearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it\naround Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn’t get away; whenever he tried to sidle\nover to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks,\nforcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his\nhands. . . . Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked\nDumbledore’s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet. . . .\n“I didn’t,” he said, over and over again, “I don’t know how it happened.”"

Insisting that\nhe needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they\nattempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake\neveryone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.\nTo his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise\nempty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the\ndoor behind him.\n“Where’ve you been?” Harry said.\n“Oh hello,” said Ron.\nHe was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry\nsuddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner\nthat Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted\nvery tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to\nremove it.\n“So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it\ninto a corner. “Congratulations.”\n“What d’you mean, congratulations?” said Harry, staring at Ron. There was\ndefinitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a\ngrimace.\n“Well . . . no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not even Fred\nand George. What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak?”\n“The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said Harry\nslowly.\n“Oh right,” said Ron. “I thought you might’ve told me if it was the\nCloak . . . because it would’ve covered both of us, wouldn’t it? But you found\nanother way, did you?”\n“Listen,” said Harry, “I didn’t put my name in that goblet. Someone else\nmust’ve done it.”\nRon raised his eyebrows.\n“What would they do that for?”\n“I dunno,” said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say,\n“To kill me.”\nRon’s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into\nhis hair.\n“It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,” he said. “If you don’t want\neveryone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you\ndidn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, that\nViolet, she’s already told us all Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand\nGalleons prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests\neither. . . .”\n“I didn’t put my name in that goblet!” said Harry, starting to feel angry.\n“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric. “Only\nyou said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen"

I’m not stupid, you know.”\n“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.\n“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on\nhis face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you’ll need to be up\nearly tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”\nHe wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry\nstanding there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding\none of the few people he had been sure would believe him.\n— E I G H T E E N —\nTHE WEIGHING OF\nTHE WANDS\nW\nhen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment\nto remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the\nmemory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the\ncurtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to\nbelieve him — only to find that Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone\ndown to breakfast.\nHarry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.\nThe moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke\ninto applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and\nfacing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was\nnot inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be\ncornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him\nto join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open,\nclimbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.\n“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a\nnapkin. “I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?”\n“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.\nThey went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in\nat the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake,\nwhere the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a\nchilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told\nHermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the\nnight before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without\nquestion.\n“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,” she said when he’d\nfinished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. “The look on\nyour face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did\nput it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . . I don’t think any student could\nhave done it . . . they’d never be able to fool the goblet, or get over\nDumbledore’s —”\n“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.\nHermione hesitated.\n“Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast,” she said.\n“Does he still think I entered myself?”\n“Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really,” said Hermione awkwardly."

He wants to make a\nprat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?”\n“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all the attention,\nyou know it is. I know it’s not your fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry\nopen his mouth furiously. “I know you don’t ask for it . . . but — well — you\nknow, Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re his\nbest friend, and you’re really famous — he’s always shunted to one side\nwhenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but\nI suppose this is just one time too many. . . .”\n“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him from me I’ll swap any\ntime he wants. Tell him from me he’s welcome to it. . . . People gawping at my\nforehead everywhere I go. . . .”\n“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell him yourself.\nIt’s the only way to sort this out.”\n“I’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up!” Harry\nsaid, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. “Maybe\nhe’ll believe I’m not enjoying myself once I’ve got my neck broken or —”\n“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at all.” She\nlooked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking — you know what we’ve\ngot to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?”\n“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the —”\n“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He asked you to\nkeep him posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as\nif he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a\nquill out with me —”\n“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn’t be\noverheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He came back to the country\njust because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the\ncastle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —”\n“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to find out\nanyway —”\n“How?”\n“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very seriously.\n“This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be really surprised if there\nisn’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You’re already in\nhalf the books about You-Know-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather\nhear it from you, I know he would.”\n“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast\ninto the lake.

They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment,\nbefore a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface.\nThen they returned to the castle.\n“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the stairs. “He\ntold me not to use Hedwig again.”\n“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”\n“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.\n“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said\nHermione.\nThey went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a\nquill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches,\nlooking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote\nhis letter.\nDear Sirius,\nYou told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts, so here\ngoes — I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament’s\nhappening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion.\nI don’t know who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The\nother Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.\nHe paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about\nthe large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last\nnight, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply\ndipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,\nHope you’re okay, and Buckbeak —\n“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his\nrobes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out\nher leg.\n“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. “I’ve\ngot to use one of these. . . .”\nHedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut\ninto his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his\nletter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry\nreached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up\ninto the rafters out of reach.\n“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “This isn’t my fault.”\nIf Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to\nthe idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken\nhe was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at\nlessons — and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors,\nthought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the\nGryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\nThe Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors,\nhad turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them.

It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt\nthat Harry had stolen their champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps,\nby the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric\nwas one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor\nonce at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom\nHarry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were\nrepotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — though they did laugh rather\nunpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip\nand smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.\nHermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though\nboth answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other.\nHarry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — but then,\nshe was Head of Hufflepuff House.\nHe would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal\ncircumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too\n— the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming\nchampion.\nPredictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly\nin place.\n“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle the\nmoment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better\nget a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . .\nHalf the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re\ngoing to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”\nCrabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,\nbecause Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower\nof crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class’s\nhorror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been\nkilling one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution\nwould be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short\nwalk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy\ncompletely.\n“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the\nboxes. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash?

Harry — you\ncome here an’ help me with this big one. . . .”\nHagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from the rest of\nthe class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then\nturned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So — yer competin’, Harry. In the\ntournament. School champion.”\n“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.\nHagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows."

School champion.”\n“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.\nHagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.\n“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”\n“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with difficulty the\nrush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words.\n“’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh —\nan’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.”\n“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.\nThe pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered\nnow, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and\nextremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a\nkind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant\nscorpions and elongated crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes.\nThey had become immensely strong and very hard to control.\n“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said happily. Harry\nassumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly\nweren’t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts’ ends\nwould explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one\nperson was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get\nback on their feet.\n“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at\nhim with a worried expression on his face. “School champion . . . everythin’\nseems ter happen ter you, doesn’ it?”\nHarry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him . . . that\nwas more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake,\nand that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to\nhim.\nThe next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had\never come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second\nyear, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow\nstudents. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped\nwith the rest of the school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a\nfriend, but he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron\ndidn’t want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from\nall sides.\nHe could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t like it; they\nhad their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious\ninsults from the Slytherins — he was highly unpopular there and always had\nbeen, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch\nand in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws\nmight have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was\nwrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate\nto earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.\nThen there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much\nmore than he did.

        "text": "Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much\nmore than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair,\nand gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these\ndays, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who\nhad been so keen to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school\nbags one lunchtime.\nMeanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come\nanywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even\nmore certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in\nProfessor Flitwick’s class that he was given extra homework — the only person\nto get any, apart from Neville.\n“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure him as they\nleft Flitwick’s class — she had been making objects zoom across the room to\nher all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters,\nwastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly\n—”\n“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past,\nsurrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as\nthough he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. “Still — never mind,\neh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . . .”\nDouble Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was\nnothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with\nSnape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as\nmuch as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most\nunpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one\nFriday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them,\nignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today\nshould be any better.\nWhen he and Hermione arrived at Snape’s dungeon after lunch, they found\nthe Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large\nbadge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought\nthey were S.P.E.W. badges — then he saw that they all bore the same message,\nin luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground\npassage:\n“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. “And this\nisn’t all they do — look!”\nHe pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be\nreplaced by another one, which glowed green:\nThe Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too,\nuntil the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry.\nHe felt the heat rise in his face and neck.\n“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her\ngang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, “really witty.”\nRon was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn’t\nlaughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.\n“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. “I’ve\ngot loads. But don’t touch my hand, now.

I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t\nwant a Mudblood sliming it up.”\nSome of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst\nthrough a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he’d thought\nwhat he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing\ndown the corridor.\n“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.\n“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand.\n“Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve got the guts —”\nFor a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the\nsame time, both acted.\n“Furnunculus!” Harry yelled.\n“Densaugeo!” screamed Malfoy.\nJets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted\noff at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione.\nGoyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were\nspringing up — Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.\n“Hermione!”\nRon had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and\nsaw Ron dragging Hermione’s hand away from her face. It wasn’t a pretty\nsight. Hermione’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now\ngrowing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as\nher teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken,\nshe felt them and let out a terrified cry.\n“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice.\nSnape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations;\nSnape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, “Explain.”\n“Potter attacked me, sir —”\n“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.\n“— and he hit Goyle — look —”\nSnape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would\nhave been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.\n“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.\n“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!”\nHe forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing her best to\nhide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown\ndown past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were\ndoubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape’s\nback.\nSnape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”\nHermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her\nheel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.\nIt was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at\nthe same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in\nthe confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were\ncalling him. He got the gist, however.\n“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a"

Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s\nworth of detentions.”\nHarry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape\ninto a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back\nof the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking\nwith anger too — for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to\nnormal between them, but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and\nSeamus instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the\ndungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking.\nPOTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.\nHarry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things\nhappening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse . . .\nhe’d have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching. . . .\n“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes\nglittering unpleasantly. “You should all have prepared your recipes now. I want\nyou to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom\nto test one. . . .”\nSnape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was\ngoing to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to\nthe front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head —\nAnd then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts.\nIt was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and\nwalked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.\n“Yes?” said Snape curtly.\n“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.”\nSnape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his\neager face.\n“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape coldly. “He\nwill come upstairs when this class is finished.”\nColin went pink.\n“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the champions\nhave got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . . .”\nHarry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying\nthose last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring\ndeterminedly at the ceiling.\n“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave your things here, I\nwant you back down here later to test your antidote.”\n“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin. “All\nthe champions —”\n“Very well!” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight!”\nHarry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As\nhe walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from\nevery direction.\n“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the moment"

You being\nchampion?”\n“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps\ninto the entrance hall. “What do they want photos for, Colin?”\n“The Daily Prophet, I think!”\n“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More publicity.”\n“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry\nknocked on the door and entered.\nHe was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away\nto the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them,\nhowever, had been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered\nwith a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered\ndesks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry\nhad never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.\nViktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to\nanybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal\nhappier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so\nthat her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large\nblack camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner\nof his eye.\nBagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.\n“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you\ncome . . . nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing ceremony, the\nrest of the judges will be here in a moment —”\n“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.\n“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you\nknow, as they’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,” said Bagman.\n“The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a\nlittle photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch\nin magenta robes. “She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily\nProphet. . . .”\n“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.\nHer hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly\nwith her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers\nclutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted\ncrimson.\n“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?” she said\nto Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. “The youngest champion, you\nknow . . . to add a bit of color?”\n“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no objection?”\n“Er —” said Harry.\n“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had\nHarry’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out\nof the room again and opening a nearby door."

Harry stared at her.\n“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita Skeeter again,\nperching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down\nonto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness.\n“Let’s see now . . .”\nShe unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of\ncandles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so\nthat they could see what they were doing.\n“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to\ntalk to you normally. . . .”\n“A what?” said Harry.\nRita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached\nagain into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of\nparchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower’s\nAll-Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her\nmouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on\nthe parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.\n“Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.”\nHarry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had\nspoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:\nAttractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has\npunctured many inflated reputations —\n“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of\nparchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag. Now she\nleaned toward Harry and said, “So, Harry . . . what made you decide to enter\nthe Triwizard Tournament?”\n“Er —” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. Even though he\nwasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could\nmake out a fresh sentence:\nAn ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming\nface of Harry Potter, whose eyes —\n“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly, Harry\nlooked up at her instead. “Now — why did you decide to enter the\ntournament, Harry?”\n“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of\nFire. I didn’t put it in there.”\nRita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.\n“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We\nall know you shouldn’t really have entered at all. But don’t worry about that.\nOur readers love a rebel.”\n“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know who —”\n“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita Skeeter. “Excited?\nNervous?”"

His\ninsides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.\n“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita Skeeter briskly.\n“Have you thought about that at all?”\n“Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said Harry.\nThe quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as\nthough it were skating.\n“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” said Rita\nSkeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s affected you?”\n“Er,” said Harry, yet again.\n“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to\nprove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were\ntempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —”\n“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.\n“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over\nhim.\n“No,” said Harry.\n“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the\nTriwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?”\nHarry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how\nhis parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching\nhim very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and looked down at words\nthe quill had just written:\nTears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the\nparents he can barely remember.\n“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.\nBefore Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was\npulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus\nDumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the\ncupboard.\n“Dumbledore!” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight — but\nHarry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from\nthe box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed fingers were hastily\nsnapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said,\nstanding up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore.\n“I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International\nConfederation of Wizards’ Conference?”\n“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “I particularly\nenjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.”\nRita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.\n“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-\nfashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street —”\n“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,” said\nDumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but I’m afraid we will have\nto discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it\ncannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”\nVery glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room."

Rita Skeeter settled herself down in\na corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on\nher knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on\nthe parchment.\n“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his place at the\njudges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be checking your wands\nto ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”\nHarry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with\nlarge, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander\nbefore — he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought his own wand\nover three years ago in Diagon Alley.\n“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.\nOllivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.\nFleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand.\n“Hmmm . . .” he said.\nHe twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a\nnumber of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and\nexamined it carefully.\n“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches . . . inflexible . . .\nrosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me . . .”\n“An ’air from ze ’ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of my grandmuzzer’s.”\nSo Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell\nRon . . . then he remembered that Ron wasn’t speaking to him.\n“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela hair myself, of course.\nI find it makes for rather temperamental wands . . . however, to each his own,\nand if this suits you . . .”\nMr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for\nscratches or bumps; then he muttered, “Orchideous!” and a bunch of flowers\nburst from the wand-tip.\n“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander,\nscooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. “Mr.\nDiggory, you next.”\nFleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.\n“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much\nmore enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well.\nContaining a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . .\nmust have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked"

He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his\nhands in the pockets of his robes.\n“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m\nmuch mistaken? A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what\nI . . . however . . .”\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over\nbefore his eyes.\n“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded.\n“Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter\ninches . . .

He could remember it as though it had\nhappened yesterday. . . .\nFour summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr.\nOllivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his\nmeasurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved\nwhat felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that\nsuited him — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and\ncontained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been\nvery surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,”\nhe had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr.\nOllivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from\nthe same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort’s.\nHarry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.

Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and\nhanded it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.\n“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’ table. “You\nmay go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go\ndown to dinner, as they are about to end —”\nFeeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave,\nbut the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.\n“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly. “All the judges and\nchampions, what do you think, Rita?”\n“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon\nHarry again. “And then perhaps some individual shots.”\nThe photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into\nshadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn’t stand far enough\nback to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else\nstood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give\nit an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been\nused to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The\nphotographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept\nhurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she\ninsisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.\nHarry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there — he supposed she was\nstill in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the\ntable, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on\nSummoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across\nRon.\n“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was\npointing at Harry’s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.\n“Oh — right,” said Harry.\n“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s dungeon,”\nsaid Ron.\nHe then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a\nmoment, Harry considered going after him — he wasn’t sure whether he\nwanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure\nof Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the\nletter off its leg, and unrolled it.\nHarry —\nI can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky in case the\nowl is intercepted — we need to talk face-to-face.

        "text": "Harry —\nI can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky in case the\nowl is intercepted — we need to talk face-to-face. Can you ensure that you are\nalone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o’clock in the morning on the\n22nd of November?\nI know better than anyone that you can look after yourself, and while\nyou’re around Dumbledore and Moody I don’t think anyone will be able to\nhurt you. However, someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in\nthat tournament would have been very risky, especially right under\nDumbledore’s nose.\nBe on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let\nme know about the 22nd of November as quickly as you can.\n— N I N E T E E N —\nTHE HUNGARIAN\nHORNTAIL\nT\nhe prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that sustained\nHarry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that\nhad never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had\nworn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink\nin. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were\ncrouching ahead of him like some horrific monster, barring his path. He had\nnever suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had\nexperienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin,\nwhich had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it\nhard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been\nleading up to, and would finish with, the first task. . . .\nAdmittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better\nabout having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic\nin front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be\nsomething at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be\nbeside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and\nHermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of\nthe common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst,\nthey were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn’t\nhave to resort to that — Filch would skin them alive.\nIn the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of\nthe castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard\nTournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the\ntournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had\nbeen given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six,\nand seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and\nDurmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of\nthe article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.\nThe article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning\nfeeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter\nhad reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn’t remember ever\nsaying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard."

Rita Skeeter\nhad reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn’t remember ever\nsaying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.\nI suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they’d be\nvery proud of me if they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes\nat night I still cry about them, I’m not ashamed to admit it. . . .\nI know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because\nthey’re watching over me. . . .\nBut Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his “er’s” into\nlong, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.\nHarry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend,\nColin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the\ncompany of one Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty\nMuggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in\nthe school.\nFrom the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people\n— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering\ncomments.\n“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”\n“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or\nis this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?”\n“Hey — Harry!”\n“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in\nthe corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out\nover my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. . . .”\n“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”\nIt was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.\n“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.\n“Er . . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do well.”\nWhich left Harry feeling extremely stupid.\nHermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she\nhadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of\nadmiration for the way she was handling the situation.\n“Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she\nhad come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita’s article had appeared. “What\nwas she judging against — a chipmunk?”\n“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air\nand stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn’t hear\nthem. “Just ignore it, Harry.”\nBut Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all since he had\ntold him about Snape’s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make\nthings up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats’ brains in\nSnape’s dungeon, but that had been the day Rita’s article had appeared, which\nseemed to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the\nattention.\nHermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the\nother, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He\nwould talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn’t put his name"

Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just\nwasn’t the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging\naround in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn’t\nmastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a\nblock about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help.\nThey consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their\nlunchtimes.\nViktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what\nhe was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him\nthrough the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there —\nnot that he ever bothered them — but because groups of giggling girls often\nturned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the\nnoise distracting.\n“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum’s sharp\nprofile. “They only like him because he’s famous! They wouldn’t look twice at\nhim if he couldn’t do that Wonky-Faint thing —”\n“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking\nto get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron’s\nexpression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints.\nIt is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give\nanything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The\ndays until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the\nclocks to work at double speed. Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was\nwith him wherever he went, as ever-present as the snide comments about the\nDaily Prophet article.\nOn the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and\nabove were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry\nthat it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry\ndidn’t need much persuasion.\n“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want to go with him?”\n“Oh . . . well . . .” Hermione went slightly pink. “I thought we might meet\nup with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .”\n“No,” said Harry flatly.\n“Oh Harry, this is so stupid —”\n“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility\nCloak.”\n“Oh all right then . . .” Hermione snapped, “but I hate talking to you in\nthat Cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.”\nSo Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back\ndownstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.\nHarry felt wonderfully free under the Cloak; he watched other students"

Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione\nwithout looking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita\nSkeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were\ngone, Harry said, “She’s staying in the village. I bet she’s coming to watch the\nfirst task.”\nAs he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn’t\nmention this; he and Hermione hadn’t discussed what was coming in the first\ntask much; he had the feeling she didn’t want to think about it.\n“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end\nof the street. “Why don’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three\nBroomsticks, it’s a bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to talk to Ron!” she added\nirritably, correctly interpreting his silence.\nThe Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students\nenjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry\nrarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-\nwizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who\nwere not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves.\nIt was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case\nyou accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.\nHarry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to\nbuy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting\nwith Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard\npoke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.\nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under\nhis Cloak.\n“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she muttered. “Lucky I\nbrought something to do.”\nAnd she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of\nS.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron’s names at the top of the very short\nlist. It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions\ntogether, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and\ntreasurer.\n“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in\nS.P.E.W.,” Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub."

He took a swig of butterbeer under his Cloak.\n“Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?”\n“When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!” she hissed\nback. “You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more direct action. I\nwonder how you get into the school kitchens?”\n“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.\nHermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer,\nwatching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie\nMacmillan and Hannah Abbott were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a\nnearby table, both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their\ncloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw\nfriends. She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry\nvery slightly. . . .\nWhat wouldn’t he have given to be one of these people, sitting around\nlaughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He\nimagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn’t come out of the\nGoblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing.\nRon would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily\nimagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing\non Tuesday. He’d have been really looking forward to it, watching them do\nwhatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the\nback of the stands. . . .\nHe wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had\nseen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous\nbut excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors;\nshe looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat\nin the library, poring over books.\nHarry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease\nslightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight\nwas the night they were meeting at the common room fire — assuming\nnothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . .\n“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.\nThe back of Hagrid’s enormous shaggy head — he had mercifully\nabandoned his bunches — emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he\nhadn’t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully,\nhe saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid\nhad his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking\nfrom his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to think\nmuch of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from\ntables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead,\nbut Harry knew better.

Moody had told them all during their last Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and\ndrink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended\ncup.\nAs Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved,\nthen remembered that Hagrid couldn’t see him. Moody, however, paused, his\nmagical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the\nsmall of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to\nhim, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward\nHarry and Hermione’s table.\n“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.\n“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.\nMoody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was\nreading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, “Nice Cloak, Potter.”\nHarry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody’s\nnose was particularly obvious at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.\n“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?”\n“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody said quietly. “And it’s\ncome in useful at times, I can tell you.”\nHagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn’t see\nhim, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent\ndown on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a\nwhisper so low that only Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at\nmidnight at me cabin. Wear that Cloak.”\nStraightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,”\nwinked, and departed. Moody followed him.\n“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry said, very\nsurprised.\n“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder what he’s up to? I\ndon’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .” She looked nervously around\nand hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.”\nIt was true that going down to Hagrid’s at midnight would mean cutting his\nmeeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig\ndown to Hagrid’s to tell him he couldn’t go — always assuming she would\nconsent to take the note, of course — Harry, however, thought it better just to\nbe quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know\nwhat this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.\nAt half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed\nearly, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs\nthrough the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The\nCreevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory!\nbadges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry\nPotter! instead. So far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges\nstuck on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and"

Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and\nwaited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione\nopened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped\npast her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set off through the castle.\nThe grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights\nshining in Hagrid’s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage\nwas also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he\nknocked on Hagrid’s front door.\n“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking\naround.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the Cloak down\noff his head. “What’s up?”\n“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.\nThere was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a\nflower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as\nthough he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly\nattempted to comb his hair — Harry could see the comb’s broken teeth\ntangled in it.\n“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had\nlaid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a\nstranger in a pub.\n“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that Cloak,” said\nHagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . . .”\n“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. . . . I’ve got to be back up at the castle by\none o’clock —”\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off\ninto the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that\nHagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.\n“Hagrid, what — ?”\n“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the\ncrossed golden wands.\nMadame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around\nher massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.\n“Ah, ’Agrid . . . it is time?”\n“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help\nher down the golden steps.\nMadame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm,\nand they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime’s\ngiant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with\nthem. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her\nany old time he wanted . . . she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. . . .\nBut it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry,\nbecause after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?”\n“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seein’, trust me. On’y —\ndon’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.”"

Yeh’re not s’posed ter know.”\n“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.\nAnd still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged\nalong in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some\nharebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn’t\nget there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and\nleave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime. . . .\nBut then — when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest\nthat the castle and the lake were out of sight — Harry heard something. Men\nwere shouting up ahead . . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . . .\nHagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt.\nHarry hurried up alongside them — for a split second, he thought he was\nseeing bonfires, and men darting around them — and then his mouth fell\nopen.\nDragons.\nFour fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto\ntheir hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring\nand snorting — torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their\nopen, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks.\nThere was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling\nat the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing\nand stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold\nspikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into\nthe air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others, which was\nnearest to them.\nAt least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to\ncontrol them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around\ntheir necks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw\nthe eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with\neither fear or rage, he couldn’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a\nyowling, screeching scream. . . .\n“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the\nchain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you\nknow! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”\n“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.\n“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the count of\nthree!”\nHarry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.\n“Stupefy!” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the\ndarkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly\nhides —\nHarry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back\nlegs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid\nof flame, though still smoking — then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of\nsinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have\nsworn made the trees behind him quake."

Several tons of\nsinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have\nsworn made the trees behind him quake.\nThe dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen\ncharges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the\nchains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the\nground with their wands.\n“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of\nthem moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had\nwarned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was:\nCharlie Weasley.\n“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk. “They should be okay\nnow — we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here, thought it\nmight be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but, like you\nsaw, they weren’t happy, not happy at all —”\n“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid, gazing at the closest\ndragon, the black one, with something close to reverence. Its eyes were still just\nopen. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black\neyelid.\n“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s a Common Welsh\nGreen over there, the smaller one — a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray —\nand a Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.”\nCharlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the\nedge of the enclosure, gazing at the Stunned dragons.\n“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said, frowning.\n“The champions aren’t supposed to know what’s coming — she’s bound to\ntell her student, isn’t she?”\n“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing,\nenraptured, at the dragons.\n“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking his head.\n“Four . . .” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the champions, is it? What’ve\nthey gotta do — fight ’em?”\n“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be on hand if it gets nasty,\nExtinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know\nwhy . . . but I tell you this, I don’t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious\nthing. Its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.”\nCharlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-\ncolored spikes protruding along it every few inches.\nFive of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that\nmoment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between them in a\nblanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail’s side. Hagrid let out a\nmoan of longing.\n“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly. Then he said, “How’s\nHarry?”\n“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.\n“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie grimly,"

        "text": "Harry?”\n“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.\n“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie grimly,\nlooking out over the dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell Mum what he’s got\nto do for the first task; she’s already having kittens about him. . . .” Charlie\nimitated his mother’s anxious voice. “‘How could they let him enter that\ntournament, he’s much too young! I thought they were all safe, I thought there was\ngoing to be an age limit!’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about\nhim. ‘He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!’”\nHarry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t miss him,\nwith the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he\nturned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle.\nHe didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what was coming or not.\nPerhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he’d seen\nthe dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in\nfront of the whole school . . . but maybe he would anyway. . . . He was going\nto be armed with his wand — which, just now, felt like nothing more than a\nnarrow strip of wood — against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-\nbreathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How?\nHarry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen\nminutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn’t\nremember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now —\nwhen, without warning, he ran into something very solid.\nHarry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the Cloak around him. A\nvoice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s there?”\nHarry hastily checked that the Cloak was covering him and lay very still,\nstaring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the\ngoatee . . . it was Karkaroff.\n“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in\nthe darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff\nseemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around\nat waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the\ncover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the\ndragons were.\nVery slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast\nas he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness\nback toward Hogwarts.\nHe had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off\nhis ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even\nhave spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest\ntogether — they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance . . . and now all\nKarkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame\nMaxime, would know what was in store for the champions.\nBy the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on"

He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire. . . .\n“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in\nfront of the portrait hole.\n“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the\npicture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common\nroom was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal,\nHermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and\nSirius got privacy.\nHarry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair\nin front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only\nsource of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the\nCreeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now\nread POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and\njumped.\nSirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do\nexactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have scared him out of his\nwits. Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he\nscrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius —\nhow’re you doing?”\nSirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they had said\ngood-bye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity\nof long, black, matted hair — but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius’s\nface was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph\nHarry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding.\n“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.\n“I’m —” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but he couldn’t do it.\nBefore he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d talked in days —\nabout how no one believed he hadn’t entered the tournament of his own free\nwill, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he\ncouldn’t walk down a corridor without being sneered at — and about Ron,\nRon not believing him, Ron’s jealousy . . .\n“. . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first task, and\nit’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately.\nSirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look\nthat Azkaban had given them — that deadened, haunted look. He had let\nHarry talk himself into silence without interruption, but now he said,\n“Dragons we can deal with, Harry, but we’ll get to that in a minute — I\nhaven’t got long here . . . I’ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire,"

I’ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire,\nbut they could be back at any time. There are things I need to warn you\nabout.”\n“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches. . . . Surely\nthere could be nothing worse than dragons coming?\n“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what\nDeath Eaters are, don’t you?”\n“Yes — he — what?”\n“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I’d bet\neverything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year —\nto keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the\nfirst place.”\n“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his brain seemed to be\nstruggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. “Why did they\nrelease him?”\n“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius bitterly. “He said\nhe’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names . . . he put a load of\nother people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I\ncan tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the\nDark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out\nfor the Durmstrang champion as well.”\n“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But . . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name\nin the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good actor. He seemed furious\nabout it. He wanted to stop me from competing.”\n“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced the\nMinistry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on\nthe Daily Prophet, Harry —”\n“— you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.\n“— and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last\nmonth, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I\nknow she says it was another false alarm,” Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry\nabout to speak, “but I don’t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop\nhim from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot\nmore difficult with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely;\nMad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he can’t still\nspot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.”\n“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly. “Karkaroff’s trying to kill\nme? But — why?”\nSirius hesitated.\n“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said slowly. “The Death\nEaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves\nat the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark . . .\nand then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone\nmissing?”\n“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry."

And she was an idiot. Very\nnosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say\nshe’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”\n“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said\nHarry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his\norders?”\n“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t\nstrike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort\nwas powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that\ngoblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would be a\nvery good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.”\n“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry,\ngrinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their\nstuff.”\n“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s a\nway, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong\nand too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need\nabout half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”\n“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.\n“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s\nall you need. Just —”\nBut Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as\nthough it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral\nstaircase behind him.\n“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “Go! There’s someone coming!”\nHarry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face\nwithin the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the\nMinistry would get dragged in — he, Harry, would be questioned about\nSirius’s whereabouts —\nHarry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone.\nHe watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a\nstroll at one o’clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how\nto get past a dragon?\nIt was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead\nfacing Harry across the room, and looked around.\n“Who were you talking to?” he said.\n“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you doing\ndown here at this time of night?”\n“I just wondered where you —” Ron broke off, shrugging. “Nothing. I’m\ngoing back to bed.”"

I’m\ngoing back to bed.”\n“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He\nknew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on\npurpose, but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated everything about Ron,\nright down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama\ntrousers.\n“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. “Should’ve\nrealized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get on with practicing for\nyour next interview in peace.”\nHarry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and\nchucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead\nand bounced off.\n“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You\nmight even have a scar now, if you’re lucky. . . . That’s what you want, isn’t\nit?”\nHe strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop\nhim, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just\nstood there in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay\nawake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn’t hear him come up\nto bed.\n— T W E N T Y —\nTHE FIRST TASK\nH\narry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it\nwas a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his\nfoot instead of his sock. When he’d finally got all his clothes on the right parts\nof his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor\ntable in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too\nqueasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of\nporridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about\nthe dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another\nlong walk around the lake.\nAlarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still\nthought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.\n“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said\ndesperately, “and then we can worry about Karkaroff.”\nThey walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a\nsimple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to\nthem, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every\nbook he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching\nthrough the large pile.\n“‘Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .’ This is no good, this is\nfor nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. . . .”\n“‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues\ntheir thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate . . .’ But\nSirius said a simple one would do it. . . .”\n“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing aside Men\nWho Love Dragons Too Much."

The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get\nthrough a dragon’s hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you\nreally haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you’re\nsupposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But\nthey’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done any of those in class, I only\nknow about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .”\n“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut up for a bit,\nplease? I’m trying to concentrate.”\nBut all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry’s brain\nfilled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem to allow room for\nconcentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy\nand Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but dragons had no hair . . . pepper breath . . .\nthat would probably increase a dragon’s firepower . . . horn tongue . . . just\nwhat he needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .\n“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?” said\nHermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the\npair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books.\n“Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the common room . . . his fan club’ll be\nhere in a moment, twittering away. . . .”\nAnd sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them,\none of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.\nHarry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he\nseriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.\nBut as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about\nwhat leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only\nplace he had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed he must have been happy\nwith his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that.\nSomehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon\nthan back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel\nslightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn’t\nworking too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory\nleaving the Hufflepuff table.\nCedric still didn’t know about the dragons . . . the only champion who\ndidn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have\ntold Fleur and Krum. . . ."

He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn’t want to talk to\nCedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita\nSkeeter’s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a\ndistance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave\nHarry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and\ntook careful aim.\n“Diffindo!”\nCedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the\nfloor. Several bottles of ink smashed.\n“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down\nto help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . . .”\nThis was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back\ninto his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their\nclassroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but\nhimself and Cedric.\n“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration\nthat was now splattered with ink. “My bag just split . . . brand-new and\nall . . .”\n“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”\n“What?” said Cedric, looking up.\n“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came\nout to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four, one for each of us, and\nwe’ve got to get past them.”\nCedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been feeling since\nSaturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.\n“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.\n“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”\n“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .”\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if\nhe told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will\nknow by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.”\nCedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books,\nhis ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a\npuzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.\n“Why are you telling me?” he asked.\nHarry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked\nthat if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t have let his worst\nenemy face those monsters unprepared — well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape . . ."

He turned around and saw Mad-\nEye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.\n“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.”\nHarry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?\n“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology —”\n“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .”\nHarry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now.\nWhat if Moody wanted to know how he’d found out about the dragons?\nWould Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into\na ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry\nthought dully, he’d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty\nfeet . . .\nHe followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them\nand turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the\nnormal one.\n“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said quietly.\nHarry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had expected at\nall.\n“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.\nHe had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor\nLockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of\nProfessor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely\nto come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had\nprocured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a\nnumber of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in\nthe days when he had been an Auror.\nOn his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top;\nHarry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself,\nthough it was much smaller than Moody’s. In the corner on a small table stood\nan object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial.\nIt was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry\non the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving\naround inside it, none of them clearly in focus.\n“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was watching Harry\nclosely.\n“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.\n“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies . . . no use\nhere, of course, too much interference — students in every direction lying\nabout why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got\nhere. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s\nextra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be\npicking up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl."

I’m not\nreally in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s when I open my\ntrunk.”\nHe let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the\nwindow. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there,\nuntil Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to earth.\n“So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?”\nHarry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he hadn’t told Cedric, and\nhe certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\n“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg\nwith a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and\nalways has been.”\n“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort of accident that I\nfound out.”\nMoody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling\nDumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can\nbet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have told their champions\neverything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore.\nThey’d like to prove he’s only human.”\nMoody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so\nfast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.\n“So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon yet?” said\nMoody.\n“No,” said Harry.\n“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t show\nfavoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general advice. And the\nfirst bit is — play to your strengths.”\n“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say you’ve got\nthem. Think now. What are you best at?”\nHarry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really\n—\n“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help —”\n“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely\nmoving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve heard.”\n“Yeah, but . . .” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only\ngot my wand —”\n“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting him,\n“is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.”\nHarry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\n“Come on, boy . . .” whispered Moody. “Put them together . . . it’s not that\ndifficult. . . .”\nAnd it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the\nair. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed —"

And for his Firebolt, he needed —\n“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into the greenhouse three\nminutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her.\n“Hermione — I need you to help me.”\n“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her\neyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was\npruning.\n“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by\ntomorrow afternoon.”\nAnd so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a free\nclassroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly\nacross the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and\nquills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like stones to\nthe floor.\n“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .”\n“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A great big\ndragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try\nagain. . . .”\nHe wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused\npoint-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying\nwithout her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney,\nwho spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with\nrelation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great\ndanger of sudden, violent deaths.\n“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him,\n“just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.”\nRon looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly\ncaught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too\nresentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract\nsmall objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make\na fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure that was his\nprowess at Summoning Charms — perhaps the fly was just stupid.\nHe forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty\nclassroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers.\nThey kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but\nPeeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at\nhim, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a\nhurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor\ncommon room, which was now mercifully empty.\nAt two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded\nby heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of\nGobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really\ngot the hang of the Summoning Charm.\n“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking\nexhausted but very pleased.\n“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry"

Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. “Accio\nDictionary!”\nThe heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and\nHarry caught it.\n“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.\n“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s going to be\nmuch farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m\ngoing to be out there on the grounds. . . .”\n“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly. “Just as long as you’re\nconcentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some\nsleep . . . you’re going to need it.”\nHarry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that\nevening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure,\nhowever, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of\ngreat tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the\nstudents time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they\ndidn’t yet know what they would find there.\nHarry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were\nwishing him good luck or hissing “We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter” as he\npassed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he\nmightn’t just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and\nstart trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar\nfashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed\nto be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking\ninto lunch . . . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-\nfree hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great\nHall. Lots of people were watching.\n“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . . You\nhave to get ready for your first task.”\n“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a\nclatter.\n“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!”\n“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.\nHe left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t seem herself\neither; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him\ndown the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her\nhand on his shoulder.\n“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve got wizards\nstanding by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing\nis just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . .

Good\nluck.”\n“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of\nthe tent. Harry went inside.\nFleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool. She didn’t\nlook nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum\nlooked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing\nnerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave\nhim a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face\nworking rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.\n“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him. “Come in,\ncome in, make yourself at home!”\nBagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing\namid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\n“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman brightly.\n“When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering each of you this\nbag” — he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them — “from\nwhich you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face!\nThere are different — er — varieties, you see. And I have to tell you\nsomething else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task is to collect the golden egg!”\nHarry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he\nunderstood Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he\nlooked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t reacted at all. Perhaps\nthey thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was\ncertainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. . . .\nAnd in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be\nheard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . .\nHarry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species.\nAnd then — it seemed like about a second later to Harry — Bagman was\nopening the neck of the purple silk sack.\n“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\nShe put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of\na dragon — a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck. And\nHarry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a\ndetermined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her\nwhat was coming.\nThe same held true for Krum.

He didn’t even blink, just sat back down\nand stared at the ground.\nCedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish\nShort-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left,\nHarry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail,\nand the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared\nits minuscule fangs.\n“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the dragon\nyou will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on\nthe dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have to leave you in a moment,\nbecause I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you’re first, just go out into the\nenclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a\nquick word? Outside?”\n“Er . . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent\nwith Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then\nturned to him with a fatherly expression on his face.\n“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”\n“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”\n“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “Because I\ndon’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know. I mean,”\nBagman continued, lowering his voice still further, “you’re the underdog here,\nHarry. . . . Anything I can do to help . . .”\n“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, “no — I — I\nknow what I’m going to do, thanks.”\n“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.\n“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and\nwondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve got a plan worked out, I\n—”\nA whistle had blown somewhere.\n“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.\nHarry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener\nthan ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came\nout of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.\nHarry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they heard the\nroar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now\nface-to-face with the living counterpart of his model. . . .\nIt was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and\nlistening.

He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of\nthe tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.\nThe same process started again. . . . “Oh I’m not sure that was wise!” they\ncould hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly!

He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out\nthrough the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him.\nAnd now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.\nHe saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored\ndream.

The crowd was making a great deal of noise,\nbut whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It was time to do what\nhe had to do . . . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing\nthat was his only chance. . . .\nHe raised his wand.\n“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted.\nHarry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t\nworked . . . if it wasn’t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at everything\naround him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat\nhaze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim\nstrangely. . . .\nAnd then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and\nsaw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring\ninto the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to\nmount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . .

He was back where he belonged. . . .\nThis was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just another\nQuidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team. . . .\nHe looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming\nagainst its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon’s front\nlegs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics . . . let’s go. . . .”\nHe dived.

The trick was to do it carefully, gradually. . . .\nHe began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her\nbreathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she\nkept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of\nthose vertical pupils, her fangs bared. . . .\nHe flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck now stretched\nto its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer. . . .\nHarry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was\nlike a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he\nwas too high to reach now. . . .

Before the dragon knew\nwhat he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the\nground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed\nfront legs — he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the\ngolden egg —\nAnd with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the\nstands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though\nsomebody had just turned the volume back up — for the first time, he became\nproperly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding\nas loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup —\n“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that!

The tent was\ndivided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas,\nbut Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam\nPomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year\ndementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school\nnext? You’re very lucky . . . this is quite shallow . . . it’ll need cleaning before I\nheal it up, though. . . .”\nShe cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and\nstung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.\n“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you can go and get your\nscore.”\nShe bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, “How\ndoes it feel now, Diggory?”\nHarry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his\nfeet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the\nmouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — Hermione, followed\nclosely by Ron.\n“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail\nmarks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. “You were amazing!\nYou really were!”\nBut Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as\nthough he were a ghost.\n“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet — I"

Harry knew Ron was about to apologize\nand suddenly he found he didn’t need to hear it.\n“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out. “Forget it.”\n“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve —”\n“Forget it,” Harry said.\nRon grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.\nHermione burst into tears.\n“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her, bewildered.\n“You two are so stupid!” she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears\nsplashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had\ngiven both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.\n“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry, c’mon, they’ll be\nputting up your scores. . . .”\nPicking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he\nwould have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron\nby his side, talking fast.\n“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing\nwhere he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned it into a dog . . . he\nwas trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a\npretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the\negg, but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway\nthrough and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just\ngot away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to\nput it into a trance — well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but\nthen it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire —\nshe put it out with a bit of water out of her wand.

Only thing is, it\nwent trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took\nmarks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any damage to them.”\nRon drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now\nthat the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges\nwere sitting — right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.\n“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry, squinting up\nthe field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.\nWhat looked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a"

He shot a number nine into the air.\n“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.\nNext, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder\nthan ever.\nLudo Bagman — ten.\n“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But . . . I got hurt. . . . What’s he playing\nat?”\n“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.\nAnd now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a\nnumber shot out of his wand too — four.\n“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy, biased scumbag, you\ngave Krum ten!”\nBut Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if Karkaroff had given him\nzero; Ron’s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to\nhim. He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he\nturned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn’t just Ron . . . those weren’t only\nGryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had\nseen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as\nCedric’s. . . . He didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they\nthrew at him now.\n“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said Charlie Weasley,\nhurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school. “Listen, I’ve got\nto run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I’d tell her what\nhappened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah — and they told me to tell\nyou you’ve got to hang around for a few more minutes. . . . Bagman wants a\nword, back in the champions’ tent.”\nRon said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow\nlooked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how\nhe’d felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before\nhe’d walked out to face it. . . . There was no comparison; the wait had been\nimmeasurably worse.\nFleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric’s face was\ncovered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He\ngrinned at Harry when he saw him.\n“Good one, Harry.”\n“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.\n“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and\nlooking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. “Now,\njust a quick few words. You’ve got a nice long break before the second task,\nwhich will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty-\nfourth — but we’re giving you something to think about in the meantime!

If\nyou look down at those golden eggs you’re all holding, you will see that they\nopen . . . see the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the egg —\nbecause it will tell you what the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it!\nAll clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!”\nHarry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the\nedge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other\nchampions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees\nbehind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from\nbehind them.\nIt was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-\nQuotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.\n“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I wonder if you could\ngive me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now,\nabout the fairness of the scoring?”\n“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely. “Good-bye.”\nAnd he set off back to the castle with Ron.\n— T W E N T Y - O N E —\nTHE HOUSE-ELF\nLIBERATION FRONT\nH\narry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to\nfind Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling\nhim that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry\nfilled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though\nshocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time\nthey entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it\nall along.\n“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about\nhis dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each\nother. They were probably running around in masks together at the World\nCup. . . . I’ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put\nyour name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn’t he?\nDidn’t work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here — I’ll do it —”\nPigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around\nand around Harry’s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out\nof the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.\n“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how\ncould they be?” Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. “You\nknow what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I’m serious.”\nHarry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of\nthe last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however,\nleaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.\n“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,” she said"

Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve\nfeet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his\nleg was much longer and heavier than usual — Harry hadn’t been able to resist\ngiving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled,\nand dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the\ndarkness, and then Ron said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your\nsurprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food\nfrom the kitchens by now.”\nSure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded\nwith cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of\npumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some\nFilibuster’s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean\nThomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new\nbanners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head\non his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.\nHarry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to\nfeel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t\nbelieve how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he’d gotten through\nthe first task, and he wouldn’t have to face the second one for three months.\n“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which\nHarry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. “Open it, Harry, go\non! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”\n“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.\n“It’s in the tournament rules. . . .”\n“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,”\nHarry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather\nguiltily.\n“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.\nLee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that\nran all the way around it and prised it open.\nIt was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry opened it,\nthe most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The\nnearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly\nHeadless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.\n“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.\n“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry\nslammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee. . . .

Maybe you’ve got to get\npast one of those next, Harry!”\n“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone very white and\nspilled sausage rolls all over the floor. “You’re going to have to fight the\nCruciatus Curse!”\n“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George. “They wouldn’t use\nthe Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy\nsinging . . . maybe you’ve got to attack him while he’s in the shower, Harry.”\n“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.\nHermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.\n“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to them. It’s the custard\ncreams you’ve got to watch —”\nNeville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out.\nFred laughed.\n“Just my little joke, Neville. . . .”\nHermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get all this from the\nkitchens, Fred?”\n“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and\nimitated a house-elf. “‘Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!’ They’re\ndead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.”\n“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of\nvoice.\n“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just\ntickle the pear, and it giggles and —” He stopped and looked suspiciously at\nher. “Why?”\n“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.\n“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?” said\nGeorge. “Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into\nrebellion?”\nSeveral people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.\n“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to take clothes\nand salaries!” said Fred warningly. “You’ll put them off their cooking!”\nJust then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.\n“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the laughter. “I forgot — it\nwas the custard creams we hexed —”\nWithin a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had\nfallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.\n“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. “George and I\ninvented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!”\nIt was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the\ndormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains\nof his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on\nthe table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes.\nReally, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed,\nHagrid had a point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .\nThe start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts.

Drafty though the\ncastle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every\ntime he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the\nhigh winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the\nBeauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was\nkeeping Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink of\nsingle-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their\npaddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-\nheaded. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and\nneeded their wits about them.\n“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid told the shivering\nclass in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. “Thought we’d jus’ try an’ see if\nthey fancied a kip . . . we’ll jus’ settle ’em down in these boxes. . . .”\nThere were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one\nanother had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now\napproaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful,\nscuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined\nto make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class\nlooked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined\nwith pillows and fluffy blankets.\n“We’ll jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the lids on, and we’ll see\nwhat happens.”\nBut the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate\nbeing forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling,\n“Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts rampaged around the\npumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most\nof the class — Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into\nHagrid’s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry,\nRon, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying\nto help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the\nskrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one\nskrewt was left.\n“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their\nwands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing\nmenacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. “Jus’ try an’ slip\nthe rope ’round his sting, so he won’ hurt any o’ the others!”\n“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry\nbacked into the wall of Hagrid’s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their\nsparks.\n“Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.”\nRita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid’s garden fence, looking in at the\nmayhem.

She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar\ntoday, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.\nHagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering\nHarry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the\npumpkin plants nearby.\n“Who’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope\naround the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.\n“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied, beaming at him. Her\ngold teeth glinted.\n“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside the school anymore,”\nsaid Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and\nstarted tugging it over to its fellows.\nRita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid had said.\n“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she asked, beaming still more\nwidely.\n“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.\n“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. “I’ve never heard of\nthem before . . . where do they come from?”\nHarry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid’s wild black beard,\nand his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who\nseemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, “They’re very interesting,\naren’t they? Aren’t they, Harry?”\n“What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,” said Harry as she stepped on his\nfoot.\n“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. “So you\nlike Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?”\n“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.\n“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching long?” she added to\nHagrid.\nHarry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one\ncheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing\nseveral burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class\nstood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.\n“This is on’y me second year,” said Hagrid.\n“Lovely . . . I don’t suppose you’d like to give an interview, would you?\nShare some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a\nzoological column every Wednesday, as I’m sure you know. We could feature\nthese — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”\n“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er — yeah, why not?”\nHarry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of\ncommunicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand\nand watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in\nthe Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell\nrang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.\n“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off"

They looked at one another — it was exactly the sort of\nthing Hagrid might do.\n“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore’s never sacked\nhim,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get\nrid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.”\nHarry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off\nto lunch.\nHarry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still\ndoing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once\nmore, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had\nbeen so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their\nown horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her\nexplanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\n“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her\nobvious annoyance, “that some of us” — she stared very meaningfully at Harry\n— “might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my\ncrystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to\nconsult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed\ninto its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?”\n“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered under his breath.\nHarry fought hard to keep his face straight.\n“Death, my dears.”\nParvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking\nhorrified.\n“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, “it comes, ever\ncloser, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever lower over the\ncastle. . . .”\nShe stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.\n“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty times\nbefore,” Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath\nProfessor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped dead every time she’s told me\nI’m going to, I’d be a medical miracle.”\n“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said Ron, chortling, as they\npassed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring\nsinisterly. “At least we didn’t get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off\nProfessor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . .”\nBut Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went\nto look for her afterward.

I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back,\nshall I?”\n“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.\n“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led them down\nthrough six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\n“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.\nShe turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door\nthrough which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had\nregurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here before.\nHe and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of\nending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s\ndungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with\ntorches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.\n“Oh hang on . . .” said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. “Wait a\nminute, Hermione. . . .”\n“What?” She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.\n“I know what this is about,” said Harry.\nHe nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It\nshowed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.\n“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to rope us into that\nspew stuff again!”\n“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew, Ron —”\n“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at her. “What are we\nnow, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I’m not barging into that kitchen\nand trying to make them stop work, I’m not doing it —”\n“I’m not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I came down here just\nnow, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come on, Harry, I want to show\nyou!”"

It began to\nsquirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle.\nHermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back,\nforcing him inside.\nHe had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the\nGreat Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped\naround the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when\nsomething small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing,\n“Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!”\nNext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf\nhit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would\nbreak.\n“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.\n“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.\n“Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter\nhas come to see him, sir!”\nDobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his\nenormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness.\nHe looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose,\nthe batlike ears, the long fingers and feet — all except the clothes, which were\nvery different.\nWhen Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same\nfilthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment\nof garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing\nhimself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a\nhat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with\nhorseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children’s soccer shorts,\nand odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed\nfrom his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting\nDobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\n“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in amazement.\n“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby squealed excitedly.\n“Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!”\n“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”\n“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled him off\ninto the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of\nthese tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath\nthe four House tables above, in the Great Hall.

Unlike Dobby, she had obviously\nnot foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a\nmatching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while\nevery one of Dobby’s strange collection of garments was so clean and well\ncared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care of her\nclothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her\nskirt.\n“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.\nWinky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her\ngreat brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the\nQuidditch World Cup.\n“Oh dear,” said Hermione.

Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at\nHarry.\n“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked loudly, over Winky’s\nsobs.\n“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.\nInstantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a\nlarge silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a\nmilk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.\n“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him,\nbut the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\n“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked as Dobby handed\naround the tea.\n“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily. “Dobby came to see\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who\nhas been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed —”\nAt this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose\ndribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.\n“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find\nwork!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby hasn’t found work, sir, because Dobby\nwants paying now!”\nThe house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and\nwatching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had\nsaid something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, “Good for\nyou, Dobby!”\n“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. “But most wizards\ndoesn’t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. ‘That’s not the point of a\nhouse-elf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby’s face!

Dobby likes\nwork, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . .\nDobby likes being free!”\nThe Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as\nthough he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained\nwhere she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her\ncrying.\n“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky\nhas been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.\nAt this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the\nflagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with\nmisery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to\ncomfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby\ncontinued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky’s screeches.\n“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! ‘Why doesn’t Dobby and\nWinky find work together?’ Dobby says. ‘Where is there enough work for two\nhouse-elves?’ says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir!\nHogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and\nProfessor Dumbledore took us on!”\nDobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.\n“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants\npaying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and\none day off a month!”\n“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over\nWinky’s continued screaming and fist-beating.\n“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends\noff,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so\nmuch leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat him down,\nmiss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn’t wanting too much, miss, he\nlikes work better.”\n“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?” Hermione\nasked kindly.\nIf she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken.\nWinky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione\nthrough her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly\nfurious.\n“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she squeaked.\n“Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!”\n“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky, come on! It’s Mr.\nCrouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn’t do anything wrong, he\nwas really horrible to you —”\nBut at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat,\nflattening her ears so that she couldn’t hear a word, and screeched, “You is not\ninsulting my master, miss!

We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We\nupholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks ill of them — though\nProfessor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor\nDumbledore said we is free to — to —”\nDobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent\nforward. Dobby whispered, “He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old\ncodger if we likes, sir!”\nDobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.\n“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking normally\nagain, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. “Dobby likes Professor\nDumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence\nfor him.”\n“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry asked him,\ngrinning.\nA slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense eyes.\n“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He squared his small\nshoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were\n— bad Dark wizards!”\nDobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own\ndaring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head\non it very hard, squealing, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”\nHarry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the\ntable.\n“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his\nhead.\n“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.\n“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to be ashamed of\nyourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!”\n“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly. “Dobby\ndoesn’t care what they think anymore!”\n“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face\nonce more. “My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is\nneeding me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life,\nand my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before\nher . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed?

A very bad wizard! My master isn’t liking\nhim, oh no, not at all!”\n“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.\n“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously. “My master is telling\nWinky some things! But Winky is not saying . . . Winky — Winky keeps her\nmaster’s secrets. . . .”\nShe dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt,\n“Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!”\nThey couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her\ncrying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a\nfree elf and his plans for his wages.\n“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!” he said happily,\npointing at his bare chest.\n“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking\nto the elf, “I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get\none from her. You don’t mind maroon, do you?”\nDobby was delighted.\n“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told him, “but it’ll go\nwell with your tea cozy.”\nAs they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed\nin upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a\npained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and\nRon loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.\n“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the\ndoor to say good night. “See you, Dobby!”\n“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?” Dobby\nasked tentatively.\n“’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.\n“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the\nkitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. “All\nthese years I’ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from\nthe kitchens — well, it’s not exactly difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it\naway!”\n“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you\nknow,” said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. “Dobby\ncoming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being\nfree, and slowly it’ll dawn on them that they want that too!”\n“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said Harry."

Weasley! Will you pay attention?”\nProfessor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a whip through\nthe Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and\nlooked up.\nIt was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl\nthey had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on\nProfessor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still had feathers); they had copied\ndown their homework from the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways\nin which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species\nSwitches”). The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who\nhad been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s fake wands\nat the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a\nrubber haddock.\n“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,” said\nProfessor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of\nHarry’s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor — Ron’s parrot’s beak\nhad severed it moments before — “I have something to say to you all.\n“The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of the Triwizard\nTournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests.\nNow, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above — although you\nmay invite a younger student if you wish —”\nLavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the\nribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both\nlooked around at Harry.

Now then —”\nProfessor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.\n“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair\ndown,” she said, in a disapproving voice.\nLavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her\nmouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor\nMcGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let\nher hair down in any sense.\n“But that does NOT mean,” Professor McGonagall went on, “that we will\nbe relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will\nbe most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in\nany way.”\nThe bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed\ntheir bags and swung them onto their shoulders.\nProfessor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter — a word, if you\nplease.”\nAssuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock,\nHarry proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk. Professor McGonagall waited\nuntil the rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the champions and\ntheir partners —”\n“What partners?” said Harry.\nProfessor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he\nwas trying to be funny.\n“Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,” she said coldly. “Your dance\npartners.”\nHarry’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.\n“Dance partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he said\nquickly.\n“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s what I’m\ntelling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”\nHarry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails,\naccompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to\nUncle Vernon’s work parties.\n“I’m not dancing,” he said.\n“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a Hogwarts\nchampion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the\nschool. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”\n“But — I don’t —”\n“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of\nway.\nA week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a\ncinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done\nthe latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought\nhe’d rather have another round with the dragon.\nHarry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at\nHogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was\nusually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the\nminority before now.

This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and\nabove seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with\nthe coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many\ngirls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that\nbefore. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with\nlaughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they\nwere going to wear on Christmas night. . . .\n“Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so\ngirls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. “How’re you supposed\nto get one on their own to ask them?”\n“Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re going to try?”\nHarry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he’d like to ask, but\nworking up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he\nwas; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was\nalso very popular.\nRon seemed to know what was going on inside Harry’s head.\n“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a champion. You’ve\njust beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they’ll be queuing up to go with you.”\nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness\nin his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry’s amazement, he turned\nout to be quite right.\nA curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken\nin his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so\ntaken aback he said no before he’d even stopped to consider the matter. The\ngirl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s,\nand Ron’s taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day,\ntwo more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who\nlooked as though she might knock him out if he refused.\n“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after he’d stopped laughing.\n“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still unnerved. “Imagine what\nI’d look like trying to dance with her.”\nHermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to him. “They only like\nhim because he’s famous!” Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who\nhad asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with\nhim if he hadn’t been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would\nbother him if Cho asked him.\nOn the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect\nof opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got\nthrough the first task. He wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in\nthe corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he\nhad an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in\ngratitude for Harry’s tip-off about the dragons.

To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with\nthe skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today,\nsitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to\ntempt the skrewts.\n“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,” Hagrid continued in a low\nvoice. “Well, I told her we’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the\nDursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four years?’ she said. ‘Never played you\nup in lessons, has he?’ I told her no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d\nthink she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.”\n“’Course she did,” said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large\nmetal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. “She can’t keep writing\nabout what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring.”\n“She wants a new angle, Hagrid,” said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander\neggs. “You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!”\n“But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.\n“She should’ve interviewed Snape,” said Harry grimly. “He’d give her the\ngoods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at\nthis school. . . .’”\n“Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. “Well,\nyeh might’ve bent a few rules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all righ’ really, aren’ you?”\n“Cheers, Hagrid,” said Harry, grinning.\n“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?” said Ron.\n“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Should be a\ngood do, I reckon.

Hagrid didn’t\npursue the subject.\nThe last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed.\nRumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn’t\nbelieve half of them — for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight\nhundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta.

Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing\nwould ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his\nnotes on goblin rebellions — as Binns hadn’t let his own death stand in the\nway of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn’t\ngoing to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and\nvicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy’s cauldron-bottom report.\nProfessors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last\nsecond of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them\nplay games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he\ninformed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the\nlast lesson of the term.\n“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.\n“Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a\nwhole load of studying.”\n“Mmm . . . you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?” said\nHermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy\nbuilding a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack — a much more\ninteresting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the\nwhole thing would blow up at any second.\n“It’s Christmas, Hermione,” said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with\nthe Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.\nHermione looked severely over at him too. “I’d have thought you’d be\ndoing something constructive, Harry, even if you don’t want to learn your\nantidotes!”\n“Like what?” Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a\nBludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.\n“That egg!” Hermione hissed.\n“Come on, Hermione, I’ve got till February the twenty-fourth,” Harry said.\nHe had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn’t opened it since\nthe celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months\nto go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.\n“But it might take weeks to work it out!” said Hermione. “You’re going to\nlook a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!”\n“Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a break,” said Ron, and he\nplaced the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up,\nsingeing his eyebrows.\n“Nice look, Ron . . . go well with your dress robes, that will.”\nIt was Fred and George.

We don’t\nwant to end up with a pair of trolls.”\nHermione let out a sputter of indignation.\n“A pair of . . . what, excuse me?”\n“Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I’d rather go alone than with —\nwith Eloise Midgen, say.”\n“Her acne’s loads better lately — and she’s really nice!”\n“Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.\n“Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going to take the\nbest-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?”\n“Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.\n“I’m going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls’\nstaircase without another word.\nThe Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors\nfrom Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at\nits best this Christmas.

Everlasting\nicicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual\ntwelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from\nluminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor\nhad all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was\nquite something to hear “O Come, All Ye Faithful” sung by an empty helmet\nthat only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract\nPeeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps\nin the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.\nAnd still, Harry hadn’t asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very\nnervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid\nthan he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to be starting the\ndancing with the other champions.\n“I suppose there’s always Moaning Myrtle,” he said gloomily, referring to\nthe ghost who haunted the girls’ toilets on the second floor.\n“Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,” said Ron on Friday\nmorning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an\nimpregnable fortress. “When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll\nboth have partners — agreed?”\n“Er . . . okay,” said Harry.\nBut every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break, and then\nlunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic — she was surrounded\nby friends. Didn’t she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her\nas she was going into a bathroom? But no — she even seemed to go there with\nan escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound to have\nbeen asked by somebody else.\nHe found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and consequently\nforgot to add the key ingredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received\nbottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his\ncourage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag,\nand hurried to the dungeon door.\n“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off\nupstairs.\nHe’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. . . . He hurried\noff through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he\nhad expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts\nlesson.\n“Er — Cho? Could I have a word with you?”\nGiggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls\naround Cho started doing it. She didn’t, though. She said, “Okay,” and\nfollowed him out of earshot of her classmates.\nHarry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he\nhad missed a step going downstairs.\n“Er,” he said.\nHe couldn’t ask her. He couldn’t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking\npuzzled, watching him.\nThe words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.\n“Wangoballwime?”\n“Sorry?” said Cho."

Why did he\nhave to go red now? Why?\n“Oh!” said Cho, and she went red too. “Oh Harry, I’m really sorry,” and\nshe truly looked it. “I’ve already said I’ll go with someone else.”\n“Oh,” said Harry.\nIt was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but\nsuddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.\n“Oh okay,” he said, “no problem.”\n“I’m really sorry,” she said again.\n“That’s okay,” said Harry.\nThey stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, “Well —”\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\n“Well, ’bye,” said Cho, still very red. She walked away.\nHarry called after her, before he could stop himself.\n“Who’re you going with?”\n“Oh — Cedric,” she said. “Cedric Diggory.”\n“Oh right,” said Harry.\nHis insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with\nlead in their absence.\nCompletely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to\nGryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.\n“Cedric — Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric —\nprepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and\nwas handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favorite champion. Now he\nsuddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn’t have\nenough brains to fill an eggcup.\n“Fairy lights,” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the password had been\nchanged the previous day.\n“Yes, indeed, dear!” she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she\nswung forward to admit him.\nEntering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he\nsaw Ron sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him,\ntalking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.\n“What’s up, Ron?” said Harry, joining them.\nRon looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.\n“Why did I do it?” he said wildly. “I don’t know what made me do it!”\n“What?” said Harry.\n“He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,” said\nGinny. She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept\npatting Ron’s arm sympathetically.\n“You what?” said Harry.\n“I don’t know what made me do it!” Ron gasped again. “What was I playing\nat? There were people — all around — I’ve gone mad — everyone watching! I\nwas just walking past her in the entrance hall — she was standing there talking\nto Diggory — and it sort of came over me — and I asked her!”\nRon moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the\nwords were barely distinguishable.\n“She looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn’t even answer."

Hey — guess who he asked? Hermione!”\n“What?” said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.\n“Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he\nstarted to laugh. “He told me after Potions! Said she’s always been really nice,\nhelping him out with work and stuff — but she told him she was already\ngoing with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn’t want to go with Neville . . . I\nmean, who would?”\n“Don’t!” said Ginny, annoyed. “Don’t laugh —”\nJust then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.\n“Why weren’t you two at dinner?” she said, coming over to join them.\n“Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because they’ve both just been\nturned down by girls they asked to the ball!” said Ginny.\nThat shut Harry and Ron up.\n“Thanks a bunch, Ginny,” said Ron sourly.\n“All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?” said Hermione loftily. “Eloise\nMidgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find\nsomeone somewhere who’ll have you.”\nBut Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole\nnew light.\n“Hermione, Neville’s right — you are a girl. . . .”\n“Oh well spotted,” she said acidly.\n“Well — you can come with one of us!”\n“No, I can’t,” snapped Hermione.\n“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look\nreally stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has . . .”\n“I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing, “because I’m\nalready going with someone.”\n“No, you’re not!” said Ron. “You just said that to get rid of Neville!”\n“Oh did I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. “Just because\nit’s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted\nI’m a girl!”\nRon stared at her. Then he grinned again.\n“Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl,” he said. “That do? Will you come\nnow?”\n“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily. “I’m going with\nsomeone else!”\nAnd she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories again.\n“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.\n“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly."

He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought . . . well . . . I’m\nnot going to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth year.” She looked\nextremely miserable. “I think I’ll go and have dinner,” she said, and she got up\nand walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.\nRon goggled at Harry.\n“What’s got into them?” he demanded.\nBut Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait\nhole. The time had come for drastic action.\n“Wait here,” he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati,\nand said, “Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?”\nParvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his\nfingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.\n“Yes, all right then,” she said finally, blushing furiously.\n“Thanks,” said Harry, in relief. “Lavender — will you go with Ron?”\n“She’s going with Seamus,” said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder\nthan ever.\nHarry sighed.\n“Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?” he said, lowering his voice\nso that Ron wouldn’t hear.\n“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.\n“She’s going with someone else.”\nParvati looked astonished.\n“Ooooh — who?” she said keenly.\nHarry shrugged. “No idea,” he said. “So what about Ron?”\n“Well . . .” said Parvati slowly, “I suppose my sister might . . . Padma, you\nknow . . . in Ravenclaw. I’ll ask her if you like.”\n“Yeah, that would be great,” said Harry. “Let me know, will you?”\nAnd he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble\nthan it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead\ncenter.\n— T W E N T Y - T H R E E —\nTHE YULE BALL\nD\nespite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had\nbeen given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when\nterm ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as\nfully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less\ncrowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as\nits inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.

Before\nlong, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else\noffered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed\nin the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now\nworking on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to\naccept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn’t\nforgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.\nSnow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue\nBeauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the\niced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship’s\nportholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves\ndown in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming\nstews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find\nanything to complain about.\n“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as\nthey left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry,\nkeen not to be spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit into my dress robes!”\n“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the\nentrance hall. “She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”\n“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.\nHe kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response\nby asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned\nand said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”\n“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them. “You’re not telling me\nsomeone’s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?”\nHarry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving to\nsomebody over Malfoy’s shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”\nMalfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for Moody,\nbut he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.\n“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and\nshe, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.\n“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, “your\nteeth . . .”\n“What about them?” she said.\n“Well, they’re different . . . I’ve just noticed. . . .”\n“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave\nme?”\n“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before he put that hex on\nyou. . . . They’re all . . . straight and — and normal-sized.”\nHermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It\nwas a very different smile from the one he remembered.\n“Well . . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held\nup a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they\nnormally were,” she said. “And I just . . . let her carry on a bit.” She smiled"

I’ve been trying to\npersuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on\nwith my braces. You know, they’re dentists, they just don’t think teeth and\nmagic should — look! Pigwidgeon’s back!”\nRon’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters,\na scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and\nlaughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, “Oh look at the\nweeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”\n“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching\nup Pigwidgeon. “You bring letters to the addressee! You don’t hang around\nshowing off!”\nPigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron’s fist. The third-\nyear girls all looked very shocked.\n“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who\nhooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. “Here — take it,\nHarry,” Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away\nlooking scandalized. He pulled Sirius’s reply off Pigwidgeon’s leg, Harry\npocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.\nEveryone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more\nholiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and\nHermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually\nfilling up with snow, and Harry read out:\nDear Harry,\nCongratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in\nthat goblet shouldn’t be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest a\nConjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point — “That’s what\nKrum did!” Hermione whispered — but your way was better, I’m\nimpressed.\nDon’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done one task; whoever\nput you in for the tournament’s got plenty more opportunity if they’re trying to\nhurt you. Keep your eyes open — particularly when the person we discussed is\naround — and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.\nKeep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.\n“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away\nagain inside his robes. “‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d think I walk around with\nmy eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . .”\n“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still got two tasks to do.\nYou really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out\nwhat it means. . . .”\n“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a game of chess, Harry?”\n“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione’s face, he\nsaid, “Come on, how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on?"

Wondering what had caused\nhis abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something\nwith very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close\nthey were almost nose to nose.\n“Dobby!” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell\nout of bed. “Don’t do that!”\n“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with\nhis long fingers over his mouth. “Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter\n‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby\ncould come and see him sometimes, sir!”\n“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his\nheart rate returned to normal. “Just — just prod me or something in future, all\nright, don’t bend over me like that. . . .”\nHarry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses from\nhis bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean,\nand Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings,\nheavy-eyed and tousle-haired.\n“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked sleepily.\n“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to sleep.”\n“Nah . . . presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his\nbed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as\nwell get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who\nwas now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he\nhad upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his\ntea cozy.\n“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he squeaked tentatively.\n“’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er . . . I’ve got something for you too.”\nIt was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly\nopened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks.\nThey were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to\nUncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been\nusing them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the\nSneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, “Sorry, I forgot to wrap\nthem. . . .”\nBut Dobby was utterly delighted.\n“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he said, ripping off his\nodd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon’s. “I has seven now, sir. . . .

And here’s your sweater.”\nHe threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the\nhand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite\noverwhelmed.\n“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing\ndeeply to Ron. “Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry\nPotter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous\nof spirit, as noble, as selfless —”\n“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears,\nthough he looked rather pleased all the same. “Wow, Harry —” He had just\nopened Harry’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. “Cool!” He jammed it onto\nhis head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.\nDobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be —\nsocks.\n“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily. “He is buying the\nwool out of his wages, sir!”\nThe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the\nright sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.\n“They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he\npulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.\n“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the\nkitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye\nto Ron and the others as he passed.\nHarry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd socks\n— with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a single\ntissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering the\nTon-Tongue Toffee.

They spent most of the morning in\nGryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned\nto the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred\nturkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding\nCrackers.\nThey went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched\nexcept for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons\nstudents on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the\nWeasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o’clock said she was\ngoing back upstairs to get ready for the ball.\n“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at her incredulously and\npaying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by\nGeorge, hit him hard on the side of the head. “Who’re you going with?” he\nyelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps\ninto the castle.\nThere was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven\no’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their\nsnowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was\nsitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them\nextremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her\npicture.\n“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the password, and\nshe swung forward to let them inside.\nHarry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in\ntheir dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as\nRon, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled\nlook on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes\nlooked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make\nthem look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It\nworked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn’t done a\nvery neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off\ndownstairs.\n“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,”\nmuttered Dean.\n“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his\ncuffs.\nThe common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors\ninstead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of\nthe stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her\nlong dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists.\nHarry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.\n“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.\n“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she\nadded to Ron.\n“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s Hermione?”\nParvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”\n“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.

Fred\nwinked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.\nThe entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting\nfor eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open.\nThose people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging\nthrough the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma,\nand led her over to Harry and Ron.\n“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of\nbright turquoise. She didn’t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a\npartner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his\ndress robes as she looked him up and down.\n“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. “Oh\nno . . .”\nHe bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour\nwas passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied\nby the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, Roger Davies. When they had\ndisappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\n“Where is Hermione?” he said again.\nA group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room.\nMalfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high\ncollar, which in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson\nin very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy’s arm. Crabbe and Goyle\nwere both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither\nof them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.\nThe oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the\nDurmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front\nof the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn’t know.\nOver their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had\nbeen transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights — meaning hundreds\nof actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured\nthere, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas\nand his reindeer.\nThen Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over here, please!”\nParvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See you in a\nminute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting\nto let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of\nred tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of\nher hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went\ninside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the\nstudents had sat down.

Cedric and Cho\nwere close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn’t have to talk\nto them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.\nIt was Hermione.\nBut she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her\nhair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an\nelegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty,\nperiwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow —\nor maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had\nslung over her back. She was also smiling — rather nervously, it was true —\nbut the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever;\nHarry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t spotted it before.\n“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”\nParvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn’t the only\none either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan club from\nthe library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy\nParkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem\nto be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past\nHermione without looking at her.\nOnce everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the\nchampions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did\nso, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started\nwalking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges\nwere sitting.\nThe walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with\nhundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The\nHouse tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller,\nlantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.\nHarry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be\nenjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so\nforcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through\nits paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron\nwas watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.\nDumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but\nKarkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron’s as he watched Krum and\nHermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with\nlarge yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and\nMadame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a\nflowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr. Crouch,\nHarry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied\nby Percy Weasley.\nWhen the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out\nthe empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint\nand sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress"

Harry took the hint\nand sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress\nrobes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be\nfined.\n“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his\ntone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the\nuniverse. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant, and I’m here representing\nhim.”\n“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking forward to being\nlectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.\n“I’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all. Hasn’t been right\nsince the World Cup. Hardly surprising — overwork. He’s not as young as he\nwas — though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it\never was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then,\nMr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that\nhouse-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her\nimmediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s getting on, he needs looking\nafter, and I think he’s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she\nleft. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the\nCup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no, poor\nman, he’s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m just glad he knew he had\nsomeone he could rely upon to take his place.”\nHarry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling\nPercy “Weatherby” yet, but resisted the temptation.\nThere was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus\nwere lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and\nlooked around — there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked\ncarefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, “Pork\nchops!”\nAnd pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their\norders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt\nabout this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant\nplenty of extra work for the house-elves? — but for once, Hermione didn’t\nseem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum\nand hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.\nIt now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak\nbefore, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.\n“Vell, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am\nthinking,” he was telling Hermione. “Ve have just four floors, and the fires are\nlit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these —\nthough in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But\nin summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains —”\n“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn’t reach his cold"

Do we\nnot jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we\nnot right to be proud that we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to\nprotect them?”\n“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,”\nsaid Dumbledore amicably. “Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong\nturning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully\nproportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather\nmagnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more\nclosely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out\nfor it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only\nappear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full\nbladder.”\nHarry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could\nhave sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.\nMeanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to\nRoger Davies.\n“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls\nof the Great Hall. “At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we ’ave ice sculptures all\naround ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey\nare like ’uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is\nseemply superb. And we ’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo serenade us as we\neat. We ’ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’alls, and eef a poltergeist ever\nentaired into Beauxbatons, ’e would be expelled like zat.” She slapped her\nhand onto the table impatiently.\nRoger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and\nhe kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies\nwas too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.\n“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the\ntable in imitation of Fleur. “Like that. Yeah.”\nHarry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff\ntables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top\ntable. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame\nMaxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.\nHermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept\ncalling her “Hermy-own.”\n“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.\n“Herm-own-ninny.”\n“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and grinning."

Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables\nzoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a\nraised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several\nguitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.\nThe Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic\napplause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had\nbeen artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry,\nwho had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten\nwhat was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables\nhad gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing\nup.\n“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”\nHarry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck\nup a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor,\ncarefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see Seamus and Dean\nwaving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his\nhands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.\nIt wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly on\nthe spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the\nwatching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance\nfloor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville\nand Ginny were dancing nearby — he could see Ginny wincing frequently as\nNeville trod on her feet — and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame\nMaxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely\ntickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large.\nMad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor\nSinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.\n“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring\nthrough Harry’s robes.\n“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said Harry,\ngrinning.\n“He is so creepy!” Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. “I don’t think\nthat eye should be allowed!”\nHarry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The\nWeird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry\nlet go of Parvati at once.\n“Let’s sit down, shall we?”\n“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said as the Weird Sisters\nstruck up a new song, which was much faster.\n“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor,\npast Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exuberantly that people around\nthem were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and\nPadma were sitting."

He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were\ndancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot\njiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look\nat Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s other\nside, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by\na boy from Beauxbatons.\n“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.\n“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.\n“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from\nBeauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.\nHermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She was a bit\npink in the face from dancing.\n“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.\n“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. “Viktor’s\njust gone to get some drinks.”\nRon gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said. “Hasn’t he asked you to\ncall him Vicky yet?”\nHermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with you?” she said.\n“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not going to tell you.”\nHermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.\n“Ron, what — ?”\n“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing against Harry! Against\nHogwarts! You — you’re —” Ron was obviously casting around for words\nstrong enough to describe Hermione’s crime, “fraternizing with the enemy,\nthat’s what you’re doing!”\nHermione’s mouth fell open.\n“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The enemy! Honestly —\nwho was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the\none who wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him up in their\ndormitory?”\nRon chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to come with him while\nyou were both in the library?”\n“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more\nbrightly. “So what?”\n“What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?”\n“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said he’d been coming\nup to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to\npluck up the courage!”\nHermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the\nsame color as Parvati’s robes.\n“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.\n“And what’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows who you"

When she spoke, her\nvoice quivered.\n“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about Harry, not\none —”\nRon changed tack at the speed of light.\n“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose\nyou’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library\nsessions —”\n“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione, looking outraged.\n“Never. How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the\ntournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?”\n“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.\n“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign\nwizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione hotly.\n“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”\nPeople were starting to stare at them.\n“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with Hermione coming\nwith Krum —”\nBut Ron ignored Harry too.\n“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering where you are,” said\nRon.\n“Don’t call him Vicky!”\nHermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor,\ndisappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and\nsatisfaction on his face.\n“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma asked him.\n“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.\n“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the\nBeauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that\nHarry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.\n“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.\nKrum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.\n“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost her, have you?”\nKrum was looking surly again.\n“Vell, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said, and he slouched off.\n“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”\nPercy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely\npompous. “Excellent! That’s the whole point, you know — international\nmagical cooperation!”\nTo Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat. The top table\nwas now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout,\nLudo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were\ncutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the\nstudents, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen.

Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No, they were just telling\nme a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise\nthem on the marketing. I’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of\ncontacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke Shop. . . .”\nPercy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he\nwould be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home.\nApparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if\nthey were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry\nsomething, but Percy diverted him.\n“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr. Bagman? Our department’s\nquite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he glanced at Harry —\n“was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly\nsince, don’t you think?”\n“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been enormous fun. How’s old\nBarty doing? Shame he couldn’t come.”\n“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,” said Percy\nimportantly, “but in the meantime, I’m more than willing to take up the slack.\nOf course, it’s not all attending balls” — he laughed airily — “oh no, I’ve had\nto deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence — you\nheard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the\ncountry? And then we’ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign\nthe International Ban on Dueling.

The front doors\nstood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and\ntwinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves\nsurrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues.\nHarry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and\nthere, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of\nthe winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way\nwhen they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\n“. . . don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”\n“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” Karkaroff’s voice"

I am becoming seriously concerned, I\ncan’t deny it —”\n“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will make your excuses. I,\nhowever, am remaining at Hogwarts.”\nSnape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and\nwas blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued\nfrom many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.\n“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled as a girl ran past him.\n“And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!” as a boy went rushing after\nher. “And what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of Harry and\nRon on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to\nsee them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began\nwinding it around his finger.\n“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against the law, is it?”\n“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long\nblack cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape.\nHarry and Ron continued down the path.\n“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.\n“And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?” said Harry\nslowly.\nThey had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the\nsparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people\nwere visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then\nHarry heard Hagrid speak.\n“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.\nHarry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of scene they ought to\nwalk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw\nFleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush\nnearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them,\nmeaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur\nand Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at\nthe sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the\nshadows behind the reindeer.\n“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low\nvoice.\nHarry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to\nbe overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) — if it had been\npossible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that\nwasn’t really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling\nalong the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t interesting enough to\nblock out Hagrid’s next words."

When I was\nabou’ three. She wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well . . . it’s not in their\nnatures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I\nknow. . . .”\nMadame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took\nhis eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer’s antlers,\nlistening. . . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.\n“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny little bloke, my dad was.\nBy the time I was six I could lift him up an’ put him on top o’ the dresser if he\nannoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . .” Hagrid’s deep voice broke.\nMadame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery\nfountain. “Dad raised me . . . but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I started school.\nSorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind.\nVery kind ter me, he was. . . .”\nHagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose\nheavily.\n“So . . . anyway . . . enough abou’ me. What about you? Which side you got\nit on?”\nBut Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.\n“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather was doing, it was\nnowhere near as cold as her voice. “I think I will go in now.”\n“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met another one\nbefore!”\n“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.\nHarry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in\nthe shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was\nno good.\n“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.\n“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through\nthe peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger\nfall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more insulted in my life! ’Alf-\ngiant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”\nShe stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as\nshe passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench,\nstaring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after\nabout a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off"

Brought up by the\nDursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were\nrevelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive\nyear. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said “So\nwhat?” upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.\n“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. . . .”\nFleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private\nclump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and\nPadma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons\nboys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat\ndown at a table far removed from the dance floor.\n“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with giants?”\n“Well, they’re . . . they’re . . .” Ron struggled for words. “. . . not very nice,”\nhe finished lamely.\n“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with Hagrid!”\n“I know there isn’t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,” Ron said,\nshaking his head. “I always thought he’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement\nCharm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to mention it. . . .”\n“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?” said Harry.\n“Well . . . no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll know he’s not\ndangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But . . . Harry, they’re just vicious, giants. It’s\nlike Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls . . . they just like killing,\neveryone knows that. There aren’t any left in Britain now, though.”\n“What happened to them?”\n“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by\nAurors. There’re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in\nmountains mostly. . . .”\n“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,” Harry said, watching\nMadame Maxime sitting alone at the judges’ table, looking very somber. “If\nHagrid’s half-giant, she definitely is.

Harry tried not to watch Cho\nand Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.\nWhen the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a\nlast, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance\nhall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on\nlonger, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was\nconcerned, the evening hadn’t been much fun.\nOut in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night\nto Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very\ncold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry\nand Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone\ncalling him.\n“Hey — Harry!”\nIt was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance\nhall below.\n“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.\nCedric looked as though he didn’t want to say whatever it was in front of\nRon, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.\n“Listen . . .” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. “I owe you one\nfor telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail\nwhen you open it?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\n“Well . . . take a bath, okay?”\n“What?”\n“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and — er — just mull\nthings over in the hot water. It’ll help you think. . . . Trust me.”\nHarry stared at him.\n“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’ bathroom. Fourth door to\nthe left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password’s\n‘pine fresh.’ Gotta go . . . want to say good night —”\nHe grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.\nHarry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely\nstrange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg\nmeant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look like a\nfool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison?\nThe Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the\nportrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and\nwhen he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common\nroom and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet\napart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.\n“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?” yelled\nHermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face\nwas screwed up in anger.\n“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”\n“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last\nresort!”\nRon mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned"

Ron turned to look at\nHarry.\n“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just proves —\ncompletely missed the point —”\nHarry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron\ntoo much to speak his mind right now — but he somehow thought that\nHermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.\n— T W E N T Y - F O U R —\nRITA SKEETER’S SCOOP\nE\nverybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room\nwas much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the\nlazy conversations. Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry\nthat she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball,\n“but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly,\nscratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\nRon and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to\ndiscuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though\noddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the\nconversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but\nHermione didn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as\nshocking as Ron did.\n“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he couldn’t be\npure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria\nabout giants. They can’t all be horrible. . . . It’s the same sort of prejudice that\npeople have toward werewolves. . . . It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”\nRon looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps\nhe didn’t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his\nhead disbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t looking.\nIt was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the\nfirst week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that\nChristmas was over — everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once\nagain) to feel slightly nervous.\nThe trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from\nthis side of Christmas, and he still hadn’t done anything about working out\nthe clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his\ntrunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening\nintently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think\nwhat the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had\nnever heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and\nopened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn’t. He tried asking\nthe egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He\neven threw the egg across the room — though he hadn’t really expected that to\nhelp.\nHarry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-\nthan-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to"

In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric\nhad really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more\nexplicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task\n— and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath.\nWell, he didn’t need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone who kept\nwalking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day\nof the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with\nbooks, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the\negg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him\ntoo.\nSnow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were\ncovered in condensation so thick that they couldn’t see out of them in\nHerbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much\nin this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them\nup nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid’s\ncabin would catch fire.\nWhen they arrived at Hagrid’s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch\nwith closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his\nfront door.\n“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she barked at them as they\nstruggled toward her through the snow.\n“Who’re you?” said Ron, staring at her. “Where’s Hagrid?”\n“My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,” she said briskly. “I am your\ntemporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.”\n“Where’s Hagrid?” Harry repeated loudly.\n“He is indisposed,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.\nSoft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry’s ears. He turned; Draco\nMalfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked\ngleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n“This way, please,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around\nthe paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and\nHermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid’s cabin.\nAll the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?\n“What’s wrong with Hagrid?” Harry said, hurrying to catch up with\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank.\n“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he was being nosy.\n“I do mind, though,” said Harry hotly. “What’s up with him?”\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn’t hear him. She led\nthem past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing,\nhuddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a\nlarge and beautiful unicorn was tethered.\nMany of the girls “ooooohed!” at the sight of the unicorn.\n“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown. “How did she get it?\nThey’re supposed to be really hard to catch!”"

It\nwas pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its\nhorned head.\n“Boys keep back!” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm\nand catching Harry hard in the chest. “They prefer the woman’s touch,\nunicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does\nit. . . .”\nShe and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the\nboys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor\nGrubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.\n“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a skrewt — ?”\n“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,” said\nMalfoy softly. “No, he’s just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face.”\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry sharply.\nMalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded\npage of newsprint.\n“There you go,” he said. “Hate to break it to you, Potter. . . .”\nHe smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,\nSeamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped\nwith a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.\nDUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE\nAlbus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School\nof Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make\ncontroversial staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special\nCorrespondent. In September of this year, he hired Alastor\n“Mad-Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to\nteach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused\nmany raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s\nwell-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden\nmovement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks\nresponsible and kindly when set beside the part-human\nDumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\nRubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from\nHogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of\ngamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by\nDumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious\ninfluence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of\nCare of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many\nbetter-qualified candidates.\nAn alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has\nbeen using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his\ncare with a succession of horrific creatures. While Dumbledore\nturns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a\nseries of lessons that many admit to being “very frightening.”\n“I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent\nCrabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,” says Draco Malfoy,\na fourth-year student. “We all hate Hagrid, but we’re just too\nscared to say anything.”\nHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of"

        "text": "a fourth-year student. “We all hate Hagrid, but we’re just too\nscared to say anything.”\nHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of\nintimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet\nreporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has\ndubbed “Blast-Ended Skrewts,” highly dangerous crosses\nbetween manticores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds\nof magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely\nobserved by the Department for the Regulation and Control of\nMagical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be\nabove such petty restrictions.\n“I was just having some fun,” he says, before hastily\nchanging the subject.\nAs if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now\nunearthed evidence that Hagrid is not — as he has always\npretended — a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure\nhuman. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other\nthan the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently\nunknown.\nBloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the\npoint of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the\nlast century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some\nof the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\nWhile many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-\nBe-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark\nSide, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped\nto one of the giant communities still existing in foreign\nmountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical\nCreatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa’s son\nappears to have inherited her brutal nature.\nIn a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a\nclose friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-\nWho’s fall from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own\nmother, like the rest of You-Know-Who’s supporters, into\nhiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant\ntruth about his large friend — but Albus Dumbledore surely\nhas a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow\nstudents, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-\ngiants.\nHarry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging\nopen.\n“How did she find out?” he whispered.\nBut that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.\n“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s\nthis rubbish about him” — he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a\nflobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”\nCrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\n“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,” said\nMalfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-giant . . . and there was me thinking he’d just\nswallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. . . . None of the\nmummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . . They’ll be worried he’ll\neat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”\n“You —”\n“Are you paying attention over there?”"

They’ll be worried he’ll\neat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”\n“You —”\n“Are you paying attention over there?”\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all\nclustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the\nDaily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the\nunicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now\nenumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\n“I hope she stays, that woman!” said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended\nand they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. “That’s more what I\nthought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like\nunicorns, not monsters. . . .”\n“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\n“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He can still be\ngamekeeper, can’t he?”\nParvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he\nought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a\ngood time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen\nthat she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in\nHogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\n“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great\nHall. “I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni\n—”\n“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under\nHermione’s nose.\nHermione’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same\nas Ron’s.\n“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don’t think Hagrid\ntold her?”\n“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and\nthrowing himself into a chair, furious. “He never even told us, did he? I reckon\nshe was so mad he wouldn’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went\nferreting around to get him back.”\n“Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,” said Hermione\nquietly.\n“We’d have seen her in the garden!” said Ron. “Anyway, she’s not supposed\nto come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .”\n“Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry, ladling chicken\ncasserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. “Sort of thing\nshe’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”\n“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.\n“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly. “We didn’t have\nany choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone\ncould have heard him!”\n“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This evening, after Divination.\nTell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?” he shot at Hermione.\n“I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a\nproper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid"

They knocked, and\nFang’s booming barks answered.\n“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the door. “Open up!”\nHagrid didn’t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door,\nwhining, but it didn’t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron\neven went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.\n“What’s he avoiding us for?” Hermione said when they had finally given up\nand were walking back to the school. “He surely doesn’t think we’d care about\nhim being half-giant?”\nBut it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn’t see a sign of him all week.\nHe didn’t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn’t see him going\nabout his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank\ncontinued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating\nat every possible opportunity.\n“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry whenever there\nwas a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing the\nelephant-man?”\nThere was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very\nsurprised that Harry was going to go.\n“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being\nquiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”\n“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” Harry\nlied.\n“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well done!”\nHarry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five\nweeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages . . . whereas if he\nwent into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade\nhim to come back.\nHe, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off\nthrough the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the\nDurmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the\ndeck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed,\nbut apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the\nside of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\n“He’s mad!” said Harry, staring at Krum’s dark head as it bobbed out into\nthe middle of the lake. “It must be freezing, it’s January!”\n“It’s a lot colder where he comes from,” said Hermione. “I suppose it feels\nquite warm to him.”\n“Yeah, but there’s still the giant squid,” said Ron. He didn’t sound anxious\n— if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and\nfrowned.\n“He’s really nice, you know,” she said. “He’s not at all like you’d think,"

He hadn’t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but\nHarry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had\nlooked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure\nwearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\nHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy\nHigh Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had\nascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\nThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables\ntold Harry that Hagrid wasn’t there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with\nRon and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and\nthought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to\nthe egg wailing after all.\n“Doesn’t he ever go into the office?” Hermione whispered suddenly. “Look!”\nShe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman\nreflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman\nwas talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms\ncrossed and were looking rather menacing.\nIt was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three\nBroomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore\nno judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking\nstrained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the\nDark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw\nHarry, and stood up.\n“In a moment, in a moment!” Harry heard him say brusquely to the\ngoblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin\nback in place.\n“Harry!” he said. “How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything\ngoing all right?”\n“Fine, thanks,” said Harry.\n“Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?” said Bagman\neagerly. “You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?”\n“Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.\nBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.\n“Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on your splendid\nperformance against that Horntail, Harry,” said Bagman. “Really superb.”\n“Thanks,” said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman wanted\nto say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and\nHermione. Bagman didn’t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans,\nthough. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who\nwere all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.\n“Absolute nightmare,” said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing\nHarry watching the goblins too. “Their English isn’t too good . . . it’s like"

This lot keep gabbling\nin Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It\nmeans ‘pickax.’ I don’t like to use it in case they think I’m threatening them.”\nHe gave a short, booming laugh.\n“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still\nwatching Bagman very closely.\n“Er — well . . .” said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. “They . . . er . . .\nthey’re looking for Barty Crouch.”\n“Why are they looking for him here?” said Harry. “He’s at the Ministry in\nLondon, isn’t he?”\n“Er . . . as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,” said Bagman. “He’s\nsort of . . . stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now.\nYoung Percy, his assistant, says he’s ill. Apparently he’s just been sending\ninstructions in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone,\nHarry? Because Rita Skeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and I’m\nwilling to bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into something sinister. Probably\nsay he’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.”\n“Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?” Harry asked.\n“No,” said Bagman, looking strained again. “I’ve got people looking, of\ncourse . . .” (About time, thought Harry) “and it’s all very strange. She\ndefinitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And\nthen she left the cousin’s house to go south and see an aunt . . . and she seems\nto have vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she’s got\nto . . . she doesn’t seem the type to elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What\nare we doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask\nyou” — he lowered his voice — “how are you getting on with your golden\negg?”\n“Er . . . not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.\nBagman seemed to know he wasn’t being honest.\n“Listen, Harry,” he said (still in a very low voice), “I feel very bad about all\nthis . . . you were thrown into this tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it . . .\nand if . . .” (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) “if I\ncan help at all . . . a prod in the right direction . . . I’ve taken a liking to\nyou . . . the way you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.”\nHarry stared up into Bagman’s round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue\neyes.\n“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t we?” he said, careful to\nkeep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the Head of the\nDepartment of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules."

Just thought I’d offer . . .”\n“Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly there with the egg . . .\ncouple more days should crack it.”\nHe wasn’t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman’s help, except that\nBagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel\nsomehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione,\nor Sirius.\nBagman looked almost affronted, but couldn’t say much more as Fred and\nGeorge turned up at that point.\n“Hello, Mr. Bagman,” said Fred brightly. “Can we buy you a drink?”\n“Er . . . no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, “no,\nthank you, boys . . .”\nFred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was\nsurveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.\n“Well, I must dash,” he said. “Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.”\nHe hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited\nafter him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.\n“What did he want?” Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.\n“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.\n“He shouldn’t be doing that!” said Hermione, looking very shocked. “He’s\none of the judges! And anyway, you’ve already worked it out — haven’t you?”\n“Er . . . nearly,” said Harry.\n“Well, I don’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was\ntrying to persuade you to cheat!” said Hermione, still looking deeply\ndisapproving. “I hope he’s trying to help Cedric as much!”\n“He’s not, I asked,” said Harry.\n“Who cares if Diggory’s getting help?” said Ron. Harry privately agreed.\n“Those goblins didn’t look very friendly,” said Hermione, sipping her\nbutterbeer. “What were they doing here?”\n“Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,” said Harry. “He’s still ill.\nHasn’t been into work.”\n“Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron. “Probably thinks if Crouch\nsnuffs it he’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical\nCooperation.”\nHermione gave Ron a don’t-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said,\n“Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the\nDepartment for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”\n“Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,” said Harry.\n“Maybe they need an interpreter.”\n“Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you?” Ron asked Hermione."

They’re not like house-elves,\nwho never stick up for themselves.”\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, staring at the door.\nRita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes today;\nher long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her\npaunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer\nmade their way through the crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione glaring at her as she approached.

Madam Rosmerta was staring over\nfrom behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was\nfilling with mead was overflowing.\nRita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at\nonce; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-\nQuotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid\nyou know, Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and\nthe reasons behind it.

Harry glanced\nback as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it\nwas zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.\n“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low and worried voice as\nthey walked quickly back up the street.\n“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. “I’ll show\nher! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I’ll get her back for this. First Harry, then\nHagrid . . .”\n“You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said Ron nervously. “I’m\nserious, Hermione, she’ll dig up something on you —”\n“My parents don’t read the Daily Prophet. She can’t scare me into hiding!”\nsaid Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could\ndo to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like\nthis, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. “And Hagrid isn’t hiding\nanymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him!\nCome on!”\nBreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the\ngates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid’s cabin.\nThe curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they\napproached.\n“Hagrid!” Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. “Hagrid, that’s\nenough! We know you’re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess,\nHagrid! You can’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out\nhere, you’re just being —”\nThe door opened. Hermione said, “About t — !” and then stopped, very\nsuddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but\nwith Albus Dumbledore.\n“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.\n“We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid,” said Hermione in a rather small\nvoice.\n“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “Why\ndon’t you come in?”\n“Oh . . . um . . . okay,” said Hermione.\nShe, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon\nHarry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry\nfended off Fang and looked around."

Harry\nfended off Fang and looked around.\nHagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He\nlooked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to\nthe other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it\nbehave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.\n“Hi, Hagrid,” said Harry.\nHagrid looked up.\n“’Lo,” he said in a very hoarse voice.\n“More tea, I think,” said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray\nappeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray\nonto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then\nDumbledore said, “Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was\nshouting, Hagrid?”\nHermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued,\n“Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the\nway they were attempting to break down the door.”\n“Of course we still want to know you!” Harry said, staring at Hagrid. “You\ndon’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry, Professor,” he added quickly,\nlooking at Dumbledore.\n“I have gone temporarily deaf and haven’t any idea what you said, Harry,”\nsaid Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\n“Er — right,” said Harry sheepishly. “I just meant — Hagrid, how could\nyou think we’d care what that — woman — wrote about you?”\nTwo fat tears leaked out of Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his\ntangled beard.\n“Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, still\nlooking carefully up at the ceiling. “I have shown you the letters from the\ncountless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in\nno uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say\nabout it —”\n“Not all of ’em,” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Not all of ’em wan’ me ter stay.”\n“Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I’m afraid\nyou will be in this cabin for a very long time,” said Dumbledore, now peering\nsternly over his half-moon spectacles. “Not a week has passed since I became\nheadmaster of this school when I haven’t had at least one owl complaining\nabout the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study\nand refuse to talk to anybody?”\n“Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.\n“Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives!” Harry said furiously. “Look at the\nDursleys!”\n“An excellent point,” said Professor Dumbledore. “My own brother,\nAberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It\nwas all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his\nhead high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely"

Of course, I’m not entirely\nsure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . . .”\n“Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione quietly, “please come back,\nwe really miss you.”\nHagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled\nbeard.\nDumbledore stood up. “I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I\nexpect you back at work on Monday,” he said. “You will join me for breakfast\nat eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.”\nDumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang’s ears. When the\ndoor had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized\nhands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes\nvery red indeed, and said, “Great man, Dumbledore . . . great man . . .”\n“Yeah, he is,” said Ron. “Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?”\n“Help yerself,” said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. “Ar,\nhe’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ . . . I bin stupid . . . my ol’ dad woulda\nbin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’. . . .” More tears leaked out, but he\nwiped them away more forcefully, and said, “Never shown you a picture of my\nold dad, have I? Here . . .”\nHagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a\npicture of a short wizard with Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat\non top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall,\njudging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round,\nand smooth — he looked hardly older than eleven.\n“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked. “Dad was\ndead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos me mum . . . well,\nanyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he\nnever saw me expelled.

Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit in at\nHogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it . . . an’ now look at\nyeh, Harry!

Beat ’em all.”\nLying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to\nthe castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the\nimage of the happy expression on Hagrid’s whiskery face as he had imagined\nHarry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more\nheavily than ever on Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time he had\ngot into bed, he had made up his mind — it was time to shelve his pride and\nsee if Cedric’s hint was worth anything.\n— T W E N T Y - F I V E —\nTHE EGG AND THE EYE\nA\ns Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the\nsecret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would\nbe able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept\nmore favors from Cedric, he also decided to use the prefects’ bathroom; far\nfewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be\ndisturbed.\nHarry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of\nbed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once\nbefore, and had no desire to repeat the experience.

        "text": "bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once\nbefore, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak\nwould, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he\nwould take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most useful\naid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts,\nincluding its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of\nall, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving\naround the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was\napproaching the bathroom.\nOn Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept back\ndownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown\nhim the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron\nwho waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”).\n“Good luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past\nhim.\nIt was awkward moving under the Cloak tonight, because Harry had the\nheavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other.\nHowever, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the\nmap at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into\nanyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the\nBewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he\nlocated the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine\nfresh,” just as Cedric had told him.\nThe door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him,\nand pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.\nHis immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just\nto be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled\nchandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked\nlike an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor.\nAbout a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool’s edges, each with a\ndifferently colored jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board.\nLong white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white\ntowels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the\nwall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair\nover her face. It fluttered every time she snored.\nHarry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.\nMagnificent though the bathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try\nout a few of those taps — now he was here he couldn’t quite suppress the\nfeeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this\nsupposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the\nfluffy towels, the Cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-\npool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.\nHe could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed\nwith the water, though it wasn’t bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it."

Harry amused himself for a while turning the\ntaps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off\nthe surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot\nwater, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size,\nHarry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing\ngown, and slid into the water.\nIt was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a\ncouple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring\nat the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water\nwith clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of\nbrilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.\nHarry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it.\nThe wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating\noff the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not\nmore so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound\nwould attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and\nthen, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered\naway across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.\n“I’d try putting it in the water, if I were you.”\nHarry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood\nup, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-\nlegged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to\nbe heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.\n“Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I’m — I’m not wearing anything!”\nThe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling\nthat Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he\nhad arrived.\n“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said, blinking at him through her\nthick spectacles. “You haven’t been to see me for ages.”\n“Yeah . . . well . . .” said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make\nabsolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t see anything but his head, “I’m not supposed\nto come into your bathroom, am I? It’s a girls’ one.”\n“You didn’t used to care,” said Myrtle miserably. “You used to be in there\nall the time.”\nThis was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found\nMyrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in\nsecret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas\nof Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin\ncommon room.\n“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was half-true; Percy"

I see . . .” said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose\nsort of way. “Well . . . anyway . . . I’d try the egg in the water. That’s what\nCedric Diggory did.”\n“Have you been spying on him too?” said Harry indignantly. “What d’you\ndo, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?”\n“Sometimes,” said Myrtle, rather slyly, “but I’ve never come out to speak to\nanyone before.”\n“I’m honored,” said Harry darkly. “You keep your eyes shut!”\nHe made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself\nout of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to\nretrieve the egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her\nfingers and said, “Go on, then . . . open it under the water!”\nHarry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it . . . and this\ntime, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose\nwords he couldn’t distinguish through the water.\n“You need to put your head under too,” said Myrtle, who seemed to be\nthoroughly enjoying bossing him around. “Go on!”\nHarry took a great breath and slid under the surface — and now, sitting on\nthe marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices\nsinging to him from the open egg in his hands:\n“Come seek us where our voices sound,\nWe cannot sing above the ground,\nAnd while you’re searching, ponder this:\nWe’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss,\nAn hour long you’ll have to look,\nAnd to recover what we took,\nBut past an hour — the prospect’s black,\nToo late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”\nHarry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking\nhis hair out of his eyes.\n“Hear it?” said Myrtle.\n“Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I need\npersuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .”\nHe sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions\nof the egg’s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a\nwhile, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.\n“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the\nground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”\n“Slow, aren’t you?”\nHe had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a\ndose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.\nHarry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be\nheard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater"

He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.\n“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to\nhimself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had\ngone. . . .”\n“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,\napart from the giant squid?”\n“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t\nhave any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”\nTrying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the\nlake with the contents of a toilet, Harry said, “Well, does anything in there\nhave a human voice? Hang on —”\nHarry’s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall.\n“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”\n“Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses twinkling, “it took Diggory\nmuch longer than that! And that was with her awake too” — Myrtle jerked her\nhead toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face\n— “giggling and showing off and flashing her fins. . . .”\n“That’s it, isn’t it?” said Harry excitedly. “The second task’s to go and find\nthe merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . .”\nBut he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement\ndrain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He\nwasn’t a very good swimmer; he’d never had much practice. Dudley had had\nlessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping\nthat Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give him any. A couple\nof lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very\ndeep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . .\n“Myrtle,” Harry said slowly, “how am I supposed to breathe?”\nAt this, Myrtle’s eyes filled with sudden tears again.\n“Tactless!” she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.\n“What’s tactless?” said Harry, bewildered.\n“Talking about breathing in front of me!” she said shrilly, and her voice\nechoed loudly around the bathroom. “When I can’t . . . when I haven’t . . . not\nfor ages . . .”\nShe buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry\nremembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none\nof the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.\n“Sorry,” he said impatiently. “I didn’t mean — I just forgot . . .”\n“Oh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle’s dead,” said Myrtle, gulping, looking at\nhim out of swollen eyes. “Nobody missed me even when I was alive.

I\nremember at her brother’s wedding —”\nBut Harry wasn’t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople’s song\nagain. “We’ve taken what you’ll sorely miss.” That sounded as though they were\ngoing to steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they\ngoing to take?\n“— and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me\nstalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.”\n“Good,” said Harry vaguely. “Well, I’m a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut\nyour eyes again, will you? I’m getting out.”\nHe retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried\nhimself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.\n“Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?” Moaning\nMyrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.\n“Er . . . I’ll try,” Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he’d be\nvisiting Myrtle’s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got\nblocked. “See you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your help.”\n“’Bye, ’bye,” she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak\nhe saw her zoom back up the tap.\nOut in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map to check\nthat the coast was still clear.

He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a\ntapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a\nshortcut that would take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the\nmap, wondering . . . It just didn’t seem in character, somehow, for correct,\nlaw-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else’s office this late\nat night. . . .\nAnd then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was\ndoing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr.\nCrouch, Harry’s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always\nforgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp\nfrom the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and\ncatch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as\na bass drum on every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry snatched\nat it, and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six\nstairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.\nThe golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst\nopen, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his\nwand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was\ntoo far away to reach —\nPulling the Cloak back over himself, Harry straightened up, listening hard\nwith his eyes screwed up with fear . . . and, almost immediately —\n“PEEVES!”\nIt was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear\nhis rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised\nin fury.\n“What’s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I’ll have you,\nPeeves, I’ll have you, you’ll . . . and what is this?”\nFilch’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing\nstopped — Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still,\none leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now,\nFilch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there\nwould be no Peeves . . . but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the\nMarauder’s Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show\n“Harry Potter” standing exactly where he was.\n“Egg?” Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. “My sweet!” — Mrs.\nNorris was obviously with him — “This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a\nschool champion!”\nHarry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —\n“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been stealing!”\nHe ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face\nand bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase."

Dumbledore’ll have you\nout of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. . . .”\nFilch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels.\nMrs. Norris’s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master’s, were fixed directly upon\nHarry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility\nCloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing\nnearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown — he tried desperately to\npull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches — any second\nnow, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him —\n“Filch? What’s going on?”\nFilch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs\nstood the only person who could make Harry’s situation worse: Snape. He was\nwearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.\n“It’s Peeves, Professor,” Filch whispered malevolently. “He threw this egg\ndown the stairs.”\nSnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted\nhis teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any\nsecond. . . .\n“Peeves?” said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch’s hands. “But Peeves\ncouldn’t get into my office. . . .”\n“This egg was in your office, Professor?”\n“Of course not,” Snape snapped. “I heard banging and wailing —”\n“Yes, Professor, that was the egg —”\n“— I was coming to investigate —”\n“— Peeves threw it, Professor —”\n“— and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a\ncupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!”\n“But Peeves couldn’t —”\n“I know he couldn’t, Filch!” Snape snapped again. “I seal my office with a\nspell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight\nthrough Harry, and then down into the corridor below. “I want you to come\nand help me search for the intruder, Filch.”\n“I — yes, Professor — but —”\nFilch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see\nthat he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry\npleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go . . . Mrs. Norris was peering\naround Filch’s legs. . . . Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell\nhim. . . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?\n“The thing is, Professor,” said Filch plaintively, “the headmaster will have to\nlisten to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my\nchance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all —”"

Clunk. Clunk.\nSnape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the\nfoot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the\nnarrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak\nover his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.\n“Pajama party, is it?” he growled up the stairs.\n“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at once. “Peeves\nthe Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape\ndiscovered that someone had broken into his off —”\n“Shut up!” Snape hissed to Filch.\nMoody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody’s\nmagical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility\nCloaks . . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his\nnightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind\nthem. Moody’s lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few\nseconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other’s eyes. Then Moody\nclosed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.\n“Did I hear that correctly, Snape?” he asked slowly. “Someone broke into\nyour office?”\n“It is unimportant,” said Snape coldly.\n“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very important. Who’d want to\nbreak into your office?”\n“A student, I daresay,” said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly\non Snape’s greasy temple. “It has happened before. Potion ingredients have\ngone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit\nmixtures, no doubt. . . .”\n“Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?” said Moody. “Not hiding\nanything else in your office, are you?”\nHarry saw the edge of Snape’s sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein\nin his temple pulsing more rapidly.\n“You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody,” he said in a soft and dangerous\nvoice, “as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.”\nMoody’s face twisted into a smile. “Auror’s privilege, Snape. Dumbledore\ntold me to keep an eye —”\n“Dumbledore happens to trust me,” said Snape through clenched teeth. “I\nrefuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!”\n“’Course Dumbledore trusts you,” growled Moody. “He’s a trusting man,\nisn’t he? Believes in second chances. But me — I say there are spots that don’t\ncome off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d’you know what I mean?”\nSnape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm\nconvulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.\nMoody laughed. “Get back to bed, Snape.”"

You’ve dropped something,\nby the way. . . .”\nWith a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder’s Map, still\nlying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to\nlook at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the\nCloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing “It’s\nmine! Mine!”\nSnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning\ncomprehension on his face —\n“Accio Parchment!”\nThe map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape’s outstretched fingers,\nand soared down the stairs into Moody’s hand.\n“My mistake,” Moody said calmly. “It’s mine — must’ve dropped it earlier\n—”\nBut Snape’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the map\nin Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together,\nas only Snape could. . . .\n“Potter,” he said quietly.\n“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.\n“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at\nthe place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is\nPotter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I\nrecognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”\nSnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the\nstairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to\nsniff Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snape’s\nfingertips, but any moment now —\n“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but I’ll be happy to tell the\nheadmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!”\n“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still\noutstretched, inches from Harry’s chest.\n“Meaning that Dumbledore’s very interested to know who’s got it in for\nthat boy!” said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. “And so am\nI, Snape . . . very interested. . . .” The torchlight flickered across his mangled\nface, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and\ndarker than ever.\nSnape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn’t see the expression\non his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape\nslowly lowered his hands.\n“I merely thought,” said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, “that if Potter was\nwandering around after hours again . . . it’s an unfortunate habit of his . . . he"

Mrs.\nNorris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch’s legs, looking for the\nsource of Harry’s bubble-bath smell.\n“I think I will go back to bed,” Snape said curtly.\n“Best idea you’ve had all night,” said Moody. “Now, Filch, if you’ll just give\nme that egg —”\n“No!” said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son.\n“Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves’ treachery!”\n“It’s the property of the champion he stole it from,” said Moody. “Hand it\nover, now.”\nSnape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch\nmade a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few\nmore seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very\nfast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody\nthe egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. “Never\nmind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him what\nPeeves was up to. . . .”\nA door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his\nstaff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a\ndull clunk on every other step.\n“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.\n“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.\n“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his\npocket and unfolding it.\n“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out\nof the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.\n“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye\ngoing haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”\n“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from\nthe pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?”\n“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”\nMoody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the\ntrick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the\nmap.\n“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who\nbroke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?”\n“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”\nMoody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked\nsuddenly alarmed.\n“Crouch?” he said. “You’re — you’re sure, Potter?”\n“Positive,” said Harry."

It was a\npenetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him\nup, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.\n“Put it this way, Potter,” Moody muttered finally, “they say old Mad-Eye’s\nobsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I’m nothing — nothing —\ncompared to Barty Crouch.”\nHe continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.\n“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think . . . could this have\nanything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s something going\non. . . .”\n“Like what?” said Moody sharply.\nHarry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody to guess\nthat he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to\ntricky questions about Sirius.\n“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening lately, hasn’t\nit? It’s been in the Daily Prophet . . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the\nDeath Eaters and everything. . . .”\nBoth of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.\n“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye roved back to the\nMarauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he said slowly.\n“Very possible . . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately —\nhelped along by Rita Skeeter, of course.

Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he\nmeant?\n“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said Moody in a more\nbusinesslike tone.\nHarry’s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to\nask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object —\nand the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him,\nbut his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of\nHarry, who braced himself —\n“Can I borrow this?”"

Moody waved the map in front of\nHarry, who braced himself —\n“Can I borrow this?”\n“Oh!” said Harry.\nHe was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely\nrelieved that Moody wasn’t asking where he’d got it, and there was no doubt\nthat he owed Moody a favor.\n“Yeah, okay.”\n“Good boy,” growled Moody. “I can make good use of this . . . this might\nbe exactly what I’ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on,\nnow. . . .”\nThey climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the\nmap as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before.\nThey walked in silence to the door of Moody’s office, where he stopped and\nlooked up at Harry.\n“You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?”\n“No,” said Harry, taken aback.\n“You want to consider it,” said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry\nthoughtfully. “Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I’m guessing you weren’t\njust taking that egg for a walk tonight?”\n“Er — no,” said Harry, grinning. “I’ve been working out the clue.”\nMoody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again.\n“Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See you in the\nmorning. . . .”\nHe went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder’s Map again,\nand closed the door behind him.\nHarry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about\nSnape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was Crouch pretending to\nbe ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he\nthink Snape was concealing in his office?\nAnd Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea . . .\nbut somehow, Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten\nminutes later, the egg and the Cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought\nhe’d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a\ncareer.\n— T W E N T Y - S I X —\nTHE SECOND TASK\nY\nou said you’d already worked out that egg clue!” said Hermione\nindignantly.\n“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly. “I just need to — sort of fine-\ntune it, all right?”\nHe, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class\nwith a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite\nof the Summoning Charm today — the Banishing Charm. Owing to the\npotential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room,\nProfessor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to\npractice, the theory being that these wouldn’t hurt anyone if they went off\ntarget. It was a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well. Neville’s aim was\nso poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the\nroom — Professor Flitwick, for instance."

Neville’s aim was\nso poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the\nroom — Professor Flitwick, for instance.\n“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry hissed as Professor\nFlitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet.\n“I’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. . . .”\nThis class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was\nhaving far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been\nrecounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for\nthe last half hour.\n“Snape said Moody’s searched his office as well?” Ron whispered, his eyes\nalight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it\nsoared into the air and knocked Parvati’s hat off). “What . . . d’you reckon\nMoody’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?”\n“Well, I dunno if that’s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he’s\ndefinitely doing it,” said Harry, waving his wand without paying much\nattention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.\n“Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he’s giving him a\nsecond chance or something. . . .”\n“What?” said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into\nthe air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick’s\ndesk. “Harry . . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of\nFire!”\n“Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head skeptically, “we thought Snape\nwas trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s life,\nremember?”\nShe Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box\nthey were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione,\nthinking . . . it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing\nwas, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he’d loathed Harry’s father when\nthey had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and\nhad certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to\nsuggest that he should be suspended from the school.\n“I don’t care what Moody says,” Hermione went on. “Dumbledore’s not\nstupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of\npeople wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why shouldn’t he be right about\nSnape, even if Snape is a bit —”\n“— evil,” said Ron promptly. “Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark\nwizard catchers searching his office, then?”\n“Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?” said Hermione, ignoring\nRon. “It’s a bit funny, isn’t it, that he can’t manage to come to the Yule Ball,\nbut he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?”\n“You just don’t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,” said Ron, sending a\ncushion soaring into the window.\n“You just want to think Snape’s up to something,” said Hermione, sending\nher cushion zooming neatly into the box."

Then\nHarry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him:\nhow to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.\nRon quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry\nhad explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t\nSummon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by\npointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to\noperate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be\ndisqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it\nwas too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming\nacross the countryside to Hogwarts.\n“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into\na submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human\nTransfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it\ncan go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”\n“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my\nhead,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody;\nhe might do it for me. . . .”\n“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into,\nthough,” said Hermione seriously. “No, I think your best chance is some sort\nof charm.”\nSo Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to\nlast him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes,\nlooking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen.\nHowever, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes,\nevenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked Professor McGonagall\nfor a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the\nirritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they found nothing\nwhatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to\ntell the tale.\nFamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was\nfinding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had\nalways taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes\nwhenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly\nwater, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.\nJust as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though\nsomebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go\nbefore February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five"

There was a week to go\nbefore February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five\ndays to go (he was bound to find something soon) . . . three days to go (please\nlet me find something . . . please) . . .\nWith two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing\nabout breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to\nSirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter\nSirius had ever written to him.\nSend date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.\nHarry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see\nsomething else, but it was blank.\n“Weekend after next,” whispered Hermione, who had read the note over\nHarry’s shoulder. “Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight\naway.”\nHarry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius’s letter, tied it onto the\nbrown owl’s leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected?\nAdvice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius\nall about Snape and Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the egg’s\nclue.\n“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?” said\nRon.\n“Dunno,” said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared\ninside him at the sight of the owl had died. “Come on . . . Care of Magical\nCreatures.”\nWhether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or\nbecause there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to\nprove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn’t\nknow, but Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d\nreturned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about\nunicorns as he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack\nof poisonous fangs disappointing.\nToday he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown\nunicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of\ndelight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to\nconceal how much she liked them.\n“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the class. “They turn silver\nwhen they’re abou’ two years old, an’ they grow horns at aroun’ four. Don’ go\npure white till they’re full grown, ’round about seven. They’re a bit more\ntrustin’ when they’re babies . . . don’ mind boys so much. . . . C’mon, move in\na bit, yeh can pat ’em if yeh want . . . give ’em a few o’ these sugar lumps. . . .\n“You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of\nthe others swarmed around the baby unicorns.\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\n“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid.\n“Bit,” said Harry.\n“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that\nHarry’s knees buckled under its weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh"

I’m not worried at all. Yeh’re goin’ ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out,\nhaven’ yeh?”\nHarry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he\ndidn’t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came\nover him. He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake\nsometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on\nthe grounds, after all —\n“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s shoulder again, so\nthat Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. “I\nknow it. I can feel it. Yeh’re goin’ ter win, Harry.”\nHarry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off\nHagrid’s face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a\nsmile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.\nBy the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were trapped in\na nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to\nfind a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he\nhave let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner?\nWhy had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once\nmentioned how to breathe underwater?\nHe sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing\nfeverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the\nmassive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry’s heart gave\na huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than\nnot it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded\nmandrake leaves, and a newt . . .”\n“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side\nof the table. “There’s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up\npuddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful\nenough to drain the lake.”\n“There must be something,” Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to\nher. Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and\nForgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the\npage. “They’d never have set a task that was undoable.”\n“They have,” said Ron. “Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right,\nstick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked,\nand see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.”\n“There’s a way of doing it!” Hermione said crossly. “There just has to be!”\nShe seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful information on the\nsubject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before."

He was exhausted.\n“It takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register\nyourself and everything,” said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the\nindex of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions. “Professor\nMcGonagall told us, remember . . . you’ve got to register yourself with the\nImproper Use of Magic Office . . . what animal you become, and your\nmarkings, so you can’t abuse it. . . .”\n“Hermione, I was joking,” said Harry wearily. “I know I haven’t got a\nchance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning. . . .”\n“Oh this is no use,” Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding\nDilemmas. “Who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?”\n“I wouldn’t mind,” said Fred Weasley’s voice. “Be a talking point, wouldn’t\nit?”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged\nfrom behind some bookshelves.\n“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked.\n“Looking for you,” said George. “McGonagall wants you, Ron. And you,\nHermione.”\n“Why?” said Hermione, looking surprised.\n“Dunno . . . she was looking a bit grim, though,” said Fred.\n“We’re supposed to take you down to her office,” said George.\nRon and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. Was\nProfessor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she’d\nnoticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out\nhow to do the task alone?\n“We’ll meet you back in the common room,” Hermione told Harry as she\ngot up to go with Ron — both of them looked very anxious. “Bring as many\nof these books as you can, okay?”\n“Right,” said Harry uneasily.\nBy eight o’clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to\nchivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books\nas he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a\ntable into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap\nMagic for Wacky Warlocks . . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not\none mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century\nCharms, or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never Knew You\nHad and What to Do with Them Now You’ve Wised Up.\nCrookshanks crawled into Harry’s lap and curled up, purring deeply.

Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A\nlarge, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest into his stomach.\n“Hurry, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry’s sleeve. “You is\nsupposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!”\n“It’s too late, Dobby,” Harry said hopelessly. “I’m not doing the task, I\ndon’t know how —”\n“Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf. “Dobby knew Harry had\nnot found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!”\n“What?” said Harry. “But you don’t know what the second task is —”\n“Dobby knows, sir!

They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis\nCreevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly\ngrounds.\nAs he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the\ndragons’ enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank,\nrising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake\nbelow. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as\nHarry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who\nwere sitting at another gold-draped table at the water’s edge. Cedric, Fleur,\nand Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry sprint toward them.\n“I’m . . . here . . .” Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and\naccidentally splattering Fleur’s robes.\n“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving voice. “The task’s about\nto start!”\nHarry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges’ table — Mr.\nCrouch had failed to turn up again.\n“Now, now, Percy!” said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved\nto see Harry. “Let him catch his breath!”\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn’t\nlook at all pleased to see him. . . . It was obvious from the looks on their faces\nthat they had thought he wasn’t going to turn up.\nHarry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in\nhis side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no\ntime to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions,\nspacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end\nof the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding\nhis wand ready.\n“All right, Harry?” Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther\naway from Krum. “Know what you’re going to do?”\n“Yeah,” Harry panted, massaging his ribs.\nBagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’\ntable; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said,\n“Sonorus!” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands."

One . . . two . . . three!”\nThe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with\ncheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were\ndoing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed\nout of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.\nIt was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not\nicy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now\nthe water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over\nsilt and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he\ncould; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-\ndeep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to\nhappen.\nHe could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking\ninto the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that\nwas still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a\ncruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided\nlooking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were\ncatcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .\nThen, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been\npressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his\nhead spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either\nside of his neck —\nHarry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below\nhis ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he\ndid the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water.\nThe first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had\nstopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly\nthrough his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands\nin front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the\nwater, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare\nfeet — they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as\nthough he had sprouted flippers.\nThe water didn’t feel icy anymore either . . . on the contrary, he felt\npleasantly cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at\nhow far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and\nnoticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to\nblink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the\nbottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.\nSilence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy"

He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through\nthe water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness:\nforests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull,\nglimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the\nlake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the\nshadows beyond, where the water became opaque.\nSmall fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he\nsaw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he\ndiscovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of\nweed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron —\nnor, thankfully, the giant squid.\nLight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet\ndeep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly\nahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then,\nwithout warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.\nHarry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water\ndemon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around\nHarry’s leg, its pointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly\ninside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two\nmore grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry’s\nrobes, and were attempting to drag him down.\n“Relashio!” Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. . . . A large\nbubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the\ngrindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for\nwhere it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry\npulled his ankle out of the grindylow’s grip and swam, as fast as he could,\noccasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every\nnow and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he\nkicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and\nlooking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its\nfellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.\nHarry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and\nlooked around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence\npressing harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even\ndeeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.\n“How are you getting on?”\nHarry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw\nMoaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her\nthick, pearly glasses.\n“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again, nothing came out of his\nmouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled."

I don’t like them much, they always chase me when I get too\nclose. . . .”\nHarry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more,\ncareful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that\nmight be lurking there.\nHe swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over\nvast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the\nwater. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.\n“An hour long you’ll have to look,\nAnd to recover what we took . . .”\nHarry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water\nahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and\nchasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock,\nfollowing the mersong.\n“. . . your time’s half gone, so tarry not\nLest what you seek stays here to rot. . . .”\nA cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of\nthe gloom on all sides.

They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them\nemerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails\nbeating the water, spears clutched in their hands.\nHarry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more\nnumerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw\na pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on\nall sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills,\ntalking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a\nvery strange sight met his eyes.\nA whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined\nwhat looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was\nsinging in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them\nrose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four\npeople were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.\nRon was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who\nlooked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure\nthat she was Fleur Delacour’s sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very\ndeep sleep.

Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of\nbubbles kept issuing from their mouths.\nHarry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their\nspears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the\nhostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second\nhe thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas — locked in his\ntrunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.\nHe looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying\nspears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green\nbeard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the\nspear. The merman laughed and shook his head.\n“We do not help,” he said in a harsh, croaky voice.\n“Come ON!” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth),\nand he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked\nit back, still shaking his head and laughing.\nHarry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .\nThere were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a\nparticularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the\nropes binding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work, they broke apart.\nRon floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little\nin the ebb of the water.\nHarry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions.\nWhat were they playing at? Why didn’t they hurry up? He turned back to\nHermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too —\nAt once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen\nwere pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and\nlaughing.\n“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to him. “Leave the\nothers . . .”\n“No way!” said Harry furiously — but only two large bubbles came out.\n“Your task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others . . .”\n“She’s my friend too!” Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an\nenormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. “And I don’t want\nthem to die either!”\nCho’s head was on Hermione’s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was\nghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they\nlaughed harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around.\nWhere were the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the\nsurface and come back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able\nto find them again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was\nleft — it had stopped working.\nBut then the merpeople around him started pointing excitedly over his\nhead. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an\nenormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide\nand stretched.\n“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. “Fleur and Krum’re coming\nnow!”\nFeeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his"

He pulled her upward and out of sight.\nHarry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was\ngetting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an\nhour. . . .\nThe merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry\nloosened their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something\nmonstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in\nswimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . . It was Krum. He appeared to\nhave transfigured himself — but badly.\nThe shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting\nat her ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were positioned very\nawkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite\nsure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half.\nDarting forward, Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged\nstone. Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had\ndone it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward\nglance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.\nNow what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was\ncoming. . . . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except . . .\nHe snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now\nclosed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry\npulled out his wand.\n“Get out of the way!”\nOnly bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that\nthe mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing.\nTheir yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and they looked scared.\nThere might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could\ntell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant\nsquid did.\n“You’ve got until three!” Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst\nfrom him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message.\n“One . . .” (he put down a finger) “two . . .” (he put down a second one) —\nThey scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes\nbinding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. He seized the little\ngirl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes, and kicked off from the\nbottom.\nIt was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel\nhimself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur’s sister\nwere like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. . . . He fixed his eyes\nskyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was\nso dark. . . .\nMerpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him\nwith ease, watching him struggle through the water. . . . Would they pull him\nback down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans?"

Steam gushed out of his ears.\n“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried. “You did it, you found out how all by\nyourself!”\n“Well —” said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had\njust noticed Karkaroff watching him.

If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most\ncertainly had been.\n“Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was\nnevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage.

However, the\nMerchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and\nthat the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages\nto safety, not merely his own.”\nRon and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating\nlooks.\n“Most of the judges,” and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look,\n“feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks.

Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events changed subtly with every\nretelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with\nHermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a\nbewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they\nwould be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water.\nOne week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he\nstruggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to\nbeat him into submission before tying him up.\n“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured Padma Patil, who\nseemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention\nand was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the\ncorridors. “I could’ve taken those mer-idiots any time I wanted.”\n“What were you going to do, snore at them?” said Hermione waspishly.\nPeople had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum\nwould most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.\nRon’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep\nversion of events.\nAs they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned\ntheir hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds.

If he was honest with himself, he really\nwanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the\nafternoon — double Potions — feeling considerably more cheerful than he\nusually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom\ndoor with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls.

The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was\nsmiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.\n“You might find something to interest you in there, Granger!” Pansy said\nloudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking\nstartled.

Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of\ntoday’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the\nmagazine under the desk.

        "text": "the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and\nhero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been\ntoying with both boys’ affections. Krum, who is openly smitten\nwith the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit\nhim in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he\nhas “never felt this way about any other girl.”\nHowever, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful natural\ncharms that have captured these unfortunate boys’ interest.\n“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and\nvivacious fourth-year student, “but she’d be well up to making\na Love Potion, she’s quite brainy. I think that’s how she’s\ndoing it.”\nLove Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no\ndoubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims.\nIn the meantime, Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that,\nnext time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.\n“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. “I\ntold you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She’s made you out to be some sort of —\nof scarlet woman!”\nHermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. “Scarlet\nwoman?” she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at\nRon.\n“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his ears going red.\n“If that’s the best Rita can do, she’s losing her touch,” said Hermione, still\ngiggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. “What a\npile of old rubbish.”\nShe looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry\nclosely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione\ngave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started\nunpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.\n“There’s something funny, though,” said Hermione ten minutes later,\nholding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. “How could Rita\nSkeeter have known . . . ?”\n“Known what?” said Ron quickly. “You haven’t been mixing up Love\nPotions, have you?”\n“Don’t be stupid,” Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles\nagain. “No, it’s just . . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over\nthe summer?”\nHermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron’s\neyes.\n“What?” said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.\n“He asked me right after he’d pulled me out of the lake,” Hermione\nmuttered. “After he’d got rid of his shark’s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us\nboth blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they\nwouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing anything over the summer, would\nI like to —”\n“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was\ngrinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was\nlooking at Hermione.\n“And he did say he’d never felt the same way about anyone else,” Hermione"

She wasn’t there . . . or was\nshe? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the\ngrounds to watch the second task. . . .”\n“And what did you say?” Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard\nthat it dented the desk.\n“Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to —”\n“Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, Miss Granger,” said an\nicy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, “I must ask you\nnot to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.”\nSnape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class\nwas now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash\nPOTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.\n“Ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?” Snape added, snatching\nup the copy of Witch Weekly. “A further ten points from Gryffindor . . . oh but\nof course . . .” Snape’s black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter’s article.\n“Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .”\nThe dungeon rang with the Slytherins’ laughter, and an unpleasant smile\ncurled Snape’s thin mouth. To Harry’s fury, he began to read the article aloud.\n“‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache’ . . . dear, dear, Potter, what’s ailing you\nnow? ‘A boy like no other, perhaps . . .’”\nHarry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every\nsentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times\nworse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.\n“‘ . . . Harry Potter’s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his\nheart upon a worthier candidate.’ How very touching,” sneered Snape, rolling\nup the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. “Well, I\nthink I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on\nyour potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here.\nMiss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter — that table in front\nof my desk. Move. Now.”\nFurious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and\ndragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed,\nsat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not\nto look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining\neach one to have Snape’s face.\n“All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head,\nPotter,” said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.\nHarry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had\ndone this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty"

        "text": "Harry didn’t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had\ndone this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty\npoints from Gryffindor before the end of the class.\n“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world\nis impressed with you,” Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear\nhim (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already\nreduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your\npicture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little\nboy who considers rules to be beneath him.”\nHarry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up\nhis ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his\neyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape was saying to him.\n“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued in a softer and more\ndangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my\noffice one more time —”\n“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry angrily, forgetting\nhis feigned deafness.\n“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into\nHarry’s. “Boomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I\nknow who stole them.”\nHarry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In\ntruth, he hadn’t stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken\nthe boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the\nPolyjuice Potion — and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had\nnever been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry lied coldly.\n“You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!” Snape\nhissed. “I know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan\nclub, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my\noffice, Potter, and you will pay!”\n“Right,” said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. “I’ll bear that in\nmind if I ever get the urge to go in there.”\nSnape’s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes.\nFor one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand\nand curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle\nof a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.\n“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering\ndangerously again.\n“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.\n“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would\nhave you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said\nSnape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict\nMinistry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that\nmy hand slips” — he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your\nevening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether\nyou’ve been in my office or not.”"

And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether\nyou’ve been in my office or not.”\nHarry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked\nup his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of that\nTruth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He\nrepressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his\nmouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in\ntrouble — Hermione and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things\nhe was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and\n— his insides squirmed at the thought — how he felt about Cho. . . . He\ntipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought\nto take a leaf out of Moody’s book and start drinking only from a private hip\nflask.\nThere was a knock on the dungeon door.\n“Enter,” said Snape in his usual voice.\nThe class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in.\nEveryone watched him as he walked up toward Snape’s desk. He was twisting\nhis finger around his goatee and looking agitated.\n“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He\nseemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was\nbarely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist.\nHarry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.\n“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape muttered, but Karkaroff\ninterrupted him.\n“I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus. You’ve been avoiding\nme.”\n“After the lesson,” Snape snapped.\nUnder the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he’d poured out\nenough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them.\nKarkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.\nKarkaroff hovered behind Snape’s desk for the rest of the double period. He\nseemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class.\nKeen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over\nhis bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him\nan excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the\nclass moved noisily toward the door.\n“What’s so urgent?” he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.\n“This,” said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron,\nsaw Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape\nsomething on his inner forearm.\n“Well?” said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. “Do\nyou see? It’s never been this clear, never since —”\n“Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.\n“But you must have noticed —” Karkaroff began in an agitated voice."

What are you doing?”\n“Clearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,” said Harry innocently,\nstraightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.\nKarkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked\nboth worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally\nangry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left\nat top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.\nThey left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining\ndown upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and\nby the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their\ncloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to\nbring was in Harry’s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of\nbread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.\nThey went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where\nthey had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair\npatterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly\nwhen they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up\nthe High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the\nvillage.\nHarry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading\nthem out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were\nfewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the\nmountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and\nsaw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the\ntopmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some\nnewspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .\n“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him.\nThe black dog sniffed Harry’s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned\nand began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose\nto meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed\nover the stile and followed.\nSirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was\ncovered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius\nhigher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a\nsteep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius’s wagging tail, sweating in the\nsun, the shoulder straps of Harry’s bag cutting into his shoulders.\nThen, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place\nwhere he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed\ninto it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it,\none end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half"

        "text": "into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it,\none end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half\ngray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of\nthem. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them\nimperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed\nHermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was\nlooking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.\nSirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing\nwhen he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he\nhad appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked\nvery thin.\n“Chicken!” he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his\nmouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.\nHarry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and\nbread.\n“Thanks,” said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the\ncave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. “I’ve been living off rats\nmostly. Can’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I’d draw attention to\nmyself.”\nHe grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.\n“What’re you doing here, Sirius?” he said.\n“Fulfilling my duty as godfather,” said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone\nin a very doglike way. “Don’t worry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable\nstray.”\nHe was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry’s face, said more\nseriously, “I want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let’s just say\nthings are getting fishier. I’ve been stealing the paper every time someone\nthrows one out, and by the looks of things, I’m not the only one who’s getting\nworried.”\nHe nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron\npicked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at\nSirius.\n“What if they catch you? What if you’re seen?”\n“You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I’m\nan Animagus,” said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken\nleg.\nRon nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The\nfirst bore the headline MYSTERY ILLNESS OF BARTEMIUS CROUCH, the second, MINISTRY\nWITCH STILL MISSING — MINISTER OF MAGIC NOW PERSONALLY INVOLVED.\nHarry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn’t\nbeen seen in public since November . . . house appears deserted . . . St. Mungo’s\nHospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment . . . Ministry refuses\nto confirm rumors of critical illness. . . .\n“They’re making it sound like he’s dying,” said Harry slowly. “But he can’t\nbe that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .”\n“My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant,” Ron informed Sirius. “He says\nCrouch is suffering from overwork.”"

She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius’s\nchicken bones. “I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now — bet he feels the\ndifference now she’s not there to look after him.”\n“Hermione’s obsessed with house-elves,” Ron muttered to Sirius, casting\nHermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.\n“Crouch sacked his house-elf?”\n“Yeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Harry, and he launched into the\nstory of the Dark Mark’s appearance, and Winky being found with Harry’s\nwand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch’s fury. When Harry had finished,\nSirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.\n“Let me get this straight,” he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken\nleg. “You first saw the elf in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat,\nright?”\n“Right,” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\n“But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match?”\n“No,” said Harry. “I think he said he’d been too busy.”\nSirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, “Harry, did you\ncheck your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box?”\n“Erm . . .” Harry thought hard. “No,” he said finally. “I didn’t need to use\nit before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all\nthat was in there were my Omnioculars.” He stared at Sirius. “Are you saying\nwhoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?”\n“It’s possible,” said Sirius.\n“Winky didn’t steal that wand!” Hermione insisted.\n“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius, his brow furrowed as\nhe continued to pace. “Who else was sitting behind you?”\n“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian ministers . . . Cornelius\nFudge . . . the Malfoys . . .”\n“The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all\naround the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. “I bet it was Lucius\nMalfoy!”\n“Anyone else?” said Sirius.\n“No one,” said Harry.\n“Yes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,” Hermione reminded him.\n“Oh yeah . . .”\n“I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for\nthe Wimbourne Wasps,” said Sirius, still pacing. “What’s he like?”\n“He’s okay,” said Harry. “He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard\nTournament.”\n“Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply. “I wonder why he’d do\nthat?”"

If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at\nhow he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”\nHe ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.\n“All these absences of Barty Crouch’s . . . he goes to the trouble of making\nsure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t\nbother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard\nTournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If\nhe’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.”\n“D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.\nSirius’s face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night\nwhen Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a\nmurderer.\n“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave\nthe order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.”\n“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.\n“You’re kidding!” said Harry.\n“No, I’m not,” said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. “Crouch\nused to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you\nknow?”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.\n“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. “He’s a great"

Oh never a\nVoldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry’s face. “No, Barty\nCrouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of\npeople who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn’t understand . . .\nyou’re too young. . . .”\n“That’s what my dad said at the World Cup,” said Ron, with a trace of\nirritation in his voice. “Try us, why don’t you?”\nA grin flashed across Sirius’s thin face.\n“All right, I’ll try you. . . .” He walked once up the cave, back again, and\nthen said, “Imagine that Voldemort’s powerful now. You don’t know who his\nsupporters are, you don’t know who’s working for him and who isn’t; you\nknow he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able\nto stop themselves. You’re scared for yourself, and your family, and your\nfriends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more\ntorturing . . . the Ministry of Magic’s in disarray, they don’t know what to do,\nthey’re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile,\nMuggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that’s\nhow it used to be.\n“Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in\nothers. Crouch’s principles might’ve been good in the beginning — I wouldn’t\nknow. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very\nharsh measures against Voldemort’s supporters. The Aurors were given new\npowers — powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn’t the\nonly one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch\nfought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable\nCurses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many\non the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you — plenty of people\nthought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of\nwitches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic.\nWhen Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until\nCrouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate\nhappened. . . .” Sirius smiled grimly. “Crouch’s own son was caught with a\ngroup of Death Eaters who’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban.\nApparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.”\n“Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped Hermione.\n“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself\nback down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half.\n“Nasty little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine. Should have spent a bit more\ntime at home with his family, shouldn’t he? Ought to have left the office early\nonce in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.”"

Ought to have left the office early\nonce in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.”\nHe began to wolf down large pieces of bread.\n“Was his son a Death Eater?” said Harry.\n“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. “I was in Azkaban myself\nwhen he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I’ve found out since I got out.\nThe boy was definitely caught in the company of people I’d bet my life were\nDeath Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\njust like the house-elf.”\n“Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered.\nSirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.\n“Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione!\nAnything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated\nhis whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted\nhouse-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t that\ntell you what he’s like? Crouch’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to\ngive his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn’t much more than an excuse for\nCrouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to\nAzkaban.”\n“He gave his own son to the dementors?” asked Harry quietly.\n“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely amused now. “I saw\nthe dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell\ndoor. He can’t have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near\nmine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few\ndays, though . . . they all went quiet in the end . . . except when they shrieked\nin their sleep. . . .”\nFor a moment, the deadened look in Sirius’s eyes became more pronounced\nthan ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.\n“So he’s still in Azkaban?” Harry said.\n“No,” said Sirius dully. “No, he’s not in there anymore. He died about a\nyear after they brought him in.”\n“He died?”\n“He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly. “Most go mad in there, and\nplenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell\nwhen a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got\nexcited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an\nimportant Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit.\nThat was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell.\nShe died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the\nboy. Crouch never came for his son’s body. The dementors buried him outside\nthe fortress; I watched them do it.”\nSirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead\npicked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.\n“So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,” he\ncontinued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “One moment, a"

Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more\nsympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a\ngood family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never\ncared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was\nshunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”\nThere was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch’s eyes had\nbulged as he’d looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at\nthe Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had\noverreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought\nback memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the\nMinistry.\n“Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,” Harry told\nSirius.\n“Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with him,” said Sirius,\nnodding. “If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity\nby catching one more Death Eater.”\n“And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!” said Ron triumphantly,\nlooking at Hermione.\n“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.\n“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.\n“Listen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn’t he been coming to\njudge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to\nHogwarts and keep an eye on him.”\n“So you think Snape could be up to something, then?” asked Harry, but\nHermione broke in.\n“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —”\n“Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently. “I know Dumbledore’s\nbrilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard\ncouldn’t fool him —”\n“Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year, then? Why didn’t he just\nlet him die?”\n“I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out —”\n“What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione\nstopped bickering to listen.\n“I think they’ve both got a point,” said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron\nand Hermione. “Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve\nwondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape’s always been fascinated by the\nDark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he\nwas,” Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. “Snape knew\nmore curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and\nhe was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death\nEaters.”\nSirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names."

        "text": "he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death\nEaters.”\nSirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.\n“Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before\nVoldemort fell. The Lestranges — they’re a married couple — they’re in\nAzkaban. Avery — from what I’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by\nsaying he’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he’s still at large. But as\nfar as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not\nthat that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape’s\ncertainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.”\n“Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,” said\nRon.\n“Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions\nyesterday!” said Harry quickly. “Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says\nSnape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape\nsomething on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was.”\n“He showed Snape something on his arm?” said Sirius, looking frankly\nbewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then\nshrugged again. “Well, I’ve no idea what that’s about . . . but if Karkaroff’s\ngenuinely worried, and he’s going to Snape for answers . . .”\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.\n“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know\nDumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see\nhim letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.”\n“Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape’s office then?” said\nRon stubbornly.\n“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad-Eye to have searched\nevery single teacher’s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I’m not sure he trusts anyone at all,\nand after the things he’s seen, it’s not surprising. I’ll say this for Moody,\nthough, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive\nwhere possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the\nDeath Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he’s a different matter . . . is he really ill? If\nhe is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape’s office? And if\nhe’s not . . . what’s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so\nimportant he didn’t turn up in the Top Box? What’s he been doing while he\nshould have been judging the tournament?”\nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was\nferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have\noverlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.\n“You say your brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant? Any chance you could\nask him if he’s seen Crouch lately?”\n“I can try,” said Ron doubtfully. “Better not make it sound like I reckon\nCrouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.”"

Percy loves Crouch.”\n“And you might try and find out whether they’ve got any leads on Bertha\nJorkins while you’re at it,” said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the\nDaily Prophet.\n“Bagman told me they hadn’t,” said Harry.\n“Yes, he’s quoted in the article in there,” said Sirius, nodding at the paper.\n“Blustering on about how bad Bertha’s memory is. Well, maybe she’s changed\nsince I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn’t forgetful at all — quite the\nreverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used\nto get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I\ncan see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that’s\nwhy Bagman didn’t bother to look for her for so long. . . .”\nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.\n“What’s the time?”\nHarry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn’t been working since it\nhad spent over an hour in the lake.\n“It’s half past three,” said Hermione.\n“You’d better get back to school,” Sirius said, getting to his feet. “Now\nlisten . . .” He looked particularly hard at Harry. “I don’t want you lot\nsneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still\nwant to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts\nwithout permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack\nyou.”\n“No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of\ngrindylows,” Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him.\n“I don’t care . . . I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s over, and\nthat’s not until June. And don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among\nyourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?”\nHe handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak\ngood-bye. “I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you,” said Sirius, “see if I\ncan scrounge another paper.”\nHe transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they\nwalked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn\nground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the\nhead, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up\ntoward Hogwarts.\n“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?” Ron said as they\nwalked up the drive to the castle. “But maybe he doesn’t care . . . it’d probably\njust make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He’d just\nsay Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.”\n“Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,” said\nHermione severely.\n“I don’t know,” said Ron. “If he thought we were standing in the way of his"

Imagine having to live off rats.”\n— T W E N T Y - E I G H T —\nTHE MADNESS OF\nMR. CROUCH\nH\narry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on\nSunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested,\nwhether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had\nbeen so long since she’d had a job. When they had watched her fly out of sight\nthrough the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give\nDobby his new socks.\nThe house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying\nand bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.\n“Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!” he squeaked, wiping large tears out of\nhis enormous eyes.\n“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,” said Harry.\n“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said Ron, who was looking\naround at the beaming and bowing house-elves.\n“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great silver\nplatter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.\n“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry muttered.\n“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t give us a\nbit of extra food, could you?” he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed\ndelightedly and hurried off to get some more.\n“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was looking around.\n“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby quietly, his ears\ndrooping slightly.\n“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.\nHarry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool\nas last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not\nimmediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her\nclothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer\nand swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her,\nshe gave an enormous hiccup.\n“Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,” Dobby whispered to\nHarry.\n“Well, it’s not strong, that stuff,” Harry said.\nBut Dobby shook his head. “’Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,” he said.\nWinky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her\ndisapproving looks as they returned to work.\n“Winky is pining, Harry Potter,” Dobby whispered sadly. “Winky wants to\ngo home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby"

Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby\nsays will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now.”\n“Hey, Winky,” said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to\nher, and bending down, “you don’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to,\ndo you? Because he’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament.”\nWinky’s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed\nslightly again and then said, “M — Master is stopped — hic — coming?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “we haven’t seen him since the first task. The Daily\nProphet’s saying he’s ill.”\nWinky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.\n“Master — hic — ill?”\nHer bottom lip began to tremble.\n“But we’re not sure if that’s true,” said Hermione quickly.\n“Master is needing his — hic — Winky!” whimpered the elf. “Master\ncannot — hic — manage — hic — all by himself. . . .”\n“Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,”\nHermione said severely.\n“Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for Mr. Crouch!”\nWinky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer\ndown her already heavily stained blouse. “Master is — hic — trusting Winky\nwith — hic — the most important — hic — the most secret —”\n“What?” said Harry.\nBut Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.\n“Winky keeps — hic — her master’s secrets,” she said mutinously, swaying\nvery heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. “You is — hic\n— nosing, you is.”\n“Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!” said Dobby angrily.\n“Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!”\n“He is nosing — hic — into my master’s — hic — private and secret — hic\n— Winky is a good house-elf — hic — Winky keeps her silence — hic —\npeople trying to — hic — pry and poke — hic —”\nWinky’s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her\nstool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled\naway across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying\nforward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others\ncovered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly,\nhiding her from view.\n“We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!” squeaked a nearby elf,\nshaking his head and looking very ashamed. “We is hoping you will not judge\nus all by Winky, sirs and miss!”\n“She’s unhappy!” said Hermione, exasperated. “Why don’t you try and\ncheer her up instead of covering her up?”\n“Begging your pardon, miss,” said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, “but\nhouse-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and\nmasters to be served.”"

You’ve got the right to wages\nand holidays and proper clothes, you don’t have to do everything you’re told\n— look at Dobby!”\n“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled, looking scared.\nThe cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the\nkitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad\nand dangerous.\n“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he shoved a\nlarge ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!”\nThe house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began\nshunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of\ntheir backs.\n“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from the\nhearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.\n“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?” said Ron\nangrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. “They won’t want us\nvisiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about\nCrouch!”\n“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You only like coming\ndown here for the food!”\nIt was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and\nHermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room\nthat he took Sirius’s food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.\nPigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain\nby himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well.\nWhen they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large\npackage between them, Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the\ngrounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the\nrippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of\nsmoke rising from Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the\nOwlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging\nenergetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it\nlooked as though he were making a new vegetable patch. As he watched,\nMadame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to\nHagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid\nleaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because\nMadame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.\nUnwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione\nsnarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness\nswallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past\nhim into the night.\nBy breakfast the next day Ron’s and Hermione’s bad moods had burnt out,"

I’m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins.”\n“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione,\nI think you’re in luck —”\nA gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.\n“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s\n—”\nBut to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely\nfollowed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.\n“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing\nHermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of\nwhom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.\n“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl,\nopening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.\n“What’s up?” said Ron.\n“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”\nShe thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but\ncomposed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily\nProphet.\nYou are a WickEd giRL.

As Harry and Ron left the\ngreenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe,\nand Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was\nwhispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls.\nCatching sight of Harry, Pansy called, “Potter, have you split up with your\ngirlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?”\nHarry ignored her; he didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing\nhow much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.\nHagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns,\nwas waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his\nfeet. Harry’s heart sank at the sight of the crates — surely not another skrewt\nhatching? — but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself\nlooking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front\npaws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class,\nlooking politely puzzled at all the attention.\n“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. “Yeh\nfind ’em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look.”\nOne of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy\nParkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.\n“Useful little treasure detectors,” said Hagrid happily. “Thought we’d have\nsome fun with ’em today. See over there?” He pointed at the large patch of\nfreshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window.\n“I’ve buried some gold coins. I’ve got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that\ndigs up most. Jus’ take off all yer valuables, an’ choose a niffler, an’ get ready\nter set ’em loose.”\nHarry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it\ndidn’t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked up a\nniffler. It put its long snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was\nreally quite cuddly.\n“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, “there’s a spare niffler\nhere . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione?”\n“She had to go to the hospital wing,” said Ron.\n“We’ll explain later,” Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.\nIt was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures.\nThe nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water,"

Chuck\n’em straigh’ in the fire.”\n“You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told Hermione as they headed\nback toward the castle. “They’re good, nifflers, aren’t they, Ron?”\nRon, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He\nlooked thoroughly put out about something.\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “Wrong flavor?”\n“No,” said Ron shortly. “Why didn’t you tell me about the gold?”\n“What gold?” said Harry.\n“The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,” said Ron. “The\nleprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t"

Why didn’t\nyou tell me it disappeared?”\nHarry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking\nabout.\n“Oh . . .” he said, the memory coming back to him at last. “I dunno . . . I\nnever noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn’t I?”\nThey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall\nfor lunch.\n“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started\nserving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. “To have so much\nmoney you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.”\n“Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!” said Harry impatiently.\n“We all did, remember?”\n“I didn’t know leprechaun gold vanishes,” Ron muttered. “I thought I was\npaying you back. You shouldn’t’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for\nChristmas.”\n“Forget it, all right?” said Harry.\nRon speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he\nsaid, “I hate being poor.”\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew\nwhat to say.\n“It’s rubbish,” said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. “I don’t blame Fred\nand George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a\nniffler.”\n“Well, we know what to get you next Christmas,” said Hermione brightly.\nThen, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could\nbe worse. At least your fingers aren’t full of pus.” Hermione was having a lot of\ndifficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. “I\nhate that Skeeter woman!” she burst out savagely. “I’ll get her back for this if\nit’s the last thing I do!”\nHate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and\nalthough she followed Hagrid’s advice and stopped opening it, several of her\nill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked\ninsults at her for the whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn’t read\nWitch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry–Krum–Hermione triangle\nnow. Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn’t his\ngirlfriend.\n“It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore it. . . . People\ngot bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time —”\n“I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when she’s\nsupposed to be banned from the grounds!” said Hermione angrily.\nHermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to\nask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave;\nMoody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of\nthem were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears,\nhe had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class."

Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears,\nhe had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.\n“Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!” Hermione panted\nfive minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and\npulling Harry’s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear\nher. “Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the\nsecond task, or anywhere near the lake!”\n“Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?” said Ron.\n“No!” said Hermione stubbornly. “I want to know how she heard me\ntalking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!”\n“Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.\n“Bugged?” said Ron blankly. “What . . . put fleas on her or something?”\nHarry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording\nequipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.\n“Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts: A History?”\n“What’s the point?” said Ron. “You know it by heart, we can just ask you.”\n“All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity, computers, and\nradar, and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too\nmuch magic in the air. No, Rita’s using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. . . .\nIf I could just find out what it is . . . ooh, if it’s illegal, I’ll have her . . .”\n“Haven’t we got enough to worry about?” Ron asked her. “Do we have to\nstart a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?”\n“I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped. “I’ll do it on my own!”\nShe marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance. Harry\nwas quite sure she was going to the library.\n“What’s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita Skeeter\nbadges?” said Ron.\nHermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue\nvengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because\ntheir workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter\nholidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact that Hermione could research\nmagical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do.\nHe was working flat-out just to get through all their homework, though he\nmade a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain\nfor Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be\ncontinually hungry. He enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out\nof the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer\nfrom Percy.\nHedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy’s letter was\nenclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harry’s\nand Ron’s were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee.\nHermione’s, however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she\nsaw it.\n“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?” she\nasked quietly."

He is sending in regular owls with instructions. No,\nI haven’t actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my\nown superior’s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at the moment\nwithout trying to quash these ridiculous rumors. Please don’t bother me\nagain unless it’s something important. Happy Easter.\nThe start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was\ntraining hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it\nwas the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed\nto prepare, but he still didn’t know what he would have to do. Finally, in the\nlast week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.\n“You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o’clock, Potter,”\nshe told him. “Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third\ntask.”\nSo at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor\nTower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up\nfrom the Hufflepuff common room.\n“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry as they went together\ndown the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. “Fleur keeps going on about\nunderground tunnels; she reckons we’ve got to find treasure.”\n“That wouldn’t be too bad,” said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask\nHagrid for a niffler to do the job for him.\nThey walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through\na gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.\n“What’ve they done to it?” Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.\nThe Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though\nsomebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and\ncrisscrossed in every direction.\n“They’re hedges!” said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.\n“Hello there!” called a cheery voice.\nLudo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur.\nHarry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges.\nFleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him had\nchanged completely since he had saved her sister from the lake.\n“Well, what d’you think?” said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric\nclimbed over the last hedge. “Growing nicely, aren’t they? Give them a month\nand Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high. Don’t worry,” he added, grinning,\nspotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll"

Don’t worry,” he added, grinning,\nspotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll\nhave your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I\nimagine you can guess what we’re making here?”\nNo one spoke for a moment. Then —\n“Maze,” grunted Krum.\n“That’s right!” said Bagman. “A maze. The third task’s really very\nstraightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze.\nThe first champion to touch it will receive full marks.”\n“We seemply ’ave to get through the maze?” said Fleur.\n“There will be obstacles,” said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his\nfeet. “Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells\nthat must be broken . . . all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions\nwho are leading on points will get a head start into the maze.” Bagman grinned\nat Harry and Cedric. “Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But\nyou’ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the\nobstacles. Should be fun, eh?”\nHarry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely\nto provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all.\nHowever, he nodded politely like the other champions.\n“Very well . . . if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up to the\ncastle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. . . .”\nBagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the\ngrowing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering\nto help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.\n“Could I haff a vord?”\n“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, slightly surprised.\n“Vill you valk vith me?”\n“Okay,” said Harry curiously.\nBagman looked slightly perturbed.\n“I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?”\n“No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman,” said Harry, suppressing a smile, “I think I can\nfind the castle on my own, thanks.”\nHarry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course\nfor the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the forest.\n“What’re we going this way for?” said Harry as they passed Hagrid’s cabin\nand the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.\n“Don’t vont to be overheard,” said Krum shortly.\nWhen at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from\nthe Beauxbatons horses’ paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and\nturned to face Harry.\n“I vant to know,” he said, glowering, “vot there is between you and Hermy-\nown-ninny.”\nHarry, who from Krum’s secretive manner had expected something much\nmore serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.\n“Nothing,” he said.

It’s just that Skeeter woman making things\nup.”\n“Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,” said Krum, looking\nsuspiciously at Harry.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.”\nHe couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor\nKrum, the famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the\neighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal — a real rival —\n“You haff never . . . you haff not . . .”\n“No,” said Harry very firmly.\nKrum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then\nsaid, “You fly very vell. I vos votching at the first task.”\n“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller\nhimself. “I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you\nreally —”\nBut something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some\nexperience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed\nKrum’s arm and pulled him around.\n“Vot is it?”\nHarry shook his head, staring at the place where he’d seen movement. He\nslipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.\nSuddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry\ndidn’t recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.\nHe looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes\nwere ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with\nexhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a\ntrim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was\nbehaving. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to\nsomeone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp\nhe had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had\nbeen conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley’s hand\nand pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated\nthe family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and\nvagrants.\n“Vosn’t he a judge?” said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. “Isn’t he vith your\nMinistry?”\nHarry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr.\nCrouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.\n“. . . and when you’ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore\nconfirming the number of Durmstrang students who will be attending the\ntournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve. . . .”\n“Mr. Crouch?” said Harry cautiously.\n“. . . and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might\nwant to up the number of students she’s bringing, now Karkaroff’s made it a"

Will you? Will . . .”\nMr. Crouch’s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering\nsoundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.\n“Mr. Crouch?” Harry said loudly. “Are you all right?”\nCrouch’s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who\nhad followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.\n“Vot is wrong with him?”\n“No idea,” Harry muttered. “Listen, you’d better go and get someone —”\n“Dumbledore!” gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of\nHarry’s robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry’s\nhead. “I need . . . see . . . Dumbledore. . . .”\n“Okay,” said Harry, “if you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the —”\n“I’ve done . . . stupid . . . thing . . .” Mr. Crouch breathed. He looked\nutterly mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was\nsliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible\neffort. “Must . . . tell . . . Dumbledore . . .”\n“Get up, Mr. Crouch,” said Harry loudly and clearly. “Get up, I’ll take you\nto Dumbledore!”\nMr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.\n“Who . . . you?” he whispered.\n“I’m a student at the school,” said Harry, looking around at Krum for some\nhelp, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.\n“You’re not . . . his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.\n“No,” said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.\n“Dumbledore’s?”\n“That’s right,” said Harry.\nCrouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch’s grip on his\nrobes, but it was too powerful.\n“Warn . . . Dumbledore . . .”\n“I’ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,” said Harry. “Just let go, Mr.\nCrouch, and I’ll get him. . . .”\n“Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup\nof tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert\ntonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.”\nCrouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely\nunaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn’t notice\nthat Crouch had released him.\n“Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s, most satisfactory, yes,\nthank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo\nfrom the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a\nresponse. . . .”\n“You stay here with him!” Harry said to Krum. “I’ll get Dumbledore, I’ll be\nquicker, I know where his office is —”"

He looked\nfuriously around at Krum. “Help me, will you?”\nLooking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down\nnext to Mr. Crouch.\n“Just keep him here,” said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch. “I’ll\nbe back with Dumbledore.”\n“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the\nforest and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric,\nand Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak\nfront doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.\nFive minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway\nalong an empty corridor.\n“Lem — lemon drop!” he panted at it.\nThis was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore’s office — or\nat least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed,\nhowever, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but\nstood frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.\n“Move!” Harry shouted at it. “C’mon!”\nBut nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he\nknew it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps\nDumbledore was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could\ntoward the staircase —\n“POTTER!”\nHarry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged from\nthe hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut\nbehind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\n“What are you doing here, Potter?”\n“I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry, running back up the\ncorridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. “It’s Mr.\nCrouch . . . he’s just turned up . . . he’s in the forest . . . he’s asking —”\n“What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering. “What are you\ntalking about?”\n“Mr. Crouch!” Harry shouted. “From the Ministry!

Dumbledore was standing there,\nwearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression. “Is there a\nproblem?” he said, looking between Harry and Snape.\n“Professor!” Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak, “Mr.\nCrouch is here — he’s down in the forest, he wants to speak to you!”\nHarry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, Dumbledore\ndid nothing of the sort.\n“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor\nbehind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice\nas ugly.\n“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore as they walked\nswiftly down the marble staircase.\n“Said he wants to warn you . . . said he’s done something terrible . . . he\nmentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins . . . and — and Voldemort . . .\nsomething about Voldemort getting stronger. . . .”\n“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out\ninto the pitch-darkness.\n“He’s not acting normally,” Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore.\n“He doesn’t seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy\nWeasley’s there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. . . . I left\nhim with Viktor Krum.”\n“You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides\nstill, so that Harry was running to keep up. “Do you know if anybody else saw\nMr. Crouch?”\n“No,” said Harry. “Krum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just finished\ntelling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch\ncoming out of the forest —”\n“Where are they?” said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged\nfrom the darkness.\n“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way\nthrough the trees. He couldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he knew\nwhere he was going; it hadn’t been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . .\nsomewhere around here. . . .\n“Viktor?” Harry shouted.\nNo one answered.\n“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore. “They were definitely\nsomewhere around here. . . .”\n“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.\nIts narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the\nground.

And then it fell upon a pair of feet.\nHarry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest\nfloor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.\nDumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.\n“Stunned,” he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as\nhe peered around at the surrounding trees.\n“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry. “Madam Pomfrey?”\n“No,” said Dumbledore swiftly. “Stay here.”\nHe raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid’s\ncabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the\ntrees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his\nwand at him, and muttered, “Rennervate.”\nKrum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he\ntried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie\nstill.\n“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. “The old\nmadman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he\nattacked from behind!”\n“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said.\nThe sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting\ninto sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his crossbow.\n“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening. “Harry — what the\n— ?”\n“Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said Dumbledore. “His\nstudent has been attacked. When you’ve done that, kindly alert Professor\nMoody —”\n“No need, Dumbledore,” said a wheezy growl. “I’m here.”\nMoody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.\n“Damn leg,” he said furiously. “Would’ve been here quicker . . . what’s\nhappened? Snape said something about Crouch —”\n“Crouch?” said Hagrid blankly.\n“Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!” said Dumbledore sharply.\n“Oh yeah . . . right y’are, Professor . . .” said Hagrid, and he turned and\ndisappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.\n“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore told Moody, “but it is\nessential that we find him.”\n“I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he raised his wand and limped off into\nthe forest.\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the\nunmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying\nalong behind them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale\nand agitated.\n“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore\nand Harry beside him. “What’s going on?”\n“I vos attacked!” said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head. “Mr.\nCrouch or votever his name —”\n“Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?”"

The Triwizard judge?”\n“Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching\nhis furs around him, looking livid.\n“Treachery!” he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. “It is a plot! You and\nyour Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore!\nThis is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament,\nthough he is underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my\nchampion out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole\naffair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international\nWizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s\nwhat I think of you!”\nKarkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet. In one swift\nmovement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff’s furs, lifted him into the air,\nand slammed him against a nearby tree.\n“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid’s\nmassive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.\n“Hagrid, no!” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.\nHagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid\nall the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs\nand leaves showered down upon his head.\n“Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore\nsharply.\nBreathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.\n“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. . . .”\n“You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,” Dumbledore repeated firmly.\n“Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry — I want you to stay\nthere. Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send —\nthey can wait until morning, do you understand me?”\n“Er — yes,” said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that,\nat that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight\nto Sirius, to tell him what had happened?\n“I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said, staring menacingly at\nKarkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and\ntree roots. “Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry.”\nThey marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the\ncastle.\n“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. “How dare he\naccuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore’d do anythin’ like that. Like\nDumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs’ place. Worried! I\ndunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he’s bin lately. An’ you!”\nHagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback.\n“What were yeh doin’, wanderin’ off with ruddy Krum? He’s from"

Yeh can’ trust any of ’em.”\n“You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,” Harry said,\nannoyed.\n“Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said Hagrid, and he looked quite\nfrightening for a moment. “I’ve got her number now! Tryin’ ter get back in me\ngood books, tryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s comin’ in the third task. Ha!\nYou can’ trust any of ’em!”\nHagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to\nhim in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the\ncommon room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione\nwere sitting, to tell them what had happened.\n— T W E N T Y - N I N E —\nTHE DREAM\nI\nt comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. “Either\nMr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them\nwhen Viktor wasn’t looking.”\n“It must’ve been Crouch,” said Ron at once. “That’s why he was gone when\nHarry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner.”\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “He seemed really weak —\nI don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.”\n“You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough\ntimes?” said Hermione.\n“Okay . . . how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly. “Krum attacked\nCrouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself!”\n“And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?” said Hermione coldly.\n“Oh yeah . . .”\nIt was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their\ndormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to\nSirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of\nthem were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the\nnight about Mr. Crouch.\n“Just go through it again, Harry,” said Hermione. “What did Mr. Crouch\nactually say?”\n“I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense,” said Harry. “He said he\nwanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned\nBertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was\nhis fault. . . . He mentioned his son.”"

He mentioned his son.”\n“Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.\n“He was out of his mind,” said Harry. “Half the time he seemed to think his\nwife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and\ngiving him instructions.”\n“And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?” said Ron\ntentatively.\n“I’ve told you,” Harry repeated dully. “He said he’s getting stronger.”\nThere was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, “But he was\nout of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . .”\n“He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,” said Harry,\nand Ron winced at the sound of the name. “He was having real trouble\nstringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he\nwas, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see\nDumbledore.”\nHarry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The\nmany perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop\nin through one of the windows, returning from its night’s hunting with a\nmouse in its beak.\n“If Snape hadn’t held me up,” Harry said bitterly, “we might’ve got there in\ntime. ‘The headmaster is busy, Potter . . . what’s this rubbish, Potter?’ Why\ncouldn’t he have just got out of the way?”\n“Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron quickly. “Maybe —\nhang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten down to the forest?\nD’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?”\n“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,” said Harry.\n“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.\n“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione. “We need to find out\nwhether he found Mr. Crouch.”\n“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy,” said Harry.\n“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,” said Ron, “because it\nonly shows up to the boundaries, doesn’t —”\n“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly.\nSomebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two\nvoices arguing, coming closer and closer.\n“— that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that —”\n“— we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn’t\nlike the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did —”\n“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s blackmail!”\n“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?”\nThe Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold,\nthen froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the same time.\n“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.\n“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.\nFred grinned."

Harry glanced at it, but\nFred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on\nit was covered.\n“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a mock bow and\npointing at the door.\nRon didn’t move. “Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.\nThe grin vanished from Fred’s face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred,\nbefore smiling at Ron.\n“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.\n“Didn’t sound like that,” said Ron.\nFred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, “I’ve told\nyou before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can’t see why\nyou would, but —”\n“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,” said Ron. “George’s\nright, you could end up in serious trouble for that.”\n“Told you, I was joking,” said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the\nletter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn\nowl. “You’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron.\nCarry on like this and you’ll be made a prefect.”\n“No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.\nGeorge carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George\nturned around and grinned at Ron.\n“Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.”\nHe and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one\nanother.\n“You don’t think they know something about all this, do you?” Hermione\nwhispered. “About Crouch and everything?”\n“No,” said Harry. “If it was something that serious, they’d tell someone.\nThey’d tell Dumbledore.”\nRon, however, was looking uncomfortable.\n“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.\n“Well . . .” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would.

They’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail!\nRon . . . maybe you’d better tell Percy. . . .”\n“Are you mad?” said Ron. “Tell Percy? He’d probably do a Crouch and turn\nthem in.” He stared at the window through which Fred and George’s owl had\ndeparted, then said, “Come on, let’s get some breakfast.”\n“D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody?” Hermione said\nas they went down the spiral staircase.\n“Yes,” said Harry. “He’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him\nat the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep.\nLet’s give it till break.”\nHistory of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron’s\nwatch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron’s was moving so slowly he\ncould have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired\nthey could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even\nHermione wasn’t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her\nhand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\nWhen the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the\nDark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired\nas they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even\nmore lopsided appearance than usual.\n“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their way toward him\nthrough the crowd.\n“Hello, Potter,” growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of\npassing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of\nMoody’s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\n“Come in here.”\nHe stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them,\nand closed the door.\n“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble. “Mr. Crouch?”\n“No,” said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his\nwooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\n“Did you use the map?” Harry said.\n“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. “Took a leaf out of\nyour book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn’t\nanywhere on there.”\n“So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.\n“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!” said Hermione. “There are\nother ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?”\nMoody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. “You’re another\none who might think about a career as an Auror,” he told her. “Mind works\nthe right way, Granger.”\nHermione flushed pink with pleasure.\n“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry. “The map shows invisible people.\nHe must’ve left the grounds, then.”\n“But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly, “or because someone\nmade him?”\n“Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown"

Then he said, “Now, Dumbledore’s told\nme you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there’s nothing you can do\nfor Crouch. The Ministry’ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified\nthem. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.”\n“What?” said Harry. “Oh yeah . . .”\nHe hadn’t given the maze a single thought since he’d left it with Krum the\nprevious night.\n“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking up at Harry\nand scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. “From what Dumbledore’s said,\nyou’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way\nthrough a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first year,\ndidn’t you?”\n“We helped,” Ron said quickly. “Me and Hermione helped.”\nMoody grinned.\n“Well, help him practice for this one, and I’ll be very surprised if he doesn’t\nwin,” said Moody. “In the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant\nvigilance.” He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye\nswiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was\nvisible through it.\n“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, “you\nstick close to Potter, all right? I’m keeping an eye on things, but all the\nsame . . . you can never have too many eyes out.”\nSirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside\nHarry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione,\nclutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper,\nscanned the first few pages, said, “Ha! She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then\njoined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious\nevents of the night before last.\nHarry — what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest\nwith Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going\nto go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous\nat Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing\nDumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark.

There’s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down\nand look after yourself. I’m waiting for your letter giving me your word you\nwon’t stray out-of-bounds again.\n“Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?” said Harry in mild\nindignation as he folded up Sirius’s letter and put it inside his robes. “After all\nthe stuff he did at school!”\n“He’s worried about you!” said Hermione sharply. “Just like Moody and\nHagrid! So listen to them!”\n“No one’s tried to attack me all year,” said Harry. “No one’s done anything\nto me at all —”\n“Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,” said Hermione. “And they\nmust’ve done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they’ve been\nbiding their time. Maybe this is the task they’re going to get you.”\n“Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is right, and someone\nStunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would’ve been in the trees near\nus, wouldn’t they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted,\ndidn’t they? So it doesn’t look like I’m their target, does it?”\n“They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if they’d murdered you in\nthe forest!” said Hermione. “But if you die during a task —”\n“They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?” said Harry. “Why\ndidn’t they just polish me off at the same time? They could’ve made it look\nlike Krum and I had a duel or something.”\n“Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione desperately. “I just\nknow there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don’t like it. . . . Moody’s\nright — Sirius is right — you’ve got to get in training for the third task,\nstraight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him\nyou’re not going to go sneaking off alone again.”\nThe Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to\nstay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the\nlibrary with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty\nclassrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on\nthe Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that\npracticing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione’s part.\n“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he\nlay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been\nStunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. “Let’s Stun her for\na bit.

I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.”\nShe looked down the list they had made in the library.\n“I like the look of this one,” she said, “this Impediment Curse. Should slow\ndown anything that’s trying to attack you, Harry. We’ll start with that one.”\nThe bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwick’s\ncupboard and slipped out of the classroom.\n“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while\nHarry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of\ndazzling gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky\noutside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.\n“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never puts out that fire,”\nsaid Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the\ntrapdoor.\nHe was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes\nfrom the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry’s head swam as he made\nhis way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was\nlooking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an\ninch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played\nacross his face. It was extremely comfortable.\n“My dears,” said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair\nin front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged\neyes, “we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today,\nhowever, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for\nhe is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way,\nI will dim the lights. . . .”\nShe waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source\nof light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair,\na miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a\nbeautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets\nand the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass.

Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.”\n“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I am . . . I am so\npleased . . . and so sorry. . . .”\n“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. I will not be feeding\nWormtail to you, after all . . . but never mind, never mind . . . there is still\nHarry Potter. . . .”\nThe snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.\n“Now, Wormtail,” said the cold voice, “perhaps one more little reminder\nwhy I will not tolerate another blunder from you. . . .”\n“My Lord . . . no . . . I beg you . . .”\nThe tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was\npointing at Wormtail.\n“Crucio!” said the cold voice.\nWormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on\nfire, the screaming filled Harry’s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with\npain; he was yelling too. . . .

His scar was still burning so badly that his\neyes were watering. The pain had been real.

He had no intention whatsoever of going there.\nSirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going\nto follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore’s office. He\nmarched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the\ndream . . . it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet\nDrive. . . . He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could\nremember them. . . . He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a\nblunder . . . but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been\nrepaired, somebody was dead . . . so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the\nsnake . . . he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. . . .\nHarry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to\nDumbledore’s office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized\nwhat he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he\nremembered that he didn’t know the password.\n“Lemon drop?” he tried tentatively.\nThe gargoyle did not move.\n“Okay,” said Harry, staring at it, “Pear Drop. Er — Licorice Wand. Fizzing\nWhizbee. Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans . . .\noh no, he doesn’t like them, does he? . . . oh just open, can’t you?” he said\nangrily. “I really need to see him, it’s urgent!”\nThe gargoyle remained immovable.\nHarry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.\n“Chocolate Frog!” he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. “Sugar Quill!\nCockroach Cluster!”\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.\n“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only joking. . . .”\nHe hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a"

        "text": "“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only joking. . . .”\nHe hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a\nspiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind\nhim, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.\nHe could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving\nstaircase and hesitated, listening.\n“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection, don’t see it at all!” It\nwas the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. “Ludo says Bertha’s\nperfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have\nfound her by now, but all the same, we’ve no evidence of foul play,\nDumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty\nCrouch’s!”\n“And what do you think’s happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?” said\nMoody’s growling voice.\n“I see two possibilities, Alastor,” said Fudge. “Either Crouch has finally\ncracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history\n— lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere —”\n“He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,” said\nDumbledore calmly.\n“Or else — well . . .” Fudge sounded embarrassed. “Well, I’ll reserve\njudgment until after I’ve seen the place where he was found, but you say it was\njust past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman\nis?”\n“I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer,”\nsaid Dumbledore quietly.\n“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily. “Don’t you think you might be\nprejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don’t all turn out harmless —\nif, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he’s got\n—”\n“I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, just\nas calmly. “I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.”\n“Can we wrap up this discussion?” growled Moody.\n“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said Fudge impatiently.\n“No, it’s not that,” said Moody, “it’s just that Potter wants a word with you,\nDumbledore. He’s just outside the door.”\n— T H I R T Y —\nTHE PENSIEVE\nT\nhe door of the office opened.\n“Hello, Potter,” said Moody. “Come in, then.”\nHarry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore’s office once before;\nit was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous\nheadmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep,\ntheir chests rising and falling gently.\nCornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore’s desk, wearing his usual\npinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.\n“Harry!” said Fudge jovially, moving forward. “How are you?”\n“Fine,” Harry lied.\n“We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the\ngrounds,” said Fudge. “It was you who found him, was it not?”"

Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn’t\noverheard what they had been saying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime\nanywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t she?”\nDumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge’s back, his eyes twinkling.\n“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go for a short\nwalk on the grounds, Harry, if you’ll excuse us . . . perhaps if you just go back\nto your class —”\n“I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said quickly, looking at\nDumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.\n“Wait here for me, Harry,” he said. “Our examination of the grounds will\nnot take long.”\nThey trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or\nso, Harry heard the clunks of Moody’s wooden leg growing fainter in the\ncorridor below. He looked around.\n“Hello, Fawkes,” he said.\nFawkes, Professor Dumbledore’s phoenix, was standing on his golden perch\nbeside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold\nplumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.\nHarry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore’s desk. For several\nminutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing\nin their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers\nover his scar. It had stopped hurting now.\nHe felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore’s office,\nknowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at\nthe walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing\non a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large\nrubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had\npulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged\nto Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,\nremembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was\nlost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the\nglass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of\nsilver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose\ndoor had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then\ngot up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.\nA shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes\nand symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from\nthe basin’s contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He\ncould not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish\nsilver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water\nbeneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked\nlike light made liquid — or like wind made solid — Harry couldn’t make up"

It looked\nlike light made liquid — or like wind made solid — Harry couldn’t make up\nhis mind.\nHe wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years’\nexperience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl\nfull of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore\npulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the\noffice, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\nThe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.\nHarry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance\nhad become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it,\nexpecting to see the stone bottom of the basin — and saw instead an enormous\nroom below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he\nseemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\nThe room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there\nwere no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated\nthe walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away\nfrom the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and\nwizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in\nlevels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was\nsomething about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains\nencircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.\nWhere was this place? It surely wasn’t Hogwarts; he had never seen a room\nlike that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the\nbottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not\nnearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be\nwaiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all\nof their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were\ntalking to one another.\nThe basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry\ncould not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even\ncloser, tilting his head, trying to see . . .\nThe tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.\nDumbledore’s office gave an almighty lurch — Harry was thrown forward\nand pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin —\nBut his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through\nsomething icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool\n—\nAnd suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the\nroom inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at\nthe high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he\nhad just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.\nBreathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches\nand wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was\nlooking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-\nold boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to\nthe wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that"

        "text": "old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to\nthe wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that\nreverberated around the silent room.\nHe was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.\n“Professor!” Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. “I’m sorry — I didn’t\nmean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are\nwe?”\nBut Dumbledore didn’t move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like\nevery other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the\nroom, where there was a door.\nHarry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently\nwatchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. . . .\nOnce before, Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or\nhear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right\ninto somebody else’s memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken,\nsomething of the sort had happened again. . . .\nHarry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in\nfront of Dumbledore’s face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry,\nor indeed move at all. And that, in Harry’s opinion, settled the matter.\nDumbledore wouldn’t ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this\nwas not the present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn’t be that long ago . . . the\nDumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-\nday Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting\nfor?\nHarry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when\nobserving it from above, was almost certainly underground — more of a\ndungeon than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about\nthe place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these\nserried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so\nthat they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.\nBefore Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they\nwere, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and\nthree people entered — or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.\nHarry’s insides went cold. The dementors — tall, hooded creatures whose\nfaces were concealed — were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of\nthe room, each grasping one of the man’s arms with their dead and rotten-\nlooking hands. The man between them looked as though he was about to\nfaint, and Harry couldn’t blame him . . . he knew the dementors could not\ntouch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well.\nThe watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the\nchained chair and glided back out of the room. The door swung shut behind\nthem.\nHarry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was\nKarkaroff.\nUnlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee\nwere black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He\nwas shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair"

Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair\nglowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff’s arms, binding him\nthere.\n“Igor Karkaroff,” said a curt voice to Harry’s left. Harry looked around and\nsaw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch’s\nhair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. “You have\nbeen brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You\nhave given us to understand that you have important information for us.”\nKarkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.\n“I have, sir,” he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could\nstill hear the familiar unctuous note in it. “I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I\nwish to help. I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to round up the last\nof the Dark Lord’s supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. . . .”\nThere was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches\nwere surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then\nHarry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledore’s other side, a familiar,\ngrowling voice saying, “Filth.”\nHarry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad-Eye\nMoody was sitting there — except that there was a very noticeable difference\nin his appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both\nwere looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.\n“Crouch is going to let him out,” Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore.\n“He’s done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and\nCrouch is going to let him go if he’s got enough new names. Let’s hear his\ninformation, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors.”\nDumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.\n“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?” said\nMoody with a sardonic smile.\n“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long felt the\nMinistry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”\n“But for filth like this . . .” Moody said softly.\n“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch. “Let us hear\nthem, please.”\n“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-\nNot-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that\nwe — I mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very deeply, that I\never counted myself among them —”\n“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.\n“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew\nexactly who we all were —”\n“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,\nKarkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody."

People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give\nthis information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled\nwith a remorse so deep I can barely —”\n“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.\nKarkaroff drew a deep breath.\n“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him torture countless\nMuggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.”\n“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.\n“We have already apprehended Dolohov,” said Crouch. “He was caught\nshortly after yourself.”\n“Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. “I — I am delighted to hear it!”\nBut he didn’t look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real\nblow to him. One of his names was worthless.\n“Any others?” said Crouch coldly.\n“Why, yes . . . there was Rosier,” said Karkaroff hurriedly. “Evan Rosier.”\n“Rosier is dead,” said Crouch. “He was caught shortly after you were too.\nHe preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle.”\n“Took a bit of me with him, though,” whispered Moody to Harry’s right.\nHarry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large\nchunk out of his nose to Dumbledore.\n“No — no more than Rosier deserved!” said Karkaroff, a real note of panic\nin his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his\ninformation would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff’s eyes darted\ntoward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still\nstood, waiting.\n“Any more?” said Crouch.\n“Yes!” said Karkaroff. “There was Travers — he helped murder the\nMcKinnons! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced\ncountless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry\nitself!”\nHarry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching\ncrowd was all murmuring together.\n“Rookwood?” said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him,\nwho began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. “Augustus Rookwood of\nthe Department of Mysteries?”\n“The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly. “I believe he used a network of\nwell-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information\n—”\n“But Travers and Mulciber we have,” said Mr. Crouch. “Very well,\nKarkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide —”\n“Not yet!” cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. “Wait, I have more!”"

Severus Snape is a Death Eater!”\nDumbledore had gotten to his feet.\n“I have given evidence already on this matter,” he said calmly. “Severus\nSnape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord\nVoldemort’s downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now\nno more a Death Eater than I am.”\nHarry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep\nskepticism behind Dumbledore’s back.\n“Very well, Karkaroff,” Crouch said coldly, “you have been of assistance. I\nshall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. . . .”\nMr. Crouch’s voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was\ndissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could\nsee only his own body — all else was swirling darkness. . . .\nAnd then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still\non the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere\nseemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all\naround the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at\nsome sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of\nbenches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and\nwas sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger\nRita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again,\nwearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer,\ngaunter. . . . Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day . . .\na different trial.\nThe door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.\nThis was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman\nwho was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn’t\nbroken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he\nsat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound\nKarkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the\nwatching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.\n“Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of\nMagical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters,”\nsaid Mr. Crouch. “We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to\nreach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we\npronounce judgment?”"

Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring\ndown at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.\n“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone muttered dryly to\nDumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there\nagain. “If I didn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have said some of those\nBludgers had permanently affected his brain. . . .”\n“Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord\nVoldemort’s supporters,” said Mr. Crouch. “For this, I suggest a term of\nimprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than —”\nBut there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the\nwitches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even\ntheir fists, at Mr. Crouch.\n“But I’ve told you, I had no idea!” Bagman called earnestly over the crowd’s\nbabble, his round blue eyes widening. “None at all! Old Rookwood was a\nfriend of my dad’s . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who!\nI thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept\ntalking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on . . . once my Quidditch\ndays are over, you know . . . I mean, I can’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for\nthe rest of my life, can I?”\nThere were titters from the crowd.\n“It will be put to the vote,” said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-\nhand side of the dungeon. “The jury will please raise their hands . . . those in\nfavor of imprisonment . . .”\nHarry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person\nraised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to\nclap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.\n“Yes?” barked Crouch.\n“We’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance\nfor England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,” the witch\nsaid breathlessly.\nMr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now.\nBagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.\n“Despicable,” Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman\nwalked out of the dungeon. “Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day\nLudo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . .”\nAnd the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked\naround.

She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling\nhands. Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer\nthan ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.\n“Bring them in,” he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.\nThe door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time,\nflanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to\nlook up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to one another.\nThe dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with\nchained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man\nwho stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-looking man,\nwhose eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark\nhair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it\nwere a throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of\npetrified. He was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his freckled\nskin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward\nand forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.\nCrouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there\nwas pure hatred in his face.\n“You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law,” he said\nclearly, “so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous —”\n“Father,” said the boy with the straw-colored hair. “Father . . . please . . .”\n“— that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,” said Crouch,\nspeaking more loudly, drowning out his son’s voice. “We have heard the\nevidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror —\nFrank Longbottom — and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing\nhim to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He-\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named —”\n“Father, I didn’t!” shrieked the boy in chains below. “I didn’t, I swear it,\nFather, don’t send me back to the dementors —”\n“You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of using the Cruciatus\nCurse on Frank Longbottom’s wife, when he would not give you information.\nYou planned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power, and to\nresume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask\nthe jury —”\n“Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch\nbegan to sob, rocking backward and forward. “Mother, stop him, Mother, I\ndidn’t do it, it wasn’t me!”\n“I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise their hands if they\nbelieve, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon"

        "text": "believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon\nraised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for\nBagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.\n“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t know! Don’t send\nme there, don’t let him!”\nThe dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys’ three\ncompanions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded\neyes looked up at Crouch and called, “The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch!\nThrow us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us,\nhe will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful!\nWe alone tried to find him!”\nBut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could\nsee their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering,\nsome of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the\nboy continued to struggle.\n“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch. “I’m your son!”\n“You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly.\n“I have no son!”\nThe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She\nhad fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.\n“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his\nmouth. “Take them away, and may they rot there!”\n“Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father, please!”\n“I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,” said a quiet voice in\nHarry’s ear.\nHarry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.\nThere was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch’s son\nbeing dragged away by the dementors — and there was an Albus Dumbledore\non his left, looking right at him.\n“Come,” said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under\nHarry’s elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved\naround him; for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he\nhad done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what\nseemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore’s sunlit office. The stone basin\nwas shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was\nstanding beside him.\n“Professor,” Harry gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I didn’t mean — the\ncabinet door was sort of open and —”\n“I quite understand,” said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over\nto his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind\nit. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.\nHarry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their\noriginal, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.\n“What is it?” Harry asked shakily.\n“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes find, and I"

It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes find, and I\nam sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and\nmemories crammed into my mind.”\n“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything\nof the sort.\n“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, “I use the\nPensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours\nthem into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It becomes easier to\nspot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”\n“You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts?” Harry said, staring at the swirling\nwhite substance in the basin.\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”\nDumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip\ninto his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair\nseemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a\nglistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the\nPensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry,\nastonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl.\nDumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled\nit, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold . . . and Harry\nsaw his own face change smoothly into Snape’s, who opened his mouth and\nspoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.\n“It’s coming back . . . Karkaroff’s too . . . stronger and clearer than ever . . .”\n“A connection I could have made without assistance,” Dumbledore sighed,\n“but never mind.” He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at\nHarry, who was gaping at Snape’s face, which was continuing to swirl around\nthe bowl. “I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting\nand put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door\nproperly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.”\n“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.\nDumbledore shook his head. “Curiosity is not a sin,” he said. “But we\nshould exercise caution with our curiosity . . . yes, indeed . . .”\nFrowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of\nhis wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about\nsixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took\nno notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her\nvoice echoed as Snape’s had done, as though it were coming from the depths\nof the stone basin. “He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was\nonly teasing him, sir, I only said I’d seen him kissing Florence behind the\ngreenhouses last Thursday. . . .”\n“But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently\nrevolving girl, “why did you have to follow him in the first place?”\n“Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her. “Is that — was that Bertha"

He knew, of course, that\nDumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of\nDumbledore as an old man.\n“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Before you got lost in my thoughts,\nyou wanted to tell me something.”\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Professor — I was in Divination just now, and — er —\nI fell asleep.”\nHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore\nmerely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.”\n“Well, I had a dream,” said Harry. “A dream about Lord Voldemort. He\nwas torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail —”\n“I do know,” said Dumbledore promptly. “Please continue.”\n“Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail’s\nblunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said,\nWormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair.\nHe said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus\nCurse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt,” Harry said. “It woke me up, it hurt\nso badly.”\nDumbledore merely looked at him.\n“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.\n“I see,” said Dumbledore quietly. “I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any\nother time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?”\n“No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer?” said Harry,\nastonished.\n“You are not Sirius’s only correspondent,” said Dumbledore. “I have also\nbeen in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who\nsuggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.”\nDumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every\nnow and then, he placed his wand-tip to his temple, removed another shining\nsilver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to\nswirl so fast that Harry couldn’t make out anything clearly: It was merely a\nblur of color.\n“Professor?” he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.\nDumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.\n“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.\n“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”\nDumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I\nhave a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both\nwhen Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong\nsurge of hatred.”\n“But . . . why?”\n“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said\nDumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”"

Harry — did\nyou see Voldemort?”\n“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have\nbeen anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he?\nBut . . . but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.\n“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing\nacross the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand-tip to his temple\nand adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the\nPensieve.\n“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s getting stronger?”\n“Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was\nthe characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other\noccasions, and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing\nright through him in a way that even Moody’s magical eye could not. “Once\nagain, Harry, I can only give you my suspicions.”\nDumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.\n“The years of Voldemort’s ascent to power,” he said, “were marked with\ndisappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where\nVoldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has\ndisappeared . . . within these very grounds. And there was a third\ndisappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any\nimportance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in\nthe village where Voldemort’s father grew up, and he has not been seen since\nlast August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my\nMinistry friends.”\nDumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.\n“These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees —\nas you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.”\nHarry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting\nthoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his\ncuriosity held him in his chair.\n“Professor?” he said again.\n“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore.\n“Er . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was in . . . in the\nPensieve?”\n“You could,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I attended it many times, but some\ntrials come back to me more clearly than others . . . particularly now. . . .”\n“You know — you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch’s\nson? Well . . . were they talking about Neville’s parents?”\nDumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. “Has Neville never told you why\nhe has been brought up by his grandmother?” he said.\nHarry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to\nask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.\n“Yes, they were talking about Neville’s parents,” said Dumbledore. “His"

He and his wife were\ntortured for information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after he lost his\npowers, as you heard.”\n“So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.\n“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard\nthere before. “They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for\nMagical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his\ngrandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him.”\nHarry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years,\nbothered to find out . . .\n“The Longbottoms were very popular,” said Dumbledore. “The attacks on\nthem came after Voldemort’s fall from power, just when everyone thought\nthey were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never\nknown. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it.\nUnfortunately, the Longbottoms’ evidence was — given their condition —\nnone too reliable.”\n“Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been involved?” said Harry slowly.\nDumbledore shook his head.\n“As to that, I have no idea.”\nHarry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl.\nThere were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned\nthe guilt of living people. . . .\n“Er,” he said, “Mr. Bagman . . .”\n“. . . has never been accused of any Dark activity since,” said Dumbledore\ncalmly.\n“Right,” said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again,\nwhich were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding\nthoughts. “And . . . er . . .”\nBut the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him. Snape’s face was\nswimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then\nup at Harry.\n“No more has Professor Snape,” he said.\nHarry looked into Dumbledore’s light blue eyes, and the thing he really\nwanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.\n“What made you think he’d really stopped supporting Voldemort,\nProfessor?”\nDumbledore held Harry’s gaze for a few seconds, and then said, “That,\nHarry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself.”\nHarry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry,\nyet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood\nup, and so did Dumbledore.\n“Harry,” he said as Harry reached the door. “Please do not speak about\nNeville’s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he\nis ready.”\n“Yes, Professor,” said Harry, turning to go.\n“And —”\nHarry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit\nfrom beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up\nlate in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until\nHarry’s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant\nabout a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to\nsiphon them off.\nRon stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver\nslightly, even though the evening was warm.\n“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said. “He really trusts Snape, even though he\nknows he was a Death Eater?”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\nHermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her\nforehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as\nthough she could have done with a Pensieve.\n“Rita Skeeter,” she muttered finally.\n“How can you be worrying about her now?” said Ron, in utter disbelief.\n“I’m not worrying about her,” Hermione said to her knees. “I’m just\nthinking . . . remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? ‘I know\nthings about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl.’ This is what she\nmeant, isn’t it? She reported his trial, she knew he’d passed information to the\nDeath Eaters. And Winky too, remember . . . ‘Ludo Bagman’s a bad wizard.’\nMr. Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it\nat home.”\n“Yeah, but Bagman didn’t pass information on purpose, did he?”\nHermione shrugged.\n“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?” Ron said, turning\nback to Harry.\n“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared\nnear the Beauxbatons carriage.”\n“We never thought of her, did we?” said Ron slowly. “Mind you, she’s\ndefinitely got giant blood, and she doesn’t want to admit it —”\n“Of course she doesn’t,” said Hermione sharply, looking up. “Look what\nhappened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge,\njumping to conclusions about her, just because she’s part giant. Who needs\nthat sort of prejudice? I’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that’s what I’d\nget for telling the truth.”\nHermione looked at her watch. “We haven’t done any practicing!” she said,\nlooking shocked. “We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to\nreally get down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get some sleep.”\nHarry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory.

As Harry took off\nhis glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to\nhave parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy\nfrom strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville’s snores, he\nthought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness,\nHarry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr.\nand Mrs. Longbottom. . . . He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s\nson and his companions had been dragged from the court by the\ndementors. . . . He understood how they had felt. . . . Then he remembered\nthe milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had\ndied a year later. . . .\nIt was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the\ndarkness, it all came back to Voldemort. . . . He was the one who had torn\nthese families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .\nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which\nwould finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their\nefforts into helping Harry prepare.\n“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out\nto them and said he didn’t mind practicing on his own for a while, “at least\nwe’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We’d never have found\nout about all these hexes in class.”\n“Good training for when we’re all Aurors,” said Ron excitedly, attempting\nthe Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it\nstop dead in midair.\nThe mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again.\nEveryone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week\nbefore the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment.\nHe felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and\ndangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had\nmanaged to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers\nbefore now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself\nfor what lay ahead.\nTired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school,\nProfessor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty\nTransfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the\nImpediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor\nCurse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the\nFour-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand\npoint due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the\nright direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield\nCharm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around\nhimself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a\nwell-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten\nminutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.\n“You’re still doing really well, though,” Hermione said encouragingly,"

He\nwas staring down onto the grounds. “What’s Malfoy doing?”\nHarry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing\nin the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a\nlookout; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth\nand speaking into it.\n“He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry curiously.\n“He can’t be,” said Hermione, “I’ve told you, those sorts of things don’t\nwork around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,” she added briskly, turning away\nfrom the window and moving back into the middle of the room, “let’s try that\nShield Charm again.”\nSirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to\nconcentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned\nthemselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in every letter that\nwhatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry’s\nresponsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.\nIf Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to\nensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are\nunder Dumbledore’s protection, but all the same, take no risks:\nConcentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn\nour attention to other matters.\nHarry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they\nwere not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one\nthing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to\nprepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well\nor badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an\nenormous relief.\nBreakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the\nthird task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from\nSirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw\nprint on its front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived\nfor Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She\nunfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of\npumpkin juice all over it.\n“What?” said Harry and Ron together, staring at her.\n“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight,\nbut Ron grabbed it. He stared at the headline and said, “No way. Not today.\nThat old cow.”\n“What?” said Harry. “Rita Skeeter again?”\n“No,” said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper\nout of sight.\n“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.\n“No,” said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.\nBut before Harry could demand to see the paper, Draco Malfoy shouted"

Potter! How’s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you’re not\ngoing to go berserk on us?”\nMalfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and\ndown the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry’s reaction.\n“Let me see it,” Harry said to Ron. “Give it here.”\nVery reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and\nfound himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:\nHARRY POTTER\n“DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”\nThe boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is\nunstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special\nCorrespondent. Alarming evidence has recently come to light\nabout Harry Potter’s strange behavior, which casts doubts upon\nhis suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the\nTriwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.\nPotter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly\ncollapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in\nthe scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You-\nKnow-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway\nthrough a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter\nwitnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar\nwas hurting too badly to continue studying.\nIt is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital for\nMagical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain was affected\nby the attack inflicted upon him by You-Know-Who, and that\nhis insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his\ndeep-seated confusion.\n“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This\ncould be a plea for attention.”\nThe Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts\nabout Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of\nHogwarts, has carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.\n“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco Malfoy, a\nHogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks on students\na couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was\nbehind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling\nclub and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up,\nthough. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too.\nWe think he’d do anything for a bit of power.”\nParseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long\nbeen considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous\nParselmouth of our times is none other than You-Know-Who\nhimself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who\nwished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any\nwizard who could speak Parseltongue “as worthy of\ninvestigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of\nanybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often\nused in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically\nassociated with evildoers.” Similarly, “anyone who seeks out\nthe company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants"

Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark\nArts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of\nwhich takes place this evening.\n“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.\nOver at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at\nhim, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and\nwaggling their tongues like snakes.\n“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said. “There’s no\nway she was there, there’s no way she could’ve heard —”\n“The window was open,” said Harry. “I opened it to breathe.”\n“You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said. “Your voice\ncouldn’t have carried all the way down to the grounds!”\n“Well, you’re the one who’s supposed to be researching magical methods of\nbugging!” said Harry. “You tell me how she did it!”\n“I’ve been trying!” said Hermione. “But I . . . but . . .”\nAn odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione’s face. She slowly\nraised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.\n“Are you all right?” said Ron, frowning at her.\n“Yes,” said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair\nagain, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an\ninvisible walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.\n“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space. “I think I know . . .\nbecause then no one would be able to see . . . even Moody . . . and she’d have\nbeen able to get onto the window ledge . . . but she’s not allowed . . . she’s\ndefinitely not allowed . . . I think we’ve got her! Just give me two seconds in the\nlibrary — just to make sure!”\nWith that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great\nHall.\n“Oi!” Ron called after her. “We’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten\nminutes! Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, “she must really hate that\nSkeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What’re you going to do\nin Binns’s class — read again?”\nExempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had\nbeen sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for\nthe third task.\n“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came\nwalking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.\n“Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after\nbreakfast,” she said.\n“But the task’s not till tonight!” said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled\neggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.\n“I’m aware of that, Potter,” she said. “The champions’ families are invited to"

This is simply a chance for you to greet them.”\nShe moved away. Harry gaped after her.\n“She doesn’t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?” he asked Ron\nblankly.\n“Dunno,” said Ron. “Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going to be late for Binns.\nSee you later.”\nHarry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur\nDelacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the\nside chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward.\nHarry stayed where he was. He really didn’t want to go into the chamber. He\nhad no family — no family who would turn up to see him risk his life,\nanyway. But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to\nthe library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber\nopened, and Cedric stuck his head out.\n“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!”\nUtterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn’t possibly be here,\ncould they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.\nCedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a\ncorner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian.\nHe had inherited his father’s hooked nose. On the other side of the room,\nFleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur’s little sister,\nGabrielle, was holding her mother’s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved\nback, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the\nfireplace, beaming at him.\n“Surprise!” Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked\nover to them. “Thought we’d come and watch you, Harry!” She bent down\nand kissed him on the cheek.\n“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. “Charlie\nwanted to come, but he couldn’t get time off. He said you were incredible\nagainst the Horntail.”\nFleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her\nmother’s shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long\nhair or earrings with fangs on them.\n“This is really nice of you,” Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. “I thought for\na moment — the Dursleys —”\n“Hmm,” said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from\ncriticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they\nwere mentioned.\n“It’s great being back here,” said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet,\nthe Fat Lady’s friend, winked at him from her frame). “Haven’t seen this place\nfor five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?”\n“Oh yeah,” said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.\n“And the Fat Lady?” said Bill."

As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.\n“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up and down. “Bet you’re\nnot feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are\nyou?”\n“What?” said Harry.\n“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father.\n“He’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard\nTournament — you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts\nchampion.”\n“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly\nenough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs.\nWeasley and Bill. “Still . . . you’ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before,\nhaven’t you?”\n“Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!” Mrs. Weasley\nsaid angrily. “I would have thought you’d know that, working at the\nMinistry!”\nMr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his\nwife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.\nHarry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with\nBill and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the\nDurmstrang ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow,\nwhich had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length\nabout the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.\n“How’s Percy?” Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.\n“Not good,” said Bill.\n“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing\naround. “The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but\nPercy’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has\nbeen sending in. They seem to think there’s a chance they weren’t genuinely\nwritten by him. Percy’s been under a lot of strain. They’re not letting him fill\nin for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be\ndoing it.”\nThey returned to the castle for lunch.\n“Mum — Bill!” said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor\ntable. “What’re you doing here?”"

How was your exam?”\n“Oh . . . okay,” said Ron. “Couldn’t remember all the goblin rebels’ names,\nso I invented a few. It’s all right,” he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty,\nwhile Mrs. Weasley looked stern, “they’re all called stuff like Bodrod the\nBearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn’t hard.”\nFred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was\nhaving such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow;\nhe had forgotten to worry about that evening’s task, and not until Hermione\nturned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a\nbrainwave about Rita Skeeter.\n“Are you going to tell us — ?”\nHermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.\n“Hello, Hermione,” said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.\n“Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs.\nWeasley’s face.\nHarry looked between them, then said, “Mrs. Weasley, you didn’t believe\nthat rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione’s\nnot my girlfriend.”\n“Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley. “No — of course I didn’t!”\nBut she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.\nHarry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk\naround the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast.\nLudo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman\nlooked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame\nMaxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was\nconcentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid\nkept glancing along the table at her.\nThere were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel\nreally nervous now, didn’t eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began\nto fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff\ntable, and silence fell.\n“Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes’ time, I will be asking you to make\nyour way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the\nTriwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down\nto the stadium now.”\nHarry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the\nWeasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of\nthe Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.\n“Feeling all right, Harry?” Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps\nonto the grounds. “Confident?”\n“I’m okay,” said Harry.

A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of\nit. There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The\npassage beyond it looked dark and creepy.\nFive minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited\nvoices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their\nseats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to\nappear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor\nFlitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the\nchampions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all\nexcept Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.\n“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said Professor\nMcGonagall to the champions. “If you get into difficulty, and wish to be\nrescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do\nyou understand?”\nThe champions nodded.\n“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.\n“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away\nin different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now\npointed his wand at his throat, muttered, “Sonorus,” and his magically\nmagnified voice echoed into the stands.\n“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard\nTournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently\nstand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory\nand Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause\nsent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. “In\nsecond place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang\nInstitute!” More applause. “And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of\nBeauxbatons Academy!”\nHarry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione\napplauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and\nthey waved back, beaming at him.\n“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman. “Three — two —\none —”\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward\ninto the maze.\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether\nbecause they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the\nsound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the\nmaze. Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his\nwand, muttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.\n“See you,” Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.\nHarry heard Bagman’s whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the"

His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned\nright, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far\nahead as possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.\nBagman’s whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the\nchampions were now inside.\nHarry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched\nwas upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the\nsky overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.\n“Point Me,” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.\nThe wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge.\nThat way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the\ncenter of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right\nagain as soon as possible.\nThe path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and\ntook it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn’t know why, but the\nlack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by\nnow? It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security.\nThen he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to\nattack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path\non the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe\nwas smoking.\n“Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewts!” he hissed. “They’re enormous — I only\njust got away!”\nHe shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put\nplenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again.\nThen, as he turned a corner, he saw . . . a dementor gliding toward him.\nTwelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands\noutstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could\nhear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew\nwhat he had to do. . . .\nHe summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his\nmight on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and\nHermione, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto Patronum!”\nA silver stag erupted from the end of Harry’s wand and galloped toward the\ndementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry\nhad never seen a dementor stumble.\n“Hang on!” he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus.\n“You’re a boggart! Riddikulus!”\nThere was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke.\nThe silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could\nhave used some company . . . but he moved on, quickly and quietly as\npossible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.\nLeft . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends."

This looked\nlike some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to\nblast it out of the way.\n“Reducto!” he said.\nThe spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he\nshould have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What\nwould happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or\nshould he double back?\nHe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.\n“Fleur?” Harry yelled.\nThere was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her?\nHer scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep\nbreath and ran through the enchanted mist.\nThe world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with\nhis hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the\nbottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there,\nterrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now\nbecome the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched\nendlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall\naway from the earth completely.\nThink, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think . . .\nBut not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a\nsudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear\nthe blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices — try and move, or send\nup red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.\nHe shut his eyes, so he wouldn’t be able to see the view of endless space\nbelow him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy\nceiling.\nImmediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto\nthe wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a\ndeep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back\nover his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled\ninnocently at him in the moonlight.\nHe paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of\nFleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was\nshe all right? There was no sign of red sparks — did that mean she had got\nherself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn’t reach her\nwand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at\nthe same time, he couldn’t help thinking, One champion down . . .\nThe Cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no\nlonger in the running.

Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found himself\nchampion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in\nfront of the rest of the school. . . .\nHe met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he\ntook the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog\nalong it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the\nhedge walls. Then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a\nBlast-Ended Skrewt.\nCedric was right — it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a\ngiant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick\narmor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.\n“Stupefy!”\nThe spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time,\nbut could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt\nissued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.\n“Impedimenta!” Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and\nricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.\n“IMPEDIMENTA!”\nThe skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it\non its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it\nand ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not\npermanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.\nHe took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing\nhimself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again,\nbacktracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest.\nHe had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard\nsomething in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.\n“What are you doing?” yelled Cedric’s voice. “What the hell d’you think\nyou’re doing?”\nAnd then Harry heard Krum’s voice.\n“Crucio!”\nThe air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting\nup his path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s. When none appeared, he tried\nthe Reductor Curse again. It wasn’t very effective, but it burned a small hole in\nthe hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles\nand branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it,\ntearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on\nthe ground, Krum standing over him.\nHarry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked\nup. Krum turned and began to run.\n“Stupefy!” Harry yelled.\nThe spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward,\nand lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who\nhad stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face."

I don’t believe it . . . he crept up behind\nme. . . . I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . .”\nCedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.\n“I can’t believe this . . .

Someone’ll come\nand collect him . . . otherwise he’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.”\n“He’d deserve it,” Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and\nshot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum,\nmarking the spot where he lay.\nHarry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around\nthem. Then Cedric said, “Well . . . I s’pose we’d better go on. . . .”\n“What?” said Harry. “Oh . . . yeah . . . right . . .”\nIt was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against\nKrum — now the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two\nof them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left,\nand Cedric right. Cedric’s footsteps soon died away.\nHarry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he\nwas moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His\ndesire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could\nhardly believe what he’d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse\non a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody\nhad told them. Krum surely couldn’t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that\nbadly. . . . Harry sped up.\nEvery so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him\nfeel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a\nlong, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight\nhit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in\nhis Monster Book of Monsters.\nIt was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and\na long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a\nwoman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he\napproached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to\nspring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then\nshe spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice."

If the riddle was too hard,\nhe could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an\nalternative route to the center.\n“Okay,” he said. “Can I hear the riddle?”\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path,\nand recited:\n“First think of the person who lives in disguise,\nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\nNext, tell me what’s always the last thing to mend,\nThe middle of middle and end of the end?\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard\nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.\nNow string them together, and answer me this,\nWhich creature would you be unwilling to kiss?”\nHarry gaped at her.\n“Could I have it again . . . more slowly?” he asked tentatively.\nShe blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem.\n“All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to kiss?” Harry asked.\nShe merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a “yes.” Harry\ncast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn’t want to kiss;\nhis immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that\nwasn’t the answer. He’d have to try and work out the clues. . . .\n“A person in disguise,” Harry muttered, staring at her, “who lies . . . er . . .\nthat’d be a — an imposter. No, that’s not my guess! A — a spy? I’ll come back\nto that . . . could you give me the next clue again, please?”\nShe repeated the next lines of the poem.\n“‘The last thing to mend,’” Harry repeated. “Er . . . no idea . . . ‘middle of\nmiddle’ . . . could I have the last bit again?”\nShe gave him the last four lines.\n“‘The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,’” said\nHarry. “Er . . . that’d be . . . er . . . hang on — ‘er’! Er’s a sound!”\nThe sphinx smiled at him.\n“Spy . . . er . . . spy . . . er . . .” said Harry, pacing up and down. “A creature\nI wouldn’t want to kiss . . . a spider!”\nThe sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and\nthen moved aside for him to pass.\n“Thanks!” said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.\nHe had to be close now, he had to be. . . .

His wand was telling him he was\nbang on course; as long as he didn’t meet anything too horrible, he might have\na chance. . . .\nHarry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. “Point Me!” he\nwhispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-\nhand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away.\nSuddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.\nCedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could\ntoward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much\ntaller, had much longer legs —\nThen Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving\nquickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast\nCedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen\nit —\n“Cedric!” Harry bellowed. “On your left!”\nCedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid\ncolliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric’s wand fly out\nof his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down\nupon Cedric.\n“Stupefy!” Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s gigantic, hairy black body,\nbut for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the\nspider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\n“Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!”\nBut it was no use — the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the\nspells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying\nglimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon\nhim.\nHe was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick\nit; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating\npain. He could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy!” too, but his spell had no more\neffect than Harry’s — Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers\nonce more and shouted “Expelliarmus!”\nIt worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant\nthat Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled\nbeneath him. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider’s\nunderbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted “Stupefy!” just as\nCedric yelled the same thing.\nThe two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled\nover sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle\nof hairy legs.\n“Harry!” he heard Cedric shouting. “You all right? Did it fall on you?”\n“No,” Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was"

He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the\nspider’s pincers on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking\nbadly and did not want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge,\ngasping for breath, and looked around.\nCedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming\nbehind him.\n“Take it, then,” Harry panted to Cedric. “Go on, take it. You’re there.”\nBut Cedric didn’t move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he\nturned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its\ngolden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto\nthe hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.\n“You take it. You should win. That’s twice you’ve saved my neck in here.”\n“That’s not how it’s supposed to work,” Harry said. He felt angry; his leg\nwas very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider,\nand after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he’d beaten Harry\nto ask Cho to the ball. “The one who reaches the cup first gets the points.\nThat’s you. I’m telling you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg.”\nCedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup,\nshaking his head.\n“No,” he said.\n“Stop being noble,” said Harry irritably. “Just take it, then we can get out of\nhere.”\nCedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.\n“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said. “I would’ve gone down in\nthe first task if you hadn’t told me what was coming.”\n“I had help on that too,” Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg\nwith his robes. “You helped me with the egg — we’re square.”\n“I had help on the egg in the first place,” said Cedric.\n“We’re still square,” said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as\nhe put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped\nhim.\n“You should’ve got more points on the second task,” said Cedric mulishly.\n“You stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should’ve done that.”\n“I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!” said\nHarry bitterly. “Just take the cup!”\n“No,” said Cedric.\nHe stepped over the spider’s tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him.\nCedric was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff\nHouse hadn’t had in centuries.\n“Go on,” Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every\nounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he\nseemed decided.\nHarry looked from Cedric to the cup.

He saw himself holding the\nTriwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho’s face shining with\nadmiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the\npicture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric’s shadowy, stubborn\nface.\n“Both of us,” Harry said.\n“What?”\n“We’ll take it at the same time. It’s still a Hogwarts victory. We’ll tie for it.”\nCedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.\n“You — you sure?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . we’ve helped each other out, haven’t we? We\nboth got here. Let’s just take it together.”\nFor a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn’t believe his ears; then\nhis face split in a grin.\n“You’re on,” he said. “Come here.”\nHe grabbed Harry’s arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward\nthe plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a\nhand out over one of the cup’s gleaming handles.\n“On three, right?” said Harry. “One — two — three —”\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the\nground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was\npulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.\n— T H I R T Y - T W O —\nFLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\nH\narry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way,\nand he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last.\nHe raised his head.\n“Where are we?” he said.\nCedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked\naround.\nThey had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously\ntraveled miles — perhaps hundreds of miles — for even the mountains\nsurrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and\novergrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a\nlarge yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could\njust make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\nCedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n“Did anyone tell you the Cup was a Portkey?” he asked.\n“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was\ncompletely silent and slightly eerie. “Is this supposed to be part of the task?”\n“I dunno,” said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. “Wands out, d’you\nreckon?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than\nhim.\nThey pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet\nagain, the strange feeling that they were being watched.\n“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.\nSquinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing\nnearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves.

Harry couldn’t make\nout a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell\nthat it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a\nhooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And — several paces\nnearer, the gap between them closing all the time — Harry saw that the thing\nin the person’s arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a bundle of robes?\nHarry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot\nhim a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\nIt stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For\na second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.\nAnd then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded with pain. It was agony\nsuch as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he\nput his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he\ncould see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\nFrom far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, “Kill the\nspare.”\nA swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the\nnight: “Avada Kedavra!”\nA blast of green light blazed through Harry’s eyelids, and he heard\nsomething heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached\nsuch a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was\nabout to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\nCedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\nFor a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric’s face, at\nhis open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted\nhouse, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then,\nbefore Harry’s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel\nanything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\nThe short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was\ndragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it\nflickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against\nit.\nTOM RIDDLE\nThe cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him\nfrom neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing\nfrom the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him — hit him\nwith a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the\nhood. It was Wormtail.\n“You!” he gasped.\nBut Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was\nbusy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably,\nfumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the\nheadstone that he couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some\nblack material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry’s\nmouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away.

Harry\ncouldn’t make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he\ncouldn’t turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what\nwas right in front of him.\nCedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him,\nglinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on the\nground at Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a\nbaby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully.\nHarry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly\nknew that he didn’t want to see what was in those robes . . . he didn’t want\nthat bundle opened. . . .\nHe could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake\nslithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied.\nWormtail’s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as\nthough he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back\nwithin Harry’s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to\nthe foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water — Harry could\nhear it slopping around — and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever\nused; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.\nThe thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more\npersistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying\nhimself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were\ncrackling flames beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.\nThe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not\nonly to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam\nwas thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The\nmovements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the\nhigh, cold voice again.\n“Hurry!”\nThe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have\nbeen encrusted with diamonds.\n“It is ready, Master.”\n“Now . . .” said the cold voice.\nWormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside\nthem, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material\nblocking his mouth.\nIt was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something\nugly, slimy, and blind — but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing\nWormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except\nthat Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-\nlooking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and\nits face — no child alive ever had a face like that — flat and snakelike, with\ngleaming red eyes.\nThe thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around"

For one moment, Harry\nsaw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the\npotion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a\nhiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the\nbottom with a soft thud.\nLet it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance,\nplease . . . let it drown. . . .\nWormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his\nwits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.\n“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!”\nThe surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as\na fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly\ninto the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent\nsparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.\nAnd now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver\ndagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.\n“Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will — revive — your\nmaster.”\nHe stretched his right hand out in front of him — the hand with the\nmissing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it\nupward.\nHarry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened\n— he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream\nthat pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been\nstabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard\nWormtail’s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was\ndropped into the cauldron. Harry couldn’t stand to look . . . but the potion\nhad turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry’s closed\neyelids. . . .\nWormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt\nWormtail’s anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right\nin front of him.\n“B-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken . . . you will . . . resurrect your foe.”\nHarry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . . . Squinting\ndown, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver\ndagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the\ncrook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes.\nWormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and\nheld it to Harry’s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it."

He took not the\nslightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground,\nnor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling\nHarry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-\nfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently\ntoo; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the\nground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the\nfoot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying.

After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry\nagain, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.\n“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,” he hissed\nsoftly. “A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both had\ntheir uses, did they not?

        "text": "and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?”\nAt the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members of the circle stirred,\nand some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.\n“It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .”\nOne of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle.\nTrembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.\n“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”\nVoldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.\n“Crucio!”\nThe Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the\nsound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought\ndesperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . .\nVoldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the\nground, gasping.\n“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for forgiveness?\nI do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years’\nrepayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt\nalready, have you not, Wormtail?”\nHe looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.\n“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends.\nYou deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don’t you?”\n“Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master . . . please . . .”\n“Yet you helped return me to my body,” said Voldemort coolly, watching\nWormtail sob on the ground. “Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped\nme . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .”\nVoldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of\nwhat looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand’s wake. Momentarily\nshapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human\nhand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon\nWormtail’s bleeding wrist.\nWormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he\nraised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached\nseamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed\nthe shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and\ncrushed it into powder.\n“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master . . . it is beautiful . . . thank you . . .\nthank you. . . .”\nHe scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort’s\nrobes.\n“May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,” said Voldemort.\n“No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .”\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful\nnew hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the\nman on Wormtail’s right.\n“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him. “I am told\nthat you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a\nrespectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-"

Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at\nthe Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies\nhave been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”\n“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius Malfoy’s voice swiftly\nfrom beneath the hood. “Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of\nyour whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could\nhave prevented me —”\n“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into\nthe sky last summer?” said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking\nabruptly. “Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed\nme. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.”\n“Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . .”\nVoldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space — large enough for\ntwo people — that separated Malfoy and the next man.\n“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort quietly. “But they are\nentombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than\nrenounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be\nhonored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our\nnatural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my\ndevoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .”\nHe walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused\nbefore others and spoke to them.\n“Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now,\nWormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair.\nLord Voldemort will provide. . . .”\n“Thank you, Master . . . thank you,” murmured Macnair.\n“And here” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures —\n“we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And\nyou, Goyle?”\nThey bowed clumsily, muttering dully.\n“Yes, Master . . .”\n“We will, Master. . . .”\n“The same goes for you, Nott,” said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a\nstooped figure in Mr. Goyle’s shadow.\n“My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful —”\n“That will do,” said Voldemort.\nHe had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his\nblank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.\n“And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service.\nOne, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me\nforever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most\nfaithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.”"

One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.”\nThere was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped\nforward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.\n“Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have\nachieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . .”\n“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort. “And it begins — and ends\n— with my young friend here.”\nHe walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole\ncircle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.\n“You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?”\nVoldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so\nfiercely that he almost screamed in agony. “You all know that on the night I\nlost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the\nattempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I\nadmit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.”\nVoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to\nHarry’s cheek.\n“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is old magic,\nI should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I\ncan touch him now.”\nHarry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his\nhead would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took\nthe finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.\n“I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the\nwoman’s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain\nbeyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped\nfrom my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I\nwas alive. What I was, even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than\nanybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal — to\nconquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my\nexperiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should\nhave done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and\nwithout the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that\nmight have helped me required the use of a wand. . . .\n“I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to"

I could possess the bodies of others. But\nI dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors\nwere still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals —\nsnakes, of course, being my preference — but I was little better off inside them\nthan as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and\nmy possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . .\n“Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured.

Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been\ndreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore’s school . . . he was easy\nto bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I\ntook possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my\norders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone. I\nwas not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again,\nby Harry Potter. . . .”\nSilence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree.\nThe Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks\nfixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.\n“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had\nbeen,” Voldemort continued. “I returned to my hiding place far away, and I\nwill not pretend to you that I didn’t then fear that I might never regain my\npowers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I\nwould be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now,\nthat any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .”\nOne or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but\nVoldemort took no notice.\n“And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it\nhappened at last . . . a servant returned to me.

For, hungry\none night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he\nfoolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there,\nbut one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic.\n“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been\nthe end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail —\ndisplaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him —\nconvinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He\noverpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might\nhave ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for\n— with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information.\n“She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts\nthis year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be\nonly too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many\nthings . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were\npowerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind\nand body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose.\nI could not possess her. I disposed of her.”\nVoldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.\n“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed\nhim dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he\nwas the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail\nwas able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a\nrudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while\nawaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own\ninvention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red eyes fell\nupon the continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood,\nand the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost\nhuman form, and strong enough to travel.\n“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone anymore, for I knew\nthat Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing\nto embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights\nlower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength.\n“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion\nthat revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one\nof them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a\nservant. . . .\n“My father’s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here,"

For he has been better protected than I\nthink even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago,\nwhen it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future. Dumbledore invoked an\nancient magic, to ensure the boy’s protection as long as he is in his relations’\ncare. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the\nQuidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there,\naway from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to\nattempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy\nwould return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that\nMuggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him?\n“Why . . . by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of course. Use my one\nfaithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy’s name was\nentered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy\nwon the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the Cup\nwhich my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him\nhere, beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and protection, and into my\nwaiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my\ndownfall. . . .”\nVoldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his\nwand.\n“Crucio!”\nIt was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones\nwere on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling\nmadly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black out . . . to die . . .\nAnd then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to\nthe headstone of Voldemort’s father, looking up into those bright red eyes\nthrough a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death\nEaters’ laughter.\n“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever\nhave been stronger than me,” said Voldemort. “But I want there to be no\nmistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I\nam now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of\nyou all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for\nhim. I will give him his chance.

Wormtail\nraised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and\nthen, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.\nThere was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered\nrunning for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the\novergrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle\naround him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters\nshould have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place\nwhere Cedric’s body lay and returned with Harry’s wand, which he thrust\nroughly into Harry’s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed\nhis place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.\n“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” said Voldemort softly,\nhis red eyes glinting through the darkness.\nAt these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the\ndueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. . . . All he had\nlearned there was the Disarming Spell, “Expelliarmus” . . . and what use would\nit be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was\nsurrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had\nnever learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was\nfacing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable\nAvada Kedavra curse — and Voldemort was right — his mother was not here\nto die for him this time. . . . He was quite unprotected. . . .\n“We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort, bending a little, but\nkeeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. “Come, the niceties must be\nobserved. . . . Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to\ndeath, Harry. . . .”\nThe Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemort’s lipless mouth was\nsmiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him\nbefore killing him . . . he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .\n“I said, bow,” Voldemort said, raising his wand — and Harry felt his spine\ncurve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward,\nand the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.\n“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure\nbearing down upon Harry lifted too. “And now you face me, like a man . . .\nstraight-backed and proud, the way your father died. . . .\n“And now — we duel.”"

The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew\nwhere he was. . . . White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his\nhead was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than\nhe’d ever screamed in his life —\nAnd then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was\nshaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut\noff; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they\npushed him away, back toward Voldemort.\n“A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with\nexcitement, “a little pause . . . That hurt, didn’t it, Harry? You don’t want me\nto do that again, do you?”\nHarry didn’t answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes\nwere telling him so . . . he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do\nabout it . . . but he wasn’t going to play along. He wasn’t going to obey\nVoldemort . . . he wasn’t going to beg. . . .\n“I asked you whether you want me to do that again,” said Voldemort softly.\n“Answer me!

Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though\nhe were floating, dreaming . . . just answer no . . . say no . . . just answer no. . . .\nI will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won’t answer. . . .\nJust answer no. . . .\nI won’t do it, I won’t say it. . . .\nJust answer no. . . .\n“I WON’T!”\nAnd these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they echoed through the\ngraveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had\nbeen thrown over him — back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had\nleft all over his body — back rushed the realization of where he was, and what\nhe was facing. . . .\n“You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not\nlaughing now. “You won’t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach\nyou before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?”\nVoldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes\nborn of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he\nrolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s father, and he heard it\ncrack as the curse missed him.\n“We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry,” said Voldemort’s soft, cold\nvoice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. “You cannot hide from\nme.

Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that\nVoldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and\nvibrating.\nAnd then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet\nlift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air,\ntheir wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They\nglided away from the tombstone of Voldemort’s father and then came to rest\non a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters\nwere shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing\nin, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at\ntheir heels, some of them drawing their wands —\nThe golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the\nwands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry\nand Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a\ngolden, dome-shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters\ncircled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . .\n“Do nothing!” Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his\nred eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to\nbreak the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry’s; Harry held\nonto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained\nunbroken. “Do nothing unless I command you!” Voldemort shouted to the\nDeath Eaters.\nAnd then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. . . .

It was the sound he connected with\nDumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .\nDon’t break the connection.\nI know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn’t . . . but no sooner had he\nthought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to\nvibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and\nVoldemort changed too . . . it was as though large beads of light were sliding\nup and down the thread connecting the wands — Harry felt his wand give a\nshudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his\nway. . . . The direction of the beam’s movement was now toward him, from\nVoldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . .\nAs the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry’s wand-tip, the wood\nbeneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer\nthat bead moved, the harder Harry’s wand vibrated; he was sure his wand\nwould not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter\nunder his fingers —\nHe concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back\ntoward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and\nslowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they\nbegan to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort’s wand that was\nvibrating extra-hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost\nfearful. . . .\nOne of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort’s\nwand. Harry didn’t understand why he was doing it, didn’t know what it\nmight achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on\nforcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .\nvery slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a\nmoment . . . and then it connected. . . .\nAt once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then\n— Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out\nof the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made\nWormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began\nto blossom from Voldemort’s wand-tip, a great, grayish something, that\nlooked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . .

Harry caught it by the handle —\nHe heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the\njerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding\nhim away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They\nwere going back.\n— T H I R T Y - F I V E —\nVERITASERUM\nH\narry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into\ngrass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while\nthe Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move.\nAll the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was\nswimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying\nlike the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the\ntwo things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard\nCup and Cedric’s body. He felt as though he would slide away into the\nblackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them.\nShock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the\ngrass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to\nhappen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .\nA torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices\neverywhere, footsteps, screams. . . .

The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them,\npushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with\ntheir footsteps.\nHe had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising\nabove him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.\nHarry let go of the Cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly.\nHe raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore’s wrist, while Dumbledore’s\nface swam in and out of focus.\n“He’s back,” Harry whispered. “He’s back.

What’s happened?”\nThe face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked\nwhite, appalled.\n“My God — Diggory!” it whispered. “Dumbledore — he’s dead!”\nThe words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it\nto those around them . . . and then others shouted it — screeched it — into\nthe night — “He’s dead!” “He’s dead!” “Cedric Diggory!

Then\nDumbledore’s face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.\n“Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”\n“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered — it seemed\nimportant to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him back to his\nparents. . . .”\n“That’s right, Harry . . . just let go now. . . .”\nDumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old\nand thin, raised Harry from the ground and set him on his feet. Harry swayed.\nHis head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight.\nThe crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on\nhim — “What’s happened?” “What’s wrong with him?” “Diggory’s dead!”\n“He’ll need to go to the hospital wing!” Fudge was saying loudly. “He’s ill,\nhe’s injured — Dumbledore, Diggory’s parents, they’re here, they’re in the\nstands. . . .”\n“I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him —”\n“No, I would prefer —”\n“Dumbledore, Amos Diggory’s running . . . he’s coming over. . . .

Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and\nshouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him\nback to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship,\nHarry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.\n“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the\nstone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad-Eye Moody.\n“Cup was a Portkey,” said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. “Took\nme and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . .

You’re sure he’s back? How did he do it?”\n“He took stuff from his father’s grave, and from Wormtail, and me,” said\nHarry.

They returned?”\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Loads of them . . .”\n“How did he treat them?” Moody asked quietly. “Did he forgive them?”\nBut Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he\nshould have said it straightaway —\n“There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death Eater here — they put\nmy name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end —”\nHarry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.\n“I know who the Death Eater is,” he said quietly.\n“Karkaroff?” said Harry wildly. “Where is he? Have you got him? Is he\nlocked up?”\n“Karkaroff?” said Moody with an odd laugh. “Karkaroff fled tonight, when\nhe felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful\nsupporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get\nfar. The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies.”\n“Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t put my name in the\ngoblet?”\n“No,” said Moody slowly. “No, he didn’t. It was I who did that.”\nHarry heard, but didn’t believe.\n“No, you didn’t,” he said. “You didn’t do that . . . you can’t have done . . .”"

At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at\nHarry.\n“He forgave them, then?” he said. “The Death Eaters who went free? The\nones who escaped Azkaban?”\n“What?” said Harry.\nHe was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad\njoke, it had to be.\n“I asked you,” said Moody quietly, “whether he forgave the scum who never\neven went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn’t even\nbrave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave\nenough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight\nof the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky.”\n“You fired . . .

Who helped you see the only way you could\nbeat the dragon? I did.”\nMoody’s magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His\nlopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.\n“It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without\narousing suspicion.

Harry, still staring at the\nplace where Moody’s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape,\nand Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He\nlooked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway,\nDumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.\nAt that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said\nDumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon\nDumbledore’s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye\nMoody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no\nbenign smile upon Dumbledore’s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the\nspectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of\npower radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.\nHe stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody’s unconscious\nbody, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape\nfollowed him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible,\nglaring into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.\n“Come along, Potter,” she whispered.

He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal\nhe has suffered tonight, and why.”\n“Moody,” Harry said.

Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a\nsecond key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks\nhad vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneakoscopes,\nsome parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak.\nHarry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and\nsixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk, and each time\nrevealing different contents. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw\nopen the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.\nHe was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying\non the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in\nappearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the\nsocket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and\nchunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between\nthe sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the\nfloor of the office.\nDumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto\nthe floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.\n“Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak,” he said. “Of\ncourse, they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the\nimposter’s cloak — he’s freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he\nseems in no immediate danger.”\nHarry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked\nit around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the\nhip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick\nglutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.\n“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,\nand the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he’s\nwell known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody\nclose by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”"

You see his hair . . .”\nDumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has\nbeen cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the\nexcitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as\nfrequently as he should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We\nshall see.”\nDumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes\nfixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too.\nMinutes passed in silence. . . .\nThen, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to\nchange. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the\nmangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled\ngray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw.\nSuddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew\nin its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man’s\nface as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to\nswivel in every direction.\nHarry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a\nmop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore’s\nPensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors,\ntrying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent . . . but he was lined\naround the eyes now and looked much older. . . .\nThere were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned\nwith Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.\n“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. “Barty Crouch!”\n“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring\ndown at the man on the floor.\nFilthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her mouth opened\nwide and she let out a piercing shriek.\n“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”\nShe flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.\n“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”\n“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.\nSeverus, you have the potion?”\nSnape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:\nthe Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got\nup, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position\nagainst the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of\nDumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.\nWinky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.\nDumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops inside it.\nThen he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said, “Rennervate.”\nCrouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.\nDumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level."

How did you escape from Azkaban?”\nCrouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,\nexpressionless voice.\n“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to\nrescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He\nagreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion\ncontaining one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion\ncontaining one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”\nWinky was shaking her head, trembling.\n“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into\ntrouble!”\nBut Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.\n“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person\nentering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My\nfather smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were\nwatching through their doors.\n“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to\ndrink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and\nbearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”\nThe man’s eyelids flickered.\n“And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?” said\nDumbledore quietly.\n“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty.\nThe house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to\nbe controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I\nhad recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of\nreturning to his service.”\n“How did your father subdue you?” said Dumbledore.\n“The Imperius Curse,” Crouch said. “I was under my father’s control. I was\nforced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the\nhouse-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my\nfather to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.”\n“Master Barty, Master Barty,” sobbed Winky through her hands. “You isn’t\nought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. . . .”\n“Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?” said Dumbledore\nsoftly. “Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?”\n“Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. “A witch in my father’s\noffice. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father’s\nsignature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the\nkitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to\ninvestigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility"

He said it damaged her memory permanently.”\n“Why is she coming to nose into my master’s private business?” sobbed\nWinky. “Why isn’t she leaving us be?”\n“Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,” said Dumbledore.\n“Winky talked my father into it,” said Crouch, still in the same\nmonotonous voice. “She spent months persuading him. I had not left the\nhouse for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his\nInvisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell fresh air for once. She said my\nmother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to\ngive me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed\nin the end.\n“It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box\nearly in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I\nwas to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge.\nWinky would appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know.\n“But Winky didn’t know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight\nmy father’s Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again.\nThere were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened,\nthere, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out\nin public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand\nsticking out of a boy’s pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before\nAzkaban. I stole it. Winky didn’t know. Winky is frightened of heights. She\nhad her face hidden.”\n“Master Barty, you bad boy!” whispered Winky, tears trickling between her\nfingers.\n“So you took the wand,” said Dumbledore, “and what did you do with it?”\n“We went back to the tent,” said Crouch. “Then we heard them. We heard\nthe Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who\nhad never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They\nwere not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They\nwere merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me.\nMy mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I\nwanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the\ntent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry.\nShe used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the\ntent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her\nback. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters"

I\nused the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.\n“Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of\nthe spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond\nconnecting us was broken. We were both Stunned.\n“When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He\nsearched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He\nwaited until the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back\nunder the Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had\nfailed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.”\nWinky let out a wail of despair.\n“Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and\nthen . . .” Crouch’s head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across\nhis face. “My master came for me.\n“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail.\nMy master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins\nin Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about\nthe Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to\nteach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory\nCharm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from\nAzkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from\nseeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant\n— perhaps the most faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon\nthe information Bertha had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house\nnear midnight. My father answered the door.”\nThe smile spread wider over Crouch’s face, as though recalling the sweetest\nmemory of his life. Winky’s petrified brown eyes were visible through her\nfingers. She seemed too appalled to speak.\n“It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my\nmaster. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced\nhim to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong.\nAnd I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in\nyears.”\n“And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said Dumbledore.\n“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It\nwas my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He\ntold me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who\nwould guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without\nappearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he\nreached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take\nthe first person to touch it to my master. But first —”\n“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing,\nthough his voice remained calm."

His blue eyes were blazing,\nthough his voice remained calm.\n“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.\nWe journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.\nWe managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of\nhis own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I\ndrank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to\nface Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a\ndisturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley\nI had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed\nup Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody,\nand set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted\nto be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that\nI could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice\nPotion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the\ndungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under\norders to search it.”\n“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said\nDumbledore.\n“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house, and to keep\nwatch over my father.”\n“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.\n“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.\nThere were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it\nwas no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send\nletters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But\nWormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.\nMy master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to\ntell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had\nsmuggled me from Azkaban.\n“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to stop him at\nall costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry\nPotter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”\n“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”\n“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing\nmore ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He\nthought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from\nPotter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my\nfather was after Snape.\n“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one\nevening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my\nInvisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the\nedge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt\nPotter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned\nKrum. I killed my father.”"

Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the\nmap with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape.\nDumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the\ncastle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to\nmeet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.\n“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my\nfather’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my\nfather’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility\nCloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.”\nThere was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs. Then\nDumbledore said, “And tonight . . .”\n“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,”\nwhispered Barty Crouch. “Turned it into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked.\nHe is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of\nwizards.”\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his\nshoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.\n— T H I R T Y - S I X —\nTHE PARTING OF\nTHE WAYS\nD\numbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment\nwith disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and\nropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch,\nbinding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall.\n“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?”\n“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as\nthough she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew\nout her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.\n“Severus” — Dumbledore turned to Snape — “please tell Madam Pomfrey\nto come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing.\nThen go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to\nthis office. He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I\nwill be in the hospital wing in half an hour’s time if he needs me.”\nSnape nodded silently and swept out of the room.\n“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.\nHarry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not\nnoticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full\nmeasure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm\nand helped him out into the dark corridor.\n“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he said quietly as they\nheaded up the passageway. “Sirius is waiting for us there.”"

A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were\nupon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn’t want to have\nto think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the\nTriwizard Cup. He didn’t want to have to examine the memories, fresh and\nsharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody,\ninside the trunk.

His voice, which had\nbeen so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very\nslightly for the first time. “She was Head of Cedric’s House, and knew him\nbest.”\nThey had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it\nsprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak\ndoor. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was\nwhite and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift\nmoment, he had crossed the room.\n“Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew something like this — what\nhappened?”\nHis hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.\n“What happened?” he asked more urgently.\nDumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry\nwas only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted\nnothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell\nasleep and didn’t have to think or feel anymore.\nThere was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown\nacross the office, and landed on Harry’s knee.\n“’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix’s beautiful\nscarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was\nsomething comforting about his warm weight.\nDumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk.\nHe was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to\nquestion him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\n“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze,\nHarry,” said Dumbledore.\n“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said Sirius harshly.\nHe had put a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.”\nHarry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice\nof Sirius’s words. He leaned forward toward Harry.

I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell\nus what happened.”\nThe phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and\nHarry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his\nstomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\nHe took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of\neverything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the\nsparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death\nEaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric’s body,\nlying on the ground beside the cup.\nOnce or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his\nhand still tight on Harry’s shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop\nhim, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he\nhad started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous\nwere being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination\nhe had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel\nbetter.\nWhen Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however,\nSirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly\nthat Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to\nstretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were\ntorn and the cut beneath them.\n“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used someone\nelse’s,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my — my mother left\nin me — he’d have it too. And he was right — he could touch me without\nhurting himself, he touched my face.”\nFor a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like\ntriumph in Dumbledore’s eyes. But next second, Harry was sure he had\nimagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk,\nhe looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.\n“Very well,” he said, sitting down again. “Voldemort has overcome that\nparticular barrier. Harry, continue, please.”\nHarry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the\ncauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort’s speech to the\nDeath Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his\nwand to him, and prepared to duel.\nBut when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected\nhis and Voldemort’s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep\ntalking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort’s wand were\nflooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha\nJorkins . . . his father . . . his mother . . .\nHe was glad when Sirius broke the silence."

Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This\nphoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird,\nperching peacefully on Harry’s knee.\n“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought\nthe second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.”\n“So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius.\n“They will not work properly against each other,” said Dumbledore. “If,\nhowever, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle . . . a very rare\neffect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells\nit has performed — in reverse. The most recent first . . . and then those which\npreceded it. . . .”\nHe looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\n“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry’s face, “that\nsome form of Cedric must have reappeared.”\nHarry nodded again.\n“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.\n“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore heavily. “All that\nwould have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric\nwould have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?”\n“He spoke to me,” Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. “The . . . the\nghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.”\n“An echo,” said Dumbledore, “which retained Cedric’s appearance and\ncharacter.

Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . . . what did they\ndo?”\nHarry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had\nprowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear\nthem, how the shadow of Harry’s father had told him what to do, how\nCedric’s had made its final request.\nAt this point, Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at\nSirius and saw that he had his face in his hands."

He looked around at\nSirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.\nHarry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix\nhad fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry’s\ninjured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound\nleft by the spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.\n“I will say it again,” said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and\nresettled itself upon the perch beside the door. “You have shown bravery\nbeyond anything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry. You have\nshown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his\npowers. You have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found yourself\nequal to it — and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect.\nYou will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to\nthe dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would\nyou like to stay with him?”\nSirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog\nand walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying\nthem down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.\nWhen Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill,\nRon, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.\nThey appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had\nhappened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the\nblack dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.\n“Harry! Oh Harry!”\nShe started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.\n“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment.\nHarry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it\nfor me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you\nall to stay with him,” he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill\ntoo, “you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready\nto answer, and certainly not this evening.”\nMrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione,\nand Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He needs\nquiet!”\n“Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was\nSirius, “may I ask what — ?”\n“This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,” said Dumbledore\nsimply. “I assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry — I will wait while\nyou get into bed.”\nHarry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the\nothers not to question him. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want them there; but\nthe thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more\ntime, was more than he could stand.\n“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,” said\nDumbledore. “I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken\nto the school.” He left."

His wooden leg\nand magical eye were lying on the bedside table.\n“Is he okay?” Harry asked.\n“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and\npulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and\ngot into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came\naround the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron\nand Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of\nhim.\n“I’m all right,” he told them. “Just tired.”\nMrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers\nunnecessarily.\nMadam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a\nsmall bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.\n“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said. “It’s a potion for\ndreamless sleep.”\nHarry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming\ndrowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the\nhospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the\nscreen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the\nwarmth of the feather mattress. Before he could finish the potion, before he\ncould say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.\nHarry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his eyes, wanting\nto drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still\nnighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have been asleep very long.\nThen he heard whispering around him.\n“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”\n“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?”\nHarry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could\nsee the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on\nher feet.\n“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered. “And that’s Minerva McGonagall’s,\nisn’t it? But what are they arguing about?”\nNow Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the\nhospital wing.\n“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva —” Cornelius Fudge was saying\nloudly.\n“You should never have brought it inside the castle!” yelled Professor\nMcGonagall. “When Dumbledore finds out —”\nHarry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people\naround his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the\nscreens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.\nFudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at\nhis heels.\n“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.\n“He’s not here,” said Mrs. Weasley angrily. “This is a hospital wing,"

Minerva, I’m\nsurprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch —”\n“There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore!” she\nshrieked. “The Minister has seen to that!”\nHarry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There\nwere angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists;\nshe was trembling with fury.\n“When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible\nfor tonight’s events,” said Snape, in a low voice, “he seemed to feel his personal\nsafety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany\nhim into the castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch —”\n“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!” Professor McGonagall\nfumed. “I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the\ncastle, but —”\n“My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry\nhad ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to\nbring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous —”\nBut Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.\n“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing\nat Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and — and —”\nHarry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find\nwords to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her\nsentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its\nfatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He\nwas worse than dead.\n“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has been\nresponsible for several deaths!”\n“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was\nstaring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He\ncannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”\n“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered Fudge. “He\nwas a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems\nto have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who’s instructions!”\n“Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,” Dumbledore\nsaid. “Those people’s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore\nVoldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been\nrestored to his body.”\nFudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his\nface. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn’t quite\nbelieve what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at\nDumbledore."

He began to sputter, still goggling at\nDumbledore.\n“You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now,\nDumbledore . . .”\n“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,” said Dumbledore, “we\nheard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us\nhow he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort — learning of his\ncontinued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father\nand used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has\nhelped Voldemort to return.”\n“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a\nslight smile dawning on his face, “you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-\nKnow-Who — back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have\nbelieved himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who’s orders — but to take the\nword of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore . . .”\n“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported\nstraight to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord\nVoldemort’s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my\noffice.”\nDumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook\nhis head and said, “I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry\ntonight.”\nFudge’s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back\nat Dumbledore, and said, “You are — er — prepared to take Harry’s word on\nthis, are you, Dumbledore?”\nThere was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His\nhackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now.\n“I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened\nafter he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain\neverything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”\nFudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at\nHarry before answering.\n“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the\nword of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well . . .”\nFudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he said quietly.\nRon, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had\nrealized that Harry was awake.\nFudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n“And if I have?” he said, looking at Dumbledore. “If I have discovered that\nyou’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh?\nAnd having funny turns all over the place —”\n“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in\nhis scar?” said Dumbledore coolly.\n“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge quickly.\n“Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly — hallucinations?”"

Possibly — hallucinations?”\n“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge,\nand once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that\nHarry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. “Harry is as\nsane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I\nbelieve it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly\nmurderous.”\nFudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less\nstubborn.\n“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse scar acting\nas an alarm bell before. . . .”\n“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. He tried to get out of\nbed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. “I saw the Death Eaters! I can\ngive you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”\nSnape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes\nflew back to Fudge.\n“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family —\ndonations to excellent causes —”\n“Macnair!” Harry continued.\n“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”\n“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”\n“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being\nDeath Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found\nthose names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the\nboy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are\ngetting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes,\nDumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”\n“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch!\nThese deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”\n“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her\nanger, his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all determined to start a\npanic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen\nyears!”\nHarry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of\nFudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially\ngood-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing,\npoint-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and\nordered world — to believe that Voldemort could have risen.\n“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If you accept that fact\nstraightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to\nsave the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from\nthe control of the dementors —”\n“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the dementors? I’d be\nkicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at\nnight because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!”\n“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you"

Voldemort can offer them much more scope for\ntheir powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind\nhim, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop\nhim regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!”\nFudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express\nhis outrage.\n“The second step you must take — and at once,” Dumbledore pressed on,\n“is to send envoys to the giants.”\n“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. “What\nmadness is this?”\n“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,” said\nDumbledore, “or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he\nalone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!”\n“You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped, shaking his head and\nretreating further from Dumbledore. “If the magical community got wind that\nI had approached the giants — people hate them, Dumbledore — end of my\ncareer —”\n“You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of\npower around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, “by the love of the\noffice you hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always\nhave done, on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it\nmatters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor\nhas just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as\nany — and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now — take\nthe steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one\nof the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act\n— and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed\nVoldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!”\n“Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away. “Mad . . .”\nAnd then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot\nof Harry’s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs. Weasley was still standing over\nHarry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and\nHermione were staring at Fudge.\n“If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this,\nCornelius,” said Dumbledore, “we have reached a parting of the ways. You\nmust act as you see fit. And I — I shall act as I see fit.”\nDumbledore’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere\nstatement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon\nhim with a wand.\n“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a threatening finger. “I’ve\ngiven you free rein, always.

If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same\nside.”\nIt seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and\nforward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.\nFinally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He can’t be back,\nDumbledore, he just can’t be . . .”\nSnape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his\nrobes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who\nrecoiled.\n“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it\nwas an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every\nDeath Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of\ndistinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he\ntouched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate,\ninstantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s\ntoo. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn.\nWe both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord’s vengeance.\nHe betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back\ninto the fold.”\nFudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not\nseem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by\nthe ugly mark on Snape’s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered,\n“I don’t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have\nheard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow,\nDumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the\nMinistry.”\nHe had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode\nback down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry’s bed.\n“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket\nand dropping it onto Harry’s bedside table. “One thousand Galleons. There\nshould have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances . . .”\nHe crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room,\nslamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared,\nDumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry’s bed.\n“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly . . . am I right in thinking that I\ncan count on you and Arthur?”\n“Of course you can,” said Mrs. Weasley.

It’s Arthur’s fondness for Muggles\nthat has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks\nproper Wizarding pride.”\n“Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said Dumbledore. “All those\nthat we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well\nplaced to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as\nCornelius.”\n“I’ll go to Dad,” said Bill, standing up. “I’ll go now.”\n“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has happened. Tell him I\nwill be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet,\nhowever. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry —”\n“Leave it to me,” said Bill.\nHe clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek,\npulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.\n“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, “I want to\nsee Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also — if she will consent to come\n— Madame Maxime.”\nProfessor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\n“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “would you be very kind\nand go down to Professor Moody’s office, where I think you will find a house-\nelf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take\nher back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.”\n“Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.\nDumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam\nPomfrey’s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.\n“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number to recognize each\nother for what they are. Sirius . . . if you could resume your usual form.”\nThe great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned\nback into a man.\nMrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\n“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.\n“Mum, shut up!” Ron yelled. “It’s okay!”\nSnape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one\nof mingled fury and horror.\n“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. “What\nis he doing here?”\n“He is here at my invitation,” said Dumbledore, looking between them, “as\nare you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old\ndifferences and trust each other.”\nHarry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape\nwere eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.\n“I will settle, in the short term,” said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience\nin his voice, “for a lack of open hostility.

They let go extremely quickly.\n“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore, stepping between\nthem once more. “Now I have work for each of you. Fudge’s attitude, though\nnot unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You\nare to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old\ncrowd.

He did not want to have to say good-bye again so\nquickly.\n“You’ll see me very soon, Harry,” said Sirius, turning to him. “I promise\nyou. But I must do what I can, you understand, don’t you?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . of course I do.”\nSirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again\ninto the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle\nhe turned with a paw. Then he was gone.\n“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you know what I must ask\nyou to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared . . .”\n“I am,” said Snape.\nHe looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered\nstrangely.\n“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of\napprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.\nIt was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.\n“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the Diggorys. Harry —\ntake the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.”\nHarry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared.\nHermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them\nspoke for a very long time.\n“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley said at\nlast. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached\nfor the bottle and the goblet. “You have a good long sleep.

He blinked and\nstared up at the ceiling.\n“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.\n“I told him to take the Cup with me,” said Harry.\nNow the burning feeling was in his throat too.

His mother’s\nface, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started\nspinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his\nface against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.\nThere was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.\nHermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in\nher hand.\n“Sorry,” she whispered.\n“Your potion, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the\nback of her hand.\nHarry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible\nwaves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and\nthought no more.\n— T H I R T Y - S E V E N —\nTHE BEGINNING\nW\nhen he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only\nscattered memories of the next few days. It was as though he had\nbeen through too much to take in any more. The recollections he did have\nwere very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that\ntook place the following morning.\nThey did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both\nthanked him for returning Cedric’s body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed\nthrough most of the interview. Mrs. Diggory’s grief seemed to be beyond tears.\n“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric\nhad died. “And after all, Amos . . . he died just when he’d won the\ntournament. He must have been happy.”\nWhen they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, “You look\nafter yourself, now.”\nHarry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.\n“You take this,” he muttered to her. “It should’ve been Cedric’s, he got\nthere first, you take it —”\nBut she backed away from him.\n“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t . . . you keep it.”\nHarry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what\nHermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that\nmorning at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone,\nthat nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had\nhappened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the\ncorridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed.\nHe guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article about how\ndisturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their\nown theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn’t care very much.\nHe liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking\nabout other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He"

He\nfelt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn’t need\nto put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what\nwas going on outside Hogwarts — and that it was useless to speculate about\nwhat might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time\nthey touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs.\nWeasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.\n“She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,” he\nsaid. “But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.”\n“Why?” said Harry.\n“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron, shaking his head darkly.\n“I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?”\nThe only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk\nto was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts\nteacher, they had those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon\nto go down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang\nbounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his\ntail madly.\n“Who’s that?” called Hagrid, coming to the door. “Harry!”\nHe strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed hug, ruffled his\nhair, and said, “Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh.”\nThey saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of\nthe fireplace when they entered Hagrid’s cabin.\n“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said. “She’s jus’ left.”\n“Who?” said Ron curiously.\n“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.\n“You two made up, have you?” said Ron.\n“Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,” said Hagrid airily, fetching more cups\nfrom the dresser. When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy\ncookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his\nbeetle-black eyes.\n“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.\n“Yeah,” said Harry.\n“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid. “’Course yeh’re not. But yeh will be.”\nHarry said nothing.\n“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said Hagrid, and Harry, Ron, and\nHermione looked up at him, shocked. “Known it fer years, Harry. Knew he\nwas out there, bidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an’ we’ll\njus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll fight. Migh’ be able ter stop him before he\ngets a good hold. That’s Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man,\nDumbledore. ’S long as we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.”\nHagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their\nfaces.\n“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s comin’ will come, an’"

It was the first time he’d smiled in days. “What’s\nDumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?” he asked. “He sent Professor\nMcGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night.”\n“Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid. “Secret, though. I’m\nnot s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe — Madame\nMaxime ter you — might be comin’ with me. I think she will. Think I got her\npersuaded.”\n“Is it to do with Voldemort?”\nHagrid flinched at the sound of the name.\n“Migh’ be,” he said evasively. “Now . . . who’d like ter come an’ visit the las’\nskrewt with me? I was jokin’ — jokin’!” he added hastily, seeing the looks on\ntheir faces.\nIt was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on\nthe night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast,\nwhich was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House\nChampionship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall\nwhen it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when\nit was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.\nWhen he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the\nusual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with\nthe winning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there\nwere black drapes on the wall behind the teachers’ table. Harry knew instantly\nthat they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.\nThe real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his\nmagical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time\nsomeone spoke to him. Harry couldn’t blame him; Moody’s fear of attack was\nbound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own\ntrunk. Professor Karkaroff’s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down\nwith the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort\nhad caught up with him.\nMadame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were\ntalking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor\nMcGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry\nlooked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and\nunpleasant as ever.

And why . . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced\nthat Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had\nsaid so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, “at great\npersonal risk.” Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact\nwith the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over\nto Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?\nHarry’s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the\nstaff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it\nusually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.\n“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, “of another year.”\nHe paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the\nmost subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the\nsaddest and palest faces in the Hall.\n“There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,” said\nDumbledore, “but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who\nshould be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, “enjoying our feast\nwith us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric\nDiggory.”\nThey did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood,\nand raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric\nDiggory.”\nHarry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears\npouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat\ndown again.\n“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish\nHufflepuff House,” Dumbledore continued. “He was a good and loyal friend,\na hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you\nknew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know\nexactly how it came about.”\nHarry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.\n“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”\nA panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at\nDumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched\nthem mutter themselves into silence.\n“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does not wish me to tell\nyou this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have\ndone so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has\nreturned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is\nmy belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any\nattempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort\nof blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”\nStunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward\nDumbledore now . . . or almost every face.

Harry felt a\nhot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at\nDumbledore.\n“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with\nCedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on. “I am talking, of course, about Harry\nPotter.”\nA kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry’s\ndirection before flicking back to face Dumbledore.\n“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “He\nrisked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every\nrespect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord\nVoldemort, and for this, I honor him.”\nDumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more.\nNearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as\nthey had murmured Cedric’s, and drank to him. But through a gap in the\nstanding figures, Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the\nother Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.\nDumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.\nWhen everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued,\n“The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical\nunderstanding. In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort’s\nreturn — such ties are more important than ever before.”\nDumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour\nand her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at\nthe Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as\nthough he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.\n“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the\nDurmstrang students, “will be welcomed back here at any time, should they\nwish to come. I say to you all, once again — in the light of Lord Voldemort’s\nreturn, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord\nVoldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it\nonly by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of\nhabit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts\nare open.\n“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken — that we\nare all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already\nsuffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have\nbeen torn asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.\n“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to\nmake a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what\nhappened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed\nacross the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”\nHarry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron,\nand Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the"

He, Ron,\nand Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the\nfourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station.\nIt was another beautiful summer’s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would\nbe hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that\nevening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.\n“’Arry!”\nHe looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the\ncastle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping\nMadame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The\nBeauxbatons carriage was about to take off.\n“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as she reached him,\nholding out her hand. “I am ’oping to get a job ’ere, to improve my Eenglish.”\n“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled\nat him; Hermione scowled.\n“Good-bye, ’Arry,” said Fleur, turning to go. “It ’az been a pleasure meeting\nyou!”\nHarry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back\nacross the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.\n“Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,” said Ron. “D’you\nreckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?”\n“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He stayed in his cabin and let\nus do the vork.”\nKrum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.\n“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.\n“Oh . . . yes . . . all right,” said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and\nfollowing Krum through the crowd and out of sight.\n“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be\nhere in a minute!”\nHe let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few\nminutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and\nHermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,\nbut her face was quite impassive.\n“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to\nme. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he\nadded, scowling.\n“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.\nKrum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s\nhand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of\npainful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron\nburst out, “Can I have your autograph?”\nHermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now\ntrundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified,\nsigned a fragment of parchment for Ron.\nThe weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King’s\nCross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September."

Harry, Ron, and Hermione had\nmanaged to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again\nhidden under Ron’s dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig\nwas dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a\nspare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked\nmore fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward.\nHarry felt as though Dumbledore’s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked\nhim, somehow. It was less painful to discuss what had happened now. They\nbroke off their conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking,\neven now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.\nWhen Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her\nschoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying\nin there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it\nmight say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s\nnothing in there. You can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. I’ve been\nchecking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you\nwon the tournament. They didn’t even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of\nit. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet.”\n“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a story like this.”\n“Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,” said Hermione\nin an oddly constrained voice. “As a matter of fact,” she added, her voice now\ntrembling slightly, “Rita Skeeter isn’t going to be writing anything at all for a\nwhile. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.”\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron.\n“I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she\nwasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said Hermione in a rush.\nHarry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this\nfor days, but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had\nhappened.\n“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.\n“How did you find out?” said Ron, staring at her.\n“Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry,” she said.\n“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?”\n“Bugging,” said Hermione happily.\n“But you said they didn’t work —”\n“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see . . . Rita Skeeter” —\nHermione’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an unregistered\nAnimagus. She can turn —”\nHermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her bag.\n“— into a beetle.”\n“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You haven’t . . . she’s not . . .”\n“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.\nInside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.\n“That’s never — you’re kidding —” Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his\neyes."

Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around\nher antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.”\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered\nsomething.\n“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame\nMaxime about his mum!”\n“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after\nwe’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m very much mistaken,\nRita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar\nhurt. She’s been buzzing around for stories all year.”\n“When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .” said Ron slowly.\n“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione. “He knew, of course.\nThat’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the\nSlytherins. They wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as\nthey were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid.”\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which\nbuzzed angrily against the glass.\n“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to London,” said Hermione.\n“I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform.\nAnd I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she\ncan’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.”\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.\nThe door of the compartment slid open.\n“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.\nCrabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked\nmore pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry\nhad ever seen them.\n“So,” said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and\nlooking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. “You caught\nsome pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again. Big\ndeal.”\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.\n“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy softly, looking around at\nall three of them. “Trying to pretend it hasn’t happened?”\n“Get out,” said Harry.\nHe had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering\nto Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric. He could feel\na kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.\n“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought\nto choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the\ntrain, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like\nthis!” He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll\nbe the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back!

Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every\ndirection, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the\nfloor.\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He,\nRon, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a\ndifferent hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.\n“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly,\nstepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so\ndid George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.\n“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe. “Who used the\nFurnunculus Curse?”\n“Me,” said Harry.\n“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two\nshouldn’t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face.\nWell, let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the decor.”\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of whom looked distinctly the worse for\nthe jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit — out into the corridor,\nthen came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut.\n“Exploding Snap, anyone?” said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards.\nThey were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask\nthem.\n“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George. “Who you were\nblackmailing?”\n“Oh,” said George darkly. “That.”\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. “It wasn’t\nanything important. Not now, anyway.”\n“We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.\nBut Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, “All\nright, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo Bagman.”\n“Bagman?” said Harry sharply. “Are you saying he was involved in —”\n“Nah,” said George gloomily. “Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn’t\nhave the brains.”\n“Well, what, then?” said Ron.\nFred hesitated, then said, “You remember that bet we had with him at the\nQuidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get\nthe Snitch?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.\n“Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught from the Irish\nmascots.”\n“So?”\n“So,” said Fred impatiently, “it vanished, didn’t it? By next morning, it had\ngone!”\n“But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?” said Hermione.\nGeorge laughed very bitterly.\n“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him,\nand told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored\nour letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was\nalways making some excuse to get away from us.”"

So he can pay you your gold!”\n“Nope,” said George, shaking his head. “The goblins play as dirty as him.\nThey say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you’d win outright.\nSo Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task.”\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.\nThe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could\nhave gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s\nCross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow\ndown when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts\nExpress was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual\nconfusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.\nRon and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying\ntheir trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.\n“Fred — George — wait a moment.”\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard\nwinnings.\n“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.\n“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.\n“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”\n“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at Harry.\n“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get inventing. It’s for the joke\nshop.”\n“He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.\n“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it down the\ndrain. I don’t want it and I don’t need it. But I could do with a few laughs.\nWe could all do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them\nmore than usual before long.”"

I know some good ones now.\nJust do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say\nthey’re from you.”\nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex\nmarks.\nUncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by\nhim. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his\near, “I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in\ntouch, Harry.”\n“See you, Harry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.\n“’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something she had never done\nbefore, and kissed him on the cheek.\n“Harry — thanks,” George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his\nside.\nHarry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently\nfrom the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got\ninto the back of the Dursleys’ car.\nAs Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he would have\nto meet it when it did.\nEthereum:0xD915FE7e19A4D50e3088370963233Fcf1C7f748B\nBitcoin:bc1q4ya2vepxlgwvsy8j6axwq7ueayytv293z2kvs9"
