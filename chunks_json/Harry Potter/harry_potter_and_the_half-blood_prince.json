He was waiting for a\ncall from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would\ntelephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult\nweek, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print\non the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his\npolitical opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to\nenumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding)\nbut also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault.\nThe Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair\nnor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was\noutrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer\nthan ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending\na dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of\npolicemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government\nshould have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to\nboth people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had\nchosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?\n\"A grim mood has gripped the country,\" the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad\ngrin.\nAnd unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more\nmiserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July... It wasn't\nright, it wasn't normal...\nHe turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job.\nStretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a\nfine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a"

        "text": "Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a\nfine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a\nslight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that\nwas pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft\ncough behind him.\nHe froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He\nhad heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room. : Â¦\n\"Hello?\" he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.\nFor a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a\nvoice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared\nstatement. It was coming -- as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough -- from the froglike little\nman wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.\n\"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.\"\nThe man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.\n\"Er,\" said the Prime Minister, \"listen... Its not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call,\nH(cid:1)rr(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)tt(cid:5)r (cid:1)nd th(cid:5) H(cid:1)lf-(cid:6)l(cid:4)(cid:4)d (cid:3)rinc(cid:5)\nyou see... from the President of--\"\n\"That can be rearranged,\" said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of\nthat.\n\"But I really was rather hoping to speak--\"\n\"We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,\" said the\nlittle man. \"Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.\"\n\"I... oh ... very well,\" said the Prime Minister weakly. \"Yes, I'll see Fudge.\"\nHe hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged\nhis face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life\nin the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or\nalarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed\nout onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green\nbowler hat in his hand.\n\"Ah... Prime Minister,\" said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. \"Good to see\nyou again.\"\nThe Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely\npleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves,\ngenerally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly\ncareworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had"

The Prime Minister had\nseen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.\n\"How can I help you?\" he said, shaking Fudge's hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the\nchairs in front of the desk.\n\"Difficult to know where to begin,\" muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his\ngreen bowler upon his knees. \"What a week, what a week...\"\n\"Had a bad one too, have you?\" asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite\nenough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. \"I've\nbeen having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge... the Bones and Vance\nmurders... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country...\"\n\"You--er--your--I mean to say, some of your people were--were involved in those--those things, were\nthey?\"\nFudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. \"Of course they were,\" he said, \"Surely you've\nrealized what's going on?\"\n\"I...\" hesitated the Prime Minister.\nIt was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge's visits so much. He was, after all, the\nPrime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had\nbeen like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He\nH(cid:1)rr(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)tt(cid:5)r (cid:1)nd th(cid:5) H(cid:1)lf-(cid:6)l(cid:4)(cid:4)d (cid:3)rinc(cid:5)\nremembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.\nHe had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of\ndreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that\nugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce\nhimself\nNaturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.\nHe had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt\nwhen a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained\nspeechless throughout Fudge's kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret\nall over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of\nMagic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population\nfrom getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations\non responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister\nremembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the\nsLill-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way."

Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the\nsLill-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.\n\"Not to worry,\" he had said, \"it's odds-on you'll never see me again. I'll only bother you if there's something\nreally serious going on our end, something that's likely to affect the Muggles--the non-magical population, I\nshould say. Otherwise, it's live and let live. And I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your\npredecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.\"\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. \"You're--you're not a hoax, then?\"\nIt had been his last, desperate hope.\n\"No,\" said Fudge gently. \"No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look.\"\nAnd he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil.\n\"But,\" said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech,\n\"but why--why has nobody told me--?\"\n\"The Minister of Magic only reveals him--or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,\" said Fudge,\npoking his wand back inside his jacket. \"We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.\"\n\"But then,\" bleated the Prime Minister, \"why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me--?\"\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed.\n\"My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?\"\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and\nvanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that\nhe would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world\nwould believe him?\nThe shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had\nindeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain\nattempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his\ndelighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had\nH(cid:1)rr(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)tt(cid:5)r (cid:1)nd th(cid:5) H(cid:1)lf-(cid:6)l(cid:4)(cid:4)d (cid:3)rinc(cid:5)\nannounced Fudge's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to\nremove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nhad all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and\nsimply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office.\nOccasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning,\nor else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a\nstretch of muddy-brown canvas behind.

However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very\nmuch, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this\nhappened.\nThen, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the\nportrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace,\nsopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping\nall over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a\nman named \"Serious\" Black, something that sounded like \"Hogwarts,\" and a boy called Harry Potter, none\nof which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.\n\"...I've just come from Azkaban,\" Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his\nbowler hat into his pocket. \"Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight... the dementors are in\nuproar\"--he shuddered--\"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime\nMinister. Black's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who.... But of course,\nyou don't even know who You-Know-Who is!\" He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a\nmoment, then said, \"Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in... Have a whiskey...\"\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own\nwhiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid\nout of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair.\nFudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote\nit instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. When\nat last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.\n\"So you think that...\" He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. \"Lord Vol--\"\n\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" snarled Fudge.\n\"I'm sorry... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?\"\n\"Well, Dumbledore says he is,\" said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, \"but\nwe've never found him. If you ask me, he's not dangerous unless he's got support, so it's Black we ought to\nbe worrying about. You'll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don't see each other again,\nPrime Minister! Good night.\"\nBut they had seen each other again.

Well, good day to you.\"\nThe Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no.\nLess than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had\nbeen a mass breakout from Azkaban.\n\"A mass breakout?\" repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.\n\"No need to worry, no need to worry!\" shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. \"We'll have\nthem rounded up in no time--just thought you ought to know!\"\nAnd before the Prime Minister could shout, \"Now, wait just one moment!\" Fudge had vanished in a shower\nof green sparks.\nWhatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not\nescaped his notice that, despite Fudge's assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot\nof each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think\nabout the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime\nMinister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The\nsite, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly\nsurprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that\nhad happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.\n\"How should I know what's going on in the--er--Wizarding community?\" snapped the Prime Minister now.\n\"I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without--\"\n\"We have the same concerns,\" Fudge interrupted. \"The Brock-dale Bridge didn't wear out. That wasn't\nreally a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley's family would be\nsafer without him.

When you say 'back'... he's alive? I mean--\"\nThe Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years\npreviously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who\nhad committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.\n\"Yes, alive,\" said Fudge. \"That is--I don't know--is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really\nunderstand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly--but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is\nwalking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive.\"\nH(cid:1)rr(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)tt(cid:5)r (cid:1)nd th(cid:5) H(cid:1)lf-(cid:6)l(cid:4)(cid:4)d (cid:3)rinc(cid:5)\nThe Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear\nwell-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of\ntheir previous conversations.\n\"Is Serious Black with--er--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\"\n\"Black? Black?\" said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. \"Sirius Black, you\nmean? Merlin's beard, no. Black's dead. Turns out we were--er--mistaken about Black. He was innocent\nafter all. And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,\" he added defensively,\nspinning the bowler hat still faster, \"all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but\nanyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There's going to\nbe an inquiry, actually...\"\nTo his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however,\neclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might\nbe in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government\ndepartments under his charge... Not yet, anyway...\nWhile the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, \"But Blacks\nby-the-by now. The point is, we're at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.\"\n\"At war?\" repeated the Prime Minister nervously. \"Surely that's a little bit of an overstatement?\"\n\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban"

Rufus\nScrimgeour, Minister of Magic.\"\n\"Yes, yes, fine,\" said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate\nturned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him\nmoments later onto the antique rug.\nFudge got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new\narrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.\nThe Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There\nwere streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind\na pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight\nlimp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he\nunderstood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous\ntimes.\n\"How do you do?\" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.\nScrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\n\"Fudge told you everything?\" he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand.\nThe Prime Minister heard the lock click.\nH(cid:1)rr(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)tt(cid:5)r (cid:1)nd th(cid:5) H(cid:1)lf-(cid:6)l(cid:4)(cid:4)d (cid:3)rinc(cid:5)\n\"Er--yes,\" said the Prime Minister. \"And if you don't mind, I'd rather that door remained unlocked.\"\n\"I'd rather not be interrupted,\" said Scrimgeour shortly, \"or watched,\" he added, pointing his wand at the"

Maybe go easy on the\ndrink...\"\n\"A team of Healers from St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we\nspeak.

There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign\nof life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip\nwrappings in the tall grass.\nBut then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox\nfroze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few\nmoments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.\nWith a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.\n\"Wait!\"\nThe harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth.

Side by side they stood looking across the\nroad at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.\n\"He lives here?\" asked Bella in a voice of contempt. \"Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of\nour kind ever to set foot--\"\nBut Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying\nacross the road.\n\"Cissy, wait!\"\nBella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses\ninto a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running\nbetween patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another\ncorner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each\nUntitled Document\nother.\n\"Cissy, you must not do this, you can't trust him--\"\n\"The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn't he?\"\n\"The Dark Lord is... I believe... mistaken,\" Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood\nas she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. \"In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan\nto anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's--\"\n\"Let go, Bella!\" snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the\nother's face. Bella merely laughed.\n\"Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn't--\"\n\"There is nothing I wouldn't do anymore!\" Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she\nbrought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister's arm as though\nburned.\n\"Narcissa!\"\nBut Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as\nthey moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named\nSpinner's End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her\nfootsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last\nhouse, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.\nShe had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood\nwaiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze.\nAfter a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be\nseen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.\nNarcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair\nstreaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.\n\"Narcissa!\" said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too."

The walls\nwere completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an\nold armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp\nhung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.\nUntitled Document\nSnape gestured Narcissa to the sofa.

Well, Wormtail's here, but we're not counting vermin, are we?\"\nHe pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a\nnarrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.\n\"As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,\" said Snape lazily.\nThe man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a\npointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it\nwas encased in a bright silver glove.\n\"Narcissa!\" he said, in a squeaky voice. \"And Bellatrix! How charming--\"\n\"Wormtail will get us drinks, if you'd like them,\" said Snape. \"And then he will return to his bedroom.\"\nWormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.\n\"I am not your servant!\" he squeaked, avoiding Snape's eye.\n\"Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.\"\n\"To assist, yes--but not to make you drinks and--and clean your house!\"\n\"I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,\" said Snape silkily. \"This can\nbe easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord--\"\n\"I can speak to him myself if I want to!\"\n\"Of course you can,\" said Snape, sneering. \"But in the meantime, bring us drinks.

This did not seem to\ndiscompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.\n\"The Dark Lord,\" he said, raising his glass and draining it.\nThe sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses.

He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n\"It so happens that I know of the plan,\" he said in a low voice. \"I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told.\nNevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the\nDark Lord.\"\n\"I thought you must know about it!\" said Narcissa, breathing more freely. \"He trusts you so, Severus. ...\"\n\"You know about the plan?\" said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of\noutrage. \"You know?\"\n\"Certainly,\" said Snape. \"But what help do you require, Nar-cissa?

He knew it was pointless to keep rereading\nDumbledore's words; Harry had sent back his \"yes\" with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could\ndo now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.\nBut Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the\nDursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was\ngoing to go wrong â his reply to Dumbledore's letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be\nprevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or\njoke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again.\nThe only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in\nher cage.\nThe minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the\nstreet-lamp outside the window went out.\nHarry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking\nhis cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the\npavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.\nHarry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching\nanything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set\nof robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living\nroom his Uncle Vernon shouted, \"Who the blazes is calling at this lime of night?\"\nHarry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\nforgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to\nlaughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice\nsay, \"Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?\"\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long\nexperience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the\ndoorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched\non his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and .1 pointed hat. Vernon Dursley,\nwhose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore's, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing\ngown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.\n\"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,\" said Dumbledore\npleasantly. \"However, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house.

Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon â the\nvein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point â but something about Dumbledore seemed\nto have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance,\nbut it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be\nvery difficult to bully.\n\"Ah, good evening Harry,\" said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most\nsatisfied expression. \"Excellent, excellent.\"\nThese words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who\ncould look at Harry and say \"excellent\" was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.\n\"I don't mean to be rude â\" he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.\n\"--yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,\" Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely.\n\"Best to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.\"\nThe kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry's aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her\nnightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather\nhorsey face registered nothing but shock.\n\"Albus Dumbledore,\" said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. \"We have\ncorresponded, of course.\" Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent\nher an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. \"And this must be your son, Dudley?\"\nDudley had that moment peered round the living room door. His large, blond head rising out of the stripy\ncollar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car. Dumbledore\nwaited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as\nthe â¢.ilcncc stretched on he smiled.\n\"Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?\"\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\nDudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and\ntrainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair\nnearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite\nextraordinarily out of place.\n\"Aren't â- aren't we leaving, sir?\" Harry asked anxiously.\n\"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I would\nprefer not to do so in the open.

Another\nflick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.\n\"We may as well be comfortable,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.\nAs he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as\nthough his flesh had been burned away.\n\"Sir â what happened to your â ?\"\n\"Later, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"Please sit down.\"\nHarry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.\n\"I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,\" Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, \"but the\nevidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.\"\nA third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and\npoured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each\nperson in the room.\n\"Madam Rosmertaâs finest oak-matured mead,\" said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught\nhold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The\nDursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat,\nas they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that\nDumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\n\"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, turning toward him, \"a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able\nto solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius's will was\ndiscovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.\"\nOver on the sofa, Uncle Vernonâs head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of\nanything to say except, \"Oh. Right.\"\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\n\"This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,\" Dumbledore went on. \"You add a reasonable amount of gold\nto your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic\npart of the legacy â\"\n\"His godfather's dead?\" said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to\nlook at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernonâs head; he\nattempted to beat it away. \"He's dead? His godfather?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. \"Our problem,\" he\ncontinued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, \"is that Sirius also left you number twelve,\nGrimmauld Place.\"\n\"He's been left a house?\" said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him."

He thought he\nwould be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within\nthe place he had wanted so desperately to leave.\n\"That is generous,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have, however, vacated the building temporarily.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Well,\" said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly\nover the head by the persistent glass of mead, \"Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed\ndown the direct line, to the next male with the name of 'Black.' Sirius was the very last of the line as his\nyounger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain\nthat he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set\nupon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.\"\nA vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius's mother that hung in the hall of number twelve,\nGrimmauld Place flashed into Harry's mind. \"I bet there has,\" he said.\n\"Quite,\" said Dumbledore. \"And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most\nlikely to pass to the eldest of Sirius's living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.\"\nWithout realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled\nacross the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's killer, inherit his house?\n\"No,\" he said.\n\"Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn't get it either,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"The situation is\nfraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it,\nfor example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius's hands. It might\nbe that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment.

        "text": "It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely\nshrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy\neyes on Dumbledore's wand.\n\"You see,\" Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not\nuttered, \"if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited â\"\nHe flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a\nnose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys' shag carpet and covered in\ngrimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living\nmemory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his\nhead, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed,\n\"What the hell is that?\"\n\"Kreacher,\" finished Dumbledore.\n\"Kreacher wont, Kreacher won't, Kreacher wont!\" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon,\nstamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. \"K readier belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher\nbelongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher\nwon't, won't, wont â\"\n\"As you can see, Harry,\" said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of \"wont, won't,\nwon't,\" \"Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.\"\n\"I don't care,\" said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. \"I don't want\nhim.\"\n\"Won't, wonât, won't, won't â\"\n\"You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived\nat the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?\"\n\"Won't, won't, wonât, won't â\"\nHarry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix\nLestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius,\nwas repugnant.\n\"Give him an order,\" said Dumbledore. \"If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not,\nthen we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.\"\n\"Won't, won't, wonât, WON'T!\"\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\nKreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, \"Kreacher, shut up!\"\nIt looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still\nworking furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward\nonto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to\na violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.\n\"Well, that simplifies matters,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. \"It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing."

In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry in relief, \"yeah, I'll do that. Er â Kreacher â I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in\nthe kitchens there with the other house-elves.\"\nKreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one\nupside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.\n\"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is also the matter of the hip-pogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking\nafter him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different\narrangements â\"\n\"No,\" said Harry at once, \"he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.\"\n\"Hagrid will be delighted,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again.\nIncidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak's safety, to rechristen him 'Witherwings' for the\ntime being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to\ndeath. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?\"\nErm . ..\n\"Doubtful that I would turn up?\" Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.\n\"I'll just go and â er â finish off,\" said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.\nIt took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract\nhis Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced\nthe lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig's cage in\nthe other, he made his way back downstairs,\nHe was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to\nreturn to the living room.\nNobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere\nwas thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, \"Professor â I'm\nready now.\"\n\"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Just one last thing, then.\" And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\n\"As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a years time â\"\n\"No,\" said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore's arrival.\n\"I'm sorry?\" said Dumbledore politely.\n\"No, he doesn't. He's a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn't turn eighteen until the year after\nnext.\"\n\"Ah,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly, \"but in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.\""

The\nWizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already\nattempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon\nyour doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents' murder and expressing the hope\nthat you would care for him ;is though he were your own.\"\nDumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of\nanger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer\ntogether.\n\"You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and\noften cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage\nyou have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.\"\nBoth Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone\nother than Dudley squeezed between them.\n\"Us â mistreat Dudders? What d'you â ?\" began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his\nringer for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.\n\"The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this\nhouse 'home.' However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have\nat least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns\nseventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return,\nonce more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues\nuntil that time.\"\nNone of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out\nwhen he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat;\nAunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.\n\"Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off,\" said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long\nblack cloak. \"Until we meet again,\" he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait\nforever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.\n\"Bye,\" said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry's trunk,\nupon which Hedwig's cage was perched.\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\n\"We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,\" he said, pulling out his wand again. \"I shall send\nthem to the Burrow to await us there.

He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before;\nthere was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too,\nand it rather heightened Harry's sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to\nmention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore's most prized possessions.\nDumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.\n\"Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,\" he said brightly.\n\"But I thought I'm not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?\"\n\"If there is an attack,\" said Dumbledore, \"I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might\noccur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.\"\n\"Why not, sir?\"\n\"You are with me,\" said Dumbledore simply. \"This will do, Harry.\"\nHe came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.\n\"You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,\" he said.\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I thought you had to be seventeen?\"\n\"You do,\" said Dumbledore. \"So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don't mind\nâ as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.\"\nHarry gripped Dumbledoreâs proffered forearm.\n\"Very good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Well, here we go.\"\nHarry felt Dumbledoreâs arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew,\neverything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were"

He felt as though he had just been\nforced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had\nvanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the\ncenter of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his\nsenses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.\n\"Are you all right?\" asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. \"The sensation does take some\ngetting used to.\"\n\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly.\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\n\"But I think I might prefer brooms. . . .\"\nDumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said, \"This way.\"\nHe set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it\nwas almost midnight.\n\"So tell me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"Your scar ... has it been hurting at all?\"\nHarry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightning-shaped mark.\n\"No,\" he said, \"and I've been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now\nVoldemort's getting so powerful again.\"\nHe glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.\n\"I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,\" said Dumbledore. \"Lord Voldemort has finally realized the\ndangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing\nOcclumency against you.\"\n\"Well, I'm not complaining,\" said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes\nof insight into Voldemort's mind.\nThey turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore\nagain. \"Professor?\"\n\"Harry?\"\n\"Er â where exactly are we?\"\n\"This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.\"\n\"And what are we doing here?\"\n\"Ah yes, of course, I haven't told you,\" said Dumbledore. \"Well, I have lost count of the number of times I\nhave said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade\nan old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.\"\n\"How can I help with that, sir?\" Â¦\n\"Oh, I think we'll find a use for you,\" said Dumbledore vaguely. \"Left here, Harry.\"\nThey proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that\nhad lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over\nhis shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.\n\"Professor, why couldn't we just Apparate directly into your old colleague's house?\""

In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are\nmagically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance â\"\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\n\"â you can't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,\" said Harry quickly. \"Hermione Granger\ntold me.\"\n\"And she is quite right. We turn left again.\"\nThe church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude\nto call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing\nquestions to ask.\n\"Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . .\"\n\"Correct,\" said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. \"He has been replaced, as I am sure you\nalso saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.\"\n\"Is he ... Do you think he's good?\" asked Harry.\n\"An interesting question,\" said Dumbledore. \"He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful\npersonality than Cornelius.\"\n\"Yes, but I meant â\"\n\"I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his\nworking life, does not under-estimate Lord Voldemort.\"\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily\nProphet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed ii. \"And ... sir ... I\nsaw about Madam Bones.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"A terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think â ouch.\"\nHe had pointed with his injured hand.\n\"Professor, what happened to your â ?\"\n\"I have no time to explain now,\" said Dumbledore. \"It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.\"\nHe smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep\nasking questions.\n\"Sir â I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the\nDeath Eaters. . . .\"\n\"Yes, I received one myself,\" said Dumbledore, still smiling. \"Did you find it useful?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I\nam indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.\"\n\"I didn't. . .\" Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.\n\"For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry. . . although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\nbeen sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.\"\n\"Er. . . right,\" said Harry. \"Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi.

This is the place, Harry, just here. . . .\"\nThey were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the\nhorrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate,\nDumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.\n\"Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.\"\nHarry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was\nhanging off its hinges.\nDumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.\n\"Wand out and follow me, Harry,\" he said quietly.\nHe opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the\nfront door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.\n\"Lumos.\"\nDumbledore's wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open.\nHolding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.\nA scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked,\nits pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn\nacross the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers\noozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything.\nDumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something\ndarkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry's small intake of breath made Dumbledore\nlook around.\n\"Not pretty, is it?\" he said heavily. \"Yes, something horrible has happened here.\"\nDumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry\nfollowed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the\noverturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.\n\"Maybe there was a fight and â and they dragged him off, Professor?\" Harry suggested, trying not to\nimagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.\n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.\n\"You mean he's â ?\"\n\"Still here somewhere? Yes.\"\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\nAnd without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed\narmchair, which yelled, \"Ouch!\"\n\"Good evening, Horace,\" said Dumbledore, straightening up again.\nHarryâs jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an\nenormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an\naggrieved and watery eye."

The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore's chin.\n\"What gave it away?\" he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed\nremarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.\n\"My dear Horace,\" said Dumbledore, looking amused, \"if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the\nDark Mark would have been set over the house.\"\nThe wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.\n\"The Dark Mark,\" he muttered. \"Knew there was something ... ah well. Wouldn't have had time anyway, I'd\nonly just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.\"\nHe heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.\n\"Would you like my assistance clearing up?\" asked Dumbledore politely.\n\"Please,\" said the other.\nThey stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one\nidentical sweeping motion.\nThe furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into their\ncushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side\ntables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and\nalighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls\nwiped themselves clean.\n\"What kind of blood was that, incidentally?\" asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly\nunsmashed grandfather flock.\n\"On the walls? Dragon,\" shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the\nchandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.\nThere was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.\n\"Yes, dragon,\" repeated the wizard conversationally. \"My last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the\nmoment.

Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face\nthe room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.\n\"Hmpf,\" he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. \"Here â\" He gave a drink\nto Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the\ncushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.\n\"Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?\" Dumbledore asked.\n\"Not so well,\" said Slughorn at once. \"Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can't move like I used to.\nWell, that's to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.\"\n\"And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,\" said\nDumbledore. \"You can't have had more than three minutes' warning?\"\nSlughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, \"Two. Didn't hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath.\nStill,\" he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, \"the fact remains that I'm an old man,\nAlbus. A tired old man who's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.\"\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody\ncould say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of\nchocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich,\nfussy old lady.\n\"You're not yet as old as I am, Horace,\" said Dumbledore.\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\n\"Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,\" said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry\neyes had found Dumbledore's injured hand. \"Reactions not what they were, I see.\"\n\"You're quite right,\" said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned\nand blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harry's neck prickle unpleasantly. \"1 am\nundoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .\"\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed\na ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily\nmade of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle."

Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts â\"\n\"If you're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your\nbreath, Albus!

Never liked her.\"\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.\n\"Sorry,\" Harry said hastily. \"It's just â I didn't like her either.\"\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly.\n\"Are you leaving?\" asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.\n\"No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"Oh,\" said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. \"Second on the left down the hall.\"\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\nDumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few\nmoments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at\nHarry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.\n\"Don't think I don't know why he's brought you,\" he said abruptly.\nHarry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn's watery eyes slid over Harry's scar, this time taking in the rest\nof his face.\n\"You look very like your father.\"\n\"Yeah, I've been told,\" said Harry.\n\"Except for your eyes.

You shouldn't have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your\nmother,\" Slughorn added, in answer to Harryâs questioning look. \"Lily Evans.

You'll be Gryffindor like her, I\nsuppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have\ndone â been in the papers for the last couple of years â died a few weeks ago â\"\nIt was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry's intestines and held them tight.\n\"Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House,\nbut Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame â he was a talented boy.

Apparently lost in memories, he\ngazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.\n\"Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out.

Then he shrugged.\n\"Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times.

I suppose everybody's in mortal danger now. ... I don't think it\ncan be just our family . . . but I don't know anyone else who's got a clock like this, so I can't check. Oh!\"\nWith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock's face. Mr. Weasley's hand had switched to \"traveling.\"\n\"He's coming!\"\nAnd sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried\nto it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, \"Arthur, is\nthat you?\"\n\"Yes,\" came Mr. Weasley's weary voice. \"But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the\nquestion!\"\n\"Oh, honestly...\"\n\"Molly!\"\n\"All right, all right. . . What is your dearest ambition?\"\n\"To find out how airplanes stay up.\"\nMrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the\nother side, because the door remained firmly shut.\n\"Molly! I've got to ask you your question first!\"\nChapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm"

Something smells good â onion\nsoup?\"\nMr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.\n\"Harry! We didn't expect you until morning!\"\nThey shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of\nsoup in front of him too.\n\"Thanks, Molly. It's been a tough night. Some idiot's started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them\naround your neck and you'll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all\nfor ten Galleons!\"\n\"And what really happens when you put them on?\"\n\"Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle\nlike warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo's didn't have enough to do already!\"\n\"It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,\" said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. \"Are you\nsure â ?\"\n\"Of course I am!\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The boys wouldn't do anything like that now, not when people are\ndesperate for protection!\"\n\"So is that why you're late, Metamorph-Medals?\"\n\"No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law\nEnforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there. ...\"\nHarry stifled a yawn behind his hand.\nChapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm\n\"Bed,\" said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. \"I've got Fred and George's room all ready for you, you'll\nhave it to yourself.\"\n\"Why, where are they?\"\n\"Oh, they're in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they're so busy,\" said Mrs.\nWeasley. \"I must say, I didn't approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business!

Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk\nout of the room.\n\"G'night, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley.\nHarry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands\nwere once again at \"mortal peril.\"\nFred and George's bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the\nbedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of\nflowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the\nlingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted\nto a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry's school trunk. The\nroom looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.\nHedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the\nwindow; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good\nnight, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He\ngroped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille.\nSmiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.\nSeconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door\nburst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight\nseemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses\nwith the other.\n\"Wuzzgoinon?\"\n\"We didn't know you were here already!\" said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the\ntop of the head.\n\"Ron, don't hit him!\" said a girl's voice reproachfully.\nHarry's hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hardly see\nanyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley\ncame into focus, grinning down at him.\n\"All right?\"\n\"Never been better,\" said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. \"You?\"\n\"Not bad,\" said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. \"When did you get here? Mum's only\nChapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm\njust told us!\"\n\"About one o'clock this morning.\"\n\"Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?\"\n\"Same as usual,\" said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, \"they didn't talk to me\nmuch, but I like it better that way. How're you, Hermione?\"\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something. He"

He\nthought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius's death or any other\nmiserable subject at the moment, he said, \"What's the time? Have I missed breakfast?\"\n\"Don't worry about that, Mum's bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,\" said Ron, rolling\nhis eyes. \"So, what's been going on?\"\n\"Nothing much, I've just been stuck at my aunt and uncle's, haven't I?\"\n\"Come off it!\" said Ron. \"You've been off with Dumbledore!\"\n\"It wasn't that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement.\nHis name's Horace Slughorn.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Ron, looking disappointed. \"We thought â\"\nHermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\n\"âwe thought it'd be something like that.\"\n\"You did?\" said Harry, amused.\n\"Yeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,\ndon't we? So, er, what's he like?\"\n\"He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,\" said Harry. \"Something wrong,\nHermione?\"\nShe was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She\nrearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.\n\"No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he'll be a good teacher?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry. \"He can't be worse than Umbridge, can he?\"\n\"I know someone who's worse than Umbridge,\" said a voice from the doorway. Ron's younger sister\nslouched into the room, looking irritable. \"Hi, Harry.\"\n\"What's up with you?\" Ron asked.\n\"It's her,\" said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. \"She's driving me mad.\"\n\"What's she done now?\" asked Hermione sympathetically.\n\"It's the way she talks to me â you'd think I was about three!\"\nChapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm\n\"I know,\" said Hermione, dropping her voice. \"She's so full of herself.\"\nHarry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for\nsaying angrily, \"Can't you two lay off her for five seconds?\"\n\"Oh, that's right, defend her,\" snapped Ginny. \"We all know you can't get enough of her.\"\nThis seemed an odd comment to make about Ron's mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something,\nHarry said, \"Who are you â ?\"\nBut his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry\ninstinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the\nfloor.\nA young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed\nto have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate\na faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray."

When he merely shrugged,\nshe said, \"Well, Mum's going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.\"\n\"How's she going to manage that?\" asked Harry.\n\"She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she's hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead.

They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny\ntwinge of regret. . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required\nPotions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn't, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he\nlooked again at that small black E.\nIt was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make\na good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he\nwould like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few\nweeks ago. . . .

He spent most of his\ndays playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny;\nHermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating\ntriple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\nIt would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances, odd\naccidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley\nbrought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasleyâs displeasure, Harry's sixteenth\nbirthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking\ngaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.\n\"There have been another couple of dementor attacks,\" he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large\nslice of birthday cake. \"And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had\nbeen set over it â well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death\nEaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.\"\n\"Yes, well,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, \"perhaps we should talk about something diffâ\"\n\"Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?\" asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. \"The\nman who ran â\"\n\"â the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?\" Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the\npit of his stomach. \"He used to give me free ice creams.

He was a good man, Florean.\"\n\"Talking of Diagon Alley,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"looks like Ollivander's gone too.\"\n\"The wandmaker?\" said Ginny, looking startled.\n\"That's the one. Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was\nkidnapped.\"\n\"But wands â what'll people do for wands?\"\n\"They'll make do with other makers,\" said Lupin. \"But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have\ngot him it's not so good for us.\"\nThe day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry's\nincluded a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.\n\"That gives you equal status with prefects!\" cried Hermione happily. \"You can use our special bathroom\nnow and everything!\"\n\"Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,\" said Ron, examining the badge with glee. \"Harry, this\nis so cool, you're my Captain â if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .\"\n\"Well, I don't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you've got these,\" sighed\nMrs. Weasley, looking down Ronâs booklist. \"We'll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn't have to\ngo into work again. I'm not going there without him.\"\n\"Mum, d'you honestly think You-Know-Who's going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and\nBlotts?\" sniggered Ron.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?\" said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. \"If you think\nsecurity's a laughing matter you can stay behind and I'll get your things myselfâ\"\n\"No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George's shop!\" said Ron hastily.\n\"Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you're too immature to come with us!\" said\nMrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at \"mortal peril,\"\nand balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. \"And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as\nwell!\"\nRon turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock\ninto her arms and stormed out of the room.\n\"Blimey. . . you can't even make a joke round here anymore. . . .\"\nBut Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without\nany more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who\nwould be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny's pleasure), passed a full money bag\nacross the table to Harry.\n\"Where's mine?\" demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.\n\"That's already Harry's, idiot,\" said Bill. \"I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it's taking about"

Ginny mimed vomiting into her\ncereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nIt was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once\nbefore, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.\n\"It's good Dad can get us these again,\" said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved\nsmoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione,\nand Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.\n\"Don't get used to it, it's only because of Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley\nwere in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what\nresembled a two-seater sofa. \"He's been given top-grade security status. And we'll be joining up with\nadditional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.\"\nHarry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping\nwhile surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt\nthat, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he\ncame to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.\n\"Here you are, then,\" said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he\nslowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. \"I'm to wait for you, any idea how\nlong you'll be?\"\n\"A couple of hours, I expect,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Ah, good, he's here!\"\nHarry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting\noutside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper,\nwearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry's face and oblivious to the startled stares of\npassing Muggles.\n\"Harry!\" he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the\ncar. \"Buckbeak â Witherwings, I mean â yeh should see him, Harry, he's so happy ter be back in the\nopen air â\"\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"Glad he's pleased,\" said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. \"We didn't know 'security' meant you!\""

See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o' Aurors, but Dumbledore\nsaid I'd do,\" said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. \"Lets get\ngoin' then â after yeh, Molly, Arthur â\"\nThe Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry's memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord,\nwizened and toothless,\nremained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said\nimportantly, \"Jus' passin' through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.\"\nTom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked\nthrough the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised\nhis pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a\nwinding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.\nDiagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and\ncauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over\nthem. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry\npamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of\nDeath Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest\napothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor. On\nthe other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which\nhad been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned\nto its front:\nAMULETS\nEffective Against Werewolves, -=-Dement on, and -=-infer!\nA seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"One for your little girl, madam?\" he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. \"Protect her\npretty neck?\"\n\"If I were on duty . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.\n\"Yes, but don't go arresting anyone now, dear, we're in a hurry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a\nlist. \"I think we'd better do Madam Malkin's first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron's showing\nmuch too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Harry, you've grown so much\nâ come on, everyone â\"\n\"Molly, it doesn't make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin's,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Why don't those\nthree go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone's school-books?\""

Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward\nFlourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for\nMadam Malkin's.\nHarry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs.\nWeasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly\nknit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.\n\"Migh' be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,\" said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin's and\nbending down to peer through the window. \"I'll stand guard outside, all right?\"\nSo Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but\nno sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack\nof dress robes in spangled green and blue.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\". . . not a child, in case you haven't noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.\"\nThere was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, \"Now,\ndear, your mother's quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it's\nnothing to do with being a child â\"\n\"Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you!\"\nA teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a\nhandsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He\nstrode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and\nHermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.\n\"If you're wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,\" said Draco Malfoy.\n\"I don't think there's any need for language like that!\" said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the\nclothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. \"And I don't want wands drawn in my shop either!\" she\nadded hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their\nwands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, \"No,\ndon't, honestly, it's not worth it. \"\n\"Yeah, like you'd dare do magic out of school,\" sneered Malfoy. \"Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want\nto send them flowers.\"\n\"That's quite enough!\" said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. \"Madam â\nplease â\"\nNarcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack."

The left-hand window was dazzlingly full\nof an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harrys eyes began to\nwater just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the\nMinistry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:\nWHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT\nYOU-KNOW-WHO?\nYOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT\nU-NO-POO--\nTHE CONSTIPATION SENSATION\nTHAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!\nHarry started to laugh.

Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.\n\"There you go,\" said Fred proudly. \"Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere.\"\nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. \"Do they work?\" she asked.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question\nâ\"\n\"â and the attractiveness of the girl,\" said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. \"But we're not\nselling them to our sister,\" he added, becoming suddenly stern, \"not when she's already got about five boys\non the go from what we've â\"\n\"Whatever you've heard from Ron is a big fat lie,\" said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink\npot off the shelf. \"What's this?\"\n\"Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,\" said Fred. \"Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads,\nbut don't change the subject.

So what about\nMichael Corner?\"\n\"I dumped him, he was a bad loser,\" said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching\nthe Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. \"They're really cute!\"\n\"They're fairly cuddly, yes,\" conceded Fred. \"But you're moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?\"\nGinny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips.

Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed\nWeasleys' Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the\nwindow and they lost sight of him.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"Wonder where his mummy is?\" said Harry, frowning.\n\"Given her the slip by the looks of it,\" said Ron.\n\"Why, though?\" said Hermione.\nHarry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of\nher sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.\nHarry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.\nHe glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was\ndelightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping\ncustomers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down\nthe street.\n\"Get under here, quick,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.\n\"Oh â I don't know, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.\n\"Come on\\\" said Ron.\nShe hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them\nvanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George's products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed\ntheir way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had\ndisappeared just as successfully as they had.\n\"He was going in that direction,\" murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid\nwould not hear them. âCmon.â\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nThey scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed\nahead.\n\"That's him, isn't it?\" she whispered. \"Turning left?\"\n\"Big surprise,\" whispered Ron.\nFor Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.\n\"Quick, or we'll lose him,\" said Harry, speeding up.\n\"Our feet'Il be seen!\" said Hermionc anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was\nmuch more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Harry impatiently. \"Just hurry!\"\nBut Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered\ninto windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it\nwas a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts â or at least, to be\nseen buying them.\nHermione gave his arm a hard pinch.\n\"Ouch!\""

Look! He's in there!\" she breathed in Harry's ear.\nThey had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and\nBurkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old\nbottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nwhich Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoy's hands,\nhe was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood\nfacing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.\n\"If only we could hear what they're saying!\" said Hermione.\n\"We can!\" said Ron excitedly. \"Hang on â damn â\"\nHe dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.\n\"Extendable Ears, look!\"\n\"Fantastic!\" said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-\ncolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. \"Oh, I hope the door isn't\nImperturbable â\"\n\"No!\" said Ron gleefully. \"Listen!\"\nThey put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy's voice\ncould be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.\n\". . . you know how to fix it?\"\n\"Possibly,\" said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. \"I'll need to see it,\nthough. Why don't you bring it into the shop?\"\n\"I can't,\" said Malfoy. \"It's got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.\"\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nHarry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.\n\"Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn't guarantee\nanything.\"\n\"No?\" said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \"Perhaps this will make\nyou more confident.\"\nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled\nsideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.\n\"Tell anyone,\" said Maifoy, \"and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He's a family\nfriend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention.\"\n\"There will be no need for â\"\n\"I'll decide that,\" said Malfoy. \"Well, I'd better be off. And don't forget to keep that one safe, I'll need it.\"\n\"Perhaps you'd like to take it now?\"\n\"No, of course I wouldn't, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don't\nsell it.\"\n\"Of course not. . . sir.\""

He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their\nknees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.\n\"What was that about?\" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something\nin there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said 'that one'?\"\n\"No, he was behind that cabinet â\"\n\"You two stay here,\" whispered Hermione.\n\"What are you â ?\"\nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the\nglass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back\nunder the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.\n\"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?\" Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a\nsuspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.\n\"Is this necklace for sale?\" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.\n\"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons,\" said Mr.\nBorgin coldly.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n\"Oh â er â no, I haven't got quite that much,\" said Hermione, walking on. \"And . . . what about this\nlovely â um â skull?\"\n\"Sixteen Galleons.\"\n\"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being . . . kept for anyone?\"\nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to.\nApparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the\nwinds.\n\"The thing is, that â er â boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he's a friend of mine, and I\nwant to get him a birthday present, but if he's already reserved anything, I obviously don't want to get him\nthe same thing, so ... um ...\"\nIt was a pretty lame story in Harry's opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.\n\"Out,\" he said sharply. \"Get out!\"\nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell\ntinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.\n\"Ah well,\" said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. \"Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious â\"\n\"Well, next time you can show me how it's done, Master of Mystery!\" she snapped."

Once in the shop, Harry\nwhipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in\nanswer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not\nhave looked properly.\nHotLog\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:16)\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn\nAlley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing\nthat made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor\nHermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored\nof discussing it after a few days.\n\"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\" said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the\nwindowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only\ngrudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \"But haven't we agreed there\ncould be a lot of explanations?\"\n\"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory\" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's\nbent tail twigs. \"Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\"\n\"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?\" asked Harry for the umpteenth time.\n\"That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\"\n\"You reckon?\" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\n\"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry.

Instead, two grim-faced, bearded\nAurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched\nthem into the station without speaking.\n\"Quick, quick, through the barrier,\" said Mrs. Weasley, who\nseemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \"Harry had better go first, with â\"\nShe looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry's upper arm, and attempted\nto steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.\n\"I can walk, thanks,\" said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley\ndirectly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on\nplatform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.\nHermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror,\nHarry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.\n\"We can't, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking apologetic. \"Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first\nand then patrol the corridors for a bit.\"\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot,\" said Harry.\n\"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go,\" said Mrs. Weasley,\nconsulting her watch. \"Well, have a lovely term, Ron. . . .\"\n\"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?\" said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment."

He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage,\nbut Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her,\ndragging his trunk.\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their\ncompartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he\nwould have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy\nthe sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n\"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\"\n\"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing\nbehind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that\nGinny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked\naround: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n\"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him.\n\"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.\n\"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n\"Luna, hi, how are you?\"\n\"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front\nannounced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n\"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given\nit an exclusive interview the previous year.\n\"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily.\n\"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring\nstudents. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n\"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\"\n\"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the"

She bought me a new wand, look!\"\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n\"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he\nvanished next day â oi, come back here, Trevor!\"\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n\"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna,\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nwho was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n\"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head\nagainst the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n\"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\"\n\"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\"\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming\nmixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside\ntheir compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side\nof the glass.\n\"You ask him!\"\nNo, you!\n\"I'll do it!\"\nAnd one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed\nher way through the door.\n\"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,\" she said loudly and confidently. \"Why don't you join us in our\ncompartment? You don't have to sit with them,\" she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom,\nwhich was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now\nwearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\n\"They're friends of mine,\" said Harry coldly.\n\"Oh,\" said the girl, looking very surprised. \"Oh. Okay.\"\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\n\"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,\" said Luna, once again displaying her knack for\nembarrassing honesty.\n\"You are cool,\" said Harry shortly. \"None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.\"\n\"That's a very nice thing to say,\" beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and\nsettled down to read The\nQuibbler.\n\"We didn't face him, though,\" said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and\na resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \"You did.

While Neville\nrecited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nonly an \"Acceptable,\" Harry watched him without really listening.\nNeville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea\nhow close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet,\nfor his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped\nscar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? Would Nevilleâs mother have died to save him, as Lily\nhad died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and\nVoldemort? Would there then have been no \"Chosen One\" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat\nand a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's?\n\"You all right, Harry? You look funny,\" said Neville.\nHarry started. \"Sorry â I â\"\n\"Wrackspurt got you?\" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored\nspectacles.\n\"I âwhat?\"\n\"A Wrackspurt. . . They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\" she\nsaid. \"I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\"\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught\neach other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through\nstretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when\nthe sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\n\"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving,\" said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside\nHarry and rubbing his stomach. \"Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\" he added, turning to Harry. \"Malfoy s\nnot doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we\npassed.\"\nHarry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as\nprefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\n\"What did he do when he saw you?\"\n\"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand\ngesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well â that is\" â he did the hand gesture again â \"but why isn't he\nout there bullying first years?\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things\non his mind than bullying younger students?"

She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon.\nPerplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of\nthe compartment.\n\"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n\"An invitation,\" said Harry.â\nHarry,\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\nSincerely, . , .\n\"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n\"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct.\n\"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get\na good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\"\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the\nlunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his\nbag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have\nincreased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would\nhurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into\nher compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in\ndetermined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did\nnot entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry\npushed on.\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although\njudging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n\"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed\nto fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed\nas brightly in the sunlight as the golden\nbuttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\"\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only\ntwo empty seats, which were nearest the door.

No?\"\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n\"â and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether â ?\"\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.\n\"â and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished.\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back.\n\"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said Slughorn cozily. \"A chance to get to know you all a little better.\nHere, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on\nlicorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?\"\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\n\"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\" Slughorn\ntold Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \"Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his\nOrder of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\"\nUnfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he\nswallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\n\"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\n\"Not. . . not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\n\"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy,\" said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \"I doubt he invented\nthe Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\"\n\"I suppose . . .\" said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that\nSlughorn had finished with him. \"Er ... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really\nknow much about...\"\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\n\"Now, you, Cormac,\" said Slughorn, \"I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he\nhas a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\""

Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to\nsomebody well-known or influential â everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after\nMcLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out,\nshe had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of\ngold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents,\nwell-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater\ncronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment\non Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair.\n\"And now,\" said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act.\n\"Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\" He\ncontemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant,\nthen said, \"'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!\"\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\n\"Of course,\" said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \"there have been rumors for years. ... I remember when\nâ well â after that terrible night â Lily â James â and you survived â and the word was that you\nmust have powers beyond the ordinary â\"\nZabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to\nindicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.\n\"Yeah, Zabini, because you're so talented ... at posing. . . .\"\n\"Oh dear!\" chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around\nSlughorn's great belly. \"You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous\nBat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage!

Harry could not wait to leave, but\ncouldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red\nsunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.\n\"Good gracious, it's getting dark already!

Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to\nChapter 6: Draco's Detour\nchange into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to\nZabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini\nopened the door.

It was fortunate that\nGoyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet\nand ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he\nthought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed\nthe door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe\nreturned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy\nParkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained\nhidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as\nthough anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling\ncast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly\nbelow him.\n\"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want?\"\n\"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini,\nwho was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find\nmany.\"\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy. \"Who else had he invited?\" he demanded.\n\"McLaggen from Gryffindor,\" said Zabini.\n\"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,\" said Malfoy.\n\"â someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw â\""

He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked\nup at the luggage rack, frowning.\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his\nInvisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew\nhis wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to\ndecide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the\ntrain slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out\nonto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last,\nwith a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\n\"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he\nwould hold it. \"I just want to check something.\"\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending\nonto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that\npeople in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy\nwanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to\nmend?\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\"\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed.

As though in slow\nmotion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's\nfeet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly\ninto the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who\nsmiled broadly.\n\"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash\nthrough the air after Zabini came back. . . .\"\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers.\n\"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter.

His\nimmediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train\ndeparted again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the\ncompartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in\nand step on him.\nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping\nsickeningly into his open mouth.

What a stupid situation to have landed himself in... and now the last few\nfootsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the\nscraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and\ntook their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally\nrealized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like\nDumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out\nof his hand, by saying the words \"Accio Wand!\" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.\nHe thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl,\nbut no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices\nwondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the\nconvoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from\nwhichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe,\nGoyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.\nThe train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the\nseats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was\nleaving and nobody knew he was still on it...\nThen he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \"Wotcher, Harry.\"\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified\nsitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to\nlook up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiv Cloak she had just pulled away.\nWe'd better get out of here, quickly,\" she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they\nbegan to move out of the station. \"Come on, we'll jump.\"\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which\nseemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little\non landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the\ncorner, and disappear from view.\nThe cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and\nembarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the\nInvisibility Cloak.\nâWho did it?\"\nâDraco Malfoy,â said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for... well...\"\nâNo problem,â said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as\nmousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your"

He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended.\nChapter 8 - Victorious Snape\nâThanks a lot!\"\nâYou'd better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,\" said Tonks, still unsmiling. As\nHarry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature\nerupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.\n''Was that a Patronus?\" asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\n\"Yes, I'm sending word to the castle that I've got you or they'll worry. Come on, we'd better not dawdle.\"\nThey set off toward the lane that led to the school.\n\"How did you find me?\"\n\"I noticed you hadn't left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some\nreason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Iâd check.\"\n\"But what are you doing here, anyway?\" Harry asked.\n\"I'm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,\" said Tonks.\n\"Is it just you who's stationed up here, or â ?\"\n\"No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.\"\n\"Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?\"\n\"That's right.\"\nThey trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways\nat Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at\ntimes), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and\npurposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that\nHermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn't been her\nfault at all, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius's death; it was no\nmore her fault than anyone elseâs (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he\ncould avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks's long cloak whispering on\nthe ground behind them.\nHaving always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was\nfrom Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each\ntopped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy\nTonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.\nâAlohomora!\" he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened."

Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even\nendure Filch's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with\nthe regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from\nthem, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of\npure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.\n\"Well, well, well,\" sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains\nsnaked backward and the gates creaked open. \"Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently\ndecided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.\"\n\"I couldn't change, I didn't have my â\" Harry began, but Snape cut across him.\n\"There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite â ah\nâ safe in my hands.\"\n\"I meant Hagrid to get the message,\" said Tonks, frowning.\nChapter 8 - Victorious Snape\n\"Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead.

Then\nshe was covered in darkness once more.\n\"Good night,\" Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape.\n\"Thanks for ... everything,\"\n\"See you, Harry.\"\nSnape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so\npowerful that it seemed incredibie that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from\ntheir first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's\nforgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius.

Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the\nsummer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the\nrest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius\nrushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to\nblame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was\ndead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.\nâFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. âAnd, let me see, another twenty for your\nMuggle attire. You know, I donât believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term:\nWe haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\"\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been\nimmobilized all the way\nback to London than tell Snape why he was late.\nâI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?\" Snape\ncontinued. \"And with no flying car available you decided that\nbursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to\ncreate a dramatic effect.\"\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might\nexplode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for\nthe few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without\nanyone else listening.\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged\nentrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors\nstanding open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on,\nthereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the\nentrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, \"No cloak.\nYou can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure.\"\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape.\nThe Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated\nas usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was ail a shimmering blur to\nHarry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to\nstare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione,\nsped along the benches toward them, .mil forced his way in between them.\n\"Where've you â blimey, what've you done to your face?\" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone\nelse in the vicinity. I\n\"Why, what's wrong with it?\" said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\nChapter 8 - Victorious Snape\n\"You're covered in blood!\" said Hermione. \"Come here â\"\nShe raised her wand, said \"Tergeo!\" and siphoned off the dried blood.\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \"How's my nose looking?"

Harry, what happened? We've been terrified!\"\nâI'll tell you later,\" said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were\nlistening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to\neavesdrop.\nâBut â\" said Hermione.\nâNot now, Hermione,\" said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all\nassume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a\ndementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it\nwouldn't reach too many Gryffindor ears.\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful chips, but before he could take them they\nvanished, to be replaced with puddings.\nâYou missed the Sorting, anyway,\" said Hermione, as Ron dived a largt: chocolate gateau.\nâHat say anything interesting?\" asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\nâMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.\"\nâDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?\" Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the\nfeast doesn't he? It can't be long now.\"\nâSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast â\"\nâYou've seen Snape? How come?\" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\n\"Bumped into him,\" said Harry evasively.\n\"Hagrid was only a few minutes late,\" said Hermione. \"Look, he's waving at you, Harry.\"\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never\nquite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House,\nthe top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting\nside by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see\nthe Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid's other side; she rarely left her tower room,\nand he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads\nand trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a\nbit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who\nhad made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry's parents and attack Harry himself. The\nknowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be\ndropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward\nthe Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause.\nHarry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again.

The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\n\"The very best of evenings to you!\" he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace\nthe whole room.\nâWhat happened to his hand?\" gasped Hermione.\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore's right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as\nit had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it the room; Dumbledore,\ninterpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.\nâNothing to worry about,\" he said airily. \"Now ... to our new students, welcome, to our old students,\nwelcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you . ..\"\n\"His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,\"\nHarry whispered to Hermione. \"I thought he'd have cured it by now, though ... or Madam Pomfrey\nwould've done.\"\n\"It looks as if it's died,\" said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. \"But there are some injuries you can't\ncure... old cursesâ¦and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .\"\n\". . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say chat there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought\nat the shop called Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.\n\"Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as\nusual.

With what Harry considered pure\npigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.\nâCome on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinsonâ¦.\nWhat kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?\"\nâHow d'you know Voldemort doesn't need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn't be the first â\"\nâI wish yeh'd stop sayin' tha name, Harry,\" said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his\nshoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head.\n\"Dumbledore uses that name,\" said Harry stubbornly\nâYeah, well, tha's Dumbledore, innit?\" said Hagrid mysteriously.\nâSo how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.\"\n\"Got held up on the train,\" said Harry. \"Why were you late?\"\n\"I was with Grawp,\" said Hagrid happily. \"Los' track o' the time. He's got a new home up in the mountains\nnow, Dumbledore fixed it â nice big cave. He's much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin' a\ngood chat.\"\n\"Really?\" said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron's eye; the last time he had met Hagrid's half-brother, a\nvicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two\nof which he was unable to pronounce properly."

Ron looked rather pleased with himself.\nThe ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares\nof sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon,\nHarry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.\n\"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures !\" she said, looking distressed. \"I mean,\nwhen has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?\"\n\"That's it, though, innit?\" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \"We were the ones who made\nthe most effort in classes because we like Hagrid.

I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an 'Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to\nN.E.W.T. level. Just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\"\nNeville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.\n\"Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I've never had the impression that you\nparticularly enjoyed it.\"\nNeville looked miserable and muttered something about \"my grandmother wants.\"\n\"Hmph,\" snorted Professot McGonagall. \"It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the\ngrandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the\nMinistry.\"\nNeville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment\nbefore.\n\"I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an 'Exceeds\nExpectations' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\"\n\"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\" mumbled Neville.\n\"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just\nbecause she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" Smiling slightly at the\nlook of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip\nof her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.\nProfessor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the\nhandsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.\n\"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\" said Professor McGonagall, a\nhint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination.\n\"The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\"\nParvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.\n\"So, Potter, Potter . . .\" said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \"Charms,\nDefense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your\nTransfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions?

Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the\nGryffindor Quidditch team.

Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or\nletting in their friends. ...\"\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the\nfourth-year student.

Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books\nand looking put-upon.\n\"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A\nfifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\"\n\"Shame,\" yawned Ron.\n\"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\"\nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as\never by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n\"Inside,\" he said.\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\ngloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New\npictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly\ninjuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the\nshadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class"

The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting\nthem is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even\nfiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\"\nHarry stared at Snape.

These pictures - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of\nwhat happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch\nwho was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed,\nslumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground.\n\"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using\nthem?\"\n\"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to\nassume he might use them again.

None of them had ever cast the charm\nwithout speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering\nthe incantation instead of saying it aloud.

Harry had his wand raised, waiting\non tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\n\"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you -\"\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells\nforgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\"\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk.

I'm Muggle-born, you see.\"\nHarry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed\nno dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.\n\"Oho! 'One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very\nfriend of whom you spoke, Harry?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Harry.\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\n\"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially."

Hermione turned to\nHarry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh,\nHarry!\"\n\"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are\nthe best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\"\nHermione smiled but made a \"shhing\" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron\nlooked slightly disgruntled.\n\"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this\nwill simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful\npotion in this room - oh yes,\" he said, nodding gravely at Maifoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking\nskeptically. \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of\nobsessive love. ...\n\"And now,\" said Slughorn, \"it is time for us to start work.\"\n\"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\" said Ernie Macmillan , pointing at a small black cauldron\nstanding on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten\ngold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.\n\"Oho,\" said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had\nwaited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious\nlittle potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an\naudible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\"\n\"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly. \"It makes you lucky!\"\nThe whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his\nsleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.\n\"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said\nSlughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this\nhas been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\"\n\"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?\" said Terry Boot eagerly.\n\"Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\" said\nSlughorn. \"Too much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken\nsparingly, and very occasionally . . .\"\n\"Have you ever taken it, sir?\" asked Michael Corner with great interest."

Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.\n\"And that,\" said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \"is what I shall be offering as a prize in this\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\nlesson.\"\nThere was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.\n\"One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his\npocket and showing it to them all. \"Enough for twelve hours' luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky\nin everything you attempt.\"\n\"Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . .\nsporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only .\n. . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!\"\n\"So,\" said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \"how are you to win fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of\nAdvanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a\ndecent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have\nattempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however,\nwill win little Felix here. Off you go!\"\nThere was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began\nadding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible.\nHarry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making., It could not have been\nclearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had\nlent him.\nTo his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were\nas black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner\nhad made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he\nneeded. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could.\nEveryone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a\ndisadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the\nwhole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion\nalready resembled the \"smooth, black currant-colored liquid\" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.\nHaving finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having\nto try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner,\nwho for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the\nalternative instruction:"

Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected\nto be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had\nlearned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\nthe bottle of Felix Felicis.\nThe sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.\n\"Can I borrow your silver knife?\"\nShe nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according\nto the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.\nHarry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so\nmuch juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.\nHastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly\nthe shade of lilac described by the textbook.\nHis annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of\ninstructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water.\nAccording to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every\nseventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?\nHarry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The\npotion turned pale pink.\n\"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier\nand bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.\n\"Add a clockwise stir -\"\n\"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped.\nHarry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . .\nseven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry\nglanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated,\nsomething that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.\n\"And time's . . . up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\"\nSlughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons.

Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw\nsomething scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the\ninstructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his\ntrunk upstairs.\nThis book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.\nHotLog\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 10: The house of count\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:5)\nFor or the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions\nwherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was\nraving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor\nHermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had\nmore difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud\nor it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the\n\"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the\nPrince's.\nHarry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had\nbeen given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had\nskimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made\nadditional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what\nlooked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.\n\"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common\nroom on Saturday evening. \"It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl's than a\nboy's.\"\n\"The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\" Harry said. \"How many girls have been Princes?\""

We'll wait up, we want to hear what he\nteaches you!\"\n\"Hope it goes okay,\" said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole.\nHarry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor\nTrelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing\ncards, reading them as she walked.\n\"Two of spades: conflict,\" she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \"Seven of\nspades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence.

Harry waited until he was quite sure she\nhad gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single\ngargoyle stood against the wall.\n\"Acid Pops,\" said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral\nChapter 10: The house of count\nstone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the\ndoor with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore's Office.\nHarry knocked.\n\"Come in,\" said Dumbledore s voice.\n\"Good evening, sir,\" said Harry, walking into the headmaster's office.\n\"Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"I hope you've had an enjoyable first\nweek back at school?\" \"Yes, thanks, sir,\" said Harry.\n\"You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\" \"Er,\" began Harry awkwardly, but\nDumbledore did not look too stern.\n\"I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked\naround surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening.\nThe circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged\ntables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their\nframes, and Dumbledore's magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching\nHarry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling\npractice.\n\"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have"

It was hard to keep a\nnote of accusation from his voice. \"Sir,\" he added.\n\"And so I did,\" said Dumbledore placidly. \"I told you everything I know.

When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding\na familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk\nin front of Harry.\n\"You look worried.\"\nHarry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd\ndevice that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been\nuncomfortable.

But Dumbledore was smiling.\n\"This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\"\n\"Where are we going, sir?\"\n\"For a trip down Bob Ogden's memory lane,\" said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle\ncontaining a swirling silvery-white substance.\n\"Who was Bob Ogden?\"\n\"He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\" said Dumbledore. \"He died some\ntime ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me.\nWe are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties.

He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was\nfalling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight.\nBefore his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.\nThey were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright\nand blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously\nthick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking\nout of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only\nChapter 10: The house of count\nperson in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced\nwizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing\ncostume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set\noff at a brisk walk down the lane.\nDumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The\none pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden\nsaid Little Hangleton, 1 mile.\nThey walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the\nswishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a\nhillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could\nsee a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard\nclearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by\na wide expanse of velvety green lawn.\nOgden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride,\nand Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as\nhe had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He\nsoon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane\ncurved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat\nvanishing through a gap in the hedge.\nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows"

The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last\none, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon\nopened up\nat the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his\nwand.\nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds\nbefore Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a\nvery strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby,\nblocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were\nmossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all\naround it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded\nthat nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a\nthin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.\nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees\nslid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.\nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet\nright in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.\n\"You're not welcome.\"\nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of\nhis teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have\nlooked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing\nChapter 10: The house of count\naway several more paces before he spoke.\n\"Er â good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic â\" \"You're not welcome.\"\n\"Er â I'm sorry â I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously.\nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's\nopinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the\nother.\n\"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly\nnonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden â ?\"\nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.\n\"He's speaking Parseltongue?\"\n\"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.\nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.\n\"Now, look â\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his\nnose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.\n\"Morfin!\" said a loud voice."

This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very\nbroad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face,\ngave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was\nnow cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground.\n\"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his\nface. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\"\n\"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden.\n\"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property.\nCan't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\"\n\"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.\n\"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still\nissuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out\nof the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\"\nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being\nsaid, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the\npoint of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away\nto the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung\nsadly again.\nChapter 10: The house of count\n\"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his\ncoat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\"\n\"At, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly\naggressive.\n\"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently\nGaunt felt rather differently.\nHe squinted into Ogdens lace and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I\ncome to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\"\n\"I don't doubt it, if your sons been let loose on them,\" said Og-den. \"Perhaps we could continue this\ndiscussion inside?\"\n\"Inside?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl â\"\n\"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\"\n\"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here\nfollowing a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning â\""

Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen\nand living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live\nadder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:\nHissy, hissy, little snakey,\nSlither on the floor\nYou be good to Morfin\nOr he'll nail you to the door.\nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was\nsomebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone\nwall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around\nwith the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain,\npale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner\nthan the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person.\n\"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked\ninquiringly toward her.\nChapter 10: The house of count\n\"Good morning,\" said Ogden.\nShe did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued\nshifting the pots on the shelf behind her.\n\"Well, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, \"to get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son,\nMorfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\"\nThere was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.\n\"Pick it up!\" Gaunt bellowed at her. \"That's it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what's your wand\nfor, you useless sack of muck?\"\n\"Mr. Gaunt, please!\" said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot,\nflushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again1 drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it\nat the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her,\nhit the opposite wall, and crack in two.\nMorfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \"Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\"\nMerope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and\nsaid firmly, \"Reparo. \" The pot mended itself instantly.\nGaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it:\nInstead, he jeered at his daughter, \"Lucky the nice man from the Ministry's here, isn't it? Perhaps he'll take\nyou off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\""

Perhaps he'll take\nyou off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs. . . .\"\nWithout looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling,\nto its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as\nthough she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.\n\"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit â\"\n\"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was\ncoming to him â what about it, then?\"\n\"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly.\n\"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'\" Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice, making it pompous and singsong.\nMorfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\"\nHe pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.\n\"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.\n\"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing â\"\n\"Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\"\nChapter 10: The house of count\n\"I'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\" said Ogden.\n\"And you think we're scum, do you?\" screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty\nyellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \"Scum who'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to? Do\nyou know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\"\n\"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his\nground.\n\"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but\nthen realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger,\nwaving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries\nit's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been\noffered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\"\n\"I've really no idea,\" said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \"and it's quite beside\nthe point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed â\"\nWith a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to\nthrottle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain\naround her neck.\n\"See this?\" he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped\nfor breath.\n\"I see it, I see it!\" said Ogden hastily."

We're his last living descendants, what do you say to that,\neh?\"\n\"Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!\" said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered\naway from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.\n\"So!\" said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible\ndispute. \"Don't you go talking to us as if we're dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all\nâ more than you can say, I don't doubt!\"\nAnd he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her\nhead bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.\n\"Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden doggedly, \"I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do\nwith the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night.\nOur information\" â he glanced down at his scroll of parchment â \"is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex\non the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\"\nMorfin giggled.\n\"Be quiet, boy,\" snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.\n\"And so what if he did, then?\" Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, \"I expect you've wiped the Muggle's filthy\nface clean for him, and his memory to boot â\"\nChapter 10: The house of count\n\"That's hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\" said Ogden. \"This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless\nâ\"\n\"Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\" sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the\nfloor again.\n\"This discussion is getting us nowhere,\" said Ogden firmly. \"It is clear from your son's attitude that he feels\nno remorse for his actions.\" He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \"Morfin will attend a\nhearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and\ncausing harm and distress to that same Mugg â\"\nOgden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in\nthrough the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where\nthe house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds,\nhis expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white.\n\"My God, what an eyesore!\" rang out a girl's voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she\nhad stood in the room beside them. \"Couldn't your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\""

Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's\nscreams echoing in his ears.\nOgden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with\nthe glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl\nriding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse's\nflank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the\nlane.\n\"I think that will do, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they\nwere both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in\nDumbledore's now twilit office.\n\"What happened to the girl in the cottage?\" said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick\nof his wand. \"Merope, or whatever her name was?\"\n\"Oh, she survived,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should\nsit down too. \"Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen\nminutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage,\nand subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was\nsentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees addition to\nOgden, received six months.\"\n\"Marvolo?\" Harry repeated wonderingly.\n\"That's right,\" said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \"I am glad to see you're keeping up.\"\n\"That old man was â ?\"\n\"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope,\nwere the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that\nChapter 10: The house of count\nflourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled\nwith a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before\nMarvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic\namount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son,\nand rather more than his daughter.\"\n\"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was . . . Sir,\ndoes that mean she was . . . Voldemort's mother?\"\n\"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder\nwhether you noticed?\"\n\"The Muggle Morfin attacked?

I do not believe that her magical\npowers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and\nMorfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure,\nshe was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for\neighteen years.\"\n\"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle\ncompanion, and fall in love with her instead?\"\n\"The Imperius Curse?\" Harry suggested. \"Or a love potion?\"\n\"Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed\nmore romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was\nriding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we\nhave just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the\ngossip it caused when the squire's son ran off with the tramp's daughter, Merope.\"\n\"But the villagers' shock was nothing to Marvolo's. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his\ndaughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of\ndust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.\"\n\"From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth.\nThe shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death â or perhaps he had simply never\nlearned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return\nto the cottage.\"\n\"And Merope? She . .. she died, didn't she? Wasn't Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\"\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Dumbledore. \"We must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it\nChapter 10: The house of count\nis difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle\nreappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife.

What he meant, I am sure, is that he\nhad been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise\nwords for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers\nguessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he\nhad married her for this reason.\"\n\"But she did have his baby.\"\n\"But not until a year after they were married.

I believe that she made the choice to\nstop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now\nhave fallen in love with her in return.

Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had\nbecome more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall\nsaid to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly,\nand to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the\nHalf-Blood Prince.\nNonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and\nTransfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to\nsee them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they\nwere really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside\ninto the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least\nthey were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.\nOne result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry,\nRon, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to\nmeals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the\ncorridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.\n\"We've got to go and explain,\" said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid's huge empty chair at the staff table the\nfollowing Saturday at breakfast.\n\"We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!\" said Ron. \"And we're supposed to be practicing that"

And now they're calling you 'the Chosen One' â well, come on, can't\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\nyou see why people are fascinated by you?\"\nHarry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and\nrainy.\n\"And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you\nwere unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made\nyou write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. ...\"\n\"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,\" said Ron, shaking back his\nsleeves.\n\"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either,\" Hermione finished, ignoring\nRon.\n\"I'm tall,\" said Ron inconsequentially.\nThe post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of\nwater. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their\nchildren and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start\nof term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write\noccasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white\nHedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square\npackage. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule\nand exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon."

Look, I've thought it out â\"\nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand,\nmuttering, \"Dijjindo!\" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione\nlooked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, \"Reparo!\"\nThere sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts,\nlooking thoroughly secondhand.\n\"I'll give Slughorn back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons.\"\nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl\nlanding in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the\nfront page.\n\"Anyone we know dead?\" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every\ntime Hermione opened her paper.\n\"No, but there have been more dementor attacks,\" said Hermione. \"And an arrest.\"\n\"Excellent, who?\" said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. \"Stan Shunpike,\" said Hermione.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\n\"What?\" said Harry, startled.\n\"'Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on\nsuspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on\nhis Clapham home. . .'\"\n\"Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?\" said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years\nbefore. \"No way!\"\n\"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\" said Ron reasonably. \"You never can tell.\"\n\"It doesn't look like it,\" said Hermione, who was still reading. \"It says here he was arrested after he was\noverheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub.\" She looked up with a troubled expression\non her face. \"If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans,\nwould he?\"\n\"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\" said Ron. \"Isn't he the one who\nclaimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?\"\n\"Yeah, that's him,\" said Harry. \"I dunno what they're playing at, taking Stan seriously.\"\n\"They probably want to look as though they're doing something,\" said Hermione, frowning. \"People are\nterrified â you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home?

We've got\nAurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Dumbledore!\"\n\"I don't think we've got him all the time,\" said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over\nthe top of the Prophet. \"Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Hagrid's this past week.\"\nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to\nthink of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.\n\"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"I mean . . . it's\nall looking serious, isn't it?\"\nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a\nhorrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her\nmother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.\nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed\nLavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents\nwanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering\ntogether, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati\nsuddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then\nreturned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the\ntemptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's\nnose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty\ndrizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have\nturned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to\nseventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large,\nwiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.\n\"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment,\" he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake\nHarry's hand. \"Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.\"\n\"You didn't try out last year, did you?\" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking\nthat he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.\n\"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\" said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \"Ate a\npound of doxy eggs for a bet.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well. . . if you wait over there ...\" He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to\nwhere Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and\nwondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both \"old Sluggy's\""

He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and\nwondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both \"old Sluggy's\"\nfavorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of\nten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it\ncould not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain\nairborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal\nposts.\nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew\nhis whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When\nhe told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone\nelse.\nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without\nbroomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.\n\"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor,\" roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously\nannoyed, \"leave now, please!\nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.\nAfter two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and\nseveral broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an\nexcellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and\nGinny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though\nhe was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now\nenduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.\n\"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way of the Keepers I'll hex you,\" he bellowed.\nNeither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased\nwith them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the\nsize of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked\nweedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of\ntheir last team member.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\nHarry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less\npressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had\ncome down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever.\nAs each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced\nover at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match\nlast term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.\nNone of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece.

To Harry's great disappointment,\nCormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the\nwrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.\nRon looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. \"Good luck!\" cried a voice from the\nstands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite\nliked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he\nought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.\nYet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and\nresisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most\nunfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen's red face inches from his own. He stepped back\nhastily.\n\"His sister didn't really try,\" said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the\none Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon's. \"She gave him an easy save.\"\n\"Rubbish,\" said Harry coldly. \"That was the one he nearly missed.\"\nMcLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.\n\"Give me another go.\"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"You've had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron's Keeper, he won it fair and\nsquare. Get out of my way.\"\nHe thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace\nand stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.\nHarry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.\n\"Well done,\" he croaked. \"You flew really well â\"\n\"You did brilliantly, Ron!\"\nThis time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off\nthe pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased\nwith himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.\nAfter fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade\ngood-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid's. A watery sun was trying to break through\nthe clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be\nsomething to eat at Hagrid's.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\n\"I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,\" Ron was saying happily. \"Tricky shot from Demelza,\ndid you see, had a bit of spin on it â\"\n\"Yes, yes, you were magnificent,\" said Hermione, looking amused.\n\"I was better than that McLaggen anyway,\" said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. \"Did you see him\nlumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth?

Ron noticed nothing; he\nwas too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.\nThe great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid's cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp\nbeak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.\n\"Oh dear,\" said Hermione nervously. \"He's still a bit scary, isn't he?\"\n\"Come off it, you've ridden him, haven't you?\" said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the\nhippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.\n\"How are you?\" Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. \"Missing\nhim? But you're okay here with Hagrid, aren't you?\"\n\"Oi!\" said a loud voice.\nHagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack\nof potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded\nforward.\n\"Git away from him! He'll have yer fingers â oh. It's yeh lot.\"\nFang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them\nall for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.\n\"Oh dear!\" said Hermione, looking stricken.\n\"Don't worry about it,\" said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. \"Hagrid! Open\nup, we want to talk to you!\"\nThere was no sound from within.\n\"If you don't open the door, we'll blast it open!\" Harry said, pulling out his wand.\n\"Harry!\" said Hermione, sounding shocked. \"You can't possibly â\"\n\"Yeah, I can!\" said Harry. \"Stand back â\"\nBut before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there\nstood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.\n\"I'm a teacher!\" he roared at Harry. \"A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!\"\n\"I'm sorry, sir\" said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\nHagrid looked stunned. \"Since when have yeh called me 'sir'?\"\n\"Since when have you called me 'Potter'?\"\n\"Oh, very clever,\" growled Hagrid. \"Very amusin'. That's me outsmarted, innit? All righ', come in then, yeh\nungrateful little . . .\"\nMumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather\nfrightened.\n\"Well?\" said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table,\nFang laying his head immediately upon Harry's knee and drooling all over his robes. \"What's this? Feelin'\nsorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry at once. \"We wanted to see you.\""

Righ'.\"\nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he\nslammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock\ncakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid's cooking, and took one at once.\n\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a\nbrutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \"we really wanted to carry on\nwith Care of Magical Creatures, you know.\" Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some\nbogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.\n\"We did!\" said Hermione. \"But none of us could fit it into our schedules!\"\n\"Yeah. Righ',\" said Hagrid again.\nThere was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron\nleapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they\nhad only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.\n\"What are they, Hagrid?\" asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his\nrock cake all the same.\n\"Jus' giant grubs,\" said Hagrid.\n\"And they grow into ... ?\" said Ron, looking apprehensive.\n\"They won' grow inter nuthin',\" said Hagrid. \"I got 'em ter feed ter Aragog.\"\nAnd without warning, he burst into tears.\n\"Hagrid!\" cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of\nmaggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \"What is it?\"\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\n\"It's. . . him . ..\" gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. \"It's .\n. . Aragog. ... I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better.... I don' know what\nI'll do if he ... if he ... We've bin tergether so long. ...\"\nHermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she\nfelt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant\nscorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was\nperhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who\ndwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years\npreviously.\n\"Is there â is there anything we can do?\" Hermione asked, ignoring Ron's frantic grimaces and\nhead-shakings."

It means a lot. . ..\"\nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any\ninclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for\ngranted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.\n\"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\" he said gruffly, pouring them\nmore tea. \"Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners â\"\n\"We couldn't have done,\" said Hermione. \"We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we\nwere there last summer.

I'm sorry I've bin â yeh know â I've\njus' bin worried about Aragog ... an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh\nâ\"\nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had\nsubstituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved\nthem off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.\n\"I'm starving,\" said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark\nand deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his\nback teeth. \"And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner. ...\"\nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two\nattempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed\ngloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back.\n\"What?\" said Hermione defensively.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\n\"If you ask me,\" said Harry quietly, \"McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning.

It was as though Ron was not present;\nSlughorn did not so much as look at him.\n\"I can't come, Professor,\" said Harry at once. \"I've got a detention with Professor Snape.\"\n\"Oh dear!\" said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \"Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now,\nI'll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to persuade him to\npostpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later!\" He bustled away out of the Hall.\n\"He's got no chance of persuading Snape,\" said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. \"This\ndetentions already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won't do it for anyone else.\"\n\"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own!\" said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she\nwas thinking about McLaggen.\n\"I doubt you'll be alone, Ginny'll probably be invited,\" snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly\nto being ignored by Slughorn.\nAfter dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most\npeople had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been\nin a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling.\nHermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\n\"Anything new?\" said Harry.\n\"Not really. . .\" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \"Oh, look, your\ndad's in here, Ron â he's all right!\" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. \"It just says"

Harry's heart sank. \"He says you're to come to his office at\nhalf past eight tonight to do your detention â er â no matter how many party invitations you've received.\nAnd he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions\nChapter 11: Hermione's helping hand\nand â and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry grimly. \"Thanks a lot, Demelza.\"\nHotLog"

He rarely appeared at meals\nanymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a\ntime. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said\nthat the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted,\nand now he felt slightly abandoned.\nHalfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether\nthese trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was\npleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few\nhours.\nHarry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until\nbreakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed\nreading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione,\nwho was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Princes copy of Advanced\nPotion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized\nhow much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a\nglowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins,\nwhich Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.\nHarry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused\ntoenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results);\na jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an"

The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a\nrigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell\non anyone in the vicinity.\nSitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions\nfor a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and\nalterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\nLevicorpus (nvbl)\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at\nthe letters in brackets. Nvbl . . that had to mean \"nonverbal.\" Harry rather doubted he would be able to\nbring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had\nbeen quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more\neffective teacher than Snape so far.\nPointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.\n\"Aaaaaaaargh!\"\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\nThere was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a\nyell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as\nthough an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\n\"Sorry!\" yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the\nfloor, having fallen out of Bed. \"Hang on â I'll let you down â\"\nHe groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he\nlocated it and deciphered\nthe cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus!\nwith all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.\n\"Sorry,\" repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.\n\"Tomorrow,\" said Ron in a muffled voice, \"I'd rather you set the alarm clock.\"\nBy the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys hand-knitted\nsweaters and carrying, cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron's shock had subsided and he had decided that\nHarry's new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with\nthe story as they sat down for breakfast.\n\"... and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!\" Ron grinned, helping himself\nto sausages.\nHermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry\ndisapproval upon Harry.\n\"Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?\" she asked."

Now, however, a wonderful\npossibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be â ?\n\"Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,\" said Hermione, \"but he's not the only one. We've seen a whole bunch\nof people use it, in case you've forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep,\nhelpless.\"\nHarry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the\nQuidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.\n\"That was different,\" he said robustly. \"They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh.\nYou don't like the Prince, Hermione,\" he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, \"because he's better than\nyou at Potions â\"\n\"It's got nothing to do with that!\" said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. \"I just think it's very irresponsible\nto start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about 'the Prince' as\nif it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname, and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to\nme!\"\n\"I don't see where you get that from,\" said Harry heatedly. \"If he'd been a budding Death Eater he wouldn't\nhave been boasting about being 'half-blood,' would he?\"\nEven as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of\nhis mind; he would worry about that later. . . .\n\"The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left,\" said Hermione"

It's Dumbledore's next lesson!\" Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the\nparchment and quickly reading its contents. \"Monday evening!\" He felt suddenly light and happy. \"Want to\njoin us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?\" he asked.\n\"I'm going with Dean â might see you there,\" she replied, waving at them as she left.\nFilch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to\ngo into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with\nhis Secrecy Sensor.\n\"What does it matter if we're smuggling Dark stuff OUT?\" demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy\nSensor with apprehension. \"Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?\"\nHis cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the\nwind and sleet.\nThe walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part\nsoon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter\nwind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common\nroom, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko's Joke Shop had been boarded up,\nHarry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved\nhand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into\nthe crowded shop.\n\"Thank God,\" shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. \"Let's stay here all\nafternoon.\"\n\"Harry, m'boy!\" said a booming voice from behind them.\n\"Oh no,\" muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an\nenormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple,\nand occupying at least a quarter of the shop."

This strategy meant that Ron was not\nleft out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.\n\"Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the, hard work!\" said Slughorn. \"But a little\nrecreation never hurt any body.

The bitter wind was like knives on\ntheir faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; no-\nbody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little\nahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through\nhis rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's\nHead. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck\nand walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet\nfrom him when Harry realized who the man was.\n\"Mundungus!\"\nThe squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase,\nwhich burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window."

Harry's thoughts strayed\nto Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her,\nundoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop,\nthat haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.\nIt was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were\nbeing carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder.

The sleet-spattered\nwindows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate.\nProfessor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the\nstill sobbing Leanne.\n\"Well?\" she said sharply. \"What happened?\"\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\nHaltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor\nMcGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the\nunmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and\nhow they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument\nculminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there\nwas no getting another word out of her.\n\"All right,\" said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, \"go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get\nMadam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\"\nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\"What happened when Katie touched the necklace?\"\n\"She rose up in the air,\" said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, \"and then began to scream,\nand collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\"\n\"The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.\n\"Away?\" Harry repeated angrily.\n\"Yes, Potter, away!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"But anything you have to say about this horrible\nbusiness can be said to me, I'm sure!\"\nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though\nin many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a\nlife-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.\n\"I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\" ;\nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her\nfeet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.\n\"That is a very serious accusation, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \"Do you\nhave any proof?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry, \"but.. .\" and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the\nconversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.\nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.\n\"Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\"\n\"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But\nthat's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace\nâ\"\n\"You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\"\n\"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him â\"\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\n\"But Harry,\" Hermione interrupted, \"Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no\nâ\""

I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and\nBurkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street\nâ and in any case,\" she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \"I asked Borgin about the\nnecklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I\nsaw it there.

The same is probably true of\nhundreds of people â\"\n\"â that's what I said â\" muttered Ron.\n\"â and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that\nnecklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge â\"\n\"But â\"\n\"â and what is more,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \"Mr. Malfoy was not in\nHogsmeade today.\"\nHarry gaped at her, deflating.\n\"How do you know, Professor?\"\n\"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework\ntwice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\" she said as she marched past them,\n\"but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\"\nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.\nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall;\nnevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.\n\"So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs\nto the common room.\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\n\"Goodness only knows,\" said Hermione. \"But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have\nopened that package without touching the necklace.\"\n\"It could've been meant for loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore â the Death Eaters would love to\nget rid of him, he must be one of their top targets.

There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was\nas black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting\non the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.\n\"You have had a busy time while I have been away,\" Dumbledore said. \"I believe you witnessed Katie's\naccident.\"\n\"Yes, sir. How is she?\"\n\"Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the\nsmallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it\nin her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do\nenough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse â\"\n\"Why him?\" asked Harry quickly. \"Why not Madam Pomfrey?\"\n\"Impertinent,\" said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius's\ngreat-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. \"I would not\nhave permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.\"\n\"Yes, thank you, Phineas,\" said Dumbledore quellingly. \"Professor Snape knows much more about the\nDark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo's staff are sending me hourly reports, and I\nam hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.\"\n\"Where were you this weekend, sir?\" Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing\nhis luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.\n\"I would rather not say just now,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, I shall tell you in due course.\"\n\"You will?\" said Harry, startled.\n\"Yes, I expect so,\" said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes\nand uncorking it with a prod of his wand.\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\n\"Sir,\" said Harry tentatively, \"I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.\"\n\"Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered\ncontempt,\" said Dumbledore, frowning a little. \"He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the\nThree Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me.

However, rest assured that he will not be making\naway with any more of Sirius's old possessions.\"\n\"That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?\" said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he\nstalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\n\"Professor,\" said Harry, after a short pause, \"did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie\ngot hurt? About Draco Malfoy?\"\n\"She told me of your suspicions, yes,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"And do you â ?\"\n\"I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie's accident,\"\nsaid Dumbledore. \"But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.\"\nHarry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long\ngap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as\nDumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more\nbetween his long-fingered hands.\n\"You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort's beginnings at the point where the\nhandsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home\nin Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord\nVoldemort.\"\n\"How do you know she was in London, sir?\"\n\"Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,\" said Dumbledore, \"who, by an odd coincidence,\nhelped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.\"\nHe swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold\nprospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the\nPensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes.\n\"Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas,\noh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags\nand pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherin's. Well, we hear\nthat sort of story all the time, 'Oh, this was Merlin's, this was, his favorite teapot,' but when I looked at it, it\nhad his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near\nenough priceless. She didn't seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for\nit. Best bargain we ever made!\"\nDumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the\nswirling mass of memory from whence he had come.\n\"He only gave her ten Galleons?\" said Harry indignantly.\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\n\"Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,\" said Dumbledore. \"So we know that, near the end of\nher pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her"

But it is my beliefâI am guessing again, but I am sure I am\nright â that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted\nto be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair\nsapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her\nwand even to save her own life.\"\n\"She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?\"\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. \"Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother â\"\n\"Your mother had a choice too,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a\nson who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering\nand she never had your mother's courage. And now, if you will stand ...\"\n\"Where are we going?\" Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.\n\"This time,\" said Dumbledore, \"we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail\nand satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry ...\"\nHarry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling\nthrough darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he\nand Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street.\n\"There I am,\" said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of\na horse-drawn milk cart.\nThis younger Albus Dumbledore's long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street,\nhe strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum\nvelvet that he was wearing.\n\"Nice suit, sir,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they\nfollowed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard\nthat fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading\nto the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing\nan apron.\n\"Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?\"\n\"Oh,\" said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. \"Um. . . just a mo' . . .\nMRS.

The girl turned back to Dumbledore. \"Come\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nin, she's on 'er way.\"\nDumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly\nclean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny,\nharassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more\nanxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward\nDumbledore.\n\". . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's\noozing all over his sheets â chicken pox on top of everything else,\" she said to nobody in particular, and\nthen her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe\nhad just crossed her threshold.\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped.\n\"My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited\nme here today.\"\nMrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \"Oh yes.\nWell â well then â you'd better come into my room. Yes.\"\nShe led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the\nhallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and\nseated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.\n\"I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,\" said\nDumbledore.\n\"Are you family?\" asked Mrs. Cole.\n\"No, I am a teacher,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have come to offer Tom a place at my school.\"\n\"What school's this, then?\"\n\"It is called Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"And how come you're interested in Tom?\"\n\"We believe he has qualities we are looking for.\"\n\"You mean he's won a scholarship? How can he have done? He's never been entered for one.\"\n\"Well, his name has been down for our school since birth â\"\n\"Who registered him? His parents?\"\nThere was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought\nso too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking\nup a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole's desktop.\n\"Here,\" said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, \"I think this will make\neverything clear.\"\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nMrs. Cole's eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.\n\"That seems perfectly in order,\" she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin\nand two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.\n\"Er â may I offer you a glass of gin?\" she said in an extra-refined voice.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Dumbledore, beaming."

Pouring both of them a\ngenerous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at\nDumbledore for the first time, and he didn't hesitate to press his advantage.\n\"I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle's history? I think he was born here in\nthe orphanage?\"\n\"That's right,\" said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. \"I remember it clear as anything, because I'd just\nstarted here myself. New Year's Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not\nmuch older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn't the first. We\ntook her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.\"\nMrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.\n\"Did she say anything before she died?\" asked Dumbledore. \"Anything about the boy's father, for\ninstance?\"\n\"Now, as it happens, she did,\" said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin\nin her hand and an eager audience for her story. \"I remember she said to me, 'I hope he looks like his papa,'\nand I won't lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty â and then she told me he was to be\nnamed Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father â yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered\nwhether she came from a circus â and she said the boy's surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon\nafter that without another word.\n\"Well, we named him just as she'd said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo\nnor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and\nhe's been here ever since.\"\nMrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had\nappeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, \"He's a funny boy.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I thought he might be.\"\n\"He was a funny baby too.

Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside\nRiddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.\n\"I am Professor Dumbledore.\"\n\"'Professor'?\" repeated Riddle. He looked wary. \"Is that like 'doctor'? What are you here for? Did she get\nyou in to have a look at me?\"\nHe was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.\n\"No, no,\" said Dumbledore, smiling.\n\"I don't believe you,\" said Riddle. \"She wants me looked at, doesn't she? Tell the truth!\"\nHe spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it\nsounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at\nDumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle\nstopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come\nto offer you a place at my school â your new school, if you would like to come.\"\nRiddle's reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore,\nlooking furious.\n\"You can't kid me! The asylum, that's where you're from, isn't it? 'Professor,' yes, of course â well, I'm not\ngoing, see? That old cat's the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson\nor Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they'll tell you!\n\"I am not from the asylum,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I\nshall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you\nâ\"\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\n\"I'd like to see them try,\" sneered Riddle.\n\"Hogwarts,\" Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle's last words, \"is a school for people\nwith special abilities â\"\n\"I'm not mad!\"\n\"I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.\"\nThere was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth\nbetween each of Dumbledore's, as though trying to catch one of them lying.\n\"Magic?\" he repeated in a whisper.\n\"That's right,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"It's. . . it's magic, what I can do?\"\n\"What is it that you can do?\"\n\"All sorts,\" breathed Riddle.

A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he\nlooked fevered. \"I can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them\nto do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt\nif I want to.\"\nHis legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head\nbowed as though in prayer.\n\"I knew I was different,\" he whispered to his own quivering fingers. \"I knew I was special. Always, I knew\nthere was something.\"\n\"Well, you were quite right,\" said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently.\n\"You are a wizard.\"\nRiddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it\ndid not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his\nexpression almost bestial.\n\"Are you a wizard too?\"\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\"Prove it,\" said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, \"Tell the\ntruth.\"\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. \"If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwartsâ\"\n\"Of course I am!\"\n\"Then you will address me as 'Professor' or 'sir.'\"\nRiddle's expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nvoice, \"I'm sorry, sir. I meant â please, Professor, could you show me â ?\"\nHarry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of\ntime for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and\nmust therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside\npocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.\nThe wardrobe burst into flames.\nRiddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly\npossessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the\nwardrobe completely undamaged.\nRiddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand.\n\"Where can I get one of them?\"\n\"All in good time,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.\"\nAnd sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.\n\"Open the door,\" said Dumbledore.\nRiddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a\nrail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several\nfrantic mice trapped inside it.\n\"Take it out,\" said Dumbledore.\nRiddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.\n\"Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?\" asked Dumbledore."

Harry, who had\nexpected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble,\nand a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still\nupon the thin blankets.\n\"You will return them to their owners with your apologies,\" said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand\nback into his jacket. \"I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at\nHogwarts.\"\nRiddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last\nhe said in a colorless voice, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"At Hogwarts,\" Dumbledore went on, \"we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have â\ninadvertently, I am sure â been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our\nschool. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nshould know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic â yes, there is a Ministry â\nwill punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they\nabide by our laws.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle again.\nIt was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of\nstolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said\nbaldly, \"I haven't got any money.\"\n\"That is easily remedied,\" said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. \"There is a\nfund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of\nyour spellbooks and so on secondhand, but â\"\n\"Where do you buy spellbooks?\" interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking\nDumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon,\n\"In Diagon Alley,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have your list of books and school equipment with me.

Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though\nit burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, \"Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too,\nthey've told me.\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't know,\" said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.\n\"My mother can't have been magic, or she wouldn't have died,\" said Riddle, more to himself than\nDumbledore. \"It must've been him. So â when I've got all my stuffâ when do I come to this Hogwarts?\"\n\"All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,\" said Dumbledore. \"You will leave\nfrom King's Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.\"\nRiddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, \"I can speak\nto snakes. I found out when we've been to the country on trips â they find me, they whisper to me. Is that\nnormal for a wizard?\"\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nHarry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to\nimpress.\n\"It is unusual,\" said Dumbledore, after a moment's hesitation, \"but not unheard of.\"\nHis tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle's face. They stood for a moment, man and\nboy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.\n\"Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.\"\n\"I think that will do,\" said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry's side, and seconds later, they were\nsoaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.\n\"Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.\nHarry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.\n\"He believed it much quicker than I did â I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,\" said Harry. \"I\ndidn't believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.\"\n\"Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was â to use his word â 'special,'\" said Dumbledore.\n\"Did you know â then?\" asked Harry.\n\"Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?\" said Dumbledore. \"No, I had\nno idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to\nHogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was\nalone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others' sake as much as his.\n\"His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and â most"

The\nlittle stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . .\n. 'I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .'\"\n\"And he was a Parselmouth,\" interjected Harry.\n\"Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there\nare Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me\nnearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.\n\"Time is making fools of us again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. \"But\nbefore we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for\nthey have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.\n\"Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle's reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, 'Tom'?\"\nHarry nodded.\n\"There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\nordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within\na few short years of that conversation and created the mask of Lord Voldemort' behind which he has been\nhidden for so long.\n\"I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently,\nfriendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate\nalone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in\nhis confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort\nhas never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.\n\"And lastly â I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry â the young Tom Riddle liked\nto collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from\nvictims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in\nmind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.\n\"And now, it really is time for bed.\"\nHarry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Marvolo\nGaunt's ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there.\n\"Yes, Harry?\" said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt. I\n\"The ring's gone,\" said Harry, looking around. \"But I thought I you might have the mouth organ or\nsomething.\"\nDumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his hall' moon spectacles."

At once, the prickly vines shot back inside,\nand the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.\nChapter 14: Felix felicis\n\"You know, I don't think I'll be having any of these in my garden when I've got my own place,\" said Ron,\npushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.\n\"Pass me a bowl,\" said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm's length; Harry handed one over and\nshe dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.\n\"Don't be squeamish, squeeze it out, they're best when they're fresh!\" called Professor Sprout.\n\"Anyway,\" said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just\nattacked them, \"Slughorn's going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there's no way you'll be able to\nwriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to\nhave it on a night you can come.\"\nHarry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on\nit, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, \"And this is another party just for\nSlughorn's favorites, is it?\"\n\"Just for the Slug Club, yes,\" said Hermione.\nThe pod flew out from under Ron's fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of\nProfessor Sprout's head and knocking off her old, patched hat.

Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what\nhappened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn's dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the\nmeantime, however, he had more pressing worries.\nKatie Bell was still in St. Mungo's Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising\nGryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept\nputting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was\nlooming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.\nHarry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do\nwith Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left,\nalthough several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione's creation;\nnobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.\n\"Are you still interested in playing Chaser?\"\n\"Wha â ? Yeah, of course!\" said Dean excitedly. Over Deanâs shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan\nslamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to\nhave to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what\nwas best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.\n\"Well then, you're in,\" said Harry. \"There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock.\"\n\"Right,\" said Dean. \"Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!\"\nHe sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no\neasier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus's head as one of Hermione's canaries whizzed over them.\nSeamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katieâs substitute. There was much muttering\nin the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As\nHarry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered,\nbut all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If\nGryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that\nChapter 14: Felix felicis\nthey had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured\nworse mutterings. . . .\nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny\nand Demelza.

After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his\ntechnique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.\n\"It was an accident, I'm sorry, Demelza, really sorry!\" Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the\nground, dripping blood everywhere. \"I just â\"\n\"Panicked,\" Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. \"You prat, Ron, look at\nthe state of her!\"\n\"I can fix that,\" said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth, and saying\n\"Episkey.\" \"And Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team â\"\n\"Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should â\"\nHarry forced himself not to laugh.\n\"In the air, everyone, let's go. . . .\"\nOverall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was\nthe best policy when they were this close to the match.\n\"Good work, everyone, I think we'll flatten Slytherin,\" he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left\nthe changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.\n\"I played like a sack of dragon dung,\" said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind\nGinny.\n\"No, you didn't,\" said Harry firmly. \"You're the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.\"\nHe kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached\nthe second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take\ntheir usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny,\nwho were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.\nIt was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry's stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot\nblood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx\nDean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron's voice as though from a great\ndistance away.\nâOi!â\nDean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. \"What?\" said Ginny.\n\"I don't want to find my own sister snogging people in public!\" \"This was a deserted corridor till you came\nChapter 14: Felix felicis\nbutting in!\" said Ginny.\nDean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn\nmonster inside him was roaring for Dean's instant dismissal from the team.\n\"Er . . . c'mon, Ginny,\" said Dean, \"let's go back to the common room. ...\"\n\"You go!\" said Ginny. \"I want a word with my dear brother!\" Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry\nto depart the scene."

If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you\nwouldn't mind so much that everyone else does it!\"\nRon had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.\n\"You don't know what you're talking about!\" Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry,\nwho was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. \"Just because I don't do it in public â !\"\nGinny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.\n\"Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your\npillow?\" You â\nA streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up\nagainst the wall.\n\"Don't be stupid â\"\n\"Harry's snogged Cho Chang!\" shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. \"And Hermione snogged\nViktor Krum, it's only you who acts like it's something disgusting, Ron, and that's because you've got about\nas much experience as a twelve-year-old!\"\nAnd with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They\nboth stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich's cat, appeared around the corner, which broke\nthe tension.\n\"C'mon,\" said Harry, as the sound of Filch's shuffling feet reached their ears.\nThey hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. \"Oi, out of the way!\" Ron barked at a small\ngirl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.\nChapter 14: Felix felicis\nHarry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning\nbolt must be something like this.

Harry gave\na guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he\nand Ginny were quite alone â \"What?\" he said confusedly. \"Oh ... er ...\" The honest answer was \"yes,\" but\nhe did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry's face.\n\"Dilligrout,\" he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common\nroom.\nNeither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening\nand got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts,\nHarry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself\nthat his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and\nsister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had\nknown Ginny for years now. ... It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want\nto look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No ... he would have to control\nthat particular brotherly feeling. . . .\nRon gave a great grunting snore.\nShe's Ron's sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron's sister. She's out-of-bounds. He would not risk his\nfriendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for\nsleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.\nHarry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had\nchased him with a Beaterâs bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the\nreal one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered\nHermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as\ntouchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the\npeace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon,\nand Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for\nlooking at him.\nTo Harryâs dismay, Ron's new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided\nwith an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the\nfinal Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at\nhim, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears."

Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well\ntoday, Ron . . .\" he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, \"you're my best\nmate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I'm going to kick you off the team.\"\nHe really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron\nseemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, \"I resign. I'm pathetic.\"\n\"You're not pathetic and you're not resigning!\" said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes.\n\"You can save anything when you're on form, it's a mental problem you've got!\" \"You calling me mental?\"\n\"Yeah, maybe I am!\"\nThey glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. \"I know you haven't got any time\nto find another Keeper, so I'll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I'm taking myself off the team.\"\nNothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron's confidence all through dinner, but Ron\nwas too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that\nevening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined\nby the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron\nand casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a\ndefiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than\nencouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.\nHarry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only\nwas it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not\nyet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances\nof winning were very slim. . . .\nIf only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of\nhis form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .\nAnd the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.\nBreakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every\nmember of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall.

Pumpkin juice?\" \"Anything,\" said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of\ntoast.\nA few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron's recent unpleasant behavior that she had\nnot come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.\n\"How are you both feeling?\" she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron's head.\n\"Fine,\" said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. \"There you go, Ron.\nDrink up.\"\nChapter 14: Felix felicis\nRon had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke\nsharply.\n\"Don't drink that, Ron!\"\nBoth Harry and Ron looked up at her.\n\"Why not?\" said Ron.\nHermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.\n\"You just put something in that drink.\"\n\"Excuse me?\" said Harry.\n\"You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron's drink. You've got the bottle in your hand\nright now!\"\n\"I dont know what you're talking about,\" said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.\n\"Ron, I warn you, don't drink it!\" Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in\none gulp, and said, \"Stop bossing me around, Hermione.\"\nShe looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, \"You should be\nexpelled for that. I'd never have believed it of you, Harry!\"\n\"Look who's talking,\" he whispered back. \"Confunded anyone lately?\"\nShe stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really\nunderstood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his\nlips.\n\"Nearly time/' said Harry blithely.\nThe frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.\n\"Pretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?\" Harry asked Ron.\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.\nGinny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.\n\"Conditions look ideal,\" said Ginny, ignoring Ron. \"And guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey â he\ntook a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he's too sore to play! And even better than\nthat â Malfoy's gone off sick too!\"\n\"What?\" said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. \"He's ill? What's wrong with him?\"\n\"No idea, but it's great for us,\" said Ginny brightly. \"They're playing Harper instead; he's in my year and\nhe's an idiot.\"\nChapter 14: Felix felicis"

Malfoy\nhad once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole\nmatch was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a\nsubstitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?\n\"Fishy, isn't it?\" he said in an undertone to Ron. \"Malfoy not playing?\"\n\"Lucky, I call it,\" said Ron, looking slightly more animated. \"And Vaisey off too, he's their best goal scorer,\nI didn't fancy â hey!\" he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and\nstaring at Harry.\n\"What?\"\n\"I... you . . .\" Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. \"My drink ... my pumpkin\njuice ... you didn't...?\"\nHarry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, \"We'll be starting in about five minutes, you'd better get\nyour boots on.\"\nThey walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and\ngold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst\nall the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood's famous lion-topped\nhat.\nHarry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was stand-ing ready to release the balls from the crate.\n\"Captains shake hands,\" she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart.\n\"Mount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .\"\nThe whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.\nHarry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on\nHarper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual\ncommentator's started up.\n\"Well, there they go, and I think we're all surprised to see the team that Potter's put together this year. Many\nthought, given Ronald Weasley's patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but\nof course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . .\"\nThese words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around\non his broom to look toward the commentator's podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose\nwas standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan's; Harry recognized\nZacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\n\"Oh, and here comes Slytherin's first attempt on goal, it's Urquhart streaking down the pitch and â\"\nHarrys stomach turned over.\n\"â Weasley saves it, well, he's bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . .\""

This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there\nbecause Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.\n\"Of course, Coote isn't really the usual build for a Beater,\" said Zacharias loftily, \"they've generally got a\nbit more muscle â\"\n\"Hit a Bludger at him!\" Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim\nthe next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased\nto hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.\nIt seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at\nthe other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the\ncrowd greeted a particularly good save with a\nrousing chorus of the old favorite \"Weasley Is Our King,\" he pretended to conduct them from on high.\n\"Thinks he's something special today, doesn't he?\" said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his\nbroom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. \"Your blood-traitor pal...\" Madam Hooch's back\nwas turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had\nalready sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. ...\n\"And I think Harper of Slytherin's seen the Snitch!\" said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. \"Yes,\nhe's certainly seen something Potter hasn't!\"\nSmith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn't he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach\nseemed to drop out of the , sky â Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at\nrandom; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting\nbrightly against the clear blue sky.\nHarry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith's commentary or\nthe crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got\nthere first Gryffindor had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. ...\n\"Oi, Harper!\" yelled Harry in desperation. \"How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?\"\nHe did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip\nthrough his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught\nit."

Avoiding her\ngaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the\npitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters.\nThe atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. \"Party up in the common room, Seamus said!\" yelled\nDean exuberantly. \"C'mon, Ginny, Demelza!\"\nRon and Harry were the last two in the changing room.

He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out\nthe tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork\nwas still tightly sealed with wax. \"I wanted Ron to think I'd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were\nlooking.\" He looked at Ron. \"You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.\"\nHe pocketed the potion again.\n\"There really wasn't anything in my pumpkin juice?\" Ron said, astounded. \"But the weather's good. . . and\nVaisey couldn't play. ...

What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match\nanalysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and\nbatting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from\nRomilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with him.\nAs he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding\non her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\n\"Looking for Ron?\" she asked, smirking. \"He's over there, the filthy hypocrite.\"\nHarry looked into the corner she was indicating.

The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head\nso that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.\n\"You shouldn't leave Lavender waiting outside,\" she said quietly. \"She'll wonder where you've gone.\"\nShe walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that\nnothing worse had happened.\n\"Oppugno!\" came a shriek from the doorway.\nHarry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds\nwas speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands,\nbut the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\n\"Gerremoffme!\" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and\ndisappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.\nHotLog HotLog\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow"

Hagrid had\nalready singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and\ntinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the\nhelmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors.\nLarge groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past,\nwhich caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had\ngiven him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without\ntoo much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes.\nRon, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity,\nsimply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to\nthe moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a\nheavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to\nregard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself\nonce more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.\nRon, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a\ndefensive and resentful tone.\n\"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me\ntoo. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\"\nHarry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before\nCharms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron\nand Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.\n\"I never promised Hermione anything , \" Ron mumbled. \"I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn's\nChristmas party with her, but she never said... just as friends... I'm a free agent...\"\nHarry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron's voice trailed away in\nmutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words\n\"Krum\" and \"Can't complain\" again.\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\nHermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was,"

Hermione\nrefused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which\nmeant that their conversations were held in whispers.\n\"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\" said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince,\nprowled the shelves behind them. \"I really couldn't care less.\"\nShe raised her quill and dotted an 'i' so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said\nnothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced\nPotion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p\nrince's useful additions to Libatius B orage's text.\n\"And incidentally,\" said Hermione, after a few moments, \"you need to be careful.\"\n\"For the last time,\" said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after three-quarters of an ho u r of silence,\n\"I am not giving back this book . I've learned more from the Half-blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn\nhave taught me in--\"\n\"I'm not talking about your stupid so-called prince,\" said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though\nit had been rude to her. \"I'm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girl's bathroom just before I came in here\nand there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you\na love potion. They're all hoping they're going to get you to take them to Slughorn's party, and thay all seem\nto have bought Fred and George's love potions, which I'm afraid to say probably work --\"\n\"Why didn't you confiscate them then?\" demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermione's m ania\nfor upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.\n\"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom,\" said Hermione scornfully, \"They were just\ndiscussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince\" she gave the book another scornful look \"could dream\nup an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop\nall the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomor r ow night, they're getting desperate.\"\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\n\"There isn't anyone I want to invite,\" mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any\nmore than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made\nhim devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\n\"Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.\" said\nHermione grimly.\nShe hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued\nto scratch away with her quill.

So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into\nthe school?\"\n\"Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\" said Hermione. \"It's part of their\nOwl order service.\"\n\"You know a lot about it.\"\nHermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.\n\"It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\" she said coldly, \"I don't go\naround putting potions in people's drinks... or pretending too eit h er, which is just as bad...\"\n\"Yeah, well, never mind that,\" said Harry quickly. \"The point is, Filch is being fooled isn't he?

They'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one\nin the necklace, withi n seconds. But something that's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register --\nanyway Love potions aren't d ark or dangerous ---\"\n\"Easy for you to say,\" muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.\n\"-- so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasn't a cough potion, and he's not a very good wizard, I doubt\nhe can tell one potion from --\"\nHermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark\nbookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared\naround the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated\nunflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.\n\"The library is now closed,\" she said, \"Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what\nhave you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\"\n\"It isn't the library's, it's mine!\" said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the\ntable as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.\n\" Spoiled!\" she hissed . \"Desecrated, befouled !\"\n\"It's just a book that's been written on!\" said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.\nShe looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed\nHarry by the arm and frogmarched him away.\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow"

She raced out of the\nclassroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's\njust now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her.\nHe finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was\naccompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.\n\"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\"\n\"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff...\"\nHe held out her books.\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\nwas wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going...\"\nAnd she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he\ncould not think of any.\n\"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be\nHermione. She said something about Ron Weasley...\"\n\"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry.\n\"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he?\" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he\ncan be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\"\n\" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had\nnever met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term?\"\n\"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D.A.

And you chose Loony\nLovegood?\"\n\"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad\nyou're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\"\nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was\ntaking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting\nalone, playing with her stew.

Oh, hi, Hermione!\"\nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in\nTransfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more\nbrightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.\n\"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party\ntonight?\"\n\"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good...\nYou're going, aren't you?\"\n\"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\"\nThere was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced.

At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with\neverything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron\nlooked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls\nwould sink to get revenge.\nWhen he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls\nlurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing\na set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but\notherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her\nbutterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.\n\"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party?\"\n\"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering.\n\"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming?\"\n\"Rufus Scrimgeour?\" asked Luna.\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\n\"I - what?\" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic?\"\n\"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when\nScrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the\nMinistry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out!\"\nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna\nrepeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching\nSlughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every\nstep they took.\nWhether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office\nwas much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald,\ncrimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent.

He\nlooked rather bored.

Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\"\nTrapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black\neyes narrowed. \"Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\"\n\"Well, then, it's natural ability!\" shouted Slughorn. \"You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson,\nDraught of Living Death â never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don't think even you,\nSeverus â\"\n\"Really?\" said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet.

Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just\nfor this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated\nto raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.\n\"Professor Slughorn,\" wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his\nbulging eyes, \"I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.

But almost before Harry had registered what he had\nseen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a\nsmile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape's face was smoothly inscrutable again.\n\"It's nothing, nothing,\" said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy's t hanks. \"I did know your grandfather, after\nall....\"\n\"He always spoke very highly of you, sir,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Said you were the best potion-maker he'd\never known. ...\"\nHarry stared at Malfoy.

This was the first time he\nhad seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a\ndistinctly grayish tinge to his skin.\n\"I'd like a word with you, Draco,\" said Snape suddenly.\n\"Now , Severus,\" said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \"it's Christ mas, do n't be too hard â\"\n\"I am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,\" said Snape curtly. \"Follow me,\nDraco.\""

It was easy,\nonce out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the\ncorridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the\ncorridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\nhim. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him\nback to the Slyt herin common room. . . .

You have feared my interference? You realize that,\nhad anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco â\"\n\"So put me in detention!

That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry;\nsending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\" -:\n\"What do you mean?\" '\nChapter 16: A very frosty Christmas\n\"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\" said Lupin. \"Werewolves,\" he added, at Harrys look of\nincomprehension. \"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . .\n. ready-made.\"\nHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \"I am not\ncomplaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining\ntheir trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have\nshunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing â and sometimes killing â to eat.\"\n\"How come they like Voldemort?\"\n\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\" said Lupin. \"And it is hard to argue with\nGreyback out there. . . .\"\n\"Who's Greyback?\"\n\"You haven't heard of him?\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the\nmost savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many\npeople as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has\npromised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he\nsays, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened\nto unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\"\nLupin paused and then said, \"It was Greyback who bit me.\" \"What?\" said Harry, astonished. \"When â\nwhen you were a kid, you mean?\"\n\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who\nhad attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt\nto transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims,\nensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal\nthe werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway\nagainst Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on\nnormal people.\" \"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You've just got a â a\nproblem â\"\nLupin burst out laughing. \"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in\ncompany. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\nrabbit.\"\nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful,"

I\nshould have thought being 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\"\n\"It's nothing to do with me!\" said Harry indignantly. \"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to\nHogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was\nLevicorpus â\"\n\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin reminiscently. \"There were a few\nmonths in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\"\n\"My dad used it,\" said Harry. \"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\"\nHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not\nsure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells\ncome and go. , . .\"\n\"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\" Harry persisted.\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Lupin. \"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\"\nHe looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he\nnever asked us to call him 'Prince.'\"\nAbandoning pretense, Harry said, \"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\"\n\"Definitely not.\"\n\"Oh.\" Harry stared into the fire. \"I just thought â well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the\nPrince has.\"\n\"How old is this book, Harry?\"\n\"I dunno, I've never checked.\"\n\"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin.\nShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" which\nwas taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed.\nHarry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\nRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced\nPotion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the\nfront of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old.

He put on his glasses and\nlooked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was\nsitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.\n\"What's chat?\" asked Harry. '\n\"Its from Lavender,\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \"She earn\nhonestly think I'd wear ...\"\nHarry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\ngling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\nâMy sweetheartâ\n\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\"\n\"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I â I â Iâll â\"\n\"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I?\"\n\"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather\nshocked.\n\"Well, think back,\" said Harry. \"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words\n'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\"\n\"Well... we don't really talk much,\" said Ron. \"It's mainly . . .\"\n\"Snogging,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, yeah,\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\"\n\"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\"\nRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\nHarrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs.\nWeasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp,\nmoldy-smelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher,\nHarry stared at it. \"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked. \"Can't be anything dangerous, all our\nmail's still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\n\"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything.

Aren't they beautiful?\" .: \"Well, we find we appreciate you more and\nmore, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\" said George, waving an airy hand. \"Parsnips, Remus?\"\n\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out;\nHarry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\n\"'Ow 'orrible,\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\n\"Yes, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"Gravy, Fleur?\"\n. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared\nup in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\n\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \"She is\nalways knocking â\"\n\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary\nforce and glaring at Fleur. \"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\"\n\"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\" said Lupin. \"But Tonks has got her own family to\ngo to, hasn't she?\"\n\"Hmmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone,\nactually.\"\nShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law\ninstead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own\nfork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question\nhe had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\n\"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\" he told him. \"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could\nhappen. Why would your Patronus change?\"\nLupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \"Sometimes ... a great shock\n... an emotional upheaval ...\"\n\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\" said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. \"Hey ...\nit couldn't be â ?\"\n\"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart\nChapter 16: A very frosty Christmas\nand she was staring out of the kitchen window. \"Arthur â it's Percy!\"\n\"What?\"\nMr. Weasley looked around.

Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look.\nThere, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting\nin the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\n\"Arthur, he's â he's with the Minister!\"\nAnd sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake,\nlimping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them\ncould say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back\ndoor opened and there stood Percy.\nThere was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \"Merry Christmas, Mother.\"\n\"Oh, Percy!\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\nRufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this\naffecting scene.\n\"You must forgive this intrusion,\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping\nher eyes. \"Percy and I were in the vicinity â working, you know â and he couldn't resist dropping in and\nseeing you all.\"\nBut Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and\nawkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all\nobserving him, stony-faced.\n\"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or\nsome tooding. ... 1 '. mean â\"\n\"No, no, my dear Molly,\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before\nthey entered the house. \"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all\nso badly. . . .\"\n\"Oh, Perce!\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\n\". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with\nPercy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming\ngarden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\"\nThe atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry.\nNobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it\nnatural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and\nGeorge also had clean plates.\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry into the silence.\nHe was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up\nhis family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\nChapter 16: A very frosty Christmas"

Carry on,\neveryone!\"\nHarry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping\nslightly at his side.

He looked at the little gnome prints all around\nthe flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now\nwearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.\n\"Yeah, we've discussed it.\"\n\"Have you, have you . . .\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour\nsquinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from\nunderneath a frozen rhododendron. \"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\"\n\"Sorry, but that's between us,\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone,\ntoo, was light and friendly as he said, \"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you\nChapter 16: A very frosty Christmas"

It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out\nof the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome,\n\"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\"\n\"I don't exactly understand what you want,\" said Harry slowly. '\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What\ndoes that mean?\"\n\"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"If you were to be seen popping in and\nout of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression.

Let's sit down â\"\nBut at that moment there was a loud squeal of \"Won-Won!\" and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of\nnowhere and flung herself into Ron's arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh\nand said, \"There's a cable over here... Coming. Ginny?\"\n\"No, thanks, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound\nvery enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling, match, Harry led\nHermione over to the spare table.\n\"So how was your Christmas?\"\n\"Oh, fine,\" she shrugged. \"Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won's?\"\n\"I'll tell you in a minute,\" said Harry. \"Look, Hermione, can't you â\"\n\"No, I can't,\" she said flatly. \"So don't even ask.\"\n\"I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas â\"\n\"It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this\nimportant news you wanted to tell me?\"\nShe looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all\nthat he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a\nmoment and then said, \"Don't you think â ?\"\n\"â he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing?\"\n\"Well, yes,\" said Hermione.\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\n\"Ronâs dad and Lupin think so,\" Harry said grudgingly. \"But this definitely proves Malfoyâs planning\nsomething, you can't deny that.\"\n\"No, I can't,\" she answered slowly.\n\"And he's acting on Voldemort's orders, just like I said!\"\n\"Hmm .. . did either of them actually mention Voldemort's name?\"\nHarry frowned, trying to remember. \"I'm not sure ... Snape definitely said 'your master,' and who else would\nthat be?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"Maybe his father?\"\nShe stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. \"How's\nLupin?\"\n\"Not great,\" said Harry, and he told her all about Lupinâs mission among the werewolves and the\ndifficulties he was facing. \"Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?\"\n\"Yes, I have!\" said Hermione, sounding startled. \"And so have you, Harry!\"\n\"When, History of Magic?

Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up\nbehind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, \"Guess who, Won-Won?\" Harry turned to see\nHermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to\nhis surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his\nexpression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.\n\"So â Apparition,\" said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had\njust happened. \"Should be a laugh, eh?\"\n\"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"Maybe it's better when you do it yourself, I didnât enjoy it much when Dumbledore\ntook me along for the ride.\"\n\"I forgot you'd already done it. ...

He'll never have another peaceful\nmoment. . . .\"\nLost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of\nproducing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today's Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet\nthat ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.\n\"Harryâs already Apparated,\" Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried\nhimself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: \"I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a\nstick.\" \"Dum â er â someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know.\"\n\"Whoa!\" whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what\nApparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to\ndescribe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how\nuncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he\nwas forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\nwith Dumbledore.\nThe lamps in Dumbledoreâs office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in\ntheir frames, and the Pen-sieve was ready upon the desk once more.

It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry\nwondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask;\nDumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted\nto discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.\n\"I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He's not very happy with\nme.\"\n\"No,\" sighed Dumbledore. \"He is not very happy with me either.

Within hours of\nScrimgeour's appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you â\"\n\"So that's why you argued!\" Harry blurted out. \"It was in the Daily Prophet\"'\n\"The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,\" said Dumbledore, \"if only accidentally. Yes, that\nwas why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.\"\n\"He accused me of being 'Dumbledore's man through and through.'\"\n\"How very rude of him.\"\n\"I told him I was.\"\nDumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out\na low, soft, musical cry. To Harryâs intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized\nthat Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, ami stared hastily at his own knees. When\nDumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.\n\"I am very touched, Harry.\"\n\"Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you're not at Hogwarts,\" said Harry, still looking fixedly\nat his knees.\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\n\"Yes, he is very nosy about that,\" said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to\nlook up again. \"He has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It\nwasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.\"\n\"So they still don't know where you go?\" asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing\nsubject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.\n\"No, they don't, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless\nthere's anything else â ?\" \"There is, actually, sir,\" said Harry. \"It's about Malfoy and Snape.\"\n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\"\n\"Yes, sir.

When Harry had finished he did not speak for\na few moments, then said, \"Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your\nmind. I do not think that it is of great importance.\"\n\"Not of great importance?\" repeated Harry incredulously. \"Professor, did you understand â ?\"\n\"Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,\" said\nDumbledore, a little sharply. \"I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than\nyou did.

What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore\nhad indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard\neverything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but\npretending not to be?\n\"So, sir,\" said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, \"you definitely still trust â ?\"\n\"I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,\" said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very\ntolerant anymore. \"My answer has not changed.\"\n\"I should think not,\" said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep.\nDumbledore ignored him.\n\"And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this\nevening.\"\nHarry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he\ninsisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry's mind, Dumbledore shook his\nhead.\n\"Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has\nto say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!\"\n\"I don't think what you've got to say is unimportant, sir,\" said Harry stiffly.\n\"Well, you are quite right, because it is not,\" said Dumbledore briskly. \"I have two more memories to show\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\nyou this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most\nimportant I have collected.\"\nHarry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but\ncould not see what was to be gained by arguing further.\n\"So,\" said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, \"we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle,\nwhom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited\nhe was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in\nturn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.\n\"Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand\nrobes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the\nmoment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,\" continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward\nthe shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. \"How soon Riddle learned that\nthe famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know â perhaps that very evening. The\nknowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance.\n\"However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their\ncommon room, no hint of it reached the staff.

He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all.\nAs an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the\nstaff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed police, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all\nwere most favorably impressed by him.\"\n\"Didn't you tell them, sir, what he'd been like when you met him at the orphanage?\" asked Harry.\n\"No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had\nbehaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.\"\nDumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was\nDumbledore's tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But\nthen Harry remembered something. . . .\n\"But you didn't really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said,\n'Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.'\"\n\"Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,\" said Dumbledore. \"I had, as I have\nalready indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a\ngreat deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill\nof discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much\nagain, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided\nin me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.\n\"As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want\nof a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them.\nThis group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the\nweak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a\nleader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of\nthe Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.\n\"Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\nHogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the\nmost serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of\na girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.\n\"I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore, placing his\nwithered hand on the Pensieve. \"Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too\nterrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing\nthose few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and\nwizard witnesses alike."

This is\nunderstandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to\nbe there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy\nroom, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he\nwas forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he\ndropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Volde-mort, and began his investigations into his\npreviously despised mother's family â the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be\na witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.\n\"All he had to go upon was the single name 'Marvolo,' which he knew from those who ran the orphanage\nhad been his mother's father's name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding\nfamilies, he discovered the existence of Slytherin's surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he\nleft the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if\nyou will stand ...\" :\nDumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling,\npearly memory.\n\"I was very lucky to collect this,\" he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. \"As you will\nunderstand when we have experienced it. Shall we?\"\nHarry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the\nmemory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone\nfloor in almost total darkness.\nIt took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The\nGaunts' house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick\nwith cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of\ncrusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and\nbeard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire,\nand Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But\nthen there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a\nshort knife in his left.\nThe door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry\nrecognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome â the teenage Voldemort.\nVoldemort's eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few\nseconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet\nclattering and tinkling across the floor.\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\n\"YOU!\" he bellowed. \"YOU!\""

They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley\nfrom the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the\nmurdered people.\n\"So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or\nLegilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was\nproud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over\nhis wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be\nled off to Azkaban without a fight.\nAll that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared. 'He'll kill me for losing it,' he told\nhis captors over and over again. 'He'll kill me for losing his ring.' And that, apparently, was all he ever said\nagain. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo's last heirloom, and\nis buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.\"\n\"So Voldemort stole Morfin's wand and used it?\" said Harry, sitting up straight.\n\"That's right,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure\nwhat happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to 'the big\nhouse over the way.' There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for\ngood measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and\nrevenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed\nthe complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle's mind, laid Morfin's wand beside\nits unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.\"\n\"And Morfin never realized he hadn't done it?\"\n\"Never,\" said Dumbledore. \"He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.\"\n\"But he had this real memory in him all the time!\" \"Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to\ncoax it out of him,\" said Dumbledore, \"and why should anybody delve further into Morfin's mind when he\nhad already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his"

However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\nlife, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort's past. I extracted this\nmemory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin's release from\nAzkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.\"\n\"But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?\" Harry asked\nangrily \"He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!\" \"You are\nquite right â they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by\nthe Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by â\"\n\"Dobby,\" growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. \"So if you're underage and you do magic inside an\nadult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?\"\n\"They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the\nlook of great indignation on Harrys face. \"They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's\nobedience while within their walls.\"\n\"Well, that's rubbish,\" snapped Harry. \"Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!\"\n\"I agree,\" said Dumbledore. \"Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders\nhe had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. ...\"\nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering\nthat Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents\nproved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\n\"This will not take long,\" said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. \"We shall be back\nbefore you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . .\"\nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at\nonce.\nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn\nwith thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched,\nthough there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it\nwas these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the\ngolden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet\nresting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping\na small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.\nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn's\noffice.

His was the most handsome face and he looked the most\nrelaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that\nhe was wearing Marvolo's gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father.\n\"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" he asked.\n\"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at\nRiddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your\ninformation, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.â\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\n\"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnât, and your careful flattery of the people who\nmatter â thank you fm the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite â \"\nAs several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a\nthick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him.\nThen Slughorn's voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, \"You'll go wrong, boy, mark my\nwords. \"\nThe fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody\nlook as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden\nclock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock.\n\"Good gracious, is it that time already?\" said Slughorn. \"You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in\ntrouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\"\nSlughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed\nout. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in\nthe room with Slughorn.\n\"Look sharp, Tom,\" said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. \"You don't want to be\ncaught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect...\"\n\"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\"\n\"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away....\"\n\"Sir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?\"\nAnd it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or\nVoldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn's voice boomed out again,\njust as it had done before.\n\"I don't know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn't tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and\ndonât let me catch you mentioning them again!\"\n\"Well, that's that,\" said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.\n\"Time to go.\"\nAnd Harry's feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the\nrug in front of Dumbledore's desk."

Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but\nother than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to\nget an answer.\nChapter 17: A sluggish memory\n\"As you might have noticed,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, \"that memory has been\ntampered with.\"\n\"Tampered with?\" repeated Harry, sitting back down too.\n\"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.\"\n\"But why would he do that?\"\n\"Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,\" said Dumbledore. \"He has tried to rework the\nmemory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as\nyou will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is\nstill there beneath the alterations.\n\"And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor\nSlughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of\nall.\"\nHarry stared at him.\n\"But surely, sir,\" he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, \"you don't need me â you could use\nLegilimency ... or Veritaserum. ...\"\n\"Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,\" said Dumbledore. \"He is\nmuch more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not\ncarried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a\nrecollection.\n\"No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might\ndo much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like\nthe rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is\nmost important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we\nhave seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.\"\nA little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. \"Good night, sir.\"\nAs he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, \"I can't see why the boy\nshould be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.\"\n\"I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas,\" replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.\nHotLog"

'Won't refuse you anything, will\nhe? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.'\nHermione, however, took a gloomier view.\n'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a\nlow voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I've never\neven heard of them ...'\n'You haven't?'\nHarry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what\nHorcruxes were.\n'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them?

'After all, when has\nWon-Won's judgement ever been faulty?'\n'Hermione, can't you â'\n'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.\nPotions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a\ndesk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored\nboth Harry and Ron.\n'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile."

Ten points for Gryffindor!

Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next,\neither.\n'... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's\ningredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes\nto those ingredients in a\nof themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform\nthese disparate elements -'\nRon was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half-open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced\nPotion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble\nwhen he failed to grasp what was going on.\n'... and so,' finished Slughorn, 'I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk.

'You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!'\nAnnoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughorn's desk, which was a garish shade of pink,\ntipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was\nsupposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having\ncopied everything Harry had done.\n'You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?'

There\nwas Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating\nnote in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no\ndifficulty understanding it.\n'Nothing,' said Harry gloomily.\nHermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not\ncopy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incantations that she did not need\nto say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, 'Specialis revelio!' over his cauldron,\nwhich sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.\nIt took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was\ncrashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the\ndungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily,\ncoughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nsmugger; she had loathed being out-performed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the\nmysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching\nthis irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages\nwith unnecessary force.\nAnd there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.\nJust shove a bezoar down their throats.\nHarry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape\nmentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? 'A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will\nprotect from most poisons.'\nIt was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have\ndared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and\nrummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very\nback, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'.\nHe opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled\nbrown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in\nthe cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.\n'Time's ... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise ... what have you got for\nme?'\nSlowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task,\nalthough Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her.\nRon had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from\nhis cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand."

'What have you got to show me?'\nHarry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.\nSlughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to\nshout at him.

'Oh,\nyou're like your mother ... well, 1 can't fault you ... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these\npotions!'\nHermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid.

Harry awaited an invitation to one of\nhis little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice.\nUnfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of\nthem had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help\nwondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined\nto give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.\nMeanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so\nshocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.\n'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!' she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been\nright through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew\nthe most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile -\nlisten - \"of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction\" ... I mean,\nwhy mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut\nup,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.\nThe snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness.\nPurplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and\nmuddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a\nSaturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the\ngrounds.\nWhen Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the\ntables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly\nabove them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads\nof House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was\noddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of\nwind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had\nsomehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.\n'Good morning,' said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of House had\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\ncalled for quiet. 'My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry-Apparition Instructor for the\nnext twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -'\n'Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!' barked Professor McGonagall.\nEverybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from\nCrabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at"

Harry glanced quickly at\nSnape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's\nrudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.\n'- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,' Twycross continued, as though there had\nbeen no interruption.\n'As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster\nhas lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May\nI emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be\nunwise to try.\n'I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.'\nThere was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others\nout of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and\nbreaking up arguments.\n'Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione.\nBut Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor\nFlitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the\nfront, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie\nMacmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who\nwas taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet\naway and looking mutinous.\n'I don't know how much longer, all right?' Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind\nhim. 'It's taking longer than I thought it would.'\nCrabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.\n'Look, it's none of your business what I'm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you're told and keep a\nlookout!'\n'! tell my friends what I'm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\" Harry said, just loud enough for\nMalfoy to hear him.\nMalfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of\nHouse shouted, 'Quiet!' and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.\nThank you,' said Twycross. :Now then ...'\nHe waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student.\nThe important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!' said Twycross. 'Destination,\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nDetermination, Deliberation!\n'Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,' said Twycross. 'In this case, the interior of\nyour hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.'\nEverybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did"

Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.'\nEverybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did\nas they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to\nthink of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing\nthat needed lookouts.\n\"Step two,' said Twycross, 'focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to\nenter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!'\nHarry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop\nso hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry\nbit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.\n'Step three,' called Twycross, 'and only when 1 give the command ... lum on the spot, feeiing your way into\nnothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now ... one- 1\nHarry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so\nquickly.\nHarry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.\n: - THREE!'\nHarry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was\nsuddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had\ndone a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean\nThomas roaring with laughter at him.\n'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust\nyour hoops, please, and back to your original positions ...'\nThe second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything\nexciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan\nBones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had\nstarted.\nThe Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to\nreveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.\n'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when\nthe mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move,\nwithout hasie, but with deliberation ... thus.'\nTwycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a\nswirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again ... one\n-two - three -'\nBut an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nnot seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and\ndo not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.'"

Determination. Deliberation.'\nWith that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor\nMcGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.\n'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind\nof tingling in my feet.'\n'1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past,\nsmirking.\n'1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this interruption. \"But 1 don't care about that now-'\n'What d'you mean, you don't care ... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously.\n'I'm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,' said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and\nspeeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. 'Look, hurry up, will you, there's something I want to do\n...'\nPerplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by\nPeeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set\nfire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts.\nWithin five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.\n'Are you going to tell me what we're doing, then?' asked Ron, panting slightly.\n'Up here,' said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys'\nstaircase.\nTheir dormitory was, as Ham' had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it,\nwhile Ron watched impatiently.\n'Harry ...'\n'Malfoy's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know ...\naha.'\nHe had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped\nwith [he tip of his wand.\n'I solemn!)' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is,\nAt once, the Marauder's Map appeared on the parchment's surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of\nthe castle's floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castle's\noccupants.\n'Help me find Malfoy,' said Harry urgently.\nHe laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.\n'There!' said Ron, after a minute or so. 'He's in the Slytherin common room, look ... with Parkinson and\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nZabini and Crabbe and Goyle ...\"\nHarry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.\n'Well, I'm keeping an eye on him from now on,' he said firmly. 'And the moment 1 see him lurking\nsomewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it'll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off\nto find out what he's-'"

Admittedly, he spotted\nCrabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining\nstationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible\nto locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was\nactually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve!\nof security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the\nhundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be\ngoing their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older -\nRon and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.\nFebruary moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet.\nTo general indignation, a sign went up on all common-room noticeboards that the next trip into\nHogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.\n'It was on my birthday!' he said, 'i was looking forward to that!'\n'Not a big surprise, though, is it?' said Harry. 'Not after what happened to Katie.'\nShe had still not returned from Si Mungo's. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in\nthe Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.\n'But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!' said Ron grumpily. 'Big birthday treat ...'\nThree lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as\never, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and\nthere was a certain amount of ill-feeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a\nnumber of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head.\n'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean\nleaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.'\nHe threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry\nassumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.\n'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and\nbegan rummaging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the\ncontents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his\nbottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises"

'Hey\n... I don't think he's in his bed ...'\nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation\nof pleasure.\n'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the\nedge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of\nage next year too ...\n'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was\nMalfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere\nnear Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ...\n'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.\n'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up.

There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could\nnot think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility\nCloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could\nnot follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon,\n'Ready?' he said to Ron.\nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his\nbedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.\n'Ron? Breakfast.'\n'I'm not hungry,'\nHarry stared ai him.\n'I thought you just said -?'\n-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.'\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nHarry scrutinised him suspiciously.\n'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?'\n'It's not that,' Ron sighed again.

Ron was rather pale and\nlooked as though he was about to be sick.\n'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely.\nHarry gaped at him.

'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?'\nRon blinked.\n'Who are you talking about?'\nWho are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the\nconversation.\n'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a\nray of purest sunlight.

Harry bellowed.\n'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face\nas all the blood rushed to his head.\n'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?'\nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.\n'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?'\n'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free.

A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting\nRon down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they\nwere supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he\nwould deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.\n'Yeah, I'll introduce you,' said Harry, thinking fast. 'I'm going to let you down now, OK?'\nHe sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet\nagain, grinning.\n'She'll be in Slughorn's office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.\n'Why will she be in there?' asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.\n'Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,' said Harry, inventing wildly.\n'Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?' said Ron eagerly.\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\n'Great idea,' said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not\nforeseen.\n'You're lace, Won-Won!' she pouted. 'I've got you a birthday-'\n'Leave me alone,' said Ron impatiently, 'Harry's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.'\nAnd without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole.

'This is very early for a call ...

Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.\n'What - but -' spluttered Slughorn.\nHarry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughorn's open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches,\nwhile the terrible sound of Ron's gargling breath filled the room. Then\nhe found it - the shrivelled kidney-like stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.\nHe hurtled back to Ron's side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a\ngreat shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.\nHotLog\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 19: Elf Tails\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:17)\nChapter 19: Elf Tails\nSo, all in all, not one of Ron's better birthdays?\" said Fred.\nIt was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit.

They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was\nstreaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\nWhen there's strife and when there's trouble\nCall on Peevsie, he'll make double!\nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to\nclamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron\nyet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night\nand set off for the girls' dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and\nlooking down into the dying embers.\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he\ntrusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard\nenough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands,\nthat he had pretended there was nothing in Harry's suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that\nDumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory\nfrom Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to\nsixteen-year-olds. ...\n\"There you are, Potter!\"\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common\nroom was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair.\nA closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\n\"I've been waiting for you to come back,\" said McLaggen, disregarding Harryâs drawn wand. \"Mustâve\nfallen asleep.

I'm pretty tired now ... see you\n. . .\"\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that\nKatie's attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been\nin the Potions master's room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was\nno real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch\nmatch against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the\nHufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco\nMalfoy. Still checking the Marauder's Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to\nwherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still\nthere were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .\nBut Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and\nthe fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.\nHe could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that\nhe would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him\nplay regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the\nother players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to\nremind him who was Captain.\nMeanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing\nthan McLaggen's Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to\ntell her that Ron was in the hospital wing â \"I mean, I am his girlfriend!\" â but unfortunately slit-had\nnow decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him\nabout Ron's feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.\n\"Look, why don't you talk to Ron about all this?\" Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from\nLavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or"

Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch\nthe match, feeling it would overexcite him.\n\"So how's McLaggen shaping up?\" he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already\nasked the same question twice.\n\"I've told you,\" said Harry patiently, \"he could be world-class and I wouldn't want to keep him. He keeps\ntrying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can't\nwait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,\" Harry added, getting to his feet and picking\nup his Firebolt, \"will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She's driving me\nmad as well.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Ron, looking sheepish. \"Yeah. All right.\"\n\"If you don't want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,\" said Harry.\n\"Yeah . . . well. . . it's not that easy, is it?\" said Ron. He paused. \"Hermione going to look in before the\nmatch?\" he added casually.\n\"No, she's already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Ron, looking rather glum. \"Right. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag â I mean,\nSmith.\"\n\"I'll try,\" said Harry, shouldering his broom. \"See you after the match.\"\nHe hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the\nstadium or heading down toward it.

This was infuriating; he was already cutting it\nfine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was\nabsent: Harry's best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to.

If he could\ncatch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder's\nMap, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .\n\"And that's Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,\" said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. \"He did"

McLaggen\nhad been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he\nhad not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.\n\"McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!\"\nbellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.\n\"You're not setting a great example!\" McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.\n\"And Harry Potter's now having an argument with his Keeper,\" said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs\nand Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. \"I don't think that'll help him find the Snitch, but\nmaybe it's a clever ruse. ...\"\nSwearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of\nthe tiny, winged golden ball.\nGinny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to\ncheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed;\nshe appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the\ncrowd's attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith,\nwho had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from\nsomething called \"Loser's Lurgy.\"\n\"Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!\" barked Professor McGonagall into Luna's megaphone.\n\"Is it, already?\" said Luna vaguely. \"Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper's got hold of one of the Beater's\nbats.\"\nHarry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled\nPeakes's bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming\nCadwallader."

He raised his head awkwardly.\nChapter 19: Elf Tails\nThere on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.\n\"Nice of you to drop in,\" said Ron, grinning.\nHarry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo\nstreaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago ... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy.\nHarry's head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Cracked skull,\" said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. \"Nothing to\nworry about, I mended it at once, but I'm keeping you in overnight. You shouldn't over exert yourself for a\nfew hours.\"\n\"I don't want to stay here overnight,\" said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. \"I want to\nfind McLaggen and kill him.\"\n\"I'm afraid that would come under the heading of 'overexertion,'\" said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly\nback onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. \"You will stay here until I discharge you,\nPotter, or I shall call the headmaster.\"\nShe bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.\n\"D'you know how much we lost by?\" he asked Ron through clenched teeth.\n\"Well, yeah I do,\" said Ron apologetically. \"Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.\"\n\"Brilliant,\" said Harry savagely. \"Really brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen â\"\n\"You don't want to get hold of him, he's the size of a troll,\" said\nRon reasonably. \"Personally, I think there's a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the\nPrince's. Anyway, the rest of the team might've dealt with him before you get out of here, they're not happy.\n...\"\nThere was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled\nthat McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his\nrecently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.\n\"I could hear the match commentary from here,\" said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. \"I hope\nLuna always commentates from now on. . . . Loser's Lurgy ...\"\nBut Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron's snorts subsided."

How come?

You're\ngetting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him ...\"\n\"I want to catch him at it!\" said Harry in frustration. \"I mean, where's he going when he disappears off the\nmap?\"\n\"I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?\" suggested Ron, yawning.\n\"I've never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were being\nwatched now anyway?\"\n\"Well then, I dunno,\" said Ron.\nSilence fell between them.

He thought fleetingly of\ntrying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed\nfrom lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .\nThere was a low, rumbling snore from Ron's bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office,\nthis time wearing a thick dressing gown.

Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the\ndarkness.\n\"Kreacher?\"\nThere was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke\nChapter 19: Elf Tails\nwith a yelp.\n\"What's going â ?\"\nHarry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey's office and muttered, \"Muffliato!\" so that\nshe would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at\nwhat was going on.\nTwo house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken\nmaroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth.\nThen there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.\n\"I was watching that, Potty!\" he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud\ncackle. \"Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy â\"\n\"Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won't, or Dobby will shut Kreacher's mouth\nfor him!\" cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.\n\"â kicky, scratchy!\" cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of' chalk at the elves to enrage them further.\n\"Tweaky, pokey!\"\n\"Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of\nMudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher's mistress say â ?\"\nExactly what Kreacher's mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his\nknobbly little fist into Kreacherâs mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of\ntheir beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other,\negged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, \"Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his\ncork and pull his earsies â\"\nHarry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, \"Langlock!\" Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped"

Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little\nsince he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, \"Professor Dumbledore, I'm really\nsorry.

All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue\nonce they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect,\nHead Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor\nSlughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put\nhim in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was\nworking at Borgin and Burkes.\"\n\"At Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry repeated, stunned.\n\"At Borgin and Burkes,\" repeated Dumbledore calmly. \"I think you will see what attractions the place held\nfor him when we have entered Hokey's memory. But this was not Voldemort's first choice of job. Hardly\nanyone knew of it at the time â I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided â but\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request"

        "text": "anyone knew of it at the time â I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided â but\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\nVoldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a\nteacher.\"\n\"He wanted to stay here? Why?\" asked Harry, more amazed still.\n\"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been\nto a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.\"\nHarry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too.\n\"Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more\nof its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still\nmysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.\n\"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards.\nPerhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who\nhad demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort\nenvisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting\nground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.\"\n\"But he didn't get the job, sir?\"\n\"No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in\na few years, if he still wished to teach.\"\n\"How did you feel about that, sir?\" asked Harry hesitantly. \"Deeply uneasy,\" said Dumbledore. \"I had\nadvised Armando against the appointment â I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor\nDippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back\nat this school, and especially not in a position of power.\"\n\"Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?\"\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.\n\"Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea\nMerrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.\n\"So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it\nwas, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant.\nPolite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like\nBorgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful\nproperties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and\nhe was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.\"\n\"I'll bet he was,\" said Harry, unable to contain himself.\n\"Well, quite,\" said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \"And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf,\nwho worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.\""

He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely\nfat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her,\ngiving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge\nonto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had\never seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.\n\"Hurry up, Hokey!\" said Hepzibah imperiously. \"He said he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to\nand he's never been late yet!\"\nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached\nthe seat of Hepzibah's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore\ndraped like a toga.\n\"How do I look?\" said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\n\"Lovely, madam,\" squeaked Hokey.\nHarry could only assume that it was down in Hokeyâs contract that she must lie through her teeth when\nasked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.\nA tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.\n\"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey!\" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so\ncrammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without\nknocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of\ngold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass\ncontainers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.\nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in\nrecognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had\nbeen at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than\never. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times\nbefore and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.\n\"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.\n\"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!\" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an\nempty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit\ndown. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah ...\""

You look pale.\nThey overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ...\"\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. .Â¦,!\n\"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?\" she asked, bat-ring her lashes.\n\"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five\nhundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair â\"\n\"Now, now, not so fast, or Iâll think you're only here for my trinkets!\" pouted Hepzibah.\n\"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who\nmust do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire â\"\n\"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never\nshown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it?\nHe'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But\nyou, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.\"\n\"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another\ngirlish giggle.\n\"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure.\n... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ...\"\n\"Here, madam,\" squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving\nacross the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as\nshe wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools.\n\"Now,\" said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open\nthe topmost one, \"I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They\ncan't wait to get their hands on this!\"\nShe opened the lid.

Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's\nsupposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .\"\nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon\nsettling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was\ntaken away.\n\"Now then,\" said Hepzibah happily, \"whereâs Hokey? Oh yes, there you are â take that away now,\nHokey.\"\nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.\n\"I think you'll like this even more, Tom,\" she whispered. \"Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of\ncourse, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm\ngone. ...\"\nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a\nheavy golden locket.\nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.\n\"Slytherin's mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\n\"That's right!\" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket,\ntransfixed. \"I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to\nhave it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have\nstolen it, but had no idea of its true value â\"\nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his\nknuckles whiten on the locket's chain.\n\"â I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn't it? And again, all kinds of powers\nattributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .\"\nShe reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of\nit, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.\nâSo there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!â\nShe looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter."

The usual enchantments...\"\n\"Time to leave, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes,\nDumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and\nback to Dumbledore's office.\n\"Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,\" said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating\nthat Harry should do the same. \"Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemort's Request\nmistress's evening cocoa by accident.\"\n\"No way!\" said Harry angrily.\n\"I see we are of one mind,\" said Dumbledore. \"Certainly, then are many similarities between this death and\nthat of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of\nhaving caused the death â\" \"Hokey confessed?\"\n\"She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and\nlittle-known poison, said Dumbledore. \"It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and\nconfused â\"\n\"Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!\" \"Yes, that is my conclusion too,\" said\nDumbledore. \"And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey â\"\n\"â because she was a house-elf,\" said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society\nHermione had set up, S.P.E.W. \"Precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"She was old, she admitted to having\ntampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin,\nby the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over â but her memory,\nof course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.\n\"By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah's family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were\nmissing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her\ncollection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both\ngone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so\nregularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he\nhad gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or\nheard of Tom Riddle for a very long time.\n\"Now,\" said Dumbledore, \"if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to\ncertain points of our story.

There were other\nreasons, I think. ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.\n\"And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor\nSlughorn's memory for us. Ten years separates Hokeyâs memory and this one, ten years during which we\ncan only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .\" Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore\nemptied the last memory into the Pensieve.\n\"Whose memory is it?\" he asked. \"Mine,\" said Dumbledore.\nAnd Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just\nleft. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who\nlooked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and\nundamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office\nand this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark\nand building up on the outside ledge.\nThe younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their\narrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, \"Enter.\"\nHarry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had\nseen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes\nwere not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as\nthough his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the\neyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they\nwould become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his\nshoulders."

Something to do with impersonating an\nInferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how\nhorrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under\nthe Imperius Curse.\"\nThey finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the\ncommon room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape's dementor essay, and Harry for the\ncorridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching\ntrolls to do ballet.\nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered."

He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the\ncorner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\nHarry tried every variation of \"I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\" that he could think of\nfor a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The\nroom simply did not want to open for him.

Goading Myrtle seemed\nto have put fresh heart into Ron. \"You're right,\" he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder,\n\"I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.\"\nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn\nseventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go\ninto the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear\nskies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on\nthe Room of Requirement.\n\"You'd do better,\" said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, \"to go\nstraight to Slughorn's office and try and get that memory from him.\"\n\"I've been trying!\" said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions\nlesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast\nthat Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received\nno reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old\ngramophone.\n\"He doesn't want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's\nnot going to let it happen!â\n\"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?\"\nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy\nSensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He\nwished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined,\nwhatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.\nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his\nbag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\"\nand scanned it carefully.\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the\nGryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in\nthe basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a\ncorridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was\nGregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if\nGoyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He"

        "text": "Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if\nGoyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He\ntherefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he\nbegan to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that\nHermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bending\nvery low and whispering, \"Helloâ¦you're very pretty, aren't you?\"\nGoyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing\nfrom sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor.\nLaughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now\nstanding frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It\ngave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet\ntried.\nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of his\nrequest to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond\nbelief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to\nwhat he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\n\"OUCH!\"\nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak\nslipped off him.\n\"Harry?\"\nHe spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking\ntoward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.\n\"Whatâre you doing here?\" he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying\non the floor?\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\n\"I came to see Dumbledore,\" said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her\nmouse-colored hair lank.\n\"His office isn't here,\" said Harry, \"it's round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle â\"\n\"I know,\" said Tonks. \"He's not there. Apparently he's gone away again.\"\n\"Has he?\" said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. \"Hey â you don't know where he\ngoes, I suppose?\"\n\"No,\" said Tonks.\n\"What did you want to see him about?\"\n\"Nothing in particular,\" said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. \"I just\nthought he might know what's going on. I've heard rumorsâ¦ people getting hurt.\"\n\"Yeah, I know, it's all been in the papers,\" said Harry. \"That little kid trying to kill his â\"\n\"The Prophet's often behind the times,\" said Tonks, who didn't seem to be listening to him. \"You haven't\nhad any letters from anyone in the Order recently?\"\n\"No one from the Order writes to me anymore,\" said Harry, \"not since Sirius ââ He saw that her eyes had\nfilled with tears."

I miss him, as well.\"\n\"What?\" said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. \"Well. I'll see you around, Harry.â\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\nAnd she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a\nminute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of\nRequirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that\nRon and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to\nMalfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.\nHe found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.\n\"I did it â well, kind of!\" Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. \"I was supposed to\nbe Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts,\nbut at least I moved!\"\n\"Good one,\" said Harry. \"How'd you do, Hermione?\"\n\"Oh, she was perfect, obviously,\" said Ron, before Hermione could answer. \"Perfect deliberation,\ndivination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is â we all went for a quick drink in the Three\nBroomsticks after and you should've heard Twycross going on about her â I'll be surprised if he doesn't\npop the question soon â\"\n\"And what about you?\" asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. \"Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all\nthis time?\"\n\"Yep,\" said Harry. \"And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!\"\n\"Tonks?\" repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.\n\"Yeah, she said she'd come to visit Dumbledore.\"\n\"If you ask me,\" said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, \"she's cracking\nup a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.\"\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\n\"Itâs a bit odd,\" said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. \"She's supposed to be\nguarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he's not\neven here?\"\n\"I had a thought,\" said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermioneâs\nterritory than his. \"You don't think she can have been... you know... in love with Sirius?\"\nHermione stared at him. \"What on earth makes you say that?\"\n\"I dunno,\" said Harry, shrugging, \"but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus\nis a big four-legged thing now. I wondered whether it hadn't become... you know... him.\"\n\"It's a thought,\" said Hermione slowly. \"But I still don't know why she'd be bursting into the castle to see\nDumbledore, if that's really why she was here.\"\n\"Goes back to what I said, doesn't it?\" said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth."

Hermione and Ron were both\nclutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet â Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them â for\nthey were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the\nnerves.\nRon gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner.\n\"It isn't Lavender,\" said Hermione wearily.\n\"Oh, good,\" said Ron, relaxing.\n\"Harry Potter?\" said the girl. \"I was asked to give you this.\"\n\"Thanks...\"\nHarry's heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment.

There could be only one conclusion, in\nHarry's opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.\nCheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily\ncorrected Half-Blood Prince's version of \"An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,\" which seemed not only to meet\nSlughorn's instructions, but which might (Harry's heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into\nsuch a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to\ntaste some. . . .\n\"Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,\" said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands\ntogether as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry's cauldron. \"Euphoria, I take it?

His\nfeeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met\nnobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at\nHogwarts.\nWhy he knew that going to Hagrid's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion\nwas illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see\nwhere Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he\nreached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it\nopen and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the\ndusk.\nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the\nvegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid's. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this\nwas a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where\nhe was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor\nSprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their\nconversation.\n\"I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,\" Slughorn was saying courteously, \"most authorities agree\nthat they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.\"\n\"Oh, I quite agree,\" said Professor Sprout warmly. \"That enough for you?\""

Well, good\nevening to you, and many thanks again!\"\nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn\ndirected his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.\n:\nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish.\nChapter 22: After the Burial\n\"Good evening, Professor.\"\n\"Merlinâs beard, Harry, you made me jump,\" said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary.\n\"How did you get out of the castle?\"\n\"I think Filch must've forgotten to lock the doors,\" said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn\nscowl.\n\"I'll be reporting that man, he's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why\nare you out then, Harry?\"\n\"Well, sir, it's Hagrid,\" said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. \"He's\npretty upset. . . But you won't tell anyone, Professor? I don't want trouble for him. ...\"\nSlughorn's curiosity was evidently aroused. \"Well, I can't promise that,\" he said gruffly. \"But I know that\nDumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. ..\n.\"\n\"Well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... It lived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything â\"\n\"I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,\" said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of\nblack trees. \"It's true, then?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He's devastated.\nHe wants company while he buries it and I said I'd go.\"\n\"Touching, touching,\" said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of\nHagrid's cabin. \"But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have\ndried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was\nany way to procure some ... I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its\nalive. ...\"\nChapter 22: After the Burial\nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. \". . . seems an awful waste not to collect\nit... might get a hundred Galleons a pint. ...

Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial,\nnow came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry's lap as usual. Slughorn\nuncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.\n\"I have had it all tested for poison,\" he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid's\nbucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to\nyour poor friend Rupert.\"\nHarry saw, in his mind's eye, the expression on Hermione's face if she ever heard about this abuse of\nhouseelves, and decided never to mention it to her.\n\"One for Harry . . .\" said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, \". . . and one for me.

He refilled Hagrid's mug and his\nown, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to\nlook after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn's flattering\ninterest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.\nThe Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that\nSlughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Re-filling Charm\nwithout saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable:\nIndeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slug-liorn (now swapping tales of the\nillegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they\nimmediately began to refill.\nChapter 22: After the Burial\nAfter an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to\nelf-made wine, and to-\n\"Harry Potter!\" bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he\ndrained it.\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Slughorn a little thickly, \"Parry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who â well â something of\nthat sort,\" he mumbled, and drained his mug too.\n;\nNot long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who\npocketed it with cries of, \"To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!\"\nAnd for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a\nslow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.\n\"Aaargh, the good die young,\" muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while\nSlughorn continued to warble the refrain. \"Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum' an' dad, Harry . .\n.\""

He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much;\nperhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\n\"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized\npineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course.

What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been\nintended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\"\n\"1 still don't understand,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work â in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside\nit was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be\nno doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess\nsomebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\"\n\"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was\nSlytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\"\n\"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be\npassed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious\nfragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to\nkeep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they\nmight destroy it â as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.\nThe careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that\nhe must have made â or had been planning to make â more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would\nnot be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told\nme, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and\nalarming statement to his Death Eaters. âI who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to\nimmortality.â That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that\nmeant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry,\nwhich I donât believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less\nhuman with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only\nexplainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\"\n\"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a\nSorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\"\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\n\"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" s;nÂ«l Dumbledore. \"But there are several\nreasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort,"

Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it\nran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort\nlikes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even\non the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible\npart-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am\nconvinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could\nregain a human form. He was already immortal, you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be. But\nnow, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we\nare closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him,\nHarry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most\npowerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a\nseven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\"\n\"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made\nsimilar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world â hidden â buried or\ninvisible â\"\n\"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no,\nHarry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his\nregenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his\nexile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to\nkill Voldemort must attack â the piece that lives in his body.\"\n\"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\"\n\"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\"\n\"You have?\" said Harry eagerly.\n\"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry.\nMarvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been â forgive me the lack of seemly\nmodesty â for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to\nHogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not\nseem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\"\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\n\"But how did you find it?\"\n\"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about\nVoldemort's past life.

I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring\nhidden in the ruin of the Gauntâs house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of\nhis soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments,\nin the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course),\nnever guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open\nfor traces of magical concealment.\n\"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if\nwe are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\"\n\"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles.\n. . .\"\n\"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord\nVoldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have\nshowed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical\nhistory His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place\nin magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some\ncare, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\"\n\"The diary wasn't that special.\"\n\"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort\nconsidered it of stupendous importance.\"\n\"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\"\n\"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort\nwould prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through\nVoldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\"\n\"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet â perhaps not my other hand â but a\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\ncouple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he\ncreated a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from\nHufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects\nfrom the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I\ncannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that\nthe only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\"\nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed\nwithin a glass case.\n\"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find\nsomething from one of the other founders?\""

I am forced to conclude that\nhe never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two â he may have\nfound three â that is the best we can do for now.\"\n\"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry,\ncounting on his fingers. \"Unless heâs got both?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say\nwhen I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?'\n\"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\"\n\"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something\nthat can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are\ncorrect, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents'\nhouse with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for\nparticularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was\ndestroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure\nthat he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval\nof some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him\nto turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts\nmystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close,\nand he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\"\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\n\"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and\nyou think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\"\n\"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head.\n\"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the\nschool?\"\n\"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps ... I may be close\nto finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\"\n\"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\"\nDumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.\n\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\""

Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the\nportraits.\n\"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and\nthese crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the\npoint of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been\ndestroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had\nbeen mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\"\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\n\"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\"\n\"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was\nsupposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after\ngiving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other\nthan guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Luciusâs fear of a master who had been gone\nfor years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I\nunderstand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it\nwas cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would\nundoubtedly have treated it with more reverence â but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan\nfor his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and\nget rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts\nfury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year,\nI would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\"\nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort\ncouldbe killed?\"\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a\nmaimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his\nbrain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like\nVoldemort even without his Horcruxes.\"\n\"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had.

Think!\"\nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother,\nhis father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord\nVoldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\n\"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\"\n\"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything!\nBut the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to\nchoose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the\nprophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that â\"\n\"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\"\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\nBut he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him.

They\nwere both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively\nawed when he told them about Voldemort's Horcruxes and Dumbledore's promise to take Harry along,\nshould he find another one.\n\"Wow,\" said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very\nvaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing.\n\"Wow. You're actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow.\"\n\"Ron, you're making it snow,\" said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away\nfrom the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry\nnoticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let\ngo of Rons arm.\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. \"Sorry... looks like we've all got\nhorrible dandruff now. ...\"\nHe brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears.

She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she\ncouldn't climb in herself . . . but they've been a bit rocky for ages.\"\nHarry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.\n\"Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn't it?\" said Hermione.\n\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry quickly.\n\"The Quidditch team,\" said Hermione. \"If Ginnyand Dean aren't speaking . . .\"\n\"Oh â oh yeah,\" said Harry.\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\n\"Flitwick,\" said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them,\nand Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of\ndeep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry's and Ron's were still murky brown.\n\"Now, now, boys,\" squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. \"A little less talk, a little more action . . .\nLet me see you try. . . .\"\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks.\nHarry's vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded.\n\"Yes ... for homework,\" said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of\nglass out of the top of his hat, \"practice.\"\nThey had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together.\nRon seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione\nseemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, \"It's a nice day.\"\nNeither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry's brain:\nShe's Rons sister.\nBut she's ditched Dean!\nShe's still Rons sister.\nI'm his best mate!\nThat'll make it worse.\nIf I talked to him first â\nHe'd hit you.\nWhat if I don't care?\nHe's your best mate!\nHarry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and\nonly vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried,\n\"Katie!

You've got to let it stew. ...\"\n\"Typical,\" said Ron.\nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to\nit, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned \"For Enemies,\" that he had marked a few weeks previously.\nHe had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he\nwas considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas,\nbecause he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when\nHarry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that\nDean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.\nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so\npleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.\nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of\nthe team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle\nsped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all\nhighly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he\nhad received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the\nSnitch.\nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron\nmight not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had\nseen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her\nhand. . . .\nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her;\nhowever much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would\nhave been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around â but\nunfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for\nHermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he\ncaught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to\ncomplicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny\nout soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.\nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely\nthis was a case for, as Hermione put it, \"tweaking the circumstances\"? The balmy days slid gently through\nMay, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny.

Harry found himself\nlonging for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him\nhappier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer\nthan a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was\nlooming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.\nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high\nthroughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If\nGryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never\nknown his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three\nhundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third\nbehind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody,\nHarry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their\nfirst bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.\nThe run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to\nintimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed\nloudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or\nelse dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nlinked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they\nwon by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be\njust as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.\nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy\nwas up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to\nlocate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although\nHarry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted\nit whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly\ndoorless.\nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from\nthe common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione\nhaving dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last\nArithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor\ncorridor, checking the Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and\nassumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled\ndot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by\nMoaning Myrtle."

The loud\ncrash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble\nstaircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He\ncould not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.\nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his\nwhite-blond head bowed.\n\"Don't,\" crooned Moaning Myrtle's voice from one of the cubicles. \"Don't. . . tell me what's wrong ... I can\nhelp you. . . .\"\n\"No one can help me,\" said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. \"I can't do it. ... I can't. ... It won't work .\n. . and unless 1 do it soon ... he says he'll kill me. ...\"\nAnd Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying â\nactually crying â tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and\nthen, with a great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his\nshoulder.\nMalfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex missed\nHarry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought\nLevicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another â\n\"No! No! Stop it!\" squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. \"Stop!\nSTOP!\"\nThere was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that\nbackfired off the wall behind Malfoy's ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed\nloudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, \"Cruci â\"\n\"SECTUMSEMPRA!\" bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nBlood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He\nstaggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his\nlimp right hand.\n\"No â\" gasped Harry.\nSlipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining\nscarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.\n\"No â I didn't â\"\nHarry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking\nuncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: \"MURDER!\nMURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!\"\nThe door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face\nlivid.

The flow of blood\nseemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy's face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds\nseemed to be knitting.\nHarry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and\nwater. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his\ncountercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position.\n\"You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany\nimmediately we might avoid even that.. . . Come....\"\nHe supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, \"And you,\nPotter . . . You wait here for me.\"\nIt did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet\nfloor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in\nhimself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident\nenjoyment.\nSnape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.\n\"Go,\" he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.\n\"I didn't mean it to happen,\" said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. \"I didn't know\nwhat that spell did.\"\nBut Snape ignored this. \"Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,\" he said quietly. \"Who would have\nthought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?\"\n\"I â read about it somewhere.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"It was â a library book,\" Harry invented wildly. \"I can't remember what it was call â\"\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\n\"Liar,\" said Snape.

He stared into\nSnape's black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but â\n\"Bring me your schoolbag,\" said Snape softly, \"and all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me\nhere. Now!\"\nThere was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed\nout of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower.

He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral,\nwhose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls,\nbuilt of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were\nalleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nhide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands\nand thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged\nFrisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden\nitems; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like\ndragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a\nheavy, bloodstained axe.\nHarry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure.

A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his\nhand wordlessly for Harry's schoolbag.

But he had never learned how to do\nit properly. . . .\n\"Do you know what I think, Potter?\" said Snape, very quietly. \"I think that you are a liar and a cheat and\nthat you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. \"What do you think, Potter?\"\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\n\"I â I don't agree, sir,\" said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape's eyes.\n\"Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,\" said Snape. \"Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Potter.\nMy office.\"\n\"But sir . . .\" said Harry, looking up desperately. \"Quidditch . . . the last match of the ...\"\n\"Ten o'clock,\" whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. \"Poor Gryffindor. . . fourth\nplace this year, I fear ...\""

He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione,\nand Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very\nfast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell\nthe story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in\nvilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already\nbeen called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of\nProfessor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported\nwholeheartedly Snape's punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.\n\"I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,\" Hermione said, evidently unable to stop\nherself. \"And I was right, wasn't I.\"\n\"No, I don't think you were,\" said Harry stubbornly.\nHe was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team's\nfaces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of\nall. He could feel Ginny's eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or\nanger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be\nrejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the\npost-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . .\n\"Harry,\" said Hermione, \"how can you still stick up for that book when that spell â\"\n\"Will you stop harping on about the book!\" snapped Harry. \"The Prince only copied it out! It's not like he\nwas advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used\nagainst him!\"\n\"I don't believe this,\" said Hermione. \"You're actually defendingâ\n\"I'm not defending what I did!\" said Harry quickly. \"I wish 1 ; hadn't done it, and not just because I've got\nabout a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn't've used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can't\nblame the Prince, he hadn't written 'try this out, it's really good' â he was just making notes for himself,\nwasn't he, not for anyone else. . . .\"\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\n\"Are you telling me,\" said Hermione, \"that you're going to go back â ?\"\n\"And get the book?

And I'd have thought, seeing what this has\ndone to your chances in the match â\"\n\"Oh, don't start acting as though you understand Quidditch,\" snapped Ginny, \"you'll only embarrass\nyourself.\"\nHarry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting\nwith their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a\nbook at random and hid behind it. Harry, however,\nlittle though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them\nspoke again for the rest of the evening.\nHis lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention\nmuch anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned\nfrom the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry\nwould have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch\nwith Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students\nstreaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves,\nto descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite\nobliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.\n\"Ah, Potter,\" said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office\nthat Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same\nslimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many\ncob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious,\nhard, and pointless work about them.\n\"Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\" said Snape softly. \"They are the\nrecords of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards\nhave suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and,\nmaking sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.\"\n\"Right, Professor,\" said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables."

Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double\ndetention.\" Snape sneered. \"It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their\ngreat achievements remains.\"\nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself\nretaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.\nIt was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the\nregular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together\nin various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And\nwhile he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside,\nwhere the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .\nHarry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as\na regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only\nhalf an hour ... an hour ... an hour and a half. . . .\nHarry's stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at\nall since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.\n\"I think that will do,\" he said coldly. \"Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o'clock\nnext Saturday.\" Yes, sir.\nHarry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his\nmind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. ...\nIt was over, then. . . .\nHe hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won\nor lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.\n\"Quid agis?\" he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.\nHer expression was unreadable as she replied, \"You'll see.\"\nAnd she swung forward.\nA roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight\nof him; several hands pulled him into the room.\n\"We won!\" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. \"We won! Four\nhundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!\"\nHarry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she\nthrew her arms around him.

Hermione was\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nbeaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron.

After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him\nhappier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in\nhorrific scenes of Dark magic.\n'You'd think people had better things to gossip about,' said Ginny, as she sat on the common-room floor,\nleaning against Harry's legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all\nRomilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.'\nRon and Hermione both roared with laughter.

What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?'\ndemanded Ginny.\nBut Ron's tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny's time\ntogether was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny's O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore\nforced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and\nHarry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology home-work\nbut in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time,\nHermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.\n'I want to talk to you, Harry.'\n'What about?' said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting\nGinny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.\nThe so-called Half-Blood Prince.'\n'Oh, not again,' he groaned. 'Will you please drop it?'\nHe had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\nPotions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this\nto Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the\nPrince's book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.\n'I'm not dropping it,' said Hermione firmly, 'until you've heard me out. Now, I've been trying to find out a\nbit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -'\n'He didn't make a hobby of it -'\n'He, he - who says it's a he?'\n'We've been through this,' said Harry crossly.

Underneath the\nphotograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team.\n'So?' said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story\nabout inter-school competitions.\n'Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.'\nThey looked at each other and Harry realised what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing.\n'No way.'\n'What?'\n'You think she was the Half-Blood ...? Oh, come on.'\n'Well, why not? Harry, there aren't any real princes in the wizarding world! It's either a nickname, a\nmade-up title somebody's given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn't it? No, listen!

Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!'\n'Listen, Hermione, I can tell it's not a girl. I can just tell.'\nThe truth is that you don't think a girl would have been clever enough,' said Hermione angrily.\n'How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?' said Harry, stung by\nthis.

Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not\nknow this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry\nhaving to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.\nHarry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was\nholding out a scroll of parchment.\nâThanks, Jimmy ... hey, it's from Dumbledore!' said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning\nit.

Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\nthe corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common\nrooms.\nAnd then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.\n'How - dare - you - aaaaargh!'\nThe noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled\nround another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her\nmany shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.\n'Professor -'\nHarry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had\nbecome entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harry's\nhelping arm.\n'What happened, Professor?'\n'You may well ask!' she said shrilly.

Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.\nâThe Inner Eye,' said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of\nglittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.'\n'Right,' said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney's Inner Eye all too often before.

Well, after that, you\nknow, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that\nit was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent,\ncompared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?'\nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just realised that Harry was no longer with her; he had\nstopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.\n'Harry?' she repeated uncertainly.\nPerhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still\nas waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that\nhad been kept from him for so long ...\nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to\nVoldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their\nson ...\nNothing else mattered to Harry just now.\n'Harry?' said Professor Trelawney again. 'Harry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?'\n'You stay here,' said Harry through numb lips.\n'But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-'\n'You stay here!' Harry repeated angrily.\nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone\ngargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase\nthree steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore's door, he hammered; and the calm voice\nanswered 'Enter' after Harry had already flung himself into the room.\nFawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset\nbeyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black\ntravelling cloak in his arms.\n'Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.'\nFor a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything\nelse out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.\n'Come ... with you ... ?'\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\n'Only if you wish it, of course.'\n'If I...'\nAnd then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore's office in the first place.\n'You've found one? You've found a Horcrux?'\n'I believe so.'\nRage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak.\n'It is natural to be afraid,' said Dumbledore.\n'I'm not scared!' said Harry at once, and it was perfectly\ntrue; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. 'Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?'"

Where is it?'\n'I am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I believe it to be hidden in a cave\non the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in\nwhich Tom Riddle once terrorised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?'\n'Yes,' said Harry. 'How is it protected?'\n'I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.' Dumbledore hesitated, then said, 'Harry, I\npromised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me\nnot to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.'\n'I'm coming,' said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his\ndesire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to\nshow on Harry's face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Harry, a\nslight crease between his silver eyebrows.\n'What has happened to you?'\n'Nothing,' lied Harry promptly.\n'What has upset you?'\n'I'm not upset.'\n'Harry, you were never a good Occlumens -'\nThe word was the spark that ignited Harry's fury.\n'Snape!' he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. 'Snape's what's happened! He\ntold Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!'\nDumbledore's expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast\nby the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\n'When did you find out about this?' he asked at last.\n'Just now!' said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he\ncould not stop himself. 'AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO\nAFTER MY MUM AND DAD!'\nBreathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved\na muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit\nof restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he\nalso wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old\nman for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered\nhis anger ...\n'Harry,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'Please listen to me.'\nIt was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and\nlooked into Dumbledore's lined face.\n'Professor Snape made a terrible -'\n'Don't tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!'\n'Please let me finish.'

He was still in Lord Voldemort's employ on the night he heard the first half of\nProfessor Trelawney's prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it\nconcerned his master most deeply. But he did not know - he had no possible way of knowing - which boy\nVoldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest\nwere people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father -'\nHarry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.\n'He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven't you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to\nend up dead?'\n'You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realised how Lord Voldemort had\ninterpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he\nreturned -'\n'But he's a very good Occlumens, isn't he, sir?' said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of\nkeeping it steady. 'And isn't Voldemort convinced that Snape's on his side, even now? Professor ... how can\nyou be sure Snape's on our side?'\nDumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about\nsomething. At last he said, 'I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.'\nHarry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.\n'Well, I don't!' he said, as loudly as before. 'He's up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under\nyour nose, and you still -'\n'We have discussed this, Harry,' said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. 'I have told you my\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\nviews.'\n'You're leaving the school tonight and I'll bet you haven't even considered that Snape and Malfoy might\ndecide to -'\nTo what?' asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. 'What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?'\n'I ... they're up to something!' said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. 'Professor Trelawney\nwas just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping,\ncelebrating! He's trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he's fixed it at last and\nyou're about to just walk out of school * without -'\n'Enough,' said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had\nfinally crossed some invisible line. 'Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my\nabsences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place.\nPlease do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.'\n'I didn't -' mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.\n' ? do not wish to discuss the matter any further.'\nHarry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying\nDumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, 'Do you wish to come with me tonight?'\n'Yes,' said Harry at once."

I mean that you must follow even such orders as \"run\", \"hide\" or \"go\nback\". Do I have your word?'\n'I - yes, of course.'\n'If 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?'\n'Yes.'\n'If I tell you to flee, you will obey?'\n'Yes.'\n'If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?'\n'I -'\n'Harry?'\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\nThey looked at each other for a moment.\n'Yes, sir.'\n'Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes'\ntime.'\nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the\nhorizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all\nof a sudden. He knew what to do.\nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. 'What does Dumbledore\nwant?' Hermione said at once. 'Harry, are you OK?' she added anxiously.\n'I'm fine,' said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he\nflung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back\ndown the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking\nstunned.\n'I haven't got much time,' Harry panted, 'Dumbledore thinks I'm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...'\nQuickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione's gasps of horror\nor for Ron's hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.\n'... so you see what this means?' Harry finished at a gallop. 'Dumbledore won't be here tonight, so Malfoy's\ngoing to have another clear shot at whatever he's up to. No, listen to me!\" he hissed angrily, as both Ron\nand Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. 'I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of\nRequirement. Here -' He shoved the Marauder's Map into Hermione's hand. 'You've got to watch him and\nyou've got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those\ncontact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he's put extra protection in the school, but if\nSnape's involved, he'll know what Dumbledore's protection is, and how to avoid it - but he won't be\nexpecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?'\n'Harry -' began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.\n' ? haven't got time to argue,' said Harry curtly.

Take this as well -' He thrust the socks into Ron's hands.\nâThanks,' said Ron. 'Er - why do I need socks?'\n'You need what's wrapped in them, it's the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say\ngoodbye to her from me. I'd better go, Dumbledore's waiting -'\n'No!' said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. 'We don't\nwant it, you take it, who knows what you're going to be facing?'\n'I'Il be fine, I'll be with Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'I want to know you lot are OK ... don't look like that,\nHermione, I'll see you later\nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.\nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\ntopmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.\n'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on\nbefore saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?'\nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still\nsummer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a\nlot.\n'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and\nSnape.\nThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Dumbledore lightly. 'I sometimes offer Rosmerta my\ncustom, or else visit the Hog's Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one's true\ndestination.'\nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass,\nlake water and wood smoke from Hagrid's cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for\nanything dangerous or frightening.\n'Professor,' said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, 'will we be\nApparating?'\n'Yes,' said Dumbledore. 'You can Apparate now, I believe?'\n'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I haven't got a licence.'\nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was\nsupposed to go?\n'No matter,' said Dumbledore, 'I can assist you again.'\nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they\nwalked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from\nwindows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.\n'- and stay out!' shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. 'Oh, hello, Albus ...\nyou're out late ...'\n'Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, I'm off to the Hog's Head ... no offence, but I feel\nlike a quieter atmosphere tonight...'"

In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely\nempty.\n'It will not be necessary for us to enter,' muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. 'As long as nobody sees us\ngo ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you.\nOn the count of three - one ... two ... three ...'\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber\ntube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then,\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\njust when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in\ncool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.\nHotLog\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 26: The Cave\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:6)\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at\nmoonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and\nchurning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black\nand faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were\nstanding, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a\nbleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.\n\"What do you think?\" asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry's opinion on whether it was a\ngood site for a picnic.\n\"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?\" asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for\na day trip.\n\"Not here, precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind\nus. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only\never Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot.

No Muggle could reach this rock unless\nthey were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them\nare too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he\nbrought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey\nalone would have done it, don't you?\"\nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.\n\"But his final destination â and ours â lies a little farther on. Come.\"\nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds\nleading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous\ndescent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were\nslippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. \"Lumos,\" said\nDumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled\nupon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him\nwas illuminated too. \"You see?\" said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a\nfissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. \"You will not object to getting a little wet?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry.\n\"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak â there is no need for it now â and let us take the plunge,\" And\nwith the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and\nbegan to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his\nteeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harry's\nwaterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his\nnostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving\ndeeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with\nwater at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing\nlight of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it\nextended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers\nbrushing the rough, wet rock.\nThen he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When\nChapter 26: The Cave\nHarry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming\nfrom his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.\nDumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot,\nexamining the walls and ceiling.\n\"Yes, this is the place,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"How can you tell?\" Harry spoke in a whisper.\n\"It has known magic,\" said Dumbledore simply.

Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was\nexperiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of\nenchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on\nthings Harry could not see. \"This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,\" said Dumbledore after a\nmoment or two. \"We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort's obstacles that stand\nin our way, rather than those nature made. . . .\"\nDumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring\nwords in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave,\ntouching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and\nforward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. \"Here,\" he\nsaid. \"We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.\" Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He\nhad never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long\nsince learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore\nstepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline\nappeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.\n\"You've d-done it!\" said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline\nhad gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.\n\"Harry, I'm so sorry, I forgot,\" he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry's clothes were\nas warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.\n\"Thank you,\" said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave\nwall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something\nextremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledores\nconcentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, \"Oh, surely not. So crude.\"\n\"What is it, Professor?\"\n\"I rather think,\" said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver\nknife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, \"that we are required to make payment to pass.\"\n\"Payment?\" said Harry. \"You've got to give the door something?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Blood, if I am not much mistaken.\"\n\"Blood?\"\n\"I said it was crude,\" said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort\nhad fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. \"The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered,\nChapter 26: The Cave\nis that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that\nthere are much more terrible things than physical injury.\"\n\"Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .\" said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for\nmore.\n\"Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and"

There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was\npeppered with dark, glistening drops.\n\"You are very kind, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had\nmade in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy's wound, \"But your blood\nis worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn't it?\" The blazing silver outline of an\narch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock\nwithin it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. \"After me, I think,\" said\nDumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as\nhe went.\nAn eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could\nnot make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish\nlight shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water\nbelow. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise\nvelvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness\nwas somehow denser than normal darkness.\n\"Let us walk,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.\" He\nset off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing,\nslapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view\ndid not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth,\nglassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place\nand the silence oppressive, unnerving.\n\"Professor?\" he said finally. \"Do you think the Horcrux is here?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes, I'm sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?\"\n\"We couldn't... we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?\" Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion.\nBut he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.\n\"Certainly we could,\" said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \"Why\ndon't you do it?\"\n\"Me? Oh . . . okay . . .\" Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft,\n\"Accio Horcrux!\"\nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty\nChapter 26: The Cave\nfeet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great,"

The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had\nvanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding.\n\"Did you think that would happen, sir?\"\n\"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That\nwas a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\"\n\"But we don't know what the thing was,\" said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.\n\"What the things are, you mean,\" said Dumbledore. \"I doubt very much that there is only one of them.\nShall we walk on?\"\n\"Professor?\"\n\"Yes, Harry?\"\n\"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?\"\n\"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\"\n\"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\"\n\"Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\" And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in\nthe center of the lake.\n\"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\"\n\"Yes, I think so.\" Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of\ndemons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .\n\"Aha,\" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he\ntoppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper\narm, pulling him back. \"So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I\nthink I have found the place.\"\nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far\nas he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was\nrunning his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip\nsomething invisible.\n\"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could\nnot see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's\nbuckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore\nChapter 26: The Cave\nraised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.\nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water\ninto Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like\na snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling\nsomething from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the\nsurface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank"

Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the\nsurface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank\nwhere Harry and Dumbledore stood.\n\"How did you know that was there?\" Harry asked in astonishment.\n\"Magic always leaves traces,\" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \"sometimes\nvery distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\"\n\"Is ... is this boat safe?\"\n\"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of\nthose creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\"\n\"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort's boat?\"\n\"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord\nVoldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\"\n\"But why have they let us?\" asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the\ndark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.\n\"Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able\nto find the boat,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the\nmost unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead\nthat only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right.\"\nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. \"It doesn't look like it was built for two people.\nWill it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\"\nDumbledore chuckled. \"Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical\npower that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only\none wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\"\n\"But then â ?\"\n\"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have\nexpected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared\nto mine.\" These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added,\n\"Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates\nyouth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\" Dumbledore stood aside and\nHarry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They\nwere crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of\nthe boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat's prow\ncleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward\nthe light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea\nChapter 26: The Cave\nexcept that there were no waves.\nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water"

The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .\nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. \"Professor!\" he said, and his\nstartled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.\n\"Harry?\"\n\"I think I saw a hand in the water â a human hand!\"\n\"Yes, I am sure you did,\" said Dumbledore calmly.\nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.\n\"So that thing that jumped out of the water â ?\" But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply;\nthe wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup\ninches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling\naround him like smoke. \"There are bodies in here!\" said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than\nusual and most unlike his own.\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore placidly, \"but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\"\n\"At the moment?\" Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.\n\"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is nothing to be feared\nfrom a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who\nof course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the\nunknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" Harry said nothing; he did not\nwant to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible\nand, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.\n\"But one of them jumped,\" he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. \"When I\ntried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable.\nHowever, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall\ntherefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\" Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to\nHarry's bewildered expression.\n\"Oh . . . right. . .\" said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the\nboat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake,\nteeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had\ngiven Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . .\nand he hadn't seen Ginny at all. . .\n\"Nearly there,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully.

Harry squinted at\nit; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone\nbasin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and\nHarry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting\nthat phosphorescent glow.\n\"What is it?\" asked Harry quietly.\n\"I am not sure,\" said Dumbledore. \"Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\"\nDumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his\nburned fingers toward the surface of the potion.\n\"Sir, no, don't touch â !\"\n\"I cannot touch,\" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \"See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\"\nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier\nthat prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered\nnothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air.\n\"Out of the way, please, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements\nover the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion\nglowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore\nwithdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.\n\"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\"\n\"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the\nsmooth surface of the green potion. \"But how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand,\nVanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made\nto change its nature.\" Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair,\nand then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \"I can only conclude that this\npotion is supposed to be drunk.\"\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"No!\"\n\"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\"\n\"But what ifâ what if it kills you?\"\n\"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,\" said Dumbledore easily. \"Lord Voldemort would not want to kill\nthe person who reached this island.\" Harry couldn't believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore's insane\ndetermination to see good in everyone?\n\"Sir,\" said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \"sir, this is Voldemort we're â\"\n\"I'm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this"

Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his\nChapter 26: The Cave\nHorcruxes.\"\nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the\nemerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. \"Undoubtedly,\" he said, finally, \"this potion must act in a way that\nwill prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so\nmuch pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be\nyour job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You\nunderstand?\"\nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this\nwhy he had been invited along â so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him\nunendurable pain?\n\"You remember,\" said Dumbledore, \"the condition on which I brought you with me?\"\nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.\n\"But what ifâ?\"\n\"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\"\n\"Yes, butâ\"\n\"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but â\"\n\"Well, then,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \"you\nhave my orders.\"\n\"Why can't I drink the potion instead?\" asked Harry desperately.\n\"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\" said Dumbledore. \"Once and for all,\nHarry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\"\n\"Couldn't â ?\"\n\"Do I have it?\"\n\"Butâ\"\n\"Your word, Harry.\"\n\"I âall right, butâ\"\nBefore Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a\nsplit second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank\ninto the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.\n\"Your good health, Harry.\"\nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his\nfingertips were numb.\nChapter 26: The Cave\n\"Professor?\" he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \"How do you feel?\"\nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore\nplunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.\nIn silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion.

A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him,\nslowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning,\nand everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women\nand children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the\nblack water.\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\" yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he\npointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a\nsplash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony\nhands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken\nfaces leering.\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or\nseven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. \"Impedimenta! Incarcerous!\" A few of them\nstumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped\nover or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \"Sectumsempra!\nSECTUMSEMPRA!\" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no\nblood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed\naway still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left\nthe ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew\nthere would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of\nVoldemorts shattered soul...\nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so\nthat the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to\nget to the water.

Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat.

Don't worry. . .\n.\"\n\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am\nwith you.\"\nHotLog\nChapter 26: The Cave\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:16)(cid:14)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:6)(cid:7)\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to\nhis feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con centrated harder than he had\never done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he\ncould, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.\nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and\nDumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one\nhorrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of\nshops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few\nstreetlamps and lit upper windows.\n'We did it, Professor!' Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in\nhis chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!'\nDumbledore staggered against him.

For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown\nDumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a\nstreetlamp.\n'Sir, are you all right?'\n'I've been better,' said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no\nhealth drink ...\"\nAnd to Harry's horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground.\n'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -'\nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he\nmust somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.\n'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...'\n'No,' said Dumbledore. 'It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just\nyet ...'\n'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam\n-'\n'Severus,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'I need Severus ...'\n'All right then, Snape - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -'\nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard run ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had\nseen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the\ndark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with\ndragons.\n'I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn't\nthink what to - but what's wrong with Albus?'\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\nShe came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore.\n'He's hurt,' said Harry. 'Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the\nschool and get help for him?'\n'You can't go up there alone! Don't you realise - haven't you seen -?'\n'If you help me support him,' said Harry, not listening to her, 'I think we can get him inside -'\n'What has happened?' asked Dumbledore. 'Rosmerta, what's wrong?'\nThe - the Dark Mark, Albus.'\nAnd she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words\n... he turned and looked.\nThere it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark\nDeath Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ...\n'When did it appear?' asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry's shoulder as he\nstruggled to his feet.\n'Must have been minutes ago, it wasn't there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -'\n'We need to return to the castle at once,' said Dumbledore.

'Rosmerta,' and though he staggered a little, he\nseemed wholly in command of the situation, 'we need transport - brooms -'\n'I've got a couple behind the bar,' she said, looking very frightened. 'Shall I run and fetch -?'\n'No, Harry can do it.'\nHarry raised his wand at once.\n'Accio Rosmerta's brooms.'\nA second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into\nthe street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist\nheight.\n'Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,' said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him.\n'It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Harry, put on your\nInvisibility Cloak.'\nHarry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam\nRosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground\nand rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to\ngrab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a\nstimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard\nflying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him\nlike a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind ...\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them\nwho had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the\nDA? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave\nthe safety of their beds ... would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?\nAs they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the\nwhistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he\nunderstood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the\ngrounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they\ncould enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the\ncastle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?\nDumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him\nseconds later and looked around.\nThe ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There\nwas no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.\n'What does it mean?' Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent's tongue\nglinting evilly above them. 'Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?'\nIn the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened\nhand."

I shall wait here.'\n'But -'\n'You swore to obey me, Harry - go!'\nHarry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the\niron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore,\nwho gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.\nThe door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: 'Expelliarmus!'\nHarry's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall,\npropped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened -\nExpelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm -\nThen, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts\nand understood ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform\nthe spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.\nStanding against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress.\nHe merely looked across at his disarmer and said, 'Good evening, Draco.'\nMalfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes\nfell upon the second broom.\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n'Who else is here?'\n'A question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?'\nHarry saw Malfoy's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.\n'No,' he said. 'I've got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.'\n'Well, well,' said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show ing him an ambitious homework project. 'Very\ngood indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?'\n'Yeah,' said Malfoy, who was panting. 'Right under your nose and you never realised!'\n'Ingenious,' said Dumbledore. 'Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now? You seem unsupported.'\nThey met some of your guard. They're having a fight down below. They won't be long ... I came on ahead. I\n- I've got a job to do.'\n'Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,' said Dumbledore softly.\nThere was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of\nthem, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters' distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy\ndid nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled.\n'Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.'\n'How do you know?' said Malfoy at once.\nHe seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark's greenish\nlight."

'You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been\ntrying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble\nattempts ... so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it...'\n'It has been in it!' said Malfoy vehemently. 'I've been work ing on it all year, and tonight -'\nSomewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over\nhis shoulder.\n'Somebody is putting up a good fight,' said Dumbledore conversationally. 'But you were saying ... yes, you\nhave managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible ... how did\nyou do it?'\nBut Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as\nparalysed as Harry was.\n'Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,' suggested Dumbledore. 'What if your back-up has been\nthwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\ntonight, too. And after all, you don't really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I cannot defend\nmyself.'\nMalfoy merely stared at him.\n'I see,' said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither\nmoved nor spoke. 'You are afraid to act until they join\nyou.'Â»\n'I'm not afraid!' snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. 'It's you who should be\nscared!'\n'But why? I don't think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so\ntell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a\nlong time to work out how to do it.'\nMalfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several\ndeep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he\ncould not help himself, he said, '1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years.\nThe one Montague got lost in last year.'\n'Aaaah.'\nDumbledore's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment.\nThat was clever ... there is a pair, I take it?'\n'The other's in Borgin and Burkes,' said Malfoy, 'and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague\ntold me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear\nwhat was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was\ntravelling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out,"

'So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into\nthe school to help you ... a clever plan, a very clever plan ... and, as you say, right under my nose ...'\n'Yeah,' said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore's praise.

'I was sure it was you.'\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n'Why didn't you stop me, then?' Malfoy demanded.\n'I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -'\n'He hasn't been doing your orders, he promised my mother -'\n'Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -'\n'He's a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn't working for you, you just think he is!'\n'We must agree to differ on that, Draco.

'Old age, in short ... one day, perhaps,\nit will happen to you ... if you are lucky ...'\n'What's that mean, then, what's that mean?' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent.

As they vanished through the\ndoor, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not\nmagic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to\nleave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\"\nThe Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a\nwaxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the\ndarkened staircase.\nTerror tore at Harry;s heart. ... He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ... Somehow the\ntwo things were linked. ... He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. ...\nDumbledore could not have died. ...\nHe leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly\nlit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him,\nbut even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \"It's over,\ntime to go!\" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy\nseemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the\nfighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of\nHarry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench\nof sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\"\nHarry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the\nfloor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet\nmet something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying\nfacedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like\nflames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was\nthrowing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \"Crucio -\nCrucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\"\n\"Impedimenta!\" yelled Harry.\nHis jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into\nthe opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of\nwhom was battling a separate Death Eater.

He put his head\ndown and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits\nof wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\n\"Take that!\" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting\naway down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself\nafter them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking\naround, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \"Neville, are you - ?\"\n\"M'all right,\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. .\n.\"\n\"I know, I'm on it!\" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was\ncausing most of the chaos.

Harry scrambled up from the floor\nand began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others\nto come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .\nHe skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it\npossible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps\nto secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding\nfeet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody\nfootprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps\nthe Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -\nHe skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded.\nHe saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but\nmerely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring\npaintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within\nthe castle seemed to have awoken. . . .\nHe pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy,\nwho must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down\nthe concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of\nbewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.\n\"Harry!

He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough\nChapter 28: Flight of the Prince\nto get a good aim with a curse -\nAnother flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin\nand was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and\nthe stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not\nHagrid too . . .\nSomething caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground,\nblood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and\nsister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\n\"Impedimenta!\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his\njinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on\nafter Snape.\nAnd now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly\nbehind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense\nstrength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.\nSnape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -\nHarry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape's back, and yelled, \"Stupefy!\"\nHe missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, \"Run, Draco!\"and turned.

Go!\"\nAnd Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater\nobeyed, running toward the gates.

Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in\na bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far\nend of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged\nhim; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.\n\"Are you all right, Harry?\"\n\"I'm fine.... How's Bill?\"\nNobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill's\npillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds\nwith some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy's\nSectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.\n\"Can't you fix them with a charm or something?\" he asked the matron.\n\"No charm will work on these,\" said Madam Pomfrey. \"I've tried everything I know, but there is no cure for\nwerewolf bites.\"\n\"But he wasn't bitten at the full moon,\" said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother's face as though he\ncould somehow force him to mend just by staring. \"Greyback hadn't transformed, so surely Bill won't be a -\na real - ?\" :\nHe looked uncertainly at Lupin.\n\"No, I don't think that Bill will be a true werewolf,\" said Lupin, \"but that does not mean that there won't be\nsome contamination.

Harry had never seen\nLupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned\naway and caught Ron's eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.\n\"How did he die?\" whispered Tonks. \"How did it happen?\"\n\"Snape killed him,\" said Harry. \"I was there, I saw it.

Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, \"Shh!\nListen!\"\nGulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness,\na phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And\nHarry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his\nown grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.\nHow long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to\nlisten to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again\nand Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There\nwere grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.\n\"Molly and Arthur are on their way,\" she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused\nthemselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyest\nshake their heads. \"Harry, what happened?

When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he\nconsidered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Dumbledore's murder is more\ndisturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin's monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . .\"\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\n\"We must consult the governors,\" said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise\non his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape's office. \"We must follow the\nestablished procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.\"\n\"Hagrid, you haven't said anything,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"What are your views, ought Hogwarts to\nremain open?\"\nHagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation,\nnow raised puffy red eyes and croaked, \"I dunno, Professor . . . that's fer the Heads of House an the\nheadmistress ter decide ...\"\n\"Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,\" said Professor McGonagall kindly, \"and so do I.\"\n\"Well, I'm stayin,\" said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into\nhis tangled beard. \"It's me home, it's bin me home since I was thirteen. An' if there's kids who wan' me ter\nteach 'em, I'll do it. But... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Dumbledore .. .\" He gulped and disappeared behind\nhis handkerchief once more, and there was silence.\n\"Very well,\" said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see\nwhether the Minister was yet approaching, \"then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to\nconsult the governors, who will make the final decision.\n\"Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could\narrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -\"\n\"What about Dumbledore's funeral?\" said Harry, speaking at last.\n\"Well. . .\" said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. \"I - I know that it\nwas Dumbledore's wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -\""

He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the\ndeserted corridor; he-had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not\nmatter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did\nnot meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.\n\"Is it true?\" whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. \"It is really true? Dumbledore - dead?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\nShe let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.\nAs Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed\nthrough the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the\ndormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all,\nHarry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys' dormitories.\nAs he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his\nown four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n\"They're talking about closing the school,\" said Harry.\n\"Lupin said they would,\" said Ron.\nThere was a pause.\n\"So?\" said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. \"Did you find\none?

Harry watched from a\nwindow as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and\nthrew herself into the waiting Hagrid's arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the\nMinister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding\ncontact with any of them; he\nwas sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore's last excursion from\nHogwarts.\nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to\nmock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had\nthis time together at the very end of the year, Ginny's examinations finished, the pressure of homework\nlifted ... and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was\nright to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.\nThey visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam\nPomfrey's care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye\nMoody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed jusi the same as ever. All\nthat appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.\n'... so eet ees lucky 'e is marrying me,' said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill's pillows, 'because ze British\novercook their meat, I 'ave always said this.'\n'I suppose I'm just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,' sighed Ginny later that\nevening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room,\nlooking out over the twilit grounds,\n'She's not that bad,' said Harry. 'Ugly, though,' he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let\nout a reluctant giggle.\n'Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, 1 can.'\n'Anyone else we know died?' Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.\nHermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.\n'No,' she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper.

He kept reciting their names\nto himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: 'the locket .., the cup ... the snake ...\nsomething of Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's ... the locket ... the cup ... the snake ... something of Gryffindor's\nor Ravenclaw's ...'\nThis mantra seemed to pulse through Harry's mind as he\nfell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not\nquite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he\nbegan to climb ...\nHe had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore's death, and although she\nhad not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been\nreading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for\nsomebody who had no homework to do.\n'No,' she said sadly, 'I've been trying, Harry, but I haven't found anything ... there are a couple of reasonably\nwell-known wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert \"Axebanger\" Brookstanton ...\nbut they don't seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort,\nand I can't find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... no,\nactually, it's about ... well, Snape.'\nShe looked nervous even saying the name again.\n'What about him?' asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.\n'Well, it's just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,' she said tentatively.\n'D'you have to rub it in, Hermione? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?'\n'No - no - Harry, I didn't mean that!' she said hastily, looking around to check that they were not being\noverheard.

'So ... 1 was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being \"half a\nPrince\", you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophet'\n'Yeah, that fits,' said Harry. 'He'd play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the\nrest of them ... he's just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage,\ntrying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort\n- the Half-Blood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?'\nHe broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore's\ninexcusable trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been\ntaken in just the same ... in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to\nbelieve ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much ...\nHelped him ... it was an almost unendurable thought, now ...\n'I still don't get why he didn't turn you in for using that book,' said Ron.

'I don't think Dumbledore\nwould have liked it very much if he'd known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn't been his, Slughom\nwould have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape's old classroom, and I'll bet\nDumbledore knew his mother was called \"Prince\".'\nT should've shown the book to Dumbledore,' said Harry.

He did not know\nwhat to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered\nwhether Dumbledore's death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had\nmoments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness\nwhere, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it\ndifficult 10 believe that Dumbledore\nhad really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of\nloophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back ... he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the\nfake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it\nhad cost and what remained still to do.\nHarry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral.\nDownstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no\none seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table\nempty. Hagrid's chair was deserted too: Harry thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast;\nbut Snape's place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes\nas they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him.\nAmong Scrimgeour's entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron\ngave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.\nOver at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter\ning together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked\noddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between\nthem, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy\nmuch thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had\nnot forgotten the fear in Malfoy's voice on that Tower top, nor\nthe fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death\nEaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have\nkilled Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatu\nation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity\nmingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy\nnow, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of\nkilling him and his parents? ? â¢â¢â¢>.\nHarry's thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to\nher feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.\n'It is nearly time,' she said. 'Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.'\nThey filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the\nSlytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered with silver.

The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\nplace where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a\nmarble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer's day.\nAn extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and\nyoung. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of\nthe Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest\npink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill supported by\nFleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was\nMadame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky\nCauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the\nwizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop\nin Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's\nHead and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too,\nbarely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the\ngleaming air.\nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were\nwhispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The\ncrowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped\ninto a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione's summons the night that\nDumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most ... probably\nthe ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting ...\nCornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green\nbowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook\nclutched in her red-takmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing\nexpression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight\nof the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water's edge, she gave a start and scurried\nhastily into a seat a good distance away.\nThe staff were seated at last.

He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really\nsorry that Dumbledore wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it.\nHe was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.\n'In there,' whispered Ginny in Harry's ear.\nAnd he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the\nInferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces\nrippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry's neck stand up and\nyet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild\nfaces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore's passing. Then Ginny\nnudged him again and he looked round.\nHagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming\nwith tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to\nbe Dumbledore's body. A sharp pain rose in Harry's throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music\nand the knowledge that Dumbledore's body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron\nlooked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermione's laps.\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\nThey could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body\ncarefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises\nthat drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge ... but Harry knew that\nDumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid's\neyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to\nwhich Hagrid\nwas heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of\na small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human.\nHagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs\nsank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he\nturned to face the front again.\nA little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore's\nbody. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of\nbeads. 'Nobility of spirit' ... 'intellectual contribution' ... 'greatness of heart' ... it did not mean very much. It\nhad little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore's idea of\na few words: 'nitwit', 'oddment', 'blubber' and 'tweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin ... what was the\nmatter with him?"

He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Harry\nnow sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had\nlearned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said ...\nAnd then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it\nhad until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone ... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt,\nbut he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and\nstared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on ... there was movement\namong the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but\nHarry saw them\nstanding quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And\nHarry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing\nthat was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a\nlosing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep\nfighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated ...\nAnd Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in\nfront of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to\nprotect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he\nmust abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms\nmeant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the\ndark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had\ndied and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\nThe little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else\nto get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.\nThen several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore's body and the table\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\nupon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and\nmade strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into\nthe blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing\nDumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested.\nThere were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of\nthe crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs' tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool"

Likewise the mer-people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.\nHarry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron's face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding\nhim. Hermione's face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry's gaze with the\nsame hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his\nabsence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her\nwhat he was going to do now, she would not say 'Be careful', or 'Don't do it', but accept his decision,\nbecause she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had\nknown he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.\n'Ginny, listen ...' he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people\nbegan to get to their feet. 'I can't be involved with you any more. We've got to stop seeing each other. We\ncan't be together.'\nShe said, with an oddly twisted smile, 'It's for some stupid, noble reason, isn't it?'\n'It's been like ... like something out of someone else's life, these last few weeks with you,' said Harry. 'But 1\ncan't ... we can't ... I've got things to do alone now.'\nShe did not cry, she simply looked at him,\n'Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He's already used you as bait once, and that was just\nbecause you're my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know,\nhe'll find out. He'll try and get to me through you.'\n'What if I don't care?' said Ginny fiercely.\n'I care,' said Harry. 'How do you think I'd feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ...'\nShe looked away from him, over the lake.\nT never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with\nlife, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if\nyou were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more -\nmyself.'\n'Smart girl, that Hermione,' said Harry, trying to smile. 'I just wish I'd asked you sooner. We coukTve had\nages ... months ... years maybe ...'\n'But you've been too busy saving the wizarding world,' said Ginny, half-laughing. 'Well ... I can't say I'm\nsurprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting\nVoldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.'\nHarry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting\nbeside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\nshoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose.

With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned\nhis back on Ginny and on Dumbledore's tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more\nbearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill\nVoldemort would feel better than waiting to do it ...\n'Harry!'\nHe turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking\nstick.\n'I've been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you?'\n'No,' said Harry indifferently, and set off again.\n'Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,' said Scrimgeour quietly, 'I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear\nof it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows\nbetter than 1 -'\nâ¢What do you want?' asked Harry flatly.\nScrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful\nunderstanding.\n'You are, of course, devastated,' he said. 'I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may\nhave been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -'\n'What do you want?' Harry repeated, coming to a halt.\nScrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.\n'The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.'\n'Whose word?' said Harry.\n'Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two\nbroomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.'\n'Glad to hear it,' said Harry. 'Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He\ndidn't want people to know.'\n'Such loyalty is admirable, of course,' said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with\ndifficulty, 'bul Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He's gone.'\n'He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,' said Harry, smiling in spite of\nhimself.\n'My dear boy ... even Dumbledore cannot return from the-'\n'I am not saying he can. You wouldn't understand. But I've got nothing to tell you.'\nScrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\nsupposed to be a tone of delicacy, The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I\nwould be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service -'\nHarry laughed.\n'Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors won't stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.'\n'So,' said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, 'the request 1 made of you at Christmas -'\n'What request? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you're doing in exchange for â'\n'- for raising everyone's morale!' snapped Scrimgeour.\nHarry considered him for a moment.\n'Released Stan Shunpike yet?'\nScrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon."

'That's right.'\nScrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry\ncould see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the\nsobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying towards Harry,\npassing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them\nto catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.\n\"What did Scrimgeour want?' Hermione whispered.\n'Same as he wanted at Christmas,' shrugged Harry. 'Wanted me to give him inside information on\nDumbledore and be the Ministry's new poster boy.'\nRon seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, 'Look, let me go back\nand hit Percy!'\n'No,' she said firmly, grabbing his arm.\n'It'll make me feel better!'\nHarry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.\n'I can't bear the idea that we might never come back.' she said softly. 'How can Hogwarts close?'\n'Maybe it won't,' said Ron. 'We're not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhere's\nthe same now. I'd even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d'you\nreckon, Harry?'\n'I'm not coming back even if it does reopen,' said Harry.\nRon gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, 'I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do?\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\n1\n'I'm going back to the Dursleys' once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,' said Harry. 'But it'll be a\nshort visit, and then I'll be gone for good.'\n'But where will you go if you don't come back to school?'\n'I thought I might go back to Godric's Hollow,' Harry muttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since\nthe night of Dumbledore's death. 'For me, it started there, all of it. I've just got a feeling I need to go there.\nAnd I can visit my parents' graves, I'd like that.'\n'And then what?' said Ron.\nThen I've got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven't I?' said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore's\nwhite tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. That's what he wanted me to do, that's why\nhe told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right - and I'm sure he was -there are still four of them out\nthere. I've got to find them and destroy them and then I've got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort's\nsoul, the bit that's still in his body, and I'm the one who's going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape"

The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental\nfigure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the\nwater.\n'We'll be there, Harry,' said Ron.\n'What?'\nAt your aunt and uncle's house,' said Ron. 'And then we'll go with you, wherever you're going.'\n'No -' said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was\nundertaking this most dangerous journey alone.\n'You said to us once before,' said Hermione quietly, 'that there was time to turn back if we wanted to.\nWe've had time, haven't we?'\n'We're with you whatever happens,' said Ron. 'But, mate, you're going to have to come round my mum and\ndad's house before we do anything else, even Godric's Hollow.'\n'Why?'\n'Bill and Fleur's wedding, remember?'\nHarry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed\nincredible and yet wonderful.\n'Yeah, we shouldn't miss that,' he said finally.\nHis hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and\ntwisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew\nmust come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\none last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.\nHotLog\n(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)"
