For a second they stood quite still,\nwands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other,\nthey stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking\nbriskly in the same direction.\n“News?” asked the taller of the two.\n“The best,” replied Severus Snape.\nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles,\non the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long\ncloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.\n“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features slid-\ning in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke\nthe moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope\nhe will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will\nbe good?”\nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a\n1\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nwide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with\nthem, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive\nwrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke\nstep: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and\npassed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.\nThe yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There\nwas a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again,\npointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise\nproved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting\nmajestically along the top of the hedge.\n“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . .” Yaxley thrust\nhis wand back under his cloak with a snort.\nA handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of\nthe straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs\nwindows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a foun-\ntain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and\nYaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their\napproach, though nobody had visibly opened it.\nThe hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated,\nwith a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor.

The two men halted at a heavy wooden door\nleading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat,\nthen Snape turned the bronze handle.\nThe drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and\nornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly\nup against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath\na handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror.\nSnape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their\n2\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DARK LORD\nASCENDING\neyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward\nto the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious hu-\nman figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as\nif suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and\nin the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people\nseated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a\npale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable\nto prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.\n“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table.\n“You are very nearly late.”\nThe speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that\nit was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than\nhis silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through\nthe gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming\nred eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed\nto emit a pearly glow.\n“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his im-\nmediate right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.”\nThe two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around\nthe table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke\nfirst.\n“So?”\n“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Pot-\nter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”\nThe interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened,\nothers fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.\n“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fas-\ntened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the\nwatchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would\n3\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nbe scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked\ncalmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or two, Vol-\ndemort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.\n“Good. Very good. And this information comes —”\n“— from the source we discussed,” said Snape.\n“My Lord.”\nYaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Volde-\nmort and Snape. All faces turned to him.\n“My Lord, I have heard differently.”\nYaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on,\n“Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the"

No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish.\nIt would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.”\n“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said\nYaxley.\n“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape.\n“I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in\nthe protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have\ninfiltrated the Ministry.”\n“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sit-\nting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was\nechoed here and there along the table.\nVoldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to\nthe body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in\nthought.\n4\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DARK LORD\nASCENDING\n“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of\nAurors will be used to transfer the boy —”\nVoldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at\nonce, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.\n“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”\n“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, accord-\ning to the source, has been given every protection that the Order\nand Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little\nchance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course,\nthe Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us\nthe opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments\nto break through the rest.”\n“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight\nglinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by\nnext Saturday?”\nOnce again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.\n“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — with dif-\nficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in placing an Imperius\nCurse upon Pius Thicknesse.”\nMany of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neigh-\nbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the\nback.\n“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man.\nScrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One\nfailed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”\n“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as Head of the\nDepartment of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular\ncontact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads\n5\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nof all the other Ministry departments.

It will, I think, be easy now\nthat we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to\nsubjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring\nScrimgeour down.”\n“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has\nconverted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains\nunlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we\ncannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while\nhe travels.”\n“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed\ndetermined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have\nseveral people planted within the Department of Magical Trans-\nport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know\nimmediately.”\n“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any\nform of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry;\nthey mistrust everything to do with the place.”\n“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the\nopen. Easier to take, by far.”\nAgain, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he\nwent on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too\nmany mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them\nhave been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than\nto his triumphs.”\nThe company around the table watched Voldemort apprehen-\nsively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might\nbe blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, how-\never, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them,\nstill addressing the unconscious body above him.\n6\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DARK LORD\nASCENDING\n“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and\nchance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know bet-\nter now. I understand those things that I did not understand before.\nI must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”\nAt these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail\nsounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of\nthose at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had\nseemed to issue from below their feet.\n“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet,\nthoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving\nbody above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner\nquiet?”\n“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table,\nwho had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at\nfirst glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and\nscurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious\ngleam of silver.\n“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the\ntense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need,\nfor instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill\nPotter.”\nThe faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have\nannounced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms."

Lucius, I see no\nreason for you to have a wand anymore.”\nLucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy\nin the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he\nspoke, his voice was hoarse.\n“My Lord?”\n7\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\n“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”\n“I . . .”\nMalfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight\nahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down\nher back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his\nwrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew\na wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front\nof his red eyes, examining it closely.\n“What is it?”\n“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.\n“And the core?”\n“Dragon — dragon heartstring.”\n“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and com-\npared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement;\nfor a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Volde-\nmort’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed\nby Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.\n“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”\nSome of the throng sniggered.\n“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for\nyou? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than\nhappy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that\ndispleases you, Lucius?”\n“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!”\n“Such lies, Lucius . . .”\nThe soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had\nstopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shud-\nder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard\nsliding across the floor beneath the table.\n8\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DARK LORD\nASCENDING\nThe huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair.\nIt rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s\nshoulders: its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their\nvertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature\nabsently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\n“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my re-\nturn, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire\nfor so many years?”\n“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he\nwiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”\nTo Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted\nfrom Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who\nhad been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at\nVoldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact."

To his right, his son, Draco, who\nhad been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at\nVoldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.\n“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice\nconstricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our\nfamily’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”\nShe sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair\nand heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where\nNarcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort,\nfor mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.\n“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little\nto one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal,\nBellatrix, from you.”\nHer face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of\ndelight.\n“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”\n“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event\nthat, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”\n9\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nShe stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.\n“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”\n“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and\nNarcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You\nmust be so proud.”\nThere was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table.\nMany leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped\nthe table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance,\nopened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did\nnot hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ hu-\nmiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had\nturned an ugly, blotchy red.\n“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring\nof mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister\nsince she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with\neither of us, nor any beast she marries.”\n“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice\nwas quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you\nbabysit the cubs?”\nThe hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father,\nwho was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s\neye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her\nown deadpan stare at the opposite wall.\n“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake.\n“Enough.”\nAnd the laughter died at once.\n“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over\ntime,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.\n10\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DARK LORD\nASCENDING\n“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away\nthose parts that threaten the health of the rest.”\n“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears\nof gratitude again. “At the first chance!”\n“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in"

The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle\nagainst invisible bonds.\n“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.\nSnape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death\nEaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been\ngiven permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the fire-\nlight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus!\nHelp me!”\n“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.\n“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout\nwith his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that\nthe woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.\n“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For\nthose of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity\nBurbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witch-\ncraft and Wizardry.”\nThere were small noises of comprehension around the table. A\nbroad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.\n“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and\n11\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nwizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from\nus . . .”\nOne of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage re-\nvolved to face Snape again.\n“Severus . . . please . . . please . . .”\n“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand,\nand Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting\nand polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor\nBurbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily\nProphet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowl-\nedge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor\nBurbage, a most desirable circumstance. . . . She would have us all\nmate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves. . . .”\nNobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and\ncontempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage\nrevolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her\nhair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly\naway from him again.\n“Avada Kedavra.”\nThe flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room.\nCharity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which\ntrembled and creaked.

Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the frag-\nments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the\nalready crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he\ntramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.\nIt was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had\nfour days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to ad-\nmit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated\nhim. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came\n13\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\nto think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this\nseemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental\nnote to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet\npaper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to\nhis bedroom and slamming the door behind him.\nHarry had spent the morning completely emptying his school\ntrunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the\nstart of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off\nthe topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated\nthem, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills,\ndesiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previ-\nously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a\nstabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn\nit to see a lot of blood.\nHe now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside\nthe trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retriev-\ning an old badge that flickered feebly between S CEDRIC\nUPPORT\nDIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneak-\noscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had\nbeen hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done\nthe damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long frag-\nment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had\ngiven him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk\nfor the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift\nexcept powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris\nlike glittering grit.\nHarry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had\ncut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected"

Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak\nof the sad business, though many attempted to make\nhim do so.

By the end of\nhis first year he would never again be known as the\nson of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less\nthan the most brilliant student ever seen at the school.\nThose of us who were privileged to be his friends ben-\nefited from his example, not to mention his help and\nencouragement, with which he was always generous.\nHe confessed to me in later life that he knew even\nthen that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.\nHe not only won every prize of note that the school\noffered, he was soon in regular correspondence with\nthe most notable magical names of the day, including\nNicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda\nBagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waf-\nfling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers\nfound their way into learned publications such as\nTransfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and\nThe Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career\nseemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question\nthat remained was when he would become Minister\nof Magic.

They rubbed along\nas comfortably as two such different boys could do.\nIn fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that\nliving in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an alto-\ngether comfortable experience.

However, tragedy inter-\nvened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother,\nKendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole\nbreadwinner, of the family. I postponed my depar-\nture long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s\nfuneral, then left for what was now to be a solitary\njourney. With a younger brother and sister to care\nfor, and little gold left to them, there could no longer\nbe any question of Albus accompanying me.\nThat was the period of our lives when we had least\ncontact.

Immersed in\nmy own experiences, it was with horror that I heard,\ntoward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another\ntragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of\nhis sister, Ariana.\nThough Ariana had been in poor health for a long\ntime, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their\nmother, had a profound effect on both of her broth-\ners. All those closest to Albus — and I count my-\nself one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana’s\ndeath, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility\nfor it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their\nmark upon him forevermore.\nI returned home to find a young man who had\nexperienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus\nwas more reserved than before, and much less light-\nhearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana\nhad led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus\nand Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time\nthis would lift — in later years they reestablished,\nif not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial\none.)

I shall miss his friendship more\nthan I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to\nthe Wizarding world’s.

Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s\nchildhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as\nHarry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea\nof a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a\nstupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\nHe had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No\ndoubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it\nhad been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in\nthat legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought\nto ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his\nother famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry,\nHarry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to\nHarry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and\nso uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when\nhe had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though\nthe only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was\nalso the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered\nhonestly:\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\n“I?

It was\nonly now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed.\nAcross the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was\nset over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:\nDUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST?\nComing next week, the shocking story of the flawed\ngenius considered by many to be the greatest wizard\nof his generation.

WHAT was the real purpose of the secret\norganization known as the Order of the Phoenix?\nHOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?\nThe answers to these and many more questions\nare explored in the explosive new biography, The\nLife and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter,\n22\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nIN MEMORIAM\nexclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page\n13, inside.\nHarry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen.

I’m sure\nmy book will be the first of very, very many.”\nSkeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her\nnine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four\nweeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious death in June.\nI ask her how she managed this superfast feat.\n“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as\nI have, working to a deadline is second nature.

Harry’s favorite\nmoment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dud-\nley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had\nbeen unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and\ncollapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.\n“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pac-\ning up and down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I\n— are in danger. From — from —”\n“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.\n“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt\n31\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nin front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all\nover, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”\n“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”\n“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead\nstarting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around\nhere! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit\nof hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your\nname and —”\n“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this"

Are you actually as stupid as you look?”\n“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon\nwaved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed,\nas nothing to the danger he had spotted.\n“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a\nhouse, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one?\nAll the happy memories?”\nThere was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his\nuncle with this argument.\n“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that\nthis Lord Thing —”\n“— Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through\nthis about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dum-\nbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley —”\nVernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed\nthat his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unan-\nnounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully\ngrown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt\nand Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the\n32\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DURSLEYS\nDEPARTING\nDursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had\nonce demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not\nhave been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.\n“— Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry\npressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm\nthat keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me.\nThe Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you\nto try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you\nhostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”\nUncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that\ninstant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Ver-\nnon walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding\nand the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection,\nthe best there is.”\nUncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down.\nOutside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door\nneighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.\n“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Durs-\nley abruptly.\n“There is,” said Harry, surprised.\n“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as\ninnocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked\nman, we ought to qualify for government protection!”\nHarry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical\nof his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this\nworld that he despised and mistrusted.\n“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied.\n“We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”\n33\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nUncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heav-"

This ques-\ntion had also been addressed half a dozen times.\n“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley is\nprotecting the Mug — I mean, your Prime Minister.”\n“Exactly — he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the\nblank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the\nnews, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as\nhe visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered\nthe knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reas-\nsuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys\nto take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with\nany other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him\nwith his earring in.\n“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus\nDiggle are more than up to the job —”\n“If we’d even seen CVs . . .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost\npatience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now point-\ning at the TV set himself.\n“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions\nand derailments and whatever else has happened since we last\nwatched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he’s be-\nhind it — Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills\n34\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DURSLEYS\nDEPARTING\nMuggles for fun.

With his par-\nents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and\nasked, “There are . . . more of them?”\n“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you\nmean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by\nthis time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair —”\n“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made\nyour point —”\n“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them —\nDeath Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi — which means dead\nbodies enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and\nwill certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried\nto outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you need help.”\nThere was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid\nsmashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through\nthe intervening years.

I don’t suppose\nthose things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards —”\n“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and\nkill you like they did my parents!”\n“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these\nOrder people.”\n“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talk-\ning sense.”\nHe knew that the battle was won.

Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.\n“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none\nof the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of part-\ning — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was\none that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was\nnevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to\none another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?\nBack in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack,\nthen poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.\nThey fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.\n“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll\nbe able to fly again.”\nThe doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his\nroom and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus\nto cope with the Dursleys on their own.\n“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry\nhad opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping\nhim a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”\n“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and em-\nbarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of\nyou to do this. . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and\ncousin. . . .”\n“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus hap-\npily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all\nhappy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of\nmind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch\nand wizard.\n36\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DURSLEYS\nDEPARTING\n“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent!

Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!”\nspluttered Uncle Vernon.\n“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be ut-\nterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus.\nHe was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon\nDursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every\nword Dedalus spoke.\n“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache\nrippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia\nseemed to hear him.\n“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard.\nThere has been a little change in the arrangements —”\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was\ngoing to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”\n“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”\nThe Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter\nincomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched,\n“Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing that\nthe voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.\n“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said\n37\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nDedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist-\ncoat. “We are attempting to time your departure from the house\nwith your family’s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at\nthe moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys.\n“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”\nNone of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, ap-\npalled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.\n“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured\nHestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain\nin the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, pos-\nsibly tearful farewells.\n“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any\nfurther explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,\n“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”\nHe swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the\nlast moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and\nbegan swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.\n“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp\nof her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.\nDudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly\najar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.\n“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.\nHe had already reached the living room door when Dudley mum-"

After several moments of apparently painful in-\nternal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”\nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other.

You and your aunt\nand uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full under-\nstanding that you’re never going to live together again, correct?”\nHarry nodded.\n“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the\ncharm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choos-\ning to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-\nWho to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.\n“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who\ndoesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail\n47\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\nto the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth.\nHowever, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just\nrely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of\nDeath Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So,\nwe’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw\nat them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to\nhide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,\nKingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still\nspot a gaping hole in the plan.\n“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the\nboundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house,\nyou’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”\n“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the\ntwelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of\nobvious once” — he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of\nus fly off toward Tonks’s parents’?”\n“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen\nof us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry\nPotters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a com-\npanion, each pair heading for a different safe house.”\nFrom inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what\nlooked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word;\nHarry understood the rest of the plan immediately.\n“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No\nway!”\n“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint\nof complacency."

The moment it\nmade contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke,\nthen, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.\n“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said\nHermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing"

It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron\nsmirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper\ncar. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet\nand rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely\nuncomfortable.\n“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious\nto Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle,\nwhich creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a\nfew tricks up its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.”\nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speed-\nometer.\n“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing\nbeside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was\nadvisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”\n“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want\nus all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the\ndiversion’s lost.”\nEverybody mounted their brooms.\n“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a\nfurtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side\n54\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SEVEN POTTERS\nof her waist.

Around him\nbrooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral\nflicked past.

He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was\nparamount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people\nmoving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring\noff into the distance, but he could not tell who they were —\n“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled\nover the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ram-\nming Hedwig’s cage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was\ndead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”\n“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and\nhe opened the throttle.\n“Stop — STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back again\ntwo jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had\nbroken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for\nHagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were\nkeeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry\nhad to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around\nhe cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand,\ncleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scat-\ntered to avoid it.\n“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry\nlooked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into\na green button near the fuel gauge.\n56\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SEVEN POTTERS\nA wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe.

Not only did they\nswerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their\nunconscious friend had caught up.

He pulled hard\nat the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but\nwith an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, he smashed into a\nmuddy pond.\n62\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R F I V E\nFALLEN WARRIOR\nH\nagrid?”\nHarry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of\nmetal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches\nof muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not understand\nwhere Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the\ndarkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling\ndown his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond\nand stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was\nHagrid.\n“Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me —”\nBut the dark mass did not stir.\n“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”\nHarry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted,\n“They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”\nHarry’s head was swimming.\n“Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.\n63\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nThe next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt\nlike cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm.\nHis missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was\nstill throbbing.\n“Hagrid?”\nHe opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an un-\nfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short\ndistance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was\nwatching Harry anxiously.\n“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now.\nHow are you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve fixed your ribs,\nyour tooth, and your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s\nfather.”\nHarry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and\nhe felt sick and giddy.\n“Voldemort —”\n“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoul-\nder and pushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty\ncrash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong"

Something go wrong\nwith the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and\nhis Muggle contraptions?”\n“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death\nEaters, loads of them — we were chased —”\n“Death Eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death\nEaters? I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight,\nI thought —”\n“They knew,” said Harry.\nTed Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through\nit to the sky above.\n64\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFALLEN WARRIOR\n“Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They\nshouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any\ndirection.”\nNow Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had\nbeen at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the\nOrder’s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He\nimagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke,\nlooking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great\ntransparent bubble.\nHe swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with\nhis own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had\nbarely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed\nthrough it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but\nmiraculously alive.\n“Harry!”\nKnocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered\nthe floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug\nthat nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did\nyeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners.”\n“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe —”\nHarry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered\nthe room behind Hagrid.\n“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it\nwas empty.\n“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm.\n“It fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re\nshouting at.”\n“Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.”\nAs she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance\n65\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nto her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a\nlight, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless,\nshe looked a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation.\n“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you\nwere ambushed; where is Nymphadora?”\n“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to\nanyone else.”\nShe and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped\nHarry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died,\nit was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given\nthem his hair. . . .\n“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got"

The Portkey’s through\nhere,” he added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes,\nif you want to take it.”\n“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto\nhis shoulders. “I —”\nHe looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of\nfear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly respon-\nsible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and\ninsincere.\n“I’ll tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she . . . Thanks\nfor patching us up, thanks for everything. I —”\nHe was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short\nhallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low\nto avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.\n66\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFALLEN WARRIOR\n“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”\nMr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying\non the dressing table.\n“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready\nto leave.\n“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s\nHedwig?”\n“She . . . she got hit,” said Harry.\nThe realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as\nthe tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one\ngreat link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to\nreturn to the Dursleys.\nHagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on\nthe shoulder.\n“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great old\nlife —”\n“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed\nbright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.\nWith a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line\nhad dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spin-\nning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid\nhurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed\nonto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of\nthe Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing\nhairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley\nand Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who\nhad also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.\n“Harry?

He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for\ninformation at once.\n“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed\ntheir Portkey, it came back without them,” she said, pointing at\na rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. “And that one,” she\npointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s,\nthey were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,”\nshe checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin ought\nto be back in about a minute.”\nMrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she\nhanded to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in\none.\n“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.\n68\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFALLEN WARRIOR\nA blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and\nbrighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling.\nHarry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin\nwas supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was\ncovered in blood.\nHarry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and\nLupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the\nsitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell\nacross George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched:\nOne of George’s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck\nwere drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.\nNo sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin\ngrabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently,\nback into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his\nbulk through the back door.\n“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!”\nLupin ignored him.\n“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter\nvisited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake.\n“Answer me!”"

Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight\nand the only people who could have told him were directly involved\nin the plan. You might have been an impostor.”\n“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling\nto fit through the door.\n69\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The\nPolyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.”\n“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were mov-\ning tonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could\nnot believe it of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me\ntoward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning.\nIf he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was\nthe one with Hagrid.”\n“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What\nhappened? How did you escape?”\nHarry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had\nseemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had aban-\ndoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who\nhad appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary\nof Tonks’s parents.\n“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”\n“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like\na blur of panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know,\nthe bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to\nDisarm him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing,\ndoes he? He must be Imperiused!”\nLupin looked aghast.\n“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to\ncapture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”\n“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned\nhim and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada\nKedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,”\nHarry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering\n70\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFALLEN WARRIOR\nHufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to\nteach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.\n“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great num-\nber of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it\nwas a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of death.\nRepeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed\nor heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!”\n“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry\nangrily."

Expelliar-\nmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is\nyour signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”\nLupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a\ngrain of defiance inside him.\n“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,”\nsaid Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”\nLupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through\nthe door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed\nbeneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry ad-\ndressed Lupin again.\n“Will George be okay?”\nAll Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the\nquestion.\n“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not\nwhen it’s been cursed off —”\nThere was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door;\nHarry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.\n71\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTwo figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward\nthem he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal\nappearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermi-\none flung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure\nat the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw\nhim raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.\n“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?”\n“‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,’” said Lupin\ncalmly.\nKingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him,\nI’ve checked!”\n“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back be-\nneath his cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew\nit was tonight!”\n“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize\nthat there would be seven Harrys.”\n“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?”\n“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”\nHermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.\n“What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley.\n“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley\nreeled off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase\nhalfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can —”\n“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and\nme.”\n“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t un-\nderstand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”\n“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin.\n“Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?”\n72"

Sectumsempra was always a\nspeciality of Snape’s.

Where was Ron? Where\nwere Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-\nEye, and Mundungus?\n“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in\nwhich he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled\nhim free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into\nthe sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending\nto George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by\nthe lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George’s ear\nhad been.\n“How is he?”\nMrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back,\nnot when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been\nso much worse. . . . He’s alive.”\n73\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”\n“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked.\n“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry.\n“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other;\nHarry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much\nthat Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse\nthere was a great crash from the kitchen.\n“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back\noff if you know what’s good for you!”\nHarry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He\nburst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his\nspectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.\n“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!”\n“How is he?”\nMr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first\ntime since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words.\nHe gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could\nnot believe what he was seeing."

Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief:\nShe had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his\nprotégée at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on\nthe floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his\neyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.\nBill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-\nwhisky and some glasses.\n“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full\nglasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thir-\nteenth aloft. “Mad-Eye.”\n“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank.\n“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.\nThe firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling\nback into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, fir-\ning him with something that was like courage.\n“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his\nown glass in one.\nThe atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watch-\ning Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and\nslightly afraid of what they might hear."

But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there\nwould be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared,\nand in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that\nlittle bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential\npoint? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that.

It was enough to make anyone panic.”\n79\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,”\nsniffed Tonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with\nthe toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and\nwhen Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .”\n“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does\nnot explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does eet?\nSomebody must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an\noutsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not\nze ’ole plan.”\nShe glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beau-\ntiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did.\nThe only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping\nfrom behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had\njust risked his own life to save Harry’s — Hagrid, whom he loved,\nwhom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort\ncrucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. . . .\n“No,” Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised:\nThe firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean . . . if\nsomebody made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip,\nI know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated,\nagain a little louder than he would usually have spoken. “We’ve got\nto trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think anyone in this\nroom would ever sell me to Voldemort.”\nMore silence followed his words. They were all looking at him;\nHarry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for\nsomething to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye.

He felt irrationally angry. He\nwanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down\nhis glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do.\nI can ask Kingsley whether —”\n“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”\n“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together.\n“Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”\n“Can’t it — ?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at\nBill.\n“Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took\nit?”\nNobody spoke.

My wand\nacted of its own accord.”\nAfter a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impos-\nsible, Harry.

Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione\nand Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.\n“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means\nI only need to stay here four days. Then I can —”\n“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the\nwedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”\nHarry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.\n“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.\n“Don’t they realize how important — ?”\n“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue.

Not Mum, though.\nShe’s determined.”\nRon’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch,\nMrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help\nidentify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out\nof his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off\nthe kitchen, she started.\n“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are drop-\nping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.\n“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah.

Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death\nof Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom\nDumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become\na Secret-Keeper in turn.\n“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the\npower of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities\nfor the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t\nexpect it to hold much longer.”\n“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by\nnow?” asked Harry.\n“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case\nhe turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to\nkeep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the\nplace, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep us-\ning the place as headquarters now that its protection has become\nso shaky.”\nThe kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to ma-\nneuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside\nGinny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made\nhim wish they had been separated by a few more people.

It’s\nkeeping a lot quiet these days.”\n“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage\nmagic I used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the\ntable to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.\n“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want\nme to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?”\n“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-\nKnow-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass\nbreakout.”\n“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his\nknife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand\nstood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.\n“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked\nRon angrily.\n“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied,"

The room was just as messy as it had\nbeen all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting\nin the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet,\nsorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into\ntwo enormous piles.\n“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.\n“And how did you manage to get away?”\n“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change\nthe sheets yesterday,” said Hermione.

He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to\nlaugh.\n“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why\nno one’s found him,” said Ron wisely.\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and\nburied in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody\nand stuffed him —”\n“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just\nin time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s\nSyllabary.\n“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp\nbed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —”\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off\nthe bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished\nin his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief\nthat he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out\nhis wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “Tergeo.”\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased\n94\n(cid:145) (cid:145)"

Ron got back\noff the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at\nHarry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not\nthink of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for\nRon to be teaching anyone else tact.\n“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t —”\n“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might\nhappen if we come with you?

He\nwas also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather\nthan distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.\n“He’s me, see?” said Ron.\n“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”\n“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said\nRon. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to\nthe ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.\n“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in\nmy room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it — well,\nit’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he\nnods a lot when you mention it.

His parents’ graves were only\npart of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling\nthat the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it\nwas there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that\nhe was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn\nto the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.\n“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping\na watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect\nyou to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go\nwherever you like?”\nThis had not occurred to Harry.

It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your\nsoul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”\nHarry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort\nmoving beyond “usual evil.”\n“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron\nasked.\n“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be ex-\ncruciatingly painful.”\n“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.\n“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve\ndone. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you.\nI can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?”\n“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how\nto destroy Horcruxes in that book?”\n“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examin-\ning rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they\nhave to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read,\nwhat Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof\nways of destroying a Horcrux.”\n“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.\n“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,”\nsaid Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”\n103\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIX\n“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently.\n“It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t re-\npair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly\nrare —\n“— phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.\n“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few\nsubstances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all danger-\nous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have\nto solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux\nwon’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”\n“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t\nthe bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”\n“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”\nSeeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermi-\none hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and\nran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”\n“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron.\nHarry laughed.\n“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens\nto your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione.\n“But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux.

Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the\nDarkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indig-\nnantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate\nFrog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry\ninstinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking\nup at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was\ncontorted with rage.\n“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her\nvoice trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are\n105\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIX\nwedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I\nwas under the impression that you had agreed to help.”\n“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her\nfeet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re\nsorry . . .”\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried\nout of the room after Mrs. Weasley.\n“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone,\nstill massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without\nthe job satisfaction.

Once they had all been deemed smart\nenough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the\nvisitors.\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty caul-\ndrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the\nback door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing\neither side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the\nleaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens\nhad been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden\n106\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS\nhad been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry,\nwho liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather for-\nlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been\nplaced upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all\nhe knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel\nby magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone\nto meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to\narrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusu-\nally high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr.\nWeasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage\nand leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes,\nwho could only be Fleur’s mother.\n“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he\nwas a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black\nbeard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs.\nWeasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek,\nleaving her flustered.\n“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur\ntells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.”\n“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trou-\nble at all!”\nRon relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was\npeering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.\n“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s\nhand between his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most\nhonored at the approaching union of our two families!

Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years\nold, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs.\nWeasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glow-\ning look, batting her eyelashes.

He was lying again on the camp bed in\nRon’s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was\nstill shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny\nwing. The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling.\n“You were muttering in your sleep.”\n“Was I?”\n“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’”\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly\nblurred.\n“Who’s Gregorovitch?”\n111\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n“I dunno, do I?

He tried to\nremember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came\nback was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village\ncradled in a deep valley.\n“I think he’s abroad.”\n“Who, Gregorovitch?”\n“Voldemort.

However, Scrim-\ngeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak\nand drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid\nhad given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which\nhe unrolled and read aloud.\n“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian\nDumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are. . . . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I\nleave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when\nhe uses it.’”\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen be-\nfore: It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he\nknew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with\na simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Delumi-\nnator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking\nstunned.\n“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It"

Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design.\nWhy would he have left you an item so rare?”\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered.\n“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrim-\ngeour persevered. “Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are\nyou three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put\nhis Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?”\n“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do\nwith it?”\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron\nfor a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.\n“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales\n125\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nof Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and\ninstructive.’”\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as\nancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding\nwas stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrim-\ngeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it.\nHarry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read\nthem. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols.\n“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss\nGranger?” asked Scrimgeour.\n“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice,\nmopping her eyes with her sleeve.\n“But why that particular book?”\n“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”\n“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret mes-\nsages, with Dumbledore?”\n“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve.\n“And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in\nthirty-one days, I doubt that I will.”\nShe suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that\nRon had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s\nshoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will.\n“‘To Harry James Potter,’” he read, and Harry’s insides contracted\nwith a sudden excitement, “‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first\nQuidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perse-\nverance and skill.’”\nAs Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its\nsilver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling\na definite sense of anticlimax.\n126\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WILL OF\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.\n“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I sup-\npose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and\nwhatever it was.”\n“You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?”\n“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”"

Dusk was really falling outside now; the mar-\nquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.\n“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,”\nScrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?”\nHermione laughed derisively.\n“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s\nway too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from\nDumbledore hidden in the icing!”\n“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrim-\ngeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small\nobject. You know why, I’m sure?”\nHarry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought\nthat answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit\nshe could not suppress the urge.\n“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said.\n“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermi-\none’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.\n“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin\nbefore it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It\ncarries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to\nlay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” — he\nheld up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your touch, Potter.\n127\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nIt occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill,\nwhatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that\nit will open only for you.”\nHarry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrim-\ngeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare\nhand in front of the Minister?\n“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already\nknow what the Snitch contains?”\n“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch\nthe Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency,\nreally knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practi-\ncally hear her brain whirring beside him.\n“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly.\nHarry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option\nbut to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward\nagain and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s\npalm.\nNothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch,\nits tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Her-\nmione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball,\nas if still hoping it might transform in some way.\n“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermi-\none laughed.\n“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself\noff the sofa.\n“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now.\n“Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.”"

Harry looked around for a\nsign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the\nsword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too\nsmall to contain it.\n“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.\n“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumble-\ndore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important\nhistorical artifact, and as such, belongs —”\n“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was\nthe one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat —”\n“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present\nitself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not\nmake it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore\nmay have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek,\nscrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think — ?”\n“— Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry,\nstruggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look\nnice on my wall.”\n“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because\nDumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor\ncould defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that\nsword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one\ndestined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”\n“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking\na sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people\nonto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Delumina-\ntors or covering up breakouts from Azkaban.

Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He\nturned away without another word and limped from the room.

He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his\nneck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter\nfeebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside.\n“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of\nthe stairs.\n“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.\n“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Delumi-\nnator.”\nRon obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it.\nThe solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.\n“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could\nhave achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew\nback to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.\n“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what\nthey said, Dumbledore invented it himself!”\n“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will\njust to help us turn out the lights!”\n“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and\nexamine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.\n“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why\nhe was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .”\n132\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WILL OF\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n“. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?”\nasked Ron.\n“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales\nof Beedle the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on\nright under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us\nknow why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?”\n“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he\nwas mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry\nan old Snitch — what the hell was that about?”\n“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take\nit, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”\n“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the\nSnitch in his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of\nScrimgeour, was I?”\n“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.\n“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said\nHarry. “Don’t you remember?”\nHermione looked simply bemused.

I open at the close . . .”\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many\ndifferent inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning\nfrom them.\n“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last aban-\ndoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription.\n“Why did he want Harry to have the sword?”\n“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “It\nwas there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our\ntalks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give\nit to me then?”\nHe felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a ques-\ntion he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain\nslow and unresponsive.

Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius\nLovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?”\nshe barked at Harry.\n“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.”\n“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter\nhere? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours,\nRonald, or have you merely been boasting?”\n“No — he couldn’t come —”\n“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in\npress photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how\nbest to wear my tiara,” she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you\nknow, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a good-looking\ngirl, but still — French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald,\nI am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too\nlong.”\n141\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nRon gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reap-\npear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had\nshown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly\nfull now, and for the first time there was no queue outside.\n“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his\nsleeve. “She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank\nGod, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dung-\nbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have writ-\nten them out of her will — like they care, they’re going to end up\nricher than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he\nadded, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward\nthem. “You look great!”\n“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled.\nShe was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high\nheels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t\nagree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara.\nShe said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture\nand skinny ankles.’”\n“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron.\n“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the\nmarquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided.\nOld bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a\nright laugh at weddings.”\n“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours\nlater?” asked Hermione.\n“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded\nGeorge."

As she scram-\nbled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you were —\ngoodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you?”\nRon’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s\ninvitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too\nloudly, “How come you’re here?”\n“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised.\nHarry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then,\nfeeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicin-\nity, offered to show him his seat.\n“Your friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as they entered\nthe now packed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a\nglance at Harry’s red curly hair.\n“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening.\nHis appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela\ncousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people\nwere still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Her-\nmione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.\n143\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run\nover by the bride.”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row\nbehind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s\nears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry,\n“Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?”\nHarry gave a noncommittal grunt.\nA sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the gen-\neral murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter.\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at\nrelatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-\ncolored robes with a matching hat.\nA moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the mar-\nquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their but-"

Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled\nfrom what seemed to be the golden balloons.\n“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look\nat the entrance.\nA great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and\nwizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle,\nFleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur\nwas wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a\nstrong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone\nelse by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny\nand Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier\nthan usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as\nthough he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with\n144\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WEDDING\na slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who\nhad presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill\nand Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of\ntwo faithful souls . . .”\n“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said Auntie Muriel\nin a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far\ntoo low cut.”\nGinny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly\nfaced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the\nmarquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts\nof the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always\nseemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shin-\ning hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-\nshaped scar on his forehead. . . .\n“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle . . . ?”\nIn the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both\nsobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the\nback of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one\nof his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and\nbeamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.\n“. . . then I declare you bonded for life.”\nThe tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of\nBill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling\naround their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round\nof applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise\nand tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their\nsongs and chimes to the din.\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired wizard. “If you\nwould please stand up!”\n145\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nThey all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his\nwand again.

The seats on which they had been sitting rose grace-\nfully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so\nthat they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with\na glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside.\nNext, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to\nform a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped them-\nselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated grace-\nfully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped\ntoward a podium.\n“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all\nsides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and\nfirewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.\n“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing\non tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid\na crowd of well-wishers.\n“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butter-\nbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop\nhold, let’s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel —”\nRon led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and\nright as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for\nKrum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee,\nmost of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where\nLuna sat alone.\n“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.\n“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and\nFleur our present.”\n“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron.\nHermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry\n146\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WEDDING\ninstead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation\nfor a few moments.\nThe band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor\nfirst, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Dela-\ncour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father.\n“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike\ntune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance\nfloor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and\nwaving her arms.\n“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good\nvalue.”\nBut the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had\ndropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flus-\ntered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a\nscowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?”\n“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,”\nsaid Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about\nto laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and\ndance,” he added abruptly to Hermione."

The strange\ntriangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong\nwith it?”\n“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.”\n“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?”\n“Exactly.”\nKrum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said,\n“Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of\ncourse, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared\nDumbledore — and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this” —\nhe pointed a finger at Xenophilius — “this is his symbol, I recognized\nit at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he\nvos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes,\nthinking to shock, make themselves impressive — until those of us\nwho had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.”\nKrum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophil-\nius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s\nfather was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent\nseemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape.\n“Are you — er — quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s — ?”\n“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign\nfor several years, I know it vell.”\n“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t\nactually know what the symbol means.

He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it\nmenacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end.\n“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry\nwas too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the\nsight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it care-\nfully before the Triwizard Tournament.\n“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously.\n“He’s a wandmaker!”\n“I know that,” said Krum.\n“He made your wand! That’s why I thought — Quidditch —”\nKrum was looking more and more suspicious.\n“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?”\n“I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a — a fan\nmagazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified.\n149\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he\nsaid.\n“So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?”\nKrum looked puzzled.\n“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a\nGregorovitch vand. They are the best — although I know, of course,\nthat you Britons set much store by Ollivander.”\nHarry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like\nKrum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for\na celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a\nreason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the\nnight that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly\nand phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some-\nthing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would\nGregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Olli-\nvander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?\n“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his\nsurroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined\nLuna. “She is also a relative of yours?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone.\nJealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.”\nKrum grunted.\n“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again,\n“is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the\ngood-looking girls are taken?”\nAnd he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a pass-\ning waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance\nfloor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but\nRon was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor."

As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under\nthe canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became\nmore and more uncontained.

His cloud of white hair\nmade him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped\nby a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains,\nHarry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the\nOrder of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’s obituary.\nHarry approached him.\n“May I sit down?”\n“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched,\nwheezy voice.\nHarry leaned in.\n“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.”\nDoge gasped.\n151\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n“My dear boy!

All most suspicious,\nLancelot thought!”\nDoge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who\nseemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for\nmore champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had\nonce shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for\nthe crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the\nsame fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had\nDumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts,\nto prove himself brilliant and talented?\n“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have\nsaid that it was she who finished off Ariana —”\n“How can you, Muriel?” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own\ndaughter? Think what you are saying!”\n“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daugh-\nter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as\nI say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana — of what,\nnobody ever seemed sure —”\n“Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,” said Doge with a brave\nattempt at scorn. “Why not?”\n“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and\nkilled Kendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully.\n“Shake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral,\nwere you not?”\n156\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WEDDING\n“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a more desper-\nately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken —”\n“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’s\nnose halfway through the service?”\nIf Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he\nlooked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and\ntook another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.\n“How do you — ?” croaked Doge.\n“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie\nMuriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while\nI was listening at the door.

A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda\ntold it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’s fault that Ariana\nwas dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda,\nAlbus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself,\nAlbus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands\ntied behind his back.”\nMuriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old\nscandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry\ndid not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth,\nand yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had\nbeen ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not\nhave intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house,\nand yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.\n“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly\nas she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to\nRita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an impor-\ntant source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows she was\nthere all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!”\n“Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.\n157\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of\nMagic?”\nThe name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s text-\nbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most\nattentively.\n“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drown-\ning man at a life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old\nfriend of Albus’s.”\n“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheer-\nfully.\n“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have\ntaken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed\non anything Bathilda may have said!”\n“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita\nSkeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel. “But even if Bathilda’s\ncompletely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe\neven letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth\na trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.”\nHarry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge\nbanged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Mu-\nriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again,\nhe asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?”\n“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there\nafter Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.”\n“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?”\n“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily.\nHarry felt drained, empty.

Were Lily and James buried close to\n158\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WEDDING\nDumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their\ngraves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had\nnever once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . .\nAnd why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to\nhimself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him\nthat they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared\nahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and\ndid not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until\nshe drew up a chair beside him.\n“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping off one of\nher shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to\nfind more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming\naway from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing —” She\ndropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?”\nHarry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter. At\nthat moment, something large and silver came falling through the\ncanopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed\nlightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as\nthose nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus’s\nmouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of\nKingsley Shacklebolt.\n“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.”\n159\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R N I N E\nA PLACE TO HIDE\nE\nverything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped\nto their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only\njust realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still\nturning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward\nin cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then\nsomebody screamed.\nHarry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd.\nGuests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating;\nthe protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken.\n“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?”\nAs they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw\ncloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw\nLupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout,\n“Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides —\n“Ron!

He caught hold of Hermione’s free\narm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were ex-\ntinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was\nHermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away\nfrom the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away,\nperhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . .\n“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.\nHarry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not\nleft the wedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by\npeople.\n“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk,\nwe need to find somewhere for you to change.”\nHarry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide\ndark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed\nshops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by\nand a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry\nand Ron were still wearing dress robes.\n“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her,\nas a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.\n“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?”\nsaid Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept\nit on me and —”\n“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,”\nsaid Hermione. “Just try and act naturally until — this will do.”\nShe led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shad-\nowy alleyway.\n161\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\n“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .” said Harry,\nfrowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small\nbeaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.\n“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s ut-\nter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some\nmaroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.\n“How the ruddy hell — ?”\n“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I\nthink I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need\nin here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed\nlike a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside\nit. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I\nhad them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you’d better\ntake the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .”\n“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his\nrobes.\n“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days,\nyou know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway.

I just had a feeling. . . .”\n“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-\nup robes.\n“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she\npushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!”\nHarry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and\npulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just\nbeginning to appreciate what had happened.\n“The others — everyone at the wedding —”\n162\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE\n“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you\nthey’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger\nby going back.”\n“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was\nabout to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order\nwas there, they’ll look after everyone.”\nHarry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him,\nand said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like\nacid in his stomach.\n“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione.\nThey moved back up the side street and onto the main road again,\nwhere a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving\nacross the pavement.\n“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron\nasked Hermione.\n“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer\nout in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.”\n“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit\n— exposed?”\n“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on\nthe other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. “We can\nhardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld\nPlace is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my\nparents’ house, though I think there’s a chance they might check\nthere. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!”\n“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pave-\nment was yelling. “Fancy a drink?

A light layer of grease\nlay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty.\nHarry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite\nHermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it:\nShe glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a\ntwitch.

Beneath the Cloak he could feel the\nlast vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their\nusual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and\nput them on again.\nAfter a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from\nthe Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross —”\n“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once.\n“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!”\n“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry,\nwhat else do we need to know?”\n“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!”\nThey relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress\nshuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry\nwas invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of\nburly workmen entered the café and squeezed into the next booth.\nHermione dropped her voice to a whisper.\n“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the coun-\ntryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.”\n“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron.\n“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione.\n164\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE\n“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they\nmight’ve been arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added\nafter one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard;\nshe shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new cus-\ntomers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and\nquite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away.\nShe stared, affronted.\n“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron.\n“Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?”\n“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to\nthe Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermi-\none, reaching for her beaded bag.\nThe two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mir-\nrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew\ntheir wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going\non, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her\nbench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall\nwhere Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled,\n“Stupefy!”\nThe great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red\nlight: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable\nto see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black\nropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot — the\nwaitress screamed and ran for the door — Harry sent another Stun-\nning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up\nRon, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the\nwaitress, who collapsed in front of the door."

Hermione crawled\nout from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of\nher hair and trembling all over.\n“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in\npain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut.\n“Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!”\nThe severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms\nto regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed\nover all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled\nacross the bench.\n“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore\ndied,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot;\nthe man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted\nposters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.”\n“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysteri-\ncally. “How did they find us? What are we going to do?”\nSomehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.\n“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.”\nHe looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the\nlock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the café into\ndarkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione\nearlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.\n“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry\n166\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE\nthrough the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill\nus. They had a good go just now.”\nHermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook\nhis head.\n“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better\nlike that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be\nobvious we were here.”\n“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But\nI’ve never done a Memory Charm.”\n“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.”\nShe took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolo-\nhov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.”\nAt once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.\n“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of\nthe other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.”"

Number twelve was visible to them, for they had\nbeen told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they\nrushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not be-\ning followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry\ntapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of\nmetallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open\nwith a creak and they hurried over the threshold.\nAs Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas\nlamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the\nhallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed,\nthe outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shad-\nows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of\nSirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s\nleg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just\nknocked it over again.\n“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, point-\ning toward it.\n169\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\n“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured\nback.\n“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry\nasked.\n“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.\nYet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against\nthe door, scared to move farther into the house.\n“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step\nforward.\n“Severus Snape?”\nMad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making\nall three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked\nHarry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his\ntongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak.\nBefore he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue\nhad unraveled again.\nThe other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant\nsensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered,\n“That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set\nup for Snape!”\nGingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted\nin the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could\nsay another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-\ncolored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black,\nher curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them,\nfaster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it,\nits face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar,\ndreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.\n170\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE"

Just some-\nthing to scare Snape.”\nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted\nthe horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumble-\ndore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-\nexpecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except\nfor a mouse skittering along the skirting board.\n“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered\nHermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.”\nNothing happened.\n“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was\nthat supposed to do?”\n171\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\n“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly.\n“That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody\nhere except us!”\n“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from\nwhich the corpse-figure had risen.\n“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same\nspot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room\non the first floor.\nHermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then,\nshivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her\narms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and\nmoved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch.\n“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if\nHarry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know\nthey can’t get in the house, but — what’s up, Harry?”\nHarry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned again as some-\nthing flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a\nlarge shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through\nhis body, violent and brief as an electric shock.\n“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you"

Was he cursing someone?”\n“No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell —”\nHarry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she\nsaid in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I\nthought that connection had closed!”\n“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful,\n172\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE\nwhich made it hard to concentrate. “I — I think it’s started opening\nagain whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to —”\n“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly.\n“Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he\nwanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use\nOcclumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your\nmind, remember —”\n“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth;\nhe did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used\nthis selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor\nthat it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had not told\nthem what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threaten-\ning, as though he were pressing against the window of the room,\nand still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was\nlike resisting the urge to be sick.\nHe turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to exam-\nine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Her-\nmione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see\na silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land\nupon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel\nthat spoke with the voice of Ron’s father.\n“Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.”\nThe Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise be-\ntween a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione\njoined him, gripping his arm.\n“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half\nlaughed and hugged her.\n“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I —”\n“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head.\n173\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\n“It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way.” He\nthought of Ginny. “I do feel the same way.”\nThe pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done\nin the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, “I don’t\nwant to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought\nand camp in here tonight?”\nHe heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer:\nHe had to succumb."

You called\nme back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again?\nDraco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or\nfeel my wrath yourself!”\nA log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a\nterrified, pointed white face — with a sense of emerging from deep\nwater, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.\nHe was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose\ninches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large\nbathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded\n174\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nA PLACE TO HIDE\non the inside of his eyes.

Could Dum-\nbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley,\ncontent to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him?\nCould he have turned his back on a sister who was being impris-\noned and hidden?\nHarry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had\nnever mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left with-\nout explanation in Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in\nthe darkness. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn’t he\nexplained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or\nhad Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed,\nbut not trusted, never confided in?\nHarry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter\nthoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distrac-\ntion, he slipped out of his sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and\ncrept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and\nstarted to climb the stairs by wandlight.\nOn the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron\nhad slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The ward-\nrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back.\nHarry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody\nhad searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps\nMundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before\nand after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that\n177\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\nsometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-\ngrandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of\nmuddy backdrop.

The room was\nspacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large\nbed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured\nby long velvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust\nwith candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging\nin frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the\nwalls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web stretched between\nthe chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as\nHarry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of dis-\nturbed mice.\nThe teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many post-"

Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way\nto annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners,\nfaded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference from all the\nrest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle\nmotorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several\n178\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKREACHER’S TALE\nposters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were\nMuggles because they remained quite stationary within their pic-\ntures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in\ncontrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which was\na picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing\nat the camera.\nWith a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy\nblack hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses.\nBeside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face\nso much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To\nSirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and\nwatery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest\nof gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had\nbeen. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking,\nbut he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked\nand included . . . or was it simply because Harry knew how it had\nbeen, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from\nthe wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but\nit would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his\nparents from redecorating his room.\nHarry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was grow-\ning brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and\nsmall objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom\nhad been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been\njudged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had\nbeen shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers,\nand sundry pages littered the floor.\nHarry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and\n179\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\nexamined them. He recognized one as part of an old edition of\nA History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging\nto a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten\nand crumpled. He smoothed it out.\nDear Padfoot,\nThank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It\nwas his favorite by far.

He seized papers, treating them, in\nhis eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher;\nhe pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run\nhis hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed\nand armchair.\nAt last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like\na torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it\nout, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in\nher letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the pic-\nture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that\nmust have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked\nthe photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to\nlook for the second sheet.\nAfter another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to\nconclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone.

Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues\nas to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy\nbroomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death\nEaters. . . . The only potentially useful thing he could see here\nwas possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that\nDumbledore — what?\n“Harry? Harry! Harry!”\n“I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?”\nThere was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione\nburst inside.\n“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breath-\nlessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found\nhim!”\nRon’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.\n“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!”\n“Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did\nyou come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room.\n“What have you been doing?”\n“Look what I’ve just found.”\nHe held out his mother’s letter.

Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photo-\ngraph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out\nof the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on\ntheir chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the\nboy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark\nhair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller,\nslighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.\n“He played Seeker,” said Harry.\n187\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\n“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Vol-\ndemort’s press clippings.\n“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the\nSeeker . . . Never mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was\nlistening: Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the\nwardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places\nand approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before\nthem. The drawers’ contents had been turned over recently, the\ndust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-\nof-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a\nrecently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents\nof the drawer.\n“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky\nfingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!”\nNothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of\nthe faded curtains, looked disappointed.\n“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”\n“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,”\nsaid Hermione. “Charms to prevent it being summoned magically,\nyou know.”\n“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, re-\nmembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.\n“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron.\n“We search manually,” said Hermione.\n“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed\nhis examination of the curtains.\nThey combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but\nwere forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.\n188\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKREACHER’S TALE\nThe sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the\ngrimy landing windows."

He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had\nfirst met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry\nshowed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no\nmore than his outfit.\n“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed\n190\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKREACHER’S TALE\nlow, muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with\nthe blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood —”\n“I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘Mudblood,’”\ngrowled Harry.

Understand?”\n“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his\nlips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was\nnow forbidden to utter.\n“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against\nhis ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs.\nWe threw it out. Did you steal it back?”\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straight-\nened up to look Harry full in the face.

But here, Harry’s imagination could go\nno further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped.\n“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he\ndrank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of\nthe water and dragged Kreacher under the surface. . . .”\n“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised\nto hear himself whispering.\nKreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great,\nbloodshot eyes.\n194\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKREACHER’S TALE\n“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said.\n“I know — but how did you escape the Inferi?”\nKreacher did not seem to understand.\n“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated.\n“I know, but —”\n“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disappa-\nrated!”\n“But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said\nHarry, “otherwise Dumbledore —”\n“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron. “I mean,\nthey can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when\nwe can’t.”\nThere was silence as Harry digested this.

The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice\nasked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of\nthe hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.\n“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.\nThe jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was im-\npossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud\nit left behind.\nHarry pointed his wand into the middle of it.\n“Don’t move!”\nHe had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his\nyell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream,\n“Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house —”\nRon and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry,\nwands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with\nhis arms raised in the hall below.\n“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!”\n“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand\nat Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again\nand silence fell.

Wrapped in a thick black\ntraveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.\n“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked.\n“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”\n“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple\nof Death Eaters in the square outside —”\n“We know —”\n“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the\nfront door to be sure that they would not see me.

A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of\ncoziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden\ntable. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling\ncloak and they sat down.\n“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the\n204\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BRIBE\nDeath Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here\nafter the wedding?”\n“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters\nin a café on Tottenham Court Road.”\nLupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.\n“What?”\nThey explained what had happened; when they had finished,\nLupin looked aghast.\n“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track\nanyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they\ndisappear!”\n“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Totten-\nham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry.\n“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could\nstill have the Trace on him?”\n“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely\nrelieved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was\nhere if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see\nhow they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s\nworrying, really worrying.”\nHe looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that\nquestion could wait.\n“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing\nsince Ron’s dad told us the family were safe.”\n“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most\nof the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.”\n“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected\nHermione.\n205\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing\nnow,” said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t\nknow you were there, Harry.

Arthur heard a rumor that they tried\nto torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed\nhim; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”\nHarry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected\nthe mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrim-\ngeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act\nhad been to try to protect Harry.\n“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lu-\npin went on. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close\n— and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours.\nThey were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course\nnobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.\n“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more\nDeath Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected\nhouse in the country. No deaths,” he added quickly, forestalling\nthe question, “but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus\nDiggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the\nCruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where\nyou went after you visited them. They’re all right — shaken, obvi-\nously, but otherwise okay.”\n“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?”\nHarry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the\nnight he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden.\n“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have\ngot the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin.\n“They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of\n206\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BRIBE\nidentification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive\nspell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely\nopen about why they’d come.”\n“And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s\nwhereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.\n“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy\nof the Daily Prophet.\n“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know\nsooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.”\nHarry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own\nface filled the front page. He read the headline over it:\nWANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT\nTHE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\nRon and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said noth-\ning. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any\nmore: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been\non top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really\nkilled him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding\nworld, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after\nDumbledore had fallen.\n“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.\n“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked\nHermione furiously.\nLupin nodded.\n“But surely people realize what’s going on?”\n“The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.\n207"

Effectively he is the Minister, but why\nshould he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse,\nis taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend\nhis power beyond the Ministry.\n“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There\nhas been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few\ndays, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it.\nHowever, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in\neach other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak\nout, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted.\nYes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game.

What’s Voldemort planning for\nHogwarts?” she asked Lupin.\n“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wiz-\nard,” he replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, be-\ncause it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch\nand wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their\nparents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if\nthey preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding\npopulation under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another\nway of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given\nBlood Status — meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that\nthey are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.”\nHarry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-\nyear-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-\nbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never\nsee their families again either.\n“It’s . . . it’s . . .” he muttered, struggling to find words that did\njustice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,\n“I know.”\nLupin hesitated.\n210\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BRIBE\n“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is\nunder the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.”\n“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it\nand they’re coming with me.”\n“Can you confide in me what the mission is?”\nHarry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but\ngraying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.\n“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry.

He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself\nand, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with\nthe thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”\nMundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione,\nhowever, was too quick for him.\n“Expelliarmus!”\nMundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it.\nWild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him\nand Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.\n“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself\nfrom Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on\nme, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go,\nor —”\n“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He\nthrew aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and\ndropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling\nand looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry\n219\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\npointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose.

Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s\nstudy — Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and\nRon jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room,\nshouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”\n“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must\nbe upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the\narticle about Snape.\n“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flit-\nwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore\ndied. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these\nCarrows?”\n“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside.\nThey were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore,\nso it’s all friends together. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing\nup a chair, “I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice\nbut to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be\na choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Az-\nkaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and\nprotect the students.”\nKreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his\n226\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMAGIC IS MIGHT\nhands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between\nhis teeth as he did so.\n“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as\nnot to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly\nwhere Snape is now.”\nHe began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s\ncooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given\nRegulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had\never tasted.\n“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he\ntold Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll\nmarch out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hog-\nwarts Express.”\nRon glanced at his watch.\n“I’ve been thinking about that all day.

He was sure Ginny, Neville,\nand Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wonder-\ning where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to\nundermine Snape’s new regime.\n“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I\nlanded badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.”\n“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around\nin his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in\nthe name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?”\n“I remembered this,” Hermione panted.\n227\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nShe was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered\nto the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen\nsideboard.

The painted image\nof Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in\nGrimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office\nat Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt\nsitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collec-\ntion of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the\nSorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of\nGryffindor.\n“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for\nhim,” Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. “But let\nhim try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside\nof my handbag.”\n“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed.\n“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her.\n“So, Harry, what else happened today?”\n“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven\nhours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.”\nRon nodded his appreciation of this news.

In the meantime, they returned to the basement\nkitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.\nThey did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours\ngoing over and over their plan until they could recite it, word per-\nfect, to each other.

Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators\n. . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles,\nNosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears . . .”\nThey gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher\nbowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie\nready for them when they returned.\n“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fan-\ntasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”\nThey made their way onto the front step with immense caution:\nThey could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the\nhouse from across the misty square.\nHermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for\nHarry.\nAfter the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry\nfound himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their\nplan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for\na couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually\nappear here until at least eight o’clock.\n“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to\nbe here in about five minutes.

The dark corridor\nbehind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an\nempty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make\nit look as though it was still closed.\n“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the\nalleyway, “we put on the Cloak again —”\n“— and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s head\nlike a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.\nLittle more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little\nMinistry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them,"

She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected\nwarmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her\nin the chest and she toppled over.\n“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a\nbin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak.\nTogether they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that\nled backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head\nand added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken\nfrom the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s\nhandbag.\n“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that iden-\ntified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Of-\nfice. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.”\n237\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nHe passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the\nletters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse.\nHermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant\nheliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double\nof Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put\nthem on, Harry checked his watch.\n“We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any\nsecond.”\nThey hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and\nRon threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione re-\nmained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and\na small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them.\n“Oh, hello, Mafalda.”\n“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you\ntoday?”\n“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked\nthoroughly downcast.\nAs Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry\nand Ron crept along behind them.\n“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the weather,” said Hermione,\ntalking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon\nhis problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street.\n“Here, have a sweet.”\n“Eh? Oh, no thanks —”\n“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles\nin his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.\nThe effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched\nhis tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did\n238\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMAGIC IS MIGHT\nnot even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top\nof his head.\n“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps\nyou’d better take the day off!”\n“No — no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his\nway despite being unable to walk straight. “I must — today — must\ngo —”"

Using a re-\npulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he\nturned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the\nbag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying\nchunks of vomit.\n“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid\nthe puddles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun\nhim too.”\n“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the\nwizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies\nwould have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t\nhe? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.”\nWithin two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety\nas the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been\nfolded in his bag.\n239\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much\nhe wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the\nlabel in the back.”\n“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the\nInvisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.”\nHe had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to\nHarry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the\ndoor concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione\nreappeared.\n“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several\ncurly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed!\nHere, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . .”\nShe pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for\nthem, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.\nOnce the painful transformation was complete he was more than\nsix feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms,\npowerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak\nand his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.\n“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now\ntowered over him.\n“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s\ngo, it’s nearly nine.”\nThey stepped out of the alleyway together.

Ron gave a forced\nchuckle.\n“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?”\nAnd he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.\nTo Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched\ndown and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just\nin time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door.\nHe looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.\n“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.\n“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep\nand gravelly.\nThey both stood up.

He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had\nzoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the\nMinistry of Magic.\nHe got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he\nwas accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry\nremembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of\nthe hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden\nfloor and walls.

Come\non, let’s get going.”\nThey joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward\nthe golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surrepti-\ntiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of\nDolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller\n242\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMAGIC IS MIGHT\nhall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles\nhousing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when\na voice said, “Cattermole!”\nThey looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the\nDeath Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding\ntoward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their\neyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The\nman’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his\nmagnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much\ngold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophan-\ntically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.\n“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out\nmy office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.”\nRon looked around as though hoping somebody else would in-\ntervene, but nobody spoke.\n“Raining . . . in your office? That’s — that’s not good, is it?”\nRon gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened.\n“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?”\nA pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and\nbustled off.\n“No,” said Ron, “no, of course —”\n“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your\nwife, Cattermole? In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there\nholding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad\njob, have you? Probably wise.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed\nthem: It was as if they were infectious.

The golden grilles clanged shut\nbehind him. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s\n246\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nanxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of\nher, Umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.\n“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of\nMagic.

Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide,\nopen space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small\ndesks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished\nand free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was\nquite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands\nin unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direc-\ntion like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that\nthere was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed\nthe same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that what\nhe was watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the paper\n248\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nsquares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked\ninto place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.\nHarry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what\nthey were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled\nfootstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a\nyoung witch.

He\nwrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled\nthe magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he\nturned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured,\n“Accio Locket.”\nNothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Um-\nbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore\nhurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. He\nsaw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips\nthat coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back;\na fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign\nof a locket.\nThere was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to search-\ning it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of fold-\ners, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the\nbottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his\nsearch: Mr. Weasley’s file.\nHe pulled it out and opened it.\nARTHUR WEASLEY\nblood status: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-\nMuggle leanings.

He had an\nidea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened\nup and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a\nposter of himself on the wall, with the words undesirable no. 1\nemblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a\npicture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and\nsaw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.”\nAngrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the\nvases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the\nlocket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and\nhis heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small\nrectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.\nHarry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized\nthe moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all.

Dumble-\ndore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book.\nHarry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across\nhis hat — The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore — nor the slightly\nsmaller writing across his chest: “by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author\nof Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?”\n252\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nHarry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photo-\ngraph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their\narms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-\nlength hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on\nKrum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in si-\nlent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about\nhim. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered\nwhether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the caption,\nthe door of the office opened.\nIf Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he en-\ntered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak\nover himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught\na glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained\nquite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just\nvanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore\nscratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily\nreplaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk\nand pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It\nsprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly,\nhardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the\nopen area beyond.\nThe pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of\nthe Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked.\nHarry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet\nit sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless,\nremember that poisonous duck?”\nSpeeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had\nnever been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there\nwas no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while\n253\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nshe was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to\nleave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another\nday. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work\nout a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.\nThe lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled\noff the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous\nrelief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-\neyed Ron got in.\n“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.\n“Ron, it’s me, Harry!”\n“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t Her-\nmione with you?”\n“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she\ncouldn’t refuse, and —”"

I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m\nafraid I cannot be party to —”\nMr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange\nto have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift\ndoors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more.\n“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound\nof steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for question-\ning today? Er — what’s happened to you? Why are you so wet?”\n“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s\nshoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might rec-\nognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t\n254\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nstop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie — Pillsworth, I think they\nsaid —”\n“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley.\n“Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”\n“Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks,\nD — I mean, thanks, Arthur.”\nThe lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left,\nand Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him,\nbut found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his\nnose buried in some papers he was reading.\nNot until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he\nwas in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned\nradish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For\nthe second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way\nblocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.\n“One moment, Runcorn.”\nThe lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr.\nWeasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”\nHarry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less\nbecause of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was\nto act stupid.\n“Sorry?” he said.\n“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You tracked\ndown the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?”\n“I — so what if I did?” said Harry.\n“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr.\nWeasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Az-\nkaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his\nsons, and his friends —”\n255\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN"

They’re watching your every\nmove —”\nThe lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley\ngave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood\nthere, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other\nthan Runcorn. . . . The lift doors clanged shut.\nHarry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He\nwould try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing\nwith the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out into\na torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled\nand carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry\nshivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked\nthe entrance to the Department of Mysteries.\nHe set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway\nhe remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight\nof stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with pos-\nsibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy\nDetonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the\ncourtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with\nMafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was suf-\nficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed\nit, Hermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they\nwere clear of the Ministry. . . .\nLost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural\nchill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog.\nIt was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold\n256\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nthat reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And\nthen he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling\nhim, expanding inside him. . . .\nDementors, he thought.\nAnd as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he\nsaw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was\npacked with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely hid-\nden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified\nMuggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering\non hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in\ntheir hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves\nfrom the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by\nfamilies, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down\nin front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair\nof the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . .\nFight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure\na Patronus here without revealing himself instantly.

So he moved\nforward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numb-\nness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think\nof Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.\nMoving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The\neyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he\nfelt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence\nthat still had some hope, some resilience. . . .\nAnd then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one\nof the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and\nscreams echoed out of it.\n“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you!

They glided away down the corridor with\nhim, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him\nfrom sight.\n“Next — Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge.\nA small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot.\nHer dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long,\nplain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the\ndementors, Harry saw her shudder.\nHe did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated\nthe sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began\nto swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.\nIt was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated\nfor improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the\nceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being\nstuck at the bottom of a deep well.\nThere were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura\nover the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners far-\nthest from the high, raised platform.

The moment she had sat down,\nchains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there.\n“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge.\nMrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.\n“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance\nDepartment?”\nMrs. Cattermole burst into tears.\n“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!”\nUmbridge ignored her.\n“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”\nMrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.\n“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home —”\n“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our\nsympathies.”\nMrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his\nway carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The\nmoment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he\nfelt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here.\nThe Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, and it glowed brightly\nbecause she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted\nlaws she had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged\n259\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\nhis way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermi-\none, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making\nHermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon\nUmbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause\nHermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs.\nCattermole, and Harry seized his chance.\n“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear.\nAs he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned\nthe bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the\ninterview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon\nMrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.\n“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry\ntoday, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying. “Eight-and-three-\nquarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that\ndescription?”\nMrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.\n“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took\nthat wand?”\n“T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from any-\nbody.

She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe\nher victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled\nover the void: the locket.\nHermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge\nand Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything\nelse.\n260\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\n“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole.\nWands only choose witches or wizards.

I have\nyour responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here —\nMafalda, pass them to me.”\nUmbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that\nmoment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between\nthe stubby fingers. Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She\nfumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her,\nfinally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s\nname on it.\n“That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pen-\ndant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.\n“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes — an old\nfamily heirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bo-\nsom. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . .\nIndeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related.\n. . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs.\nCattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be said for you.\n‘Parents’ professions: greengrocers.’”\nYaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up\nand down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.\nIt was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s\nbrain and obliterated his sense of caution — that the locket she\nhad taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bol-\nster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even\ntroubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and\nsaid, “Stupefy!”\nThere was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her fore-\nhead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid\n261\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\noff her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat\nvanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, con-\nfused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry’s\ndisembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his\nown wand, but too late: “Stupefy!”\nYaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor.\n“Harry!”\n“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her\npretend —”\n“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”"

The real Reg Catter-\nmole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running\nout of a lift.\n“R-Reg?”\nShe looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.\nThe balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one\nReg Cattermole to the other.\n“Hey — what’s going on? What is this?”\n“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!”\nYaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the\ngroup beside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but\nMrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted\nhis wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending\nhim flying through the air.\n“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry\nshouted.\nThe balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of\nwhich Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open\nfireplace, and disappeared.

Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing\nthere beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.\n“Reg, I don’t understand —”\n“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”\nThere was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked\naround; Yaxley had just appeared.\n“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand\nand Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.\nDarkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing\nbands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed to\nbe sliding out of his grip. . . .\nHe wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not\nbreathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm\nand Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . .\nAnd then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place,\nwith its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there\nwas a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione’s hand was sud-\ndenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again.\n267\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R F O U R T E E N\nTHE THIEF\nH\narry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green;\nhe had no idea what had happened, he only knew that\nhe was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs.

Then an object twitched close to his face. He\npushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small,\nfierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking\naround, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest\nfloor, apparently alone.\nHarry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a mo-\nment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would\nbe for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt\nat the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut.

He had\nalways thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . .\nHis insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s up-\nper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly\naway as though by a knife.\n“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence\nof Dittany’ —”\n“Bag — right —”\nHarry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the\ntiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after\nobject began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines\nof books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes —\n“Quickly!”\nHe grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the\ndepths of the magical bag.\n“Accio Dittany!”\nA small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and\n269\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nhastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-\nclosed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.\n“He’s fainted,” said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no\nlonger looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places.\n“Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.”\nHarry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took\nit and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound.\nGreenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry\nsaw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several\ndays old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh.\n“Wow,” said Harry.\n“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells\nthat would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do\nthem wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost so much blood\nalready. . . .”\n“How did he get hurt? I mean” — Harry shook his head, trying\nto clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place — “why\nare we here?

Since Dumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve\ngiven him the secret, haven’t I?”\nThere was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was\na serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was\nno way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing\nother Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive\nthough the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now\nthat Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home.\nWith a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry\nimagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney\npie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.\n“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”\n“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was\nmine. . . .”\nHarry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye.\nHermione recoiled, looking horrified.\n“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t\nleave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders.”\nBefore Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his\neyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat.\n“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered.\n“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. “Where\nare we?”\n“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said\nHermione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this\nwas —”\n271\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n“— the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glanc-\ning around at the apparently deserted glade.

Had it been Legilimency? Did\nVoldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had\ntaken them?\n“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and\nHarry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking\nthe same.\n“I dunno.”\nRon still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit\nup and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect\nof moving him was daunting.\n“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said.\nLooking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.\n“Where are you going?” asked Ron.\n“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments"

The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas,\nrope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of\ncats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the\nQuidditch World Cup.\n“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?”\nhe asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.\n“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said\nHermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements\nwith her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she\nadded, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one\nfluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the\nground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared,\nto land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope.\n“Cave Inimicum,” Hermione finished with a skyward flourish.\n“That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know\nthey’re coming, I can’t guarantee it will keep out Vol —”\n“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh.\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other.\n“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look\nat them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or something.

Even this very short journey had turned\nRon whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he\nclosed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.\n“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and\nmugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.\nHarry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had\nbeen on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away\na little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron\nbroke the silence.\n“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?”\n“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching\nher hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits\nabout him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-\nApparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their\nchildren. That’s what Harry told her to do.”\n“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his\npillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color\nhad returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that\nquick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I\nwas him.

Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the\nCattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that\n274\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE THIEF\nHarry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing\nhim.\n“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that\nhe was there.\n“Got — got what?” she said with a little start.\n“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s\nthe locket?”\n“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his\npillows. “No one tells me anything!

An ornate letter S, inlaid with\nmany small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining\nthrough the tent’s canvas roof.\n“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher\nhad it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a\nHorcrux?”\n“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking\nat it closely. “There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magi-\ncally destroyed.”\nShe passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers.

Even after all their\nefforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him.\nMastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his\nfingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open\nRegulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket\nback to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were\nno more successful at opening it than he had been.\n“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he\nheld it tight in his clenched fist.\n“What d’you mean?”\nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry\nthought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing\nthrough his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating\ninside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?\n“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked.\n“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” Harry replied,\nand, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own\nneck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it\nrested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.\n“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,”\nhe added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need\nto think about some food as well.

Why did the young thief look familiar?\nThe noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the\ntent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron\nwhispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?”\n“No . . . it must’ve been something small.”\n“Harry?”\nThe wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned him-\nself in bed.\n“Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else\nto turn into a Horcrux?”\n“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be\ndangerous for him to make another one? Didn’t Hermione say he\nhad pushed his soul to the limit already?”\n“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.”\n“Yeah . . . maybe,” said Harry.\nHe had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way\naround the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought\na solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him,\napparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.\nWhat was Voldemort trying to find?

He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and\nHarry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . .\nWith Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was\nin danger now, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as\nRon’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself\ndrifted slowly into sleep once more.\n283\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R F I F T E E N\nTHE GOBLIN’S REVENGE\nE\narly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left\nthe tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most\ngnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find.

You managed\nperfectly yesterday!”\n“I don’t know.”\nHe sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humili-\nated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong\ninside him.

No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve\ndone while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if\nI’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when\nshe couldn’t remember anything.”\n“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket.\n“Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the\ntent.”\n286\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE GOBLIN’S REVENGE\n“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated\nfirmly. “If we lose it, if it gets stolen —”\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around\nher own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt.\n“But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.”\n“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can\nwe please get some food?”\n“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione with\nhalf a glance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we know\ndementors are swooping around.”\nIn the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field be-\nlonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain\neggs and bread.\n“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as\nthey devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money\nunder the chicken coop?”\nRon rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “’Er-my-\nnee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax!”\nAnd, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were com-\nfortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten\nin laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he\ntook the first of the three night watches.\nThis was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach\nmeant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom.

He did not seem to\nhave any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come\nup with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies.\nAccordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to\ndecide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to de-\nstroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming\nincreasingly repetitive as they had no new information.\nAs Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had\nhidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept recit-\ning, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Volde-\nmort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born\nand raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and\nBurkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Alba-\nnia, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis\nof their speculations.\n“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon\nto search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically.\n“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his\nHorcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain\nthe snake is the sixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not\nin Albania, it’s usually with Vol —”\n“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”\n“Fine!

Repressing a strong urge to throw some-\nthing at him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden\nsomething at Hogwarts.”\nHermione sighed.\n“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”\nHarry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of\nthis theory.\n“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew\nall of Hogwarts’s secrets.

It was his first real home, the place that meant he\nwas special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —”\n“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?”\ninquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around\nhis neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.\n“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him\na job after he left,” said Hermione.\n“That’s right,” said Harry.\n“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try\nand find something, probably another founder’s object, to make"

Hermione stole into a library and dis-\ncovered from their records that the place had been demolished many\nyears before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.\n“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested\nhalfheartedly.\n“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had\nknown it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort\nhad been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part\nof his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort\nsought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray\ncorner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from\nHogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizard-\ning bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.\nEven without any new ideas, they continued to move through\nthe countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for\nsecurity. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all\nclues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and se-\ncluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy\ncrevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides,\nand once a sheltered and pebbly cove.

The thief\nwho stole from Gregorovitch.”\nAnd Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disap-\npointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his\nfamily or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he,\nHarry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort\nwas thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy.

He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desper-\nate for a lead on the Horcruxes.\nAs the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that\nRon and Hermione were having conversations without, and about,\nhim. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry en-\ntered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled\na little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times\nthey fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and\nhastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.\n291\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nHarry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed\nto come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey be-\ncause they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn\nin due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood,\nand Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed\nby his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further\nHorcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him\nwas Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely,\nhe stopped suggesting it.\nAutumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it:\nThey were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural\nmists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to\ntheir troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at iden-\ntifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their con-\ntinuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total\nignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.\n“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a\nriverbank in Wales, “can make good food appear out of thin air.”\nHe prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his\nplate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he\nhad expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He\nmanaged to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude\nwould, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off\nthe locket.\n“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione.\n“No one can.

Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them,\nhe heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was\nnot moving.\n“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to\nHermione.\n“I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, Muggle-\nRepelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it.

They drew their wands, waiting.\nThe enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be suf-\nficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice\nof Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death\nEaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark\nMagic for the first time.\nThe voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of\nmen reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer\nthan twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to\ntell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to\nrummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and\nthrew one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of\nthe flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out\nof the tent entrance.\nWithin seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.\n“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too\nearly in the season? Accio Salmon!”\nThere were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds\nof fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed\nthe Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the\nriver he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking\nEnglish or any human language he had ever heard.

One of the kids who\ntried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”\nHarry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were\nclutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.\n“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed\nopen the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword.\nSnape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the\nstaircase.”\n297\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that\nthey’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who?

Or on Snape\nhimself?”\n“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape\ndecided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of\ndays later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine,\nhe sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”\nThe goblins started to laugh again.\n“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted.\n“It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook.\n“The sword of Gryffindor!”\n“Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was\nWizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and\nhad certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever\nthe genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts\nbank.”\n“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the\nDeath Eaters this?”\n“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said\nGriphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and\nDirk’s laughter.\nInside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask\nthe question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed\nten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-\nboyfriend of Ginny’s too.\n“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to\nsteal it?”\n“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook indif-\nferently.\n298\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE GOBLIN’S REVENGE\n“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys\ndon’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?”\n“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said\nGriphook.\n“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose\nwe should just be glad they’re still alive.”\n“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You\nbelieve Snape killed Dumbledore?”\n“’Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell\nme you think Potter had anything to do with it?”\n“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.\n“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real\nthing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”\n“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk,\n“me included. But where is he?

You want the facts, try the Quibbler.”\nThere was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a\ngood deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a\nfish bone. At last he spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of\nXeno Lovegood’s?”\n“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it\na look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not\na single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue.\nHow long they’ll let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know.

Mind, who’s to say they\nhaven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?”\n“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted.\nThere was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and\nforks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought\nto sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding\nthe trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then\nclambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry,\nwho had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the\nlonger they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more\nthan, “Ginny — the sword —”\n“I know!” said Hermione.\nShe lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in\nit right up to the armpit.\n“Here . . . we . . . are . . .” she said between gritted teeth, and she\npulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.\nSlowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry\nhurried to help her.

Phineas Nigellus?”\nNothing happened.\n“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please\ncould we talk to you? Please?”\n“‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Ni-\ngellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:\n“Obscuro!”\nA black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark\neyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.\n“What — how dare — what are you — ?”\n“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a nec-\nessary precaution!”\n“Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ru-\nining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”\n“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus\nfroze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.\n“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”\n“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Ni-\ngellus’s interest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about\nthe sword of Gryffindor.”\n301\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and\nthat in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted\nmost unwisely there —”\n“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus\nraised supercilious eyebrows.\n“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side.\n“Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy\nin the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!”\n“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.”\n“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus.\n“Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved\nher punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood\noddity!”\n“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said\nHermione.\n“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with\nthe blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you\nremoved me from the house of my forebears?”\n“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and\nLuna?” asked Harry urgently.\n“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some\nwork for the oaf, Hagrid.”\n“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.\n“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said\nHarry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh\nwith Hagrid.

Maybe it’s been\ntaken away for cleaning or — or something?”\nPhineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes\nand sniggered.\n“Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not require\ncleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing\nonly that which strengthens it.”\n“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.\n“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps\nit is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?”\nStill blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying\nto feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts.\nHarry had a sudden inspiration.\n“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?”\n“I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.\n“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him\nalong, here, into yours?”\nPhineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s\nvoice.\n“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter.\nThe portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they\ncannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of them-\nselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me,\nand after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure\nyou that I shall not be making a return visit!”\nSlightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts\nto leave his frame.\n“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please,\n303\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nwhen was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before\nGinny took it out, I mean?”\nPhineas snorted impatiently.\n“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave\nits case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a\nring.”\nHermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them\ndared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last man-\naged to locate the exit.\n“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began\nto move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained\nin view when Harry gave a sudden shout.\n“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”\nPhineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the\npicture.\n“Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the\nmany eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore.

Unable to contain himself, he punched\nthe air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and\ndown the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even\nfeel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s\nportrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp\nshe threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.\n“The sword can destroy Horcruxes!

Why hadn’t Dum-\nbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not\nrealized it at the time?\n“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have\nleft it?”\n“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing.\n“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.\n“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in\nthere.”\n“But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?”\n“Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.\n“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said\nHermione.\n“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at\nthe thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however\nfaint, about Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden\nthe sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon,\nRon? Ron?”\nHarry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought\nthat Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the\nshadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.\n305\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said.\n“What?”\nRon snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper\nbunk.\n“You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”\nPerplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook\nher head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.\n“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.\n“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at\nHarry. “Not according to you, anyway.”\nThere were several plunks on the canvas over their heads.

Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d\nbe staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day?\nDid you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”\n“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron,\nstanding up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We\nthought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had\na real plan!”\n“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain\nthundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.\n“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm\neven though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you\nfrom the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

Snape seemed to be\nfacing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students.\nGinny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had\nreinstated Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or\nmore students or any unofficial student societies.\nFrom all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and prob-\nably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to\ncontinue Dumbledore’s Army.

They did not dare remain in\nany one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of Eng-\nland, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they\ncontinued to meander up and down the country, braving a moun-\ntainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the\ntent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of\na Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night.\nThey had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several\nsitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry\nresolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored\navenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal:\nHermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak\n(scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and\nHarry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a\nstomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.

He felt exactly as he had done on the\noccasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor Mc-\nGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that\nhe had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.\n“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and —”\n“Harry, could you help me with something?”\nApparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned\nforward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\n“Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of a page.\nAbove what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable\nto read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what\nlooked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.\n“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.”\n“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either.\nAll along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it\nis! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really\npart of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?”\n“No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the\nsame symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?”\n“Well, that’s what I thought too!”"

If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing\nin a book of children’s stories?”\n“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour\nwould have recognized it.

It was natural, perhaps, that they\nformed their own small communities within a community. Many small\nvillages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded\ntogether for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth\n318\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGODRIC’S HOLLOW\nin Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on\nthe south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding\nfamilies who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Mug-\ngles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps,\nGodric’s Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard\nGodric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizard-\ning smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the\nnames of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for\nthe stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for\nmany centuries.’\n“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing\nthe book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later\nthan the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hol-\nlow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dum-\nbledore would have expected you to make the connection?”\n“Oh yeah . . .”\nHarry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking\nabout the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hol-\nlow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents’ graves, the\nhouse where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of\nBathilda Bagshot.\n“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.\n“Who?”\n“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name.\n“Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had\nskinny ankles.”\n“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that\nshe had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:\n“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”\n319\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index\nfinger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A His-\ntory of Magic. “Well, I suppose —”\nShe gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he\ndrew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to\nsee a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was\nnothing there.\n“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do"

I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at\nleast —”\n“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore\nentrusted it to her?”\nHarry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely\nold woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it\nlikely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor\nwith her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to\nchance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the\nsword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship\nwith Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt\non Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to\nfall in with Harry’s dearest wish.\n“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s\nHollow?”\n“Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.” She\nwas sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of hav-\ning a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to\npractice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a\nstart, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too,\nunless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice\n320\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGODRIC’S HOLLOW\nPotion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. I\nactually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises\nthe better. . . .”\nHarry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was\na pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time\nsince he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he\nfelt excited.\nHe was about to go home, about to return to the place where he\nhad had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort,\nhe would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could\nhave invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have had broth-\ners and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made\nhis seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever\nseemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about\nto see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione\nhad gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from\nHermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album\nHagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he\nperused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him\nfrom the images, which were all he had left of them now.\nHarry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the follow-\ning day, but Hermione had other ideas.

The beaded bag\ncontaining all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which\nHarry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside\npocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invis-\nibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating dark-\nness once again.\nHeart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were\nstanding hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in\nwhich the night’s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cot-\ntages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations\ntwinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of\ngolden streetlights indicated the center of the village.\n“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why\ndidn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints!\nWe’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it —”\nHarry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse,\ntrying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their\ntraces.\n“Let’s take off the Cloak,” said Harry, and when she looked\nfrightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one\naround.”\nHe stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way\nforward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed\nmore cottages: Any one of them might have been the one in which\nJames and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry\ngazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front\n322\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGODRIC’S HOLLOW\nporches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing\ndeep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than\na year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure\nwhether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know\nwhat happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then\nthe little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and\nthe heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.\nStrung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like\na war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown\nChristmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a\nlittle church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright\nacross the square."

Villagers were crisscrossing\nin front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps.\nThey heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door\nopened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little\nchurch.\n“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione.\n“Is it?”\nHe had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for\nweeks.\n“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They\n. . . they’ll be in there, won’t they?

Halfway across the square, however, she\nstopped dead.\n“Harry, look!”\nShe was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it,\nit had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there\nwas a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a\nwoman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sit-\nting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy\nwhite caps.\nHarry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never\nimagined that there would be a statue. . . .

Why is that there?”\n“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters\nmean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you\nknow . . . living beyond death. Living after death.”\nBut they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The\nempty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering\nremains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And\ntears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly\nfreezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or\npretending?

He should have brought something to give them,\nand he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was\nleafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a\ncircle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed\nbefore them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave.\nAs soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he\ncould stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermi-\none’s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned\nin silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore’s\nmother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight\nkissing gate.\n329\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\nH\narry, stop.”\n“What’s wrong?”\nThey had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.\n“There’s someone there.

Harry could not see anything.\n“Are you sure?”\n“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . .”\nShe broke from him to free her wand arm.\n“We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out.\n“Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave!\nHarry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!”\nHarry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed\nto be haunted: what if — ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a\n330\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\nlittle eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had\npointed. Ghosts could not move snow."

Ghosts could not move snow.\n“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it was\na Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and\nwe can put the Cloak back on.”\nThey glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the\ngraveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended\nwhen reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slip-\npery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over them-\nselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were\nnow singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the\nchurch. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge\ninside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured,\n“Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out\nof the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered.\nHarry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the\nlane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they\ndared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the\noutlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.\n“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione,\nwho was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder.\n“Harry? What do you think? Harry?”\nShe tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He\nwas looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this\nrow of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione\nalong with him; she slipped a little on the ice.\n“Harry —”\n“Look. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . .”\n331\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n“I don’t . . . oh!”\nHe could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James\nand Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid\nhad taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the\nwaist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though\nentirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top\nfloor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the\ncurse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up\nat the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those\nthat flanked it.\n“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.\n“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe it’s like the\ninjuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”\nHe slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy\nand thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold\nsome part of the house.\n“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might — oh,\nHarry, look!”\nHis touch on the gate seemed to have done it.

Some had merely signed\ntheir names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into\nthe wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these,\nshining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti, all said\nsimilar things.\nGood luck, Harry, wherever you are.\nIf you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you!\nLong live Harry Potter.\n“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione,\nindignant.\nBut Harry beamed at her.\n“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . .”\nHe broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane\ntoward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square.\nHarry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a\nwoman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on\nthe snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all\ngave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she\ndrew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into\nany of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that\nshe would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and\nsimply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.\n333\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nHe did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm.

The woman beckoned again, more vigor-\nously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the sum-\nmons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing\nstronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the\ndeserted street."

Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the sum-\nmons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing\nstronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the\ndeserted street.\nWas it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long\nmonths? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry\nwould come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had\nmoved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this\nspot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish\npower that he had never encountered before.\nFinally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.\n“Are you Bathilda?”\nThe muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.\nBeneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other.\nHarry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.\n334\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\nThey stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and\nhobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several\nhouses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path\nthrough a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left.\nShe fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened\nit and stepped back to let them pass.\nShe smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled\nhis nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that\nhe was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with\nage, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind\nthem, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then\nturned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cata-\nracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face\nwas dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether\nshe could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding\nMuggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.\nThe odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food\nintensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a\nhead of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.\n“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.\nShe nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his\nskin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken;\nhe could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could\nit sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?\nBathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though\nshe had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting\nroom.\n“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione.\n“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had\n335\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nto,” said Harry. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t\nall there. Muriel called her ‘gaga.’”\n“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room.\nHermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm.\n“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the\nsitting room."

Thick dust\ncrunched beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath\nthe dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone\nbad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside\nBathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to\nhave forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles\nclumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catch-\ning fire.\n“Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the matches from her.\nShe stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that\nstood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of\nbooks and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.\nThe last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-\nfronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of\nphotographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered\non their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from\nthe pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered\n“Tergeo”: The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at\nonce that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most or-\nnate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had\nremoved them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the\ncollection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.\n336\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\nIt was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who\nhad perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry\nout of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had\nseen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm\nin arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all\nthe missing photographs were: in Rita’s book.\n“Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly.\n“Who is this?”\nBathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Her-\nmione light the fire for her.\n“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture\nin his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda\nlooked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest.\n“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture\nforward.\nShe peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.\n“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and\nlouder voice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s he\ncalled?”\nBathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration.\nHow had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?\n“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly.\n“Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione.\n“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from\nGregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?”"

With a little jerk of her head she\nlooked back into the hall.\n“You want us to leave?” he asked.\nShe repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at\nherself, then at the ceiling.\n“Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs\nwith her.”\n“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.”\nBut when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with sur-\nprising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.\n“She wants me to go with her, alone.”\n“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear\nin the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the\nloud noise.\n“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only\nto me?”\n“Do you really think she knows who you are?”\n“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon\nhis own, “I think she does.”\n“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.”\n“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda.\nShe seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him to-\nward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring\nsmile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself\nin the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.\nAs Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and\nBathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown\nthief inside his jacket.\n338\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\nThe stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place\nhis hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not\ntopple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely.\nSlowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned\nimmediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom.\nIt was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out\na chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed\nthe door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.\n“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start:\nBathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness,\nand he had not heard her approach.\n“You are Potter?” she whispered.\n“Yes, I am.”\nShe nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating\nfast, faster than his own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating\nsensation.\n“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed\ndistracted by his lit wand-tip.\n“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated."

He did not want to look away\nfrom her.\n“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was\nheaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.\n“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.\nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tan-\ngled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out\nof the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed\nhim as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring\nfrom the place where her neck had been.\nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to\nhis forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light\nswung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished: Then a\npowerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out\nof him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound\nof filthy clothing —\nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which\nthrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier:\nFragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor.\nFrom below he heard Hermione call, “Harry?”\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then\na heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide\nover him, powerful, muscular —\n“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor.\n“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . . .”\n340\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nBATHILDA’S SECRET\n“Accio . . .

Alas, no.\n“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says\nBathilda. “It came as an awful shock.

I know Bathilda\nthought it was all just talk, but ‘For the Greater Good’ became\nGrindelwald’s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he com-\nmitted later.

And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts,\nand there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their\nrise to power over the Muggles.”\nHis temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood\nup and walked around, trying to work some of it off.\n“I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermi-\none. “All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over\nagain. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in\nthe house —”\n“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for com-\npany, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up —”\n“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever\nwas wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dum-\nbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed —”\n“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer\nMuggles by force!” Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the\nempty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking\nand spiraling against the pearly sky.\n“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he\ndid believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the\nrest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore\nwas the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for\nMuggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-\nWho from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!”\nRita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of\nAlbus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.\n“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is\nthat Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.”\n361\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his\nhead, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or\nprotect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look\nwhat he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And\nagain! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just\ntrust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even\nthough I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!”\nHis voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each\nother in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were\nas insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky.\n“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.”\nHarry dropped his arms.\n“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This\nisn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of\nwhat he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever\nshared with me.”"

She picked up the\nbook and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did\nso, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand.

Harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing:\nNagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked\nring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeat-\nedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in\nthe distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent\nwas footsteps or voices.\nFinally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was\nhuddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the\nlight of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted\nwith relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.\n“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she\npulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I could\nhear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once\nor twice.”\n363\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nHarry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at\nthe silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.\n“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The\nsnow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . .

Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow\nthat Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threaten-\ning. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to\nkeep watch and told her to go to bed.\n364\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SILVER DOE\nHarry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down,\nwearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The dark-\nness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impen-\netrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as\nto watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was\nthe Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.\nEvery tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the\nforest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he\nwished they would all remain still and silent so that he could sepa-\nrate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might\nproclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of\na cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once\nthought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their\nprotective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they\nbreak now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that some-\nthing was different tonight.\nSeveral times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had\nfallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the\ntent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he\nmight have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and\nApparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see\nwhether he could make out his fingers when it happened.\nA bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through\nthe trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light\nseemed simply to drift toward him.\nHe jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised\nHermione’s wand.

His impulse to shout for\nHermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He\nknew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for\nhim, and him alone.\nThey gazed at each other for several long moments and then she\nturned and walked away.\n“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come\nback!”\nShe continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her\nbrightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling\nsecond he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure,\na trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was\nnot Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.\nSnow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as\nshe passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper\nand deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly,\nsure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her\nproperly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him\nwhat he needed to know.\nAt last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward\n366\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SILVER DOE\nhim once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him,\nbut as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.\nThough the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished\nimage was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision,\nbrightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now\nfear came: Her presence had meant safety.\n“Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.\nThe imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as\nhe stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crack-\nles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had\nshe enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody\nstood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?\nHe held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of\ngreen light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him\nto this spot?\nSomething gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun\nabout, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked\nblack surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.\nHe moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice\nreflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep\nbelow the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great\nsilver cross . . .\nHis heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the\npool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the\npool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a\nsword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor\nwas lying at the bottom of the forest pool.\nBarely breathing, he stared down at it.

How was this possible?\n367\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nHow could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the\nplace where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn\nHermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a\nPatronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been\nput into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were\nhere? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass\nit to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees\nand bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye,\nbut he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear\nleavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword\nreposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.\nHe pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio\nSword.”\nIt did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy,\nthe sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not\nin the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice,\nthinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to\nhim. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.\n“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool\nbottom, indifferent, motionless.\nWhat was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumble-\ndore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a\ntrue Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the\nqualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s head\nanswered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.\nHarry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath\ndispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do.\nIf he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this\nfrom the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.\n368\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SILVER DOE\nHe glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was con-\nvinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their\nchance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of oppor-\ntunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point\nwas because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.\nWith fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers\nof clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully,\nhe was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was\nnot calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.\nAn owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought\nwith a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chatter-\ning horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood\nthere in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch\ncontaining his wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of Sirius’s mirror,"

As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the\nsword he would have to submerge himself completely.\nContemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the\nwater warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s\nwand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much\ncolder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be\nshivering, he jumped.\nEvery pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his\nlungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders\nin the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently\n369\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nthe water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with\nhis numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.\nHarry put off the moment of total submersion from second to\nsecond, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be\ndone, gathered all his courage, and dived.\nThe cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself\nseemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the\nbottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed\naround the hilt; he pulled it upward.\nThen something closed tight around his neck. He thought of wa-\nter weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised\nhis empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the\nHorcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.\nHarry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the sur-\nface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool.\nThrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his\nfrozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were pop-\nping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing\nleft, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest\nwere surely Death’s. . . .\nChoking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been\nin his life, he came to facedown in the snow.

There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched\nto the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor\nin one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in\nthe other.\n“Why the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which\nswung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody\nof hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?”\nHarry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing\ncompared with Ron’s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shud-\ndering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the\nwater’s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after\nsweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to\nhave disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to\nbe real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry’s life.\n“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice\nweaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.\n“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused.\n“Y-you cast that doe?”\n“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!”\n“My Patronus is a stag.”\n“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”\nHarry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a\nfinal sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron\nagain.\n371\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n“How come you’re here?”\nApparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later,\nif at all.\n“Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back.

He had returned.\nHe had just saved Harry’s life.\nRon looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised\nto see the things he was holding.\n“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up\nthe sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in,\nright?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get\nhere? How did you find us?”\n“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s\na big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a\ntree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you\nfollowing.”\n“You didn’t see anyone else?”\n“No,” said Ron. “I —”\nBut he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together\nsome yards away.\n“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running\nto the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come"

The\ntwo oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches\nbetween the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen.\n372\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SILVER DOE\nThe ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry\ncould see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood\nwaiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.\n“Anything there?” Ron asked.\n“No,” said Harry.\n“So how did the sword get in that pool?”\n“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”\nThey both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glint-\ning a little in the light from Hermione’s wand.\n“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron.\n“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry.\nThe Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket\nwas twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was\nagitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had\ntried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not\nthe time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the\nlocket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s\nwand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow\nof a sycamore tree.\n“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the\nrock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron\noffered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.\n“No, you should do it.”\n“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”\n“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed\nto be you.”\nHe was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known\nthat the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to\nwield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something\n373\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\nabout certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain\nacts.\n“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway,\nokay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The bit of\nRiddle in the diary tried to kill me.”\n“How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified.\n“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The\nanswer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always\nknown it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with\nNagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid\nwith glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule\nsnake, curled upon the cold rock.\n“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”"

It\nwould have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry’s\nneck still burned.\n“One . . . two . . . three . . . open.”\nThe last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of\nthe locket swung wide with a little click.\nBehind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye,\ndark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned\nthem scarlet and slit-pupiled.\n“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.\nRon raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled\nover the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket\ntightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the\nempty windows.\nThen a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux.\n“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”\n“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”\n“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears.\nAll you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . . .”\n“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding\ntrees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s\neyes.\n“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . .

He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from\ncold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down\nbeside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took\nit as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.\n“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that\nRon’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week.

It’s always been like that.\nI thought you knew.”\nRon did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and\nwiped his nose noisily on his sleeve.

Harry could not wait\nto wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he\nentered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.\nIt was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only\nillumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the\nfloor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and\ndid not move until Harry had said her name several times.\n“Hermione!”\nShe stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face.\n“What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?”\n“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s\nsomeone here.”\n“What do you mean?

Spitting hair out\nof her mouth, she leapt up again.\n“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm —”\n“I will not calm down!” she screamed.

It was\na bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only\none of me and they’d taken my wand.

Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake\nturned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who\nhimself arrived and missed us by about a second.”\n“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione\nignored him.\n“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry!

But\nI was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and\nI heard . . . I heard you.”\nHe was looking at Hermione.\n“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.\n“No, I heard you coming out of my pocket.

Harry remembered: It\nhad been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of\nthem since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when\ntalking about repairing Harry’s wand.\n“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and\nit didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So\nI clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light\nappeared right outside the window.”\nRon raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes\nfocused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.\n“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light\nyou get around a Portkey, you know?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically.\n“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it,"

He was really young\nwhen they —”\n“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and\nsomething in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the\nsubject.\nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles.\nHarry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous\n391\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY\nnight, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and\nhad decided was made of blackthorn.\n“Engorgio.”\nThe spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry\ntried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.\n“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was\nyoung, okay?”\nHarry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders.\n“Sorry — Reducio.”\nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn\nwand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had\nseemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix\nwand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody\nelse’s hand sewn to the end of his arm."

The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody\nelse’s hand sewn to the end of his arm.\n“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached\nthem noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as\nHarry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of\nconfidence, Harry.”\nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty\nabout breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his\nlips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made\nno difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all\nto be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermi-\none a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book\nonce more.\nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and\nHarry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make\nthe blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic\nstill seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before.\n392\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nXENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD\nHermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many\nnervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out\nof his rucksack and started to try and tune it.\n“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that\ntells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s\nside and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait\ntill you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have\nto keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and you need a\npassword to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last one. . . .”\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, mut-\ntering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many\ncovert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the no-\ntice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes\nor so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her\nbook, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.\nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his\ntapping at once.\n“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously.\nHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.\n“We need to talk,” she said.\nHe looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life\nand Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\n“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that\nthere was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to\nhearing Rita’s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermi-\none’s answer, however, was completely unexpected.\n“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.”\nHe stared at her.\n“Sorry?”\n393\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n“Xenophilius Lovegood.

Look at this!”\nShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s\nunwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that\nDumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s famil-\niar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that\nDumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been\nRita’s invention.\n“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!”\nHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking\nabout, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw\nthat Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version\nof the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the\nBard.\n“Er — what are you — ?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione\nquelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.\n“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said\nit was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in\nGodric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before\nGrindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumble-\ndore or Grindelwald what it means — I don’t even know whether\nGrindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was\nwearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important,\nHarry!”\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense,\neager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking.\n394\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nXENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD\nAfter a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another God-\nric’s Hollow.

He was quite sure that Ron’s sup-\nport of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning\nof the triangular rune.\n“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on\nyour side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps tell-\ning everyone they’ve got to help you!”\n“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.\n“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me\nabout it before he died?”\n“Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for your-"

Do either of you know?”\n“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I dunno exactly\nwhere, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever\nthey mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find.”\nWhen Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his\nvoice.\n“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.”\n“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of\nboth. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”\nThey had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole\nfrom the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning.\nFrom their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of\ntoy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth\nin the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking\ntoward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they\ncould make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which\nafforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.\n“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.\n“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them.

The cluster of low hills ap-\npeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which\nseemed deserted.\n“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?”\nsaid Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen\nwith geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.\n“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if\nyou looked through the Lovegoods’ window. Let’s try the next lot\nof hills.”\nSo they Disapparated a few miles farther north.\n“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes.\nRon was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they\nhad appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically\nagainst the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging\nbehind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be Luna’s house, who\nelse would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!”\n397\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY\n“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower.\n“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”\nRon’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill\nfirst. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and\nclutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.\n“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”\nThree hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down\ngate. The first read,\nTHE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD\nthe second,\nPICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE\nthe third,\nKEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS\nThe gate creaked as they opened it.

Two aged crab apple trees, bent\nwith the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red\nfruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel\non either side of the front door.

His long white candyfloss hair was dirty\nand unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and\nFleur’s wedding by comparison.\n“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried\nin a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then\nat Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a\nperfect, comical O.\n“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m\nHarry, Harry Potter.”\nXenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was\nnot pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s\nforehead.\n“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s some-\nthing we’d like to ask you.”\n“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius.\nHe swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a\nshock . . . My word . . . I . . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought\nto —”\n“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this\nless-than-warm welcome.\n“I — oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”\nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed\nthe door shut behind them. They were standing in the most peculiar\nkitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that\nit felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved\n399\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY\nto fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the cupboards — and all\nof it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright pri-\nmary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna’s style: The effect,\nin such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.\nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the\nupper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming\nfrom overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.\n“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely\nuncomfortable, and he led the way.\nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and\nworkplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen.\nThough much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat re-\nsembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion\nthat it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised\nof centuries of hidden objects.

Harry had the impression that he was\nundergoing some painful internal struggle.\n“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione. “Let’s see what she thinks.”\nXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself.

He\ncould see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them\nat the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past\nthe window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invis-\nible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere.\nThey were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill\nand Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing to-\nward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of\nit; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius’s\nattitude proved that.\nHe turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another\npeculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a\nstone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most\nbizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear\ntrumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue\nwings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head,\nwhile one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap\naround her forehead.\n“Look at this,” said Harry.\n“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the\nwedding.”\nThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophil-\nius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin\nlegs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted\nteacups and a steaming teapot.\n“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the"

It was a moment or two before Xeno-\nphilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he with-\ndrew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.”\n“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused.\n“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius.\nHe picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled\na torn piece of parchment from between more books.\n“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line\nupon the parchment. “The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added\na circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, en-\nclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so\nintrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the Deathly Hallows.”\n“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows’ in the\nstory,” said Hermione.\n“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That\nis a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us\n409\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nwho understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient\nstory refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make\nthe possessor master of Death.”\nThere was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the\nwindow. Already the sun was low in the sky.\n“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly.\n“When you say ‘master of Death’ —” said Ron.\n“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror.\nVanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.”\n“But then . . . do you mean . . .” said Hermione slowly, and Harry\ncould tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of\nher voice, “that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actu-\nally exist?”\nXenophilius raised his eyebrows again.\n“Well, of course.”\n“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting\nto crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?”\n“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius.\n“You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow.\nClose-minded.”\n“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron,\nnodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the\nstrain of not laughing.\n“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know that there\nare such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist.\nBut —”"

She, Harry, and Ron glanced\nat one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the\nsame thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xeno-\nphilius had just described was in the room with them at that very\nmoment.\n“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in\nreasoned argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The\npossessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?”\nHe glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged\nwith the faintest trace of pink.\n“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the Cloak existed\n. . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the\nResurrection Stone?”\n“What of it?”\n“Well, how can that be real?”\n“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius.\nHermione looked outraged.\n“But that’s — I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous!

She was frowning at Xenophilius,\nbut she did not contradict him.\n“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.\n“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the\nwindow. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail\ngoes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really\ndefeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who\nmay have defeated them?

Finally Hermione asked stiffly, “Mr. Love-\ngood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly\nHallows?”\nXenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s\n412\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE TALE OF THE\nTHREE BROTHERS\nmemory, but he could not locate it.

Many of\nus Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything!\n— to do with the Hallows!”\n“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron.\n“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s\nHollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignotus\nPeverell.”\n“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically.\n“The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive\nproof!”\n“Of what?” asked Ron.\n“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three\nPeverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were\nthe original owners of the Hallows!”\nWith another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up\nthe tray, and headed for the spiral staircase.\n“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs\nagain. “Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy\nsoup.”\n“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,”\nsaid Ron under his breath.\nHarry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about\nin the kitchen downstairs before speaking.\n“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.\n413\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\n“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish.

The one good\nthing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to\nhave made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. “I think you’re\nright,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift\nis best, which one you’d choose —”\nThe three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the\nCloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”\nThey looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.\n“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you\nwouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand.

Beedle probably took the\nidea from the Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make\nyou immortal, a stone to reverse death.”\nThe smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was some-\nthing like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would\nbe possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to\nspare his feelings.\n“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you\nrealize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good\nit is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s.\nIt’s infallible.

She is down at Bottom Bridge, fish-\ning for Plimpies.”\n“So why have you only laid that tray for four?”\nXenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out.

Ron was buried deepest: Harry\nand Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreck-\nage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his\nlegs. While Xenophilius’s banging and scraping drew nearer and\nnearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover\nCharm.\n“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press\nblocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was\nfeet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust\nme, Harry?”\nHarry nodded.\n“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility\nCloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.”\n“Me? But Harry —”\n“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my\nshoulder.”\nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak.\nThe printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius\nwas trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know\nwhat Hermione was waiting for.\n“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight . . . any second . . .”\nXenophilius’s paper-white face appeared over the top of the\nsideboard.\n“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his\nface, then at the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!”\n422\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE TALE OF THE\nTHREE BROTHERS\nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like\nboulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was\na scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out\nof the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained\nall around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in\nmidair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s\nears as she dragged him once more into darkness.\n423\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T W E N T Y - T W O\nTHE DEATHLY HALLOWS\nH\narry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once.\nThey seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at\ndusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, wav-\ning her wand.\n“Protego Totalum . . . Salvio Hexia . . .”\n“That treacherous old bleeder!” Ron panted, emerging from be-\nneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione,\nyou’re a genius, a total genius, I can’t believe we got out of that!”\n“Cave Inimicum . . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t\nI tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!”\n“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the\ncuts to his legs. “What d’you reckon they’ll do to him?”\n“Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione. “That’s why\nI wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left,"

She passed a hand over her\neyes. “I’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if —”\n“— if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,”\nsaid Ron.\nThey put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made\nthem tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt\nlike home: safe, familiar, and friendly.\n“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few min-\nutes’ silence. “Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over\n425\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nagain, a complete waste of time!

I found that out\nwhen the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be\nStan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new\nperson.

If surviving\nwas as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have ev-\nerything we need already!”\n“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry,\nturning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.\n“There’s no such thing, Harry!”\n“You said there have been loads of wands — the Deathstick and\nwhatever they were called —”\n426\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEATHLY HALLOWS\n“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real,\nwhat about the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation\nmarks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic\ncan raise the dead, and that’s that!”\n“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my\nmum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . .”\n“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said\nHermione. “Those kinds of — of pale imitations aren’t the same as\ntruly bringing someone back to life.”\n“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The\nstory says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But\nthe second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he?

Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was\nfear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.\n“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said\nhastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything\nabout him, then?”\n“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I\nlooked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been any-\none famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of\nour books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’\nis Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from\nKreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the\npure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently\nthe Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.”\n“‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.\n“It means the name’s died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in\n427\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nthe case of the Peverells.

I only\never saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.”\nHarry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of\nher eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished.\n“Blimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the\nHallows?”\n“Why not?” said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was an igno-\nrant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry.\nIf that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might\nnot have known what it really was. There were no books in that\nhouse, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids.\nHe’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of\n428\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEATHLY HALLOWS\narms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made\nyou practically royal.”\n“Yes . . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously,\n“but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think —”\n“Well, why not? Why not?” said Harry, abandoning caution. “It\nwas a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it\nwas the Resurrection Stone?”\nRon’s mouth fell open.\n“Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ?”\n“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a\nResurrection Stone!”\nHermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry.\n“Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —”\n“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own ac-\ncord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone!\nGaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”\n“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone\nproperly!”\n“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What\ndid Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”"

If Voldemort had known\nabout the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them,\ndone anything to possess them: three objects that made the pos-\nsessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hal-\nlows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t\nthe simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a\nHorcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wiz-\narding secret?\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without\nrealizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of\nthree . . . for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden,\nwhose existence was best known. . . . The bloody trail of the Elder\nWand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . . .\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver\nsliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with\namazement at his discoveries.\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermi-\none standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding\nLily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they\nrealize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?\n“This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his\nown astonished certainty. “This explains everything.

The pro-\ngram I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the\ntruth about what’s going on! Nearly all the programs are following\nYou-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to\nhear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . .”\n437\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nRon spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out vari-\nous rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occa-\nsionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon\npox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.”\nWhile he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct pass-\nword, muttering strings of random words under his breath.\n“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them.\n“Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in\nthe end. . . .”\nBut not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting\nin the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape\nhyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when\nRon shouted excitedly from inside the tent.\n“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry!”\nRoused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the\nDeathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron\nand Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermi-\none, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for some-\nthing to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker,\nfrom which a most familiar voice was issuing.\n“. . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves,\nwhich was due to a number of house calls in our area by those\ncharming Death Eaters.”\n“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione.\n“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?”\n“. . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was say-\ning, “and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular\ncontributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!”\n“Hi.”\n438\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEATHLY HALLOWS\n“Evening, River.”\n“‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names,\nbut you can usually tell —”\n“Shh!” said Hermione.\n“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s\ntake a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless"

It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the\nmurders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”\nHarry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione\ngazed at one another in horror.\n“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed\nthat Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both be-\nlieved to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gor-\nnuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any\nknowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate\nfor news.\n“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found\ndead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths\nto a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me\nthat it was the Killing Curse — more evidence, as if it were needed,\nof the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a\nrecreational sport under the new regime.\n“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of\nBathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The\nevidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoe-\nnix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries\ninflicted by Dark Magic.\n“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s\n439\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\nsilence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot,\nGornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered\nby the Death Eaters.”\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half\nof Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might\ncome next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the\noutside world for a long time.\n“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to regular con-\ntributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is\naffecting the Muggle world.”\n“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured,\nreassuring.\n“Kingsley!” burst out Ron.\n“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.\n“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as\nthey continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However,\nwe continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches\nrisking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors,\noften without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our\nlisteners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective\ncharm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could\nbe saved if such simple measures are taken.”\n“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that\nin these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’?” asked Lee.\n“I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods"

Had Lupin\nforgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they\nhad last met?\n“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening,\nRomulus?”\n“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesi-\ntated slightly. “And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are\ngood and nearly always right.”\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.\n“Nearly always right,” she repeated.\n“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s\nliving with Tonks again!

Mind you, if all the alleged\nsightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-\nKnow-Whos running around the place.”\n“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery\nis creating more terror than actually showing himself.”\n“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit.\nThings are bad enough without inventing stuff as well.

Hearing\nfamiliar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had be-\ncome so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other\npeople were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long\nsleep.\n“Good, eh?” said Ron happily.\n“Brilliant,” said Harry.\n“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they\nwere found . . .”\n“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.”\n“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now\nthe broadcast was over, his thoughts turned again toward his all-\nconsuming obsession. “He’s abroad!

The Sneakoscope\non the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices\ncoming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices.

Harry clutched at his excruci-\natingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers,\ntight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent\nallergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which\nhe could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the\ntent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five\npeople wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.\n446\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMALFOY MANOR\n“Get — off — her!” Ron shouted.

What a treat . . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .”\nHarry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: Fenrir\nGreyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater\nrobes in return for his hired savagery.\n“Search the tent!” said another voice.\nHarry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud told him\nthat Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear foot-\nsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent\nas they searched.\n“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice\nfrom overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam\nof wandlight fell into his face and Greyback laughed.\n“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What hap-\npened to you, ugly?”\nHarry did not answer immediately.\n“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the\ndiaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened\nto you?”\n“Stung,” Harry muttered. “Been stung.”\n“Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice.\n“What’s your name?” snarled Greyback.\n“Dudley,” said Harry.\n“And your first name?”\n“I — Vernon. Vernon Dudley.”\n447\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n“Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry heard him\nmove sideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you,\nginger?”\n“Stan Shunpike,” said Ron.\n“Like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan\nShunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.”\nThere was another thud.\n“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was\nfull of blood. “Bardy Weadley.”\n“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood trai-\ntors even if you’re not a Mudblood.

When at last the\nman tying them had walked away, Harry whispered to the other\nprisoners.\n“Anyone still got a wand?”\n“No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.\n“This is all my fault.

The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes\nwhen they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle\nwere branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted\nthis highest honor.\n453\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nHarry’s scar seared again —\n— and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at\nthe very top of the tower —\n“. . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re\ndead.”\n“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment\nof inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two\nhundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to\ncome along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get\nthe girl thrown in!”\n— The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough\nfor a man to enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it,\ncurled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ?\n“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the\nrest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?”\n“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s\nanother ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies,\nthat’s another small fortune right there.”\nThe prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Her-\nmione’s breathing, fast and terrified.\n“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seiz-\ning a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails\nscratching his scalp. “On three! One — two — three —”\nThey Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry strug-\ngled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron\nand Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he\ncould not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed\nout of him his scar seared more painfully still —\n454\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMALFOY MANOR\n— as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and\nlanded, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room —\nThe prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a coun-"

Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then\nhe saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a\nlong drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had\nnot happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew,\nfor he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike\nplace, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to\nget to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another\nmatter. . . .\nOne of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.\n“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t —\nblimey!”\nHe whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting,\ntwisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frighten-\ning face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice: “State your\npurpose!”\n“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve cap-\ntured Harry Potter!”\nThe gates swung open.\n“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were\nshunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges\nthat muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above\nhim, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was\ndragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along\nsideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners.

She\nraised her eyebrows.\n456\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMALFOY MANOR\n“Bring them in,” she said.\nHarry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone\nsteps into a hallway lined with portraits.\n“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My\nson, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter,\nhe will know.”\nThe drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with\nhis eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions\nof the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more por-\ntraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in\nfront of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into\nthe room by the Snatchers.\n“What is this?”\nThe dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on\nHarry’s ears. He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and\nit was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts,\nthough his scar was still burning.\n“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco,\ncome here.”\nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely:\na figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face\na pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.\nGreyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry\ndirectly beneath the chandelier.\n“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf.\nHarry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing\nin an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he\nsaw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld\nPlace.\n457\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nHis face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by\nHermione’s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there\nwas a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was\nhe who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing\nhis glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give\nhim away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter\napproached.\n“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is\nit Harry Potter?”\n“I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his dis-\ntance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as\nHarry was of looking at him.\n“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!”"

He ap-\nproached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the\nusually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen\neyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peer-\ning out from between the bars of a cage.\n“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did\nhe get into this state?”\n“That wasn’t us.”\n“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius.\nHis gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.\n“There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar,\n458\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMALFOY MANOR\nstretched tight. . . .

Well then, the Dark Lord must be\ninformed at once!”\nShe dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark\nburned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to\ntouch it, to summon her beloved master —\n“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually\nclosed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the\nMark. “I shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my\nhouse, and it is therefore upon my authority —”\n“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand\nfrom his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand,\nLucius! How dare you!

There is so much you do not under-\nstand. . . .”\nHe felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut\nit out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present.\n“Go!” Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just\ngo!”\nThey caught hold of the elf’s outstretched fingers. There was\nanother loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander\nvanished.\n“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads.\n“Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?”\nHarry and Ron stared at each other.\n“Draco — no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!”\nFootsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence.\nHarry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for\nmore noises from the cellar.\n“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron.\nThey had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw\nthe absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,”\nHarry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps out-\nside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.\n“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door.\nI am coming in.”\nThe door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the\napparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature\n469\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nsuns floating in midair.

You owe me, Wormtail!”\nThe silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He\nwrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Worm-\ntail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with\nfear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his\nhand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and\nhe continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that\nmoment of weakness.\n“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand\nfrom his other hand.\nWandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes\nhad slid from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers\nwere moving inexorably toward his own throat.\n“No —”\nWithout pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but\nthere was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given\nhis most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and use-\nless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his\nmoment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.\n470\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nMALFOY MANOR\n“No!”\nRon had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried\nto pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat,\nbut it was no use.

She was barely stirring.\n“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?”\nHarry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling\nof his scar.\n“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.”\n“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?”\n“Yes,” said the goblin.\nRelief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.\n“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed"

His\ntrue surroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal\nwizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged\nat the summons he felt — he had warned them, he had told them\nto summon him for nothing less than Potter.

Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled\nabout; Harry yelled, “Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto\nthe hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco’s, Narcissa’s, and Grey-\nback’s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a\nsofa to avoid them.\n“STOP OR SHE DIES!”\nPanting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa.

Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw\nherself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in\nan explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and\nthe goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor.

Harry fell\nto his knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower\nGriphook gently to the ground.\n“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook\nmerely whimpered.\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to\nbe a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he\nthought he saw movement outside it.\n“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two\nwands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed\nto. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?”\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him.\n“DOBBY!”\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes.\nTogether, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife\nprotruding from the elf’s heaving chest.\n“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage,\ntoward the people moving there. “HELP!”\n475\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles,\nfriends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading\nacross Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to\nHarry with a look of supplication.

Harry’s voice was\nstill saying, “Dobby . . . Dobby . . .” even though he knew that the\nelf had gone where he could not call him back.\nAfter a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to\nthe right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gath-\nering around him as he knelt over the elf.\n“Hermione?” he said suddenly. “Where is she?”\n“Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.”\nHarry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and\npulled the sharp blade from the elf’s body, then dragged off his own\njacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.\nThe sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry lis-\ntened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he\n477\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\ncould take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured\nGriphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was\nmaking suggestions about burying the elf. Harry agreed without\nreally knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at\nthe tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of\nhis mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw\nVoldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor.\nHis rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby seemed to\ndiminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry\nfrom across a vast, silent ocean.\n“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry\nwas fully conscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a\nspade?”\nAnd shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the\ngrave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden,\nbetween bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual\nwork, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat\nand every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.\nHis scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was\napart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his\nmind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him\nto learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to pos-\nsess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his\nthoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby.\nGrief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of\ncourse, would have said that it was love. . . .\nOn Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth,\nsubsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar.

They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades\nof their own, and together they worked in silence until the hole\nseemed deep enough.\nHarry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the\nedge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he\nplaced upon the elf’s bare feet.

Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur’s\ncoats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of\nthe elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.\n“There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”\nHarry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that\nhe might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last\ntime upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he\nremembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden\nchairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation\nof Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble\ntomb.

He picked\nup one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where\nDobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.\nThere were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could\nnot now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remem-\nber wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter\nof the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the\nrock.\nSlowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared\nupon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done\nit more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark\nthe spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up\nagain, the stone read:\nHERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.\nHe looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then\nwalked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of\nthose things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken\nshape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.\nThey were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little\nhall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room\n481\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nwas light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning\nbrightly in the fireplace.

I need to talk to them. It’s important.”\nHe heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense\nof purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of\ntheir faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled.\n“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands,\nstill covered in mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them,\nstraightaway.”\n482\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\nHe walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window\noverlooking the sea.

There was\nhardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or\nHallows?\n“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.”\nHis heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just\ncleared an enormous obstacle.\n“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way.\nHarry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking\nback.\n484\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\n“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who\nhad been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting\nroom.\nThey both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.\n“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing —\ncoming up with that story when she was hurting you like that —”\nHermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed\nsqueeze.\n“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked.\n“You’ll see. Come on.”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto\na small landing. Three doors led off it.\n“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room.\nIt too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise."

Three doors led off it.\n“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room.\nIt too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise.\nHarry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular\nview, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took\nthe chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.\nBill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down\ncarefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left,\nclosing the door upon them all.\n“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your\nlegs?”\n“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.”\nHe was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange\nlook: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow\nskin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his\nshoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but\nnot by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human’s.\n“You probably don’t remember —” Harry began.\n485\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“— that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first\ntime you ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember,\nHarry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.”\nHarry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up.\nHarry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this in-\nterview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of\nmaking a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to\napproach his request, the goblin broke the silence.\n“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous.\n“I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\nGriphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black\neyes.\n“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.”\n“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.\n“You dug the grave.”\n“So?”\nGriphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being\nsneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to\nhim whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gath-\nered himself for the attack.\n“Griphook, I need to ask —”\n“You also rescued a goblin.”\n“What?”\n“You brought me here. Saved me.”\n“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently.\n“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he\ntwisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very\nodd wizard.”\n486\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\n“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you\ncan give it to me.”\nThe goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to\nfrown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.\n“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.”"

He closed his mind firmly. He needed to\ndeal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry\nas though he had gone mad.\n“Harry —” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.\n“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a\nlittle as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”\n“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.”\n“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My\nbirthday, seven years ago.”\n“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the gob-\nlin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left\nGringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached.\n“Its protection was minimal.”\n“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guess-\ning its protection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs\nto the Lestranges.”\nHe saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but\nthere would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given\nhis answer.\n“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all. If\nyou seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours —”\n“Thief, you have been warned, beware — yeah, I know, I remember,”\n487\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\nsaid Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not\ntrying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?”\nThe goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on\nHarry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowl-\nedge its pain or its invitation.\n“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not\nseek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry\nPotter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the re-\nspect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.”\n“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his\nears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts north-\nward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door.\n“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long\nbeen contested between wizards and goblins.”\n“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron.\n“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-\nlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of ex-\ntending our powers!”\n“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron.\n“You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you\ndo. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have\nnever —”\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color."

It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys’!”\nAs she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to\nreveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.\n“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked.\n“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron\nfidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t\nwant You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!”\nThe goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had\nshown Harry.\n“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked\nabruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real\none.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you\nalready know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.”\n“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked\nHarry. “Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?”\nHis heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his ef-\nforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.\nThe goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.\n“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts.

He would have seen the bank from the outside,\nthough, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.”\nHarry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and\nHermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to\nOllivander.\n“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Grin-\ngotts vault.

He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and\ntortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated,\nthe bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.\nHis great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands\nthat lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry\nsat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising\nsun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and\nthe freshly dug grave.\n“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.\n“My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us. I\nthought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never\nthank you . . . enough.”\n“We were glad to do it.”\nHarry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was\nhardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else\nto attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had\nmade his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feign-\ning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck\nand took out the two halves of his broken wand.\n“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.”\n“Anything. Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly.\n“Can you mend this? Is it possible?”\nOllivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two\nbarely connected halves into his palm.\n“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous\nvoice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”\n“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you — ?”\n“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand\n492\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\nthat has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any\nmeans that I know of.”\nHarry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless.\nHe took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch\naround his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shat-\ntered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had\ntaken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the\nMalfoys’.\n“Can you identify these?” Harry asked.\nThe wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to\nhis faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flex-\ning it slightly.\n“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve-and-three-\nquarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix\nLestrange.”\n“And this one?”\nOllivander performed the same examination.\n“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably\nspringy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”\n“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?”\n“Perhaps not. If you took it —”"

Of course, the manner of taking mat-\nters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however,\nwhere a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.”\nThere was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of\nthe sea.\n“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like\nthey can think for themselves.”\n493\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has\nalways been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”\n“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?”\nasked Harry.\n“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel\nyour magic through almost any instrument. The best results, how-\never, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between\nwizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attrac-\ntion, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning\nfrom the wizard, the wizard from the wand.”\nThe sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful\nsound.\n“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can\nI use it safely?”\n“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the con-\nquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.”\n“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand\nout of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.\n“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches.\nBrittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for\nPeter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bid-\nding, and do it well, than another wand.”\n“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry.\n“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Har-\nry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex\nand mysterious branch of magic.”\n“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true pos-\nsession of a wand?” asked Harry.\nOllivander swallowed.\n494\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\n“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.”\n“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate\nquickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure\nthat Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. “Legends\nabout a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand\nby murder.”\nOllivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light\ngray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what\nlooked like fear.\n“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered.\n“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry.\n“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at"

She looked flabbergasted.\n“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones,\n“had always been happy with the wand I made him — yew and\nphoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered\nthe connection of the twin cores.

There are gaps, of course, and long\nones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but\nalways it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that\nthose who are learned in wandlore recognize.

They have the ring of authenticity.”\n“So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Her-\nmione asked hopefully.\n“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do\nnot know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the\nfact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in\nwizards.

He would yield very soon, because he needed to\nknow that his theory was right.

How Grindelwald found out that\nGregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid\nenough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.”\nVoldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him\nstanding there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, com-\ning closer and closer.\n“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful.\nAnd at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was\nthe only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat\nhim, and he took the Elder Wand.”\n“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then — where\nis it now?”\n499\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the\ncliff-top garden.\n“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it\nbefore he does!”\n“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself,\nbut clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it\nis. He’s there now.”\n“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this —"

We could have gone — we could still go —”\n“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermi-\none’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want\nme to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.”\n“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron.\n“I’m not supposed to . . .

Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure to\ndisappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see\nwhere he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows,\nand he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon\nhimself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own\neyes.\nAnd he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the out-\nlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . .\n500\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE WANDMAKER\nAnd here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The\nwhite marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape.\nHe felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of\npurpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting\nthat this would be its last great act.\nThe tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was\nas long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.\nThe wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken,\nyet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the\ncrooked nose: He felt amused derision.

Wherever Harry went inside the tiny\ncottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the\nsea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent\nmuch of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded\ncottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea,\nand the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.\nThe enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand\nstill scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing\nnot to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help\nvoicing whenever they were together.\n“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time\nto get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made\nyou ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder\nWand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?”\n502\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSHELL COTTAGE\nHarry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered\nwhether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Volde-\nmort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfacto-\nrily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct\nthe internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded\nfeebler to him.\nThe odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just\nas confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder\nWand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that\nthe way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to\nbe considered.\n“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and\nagain. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.”\nBut the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less\nthan the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living\nDumbledore’s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the\ndark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering\nwhether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken\nthe other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over\nhim again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the\ncliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained\nbefore he died.\n“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the\ncottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the\ncottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found\nhim; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their\nargument.\n“Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!”\n“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry,\n503\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nwho continued to gaze at the horizon. “The silver doe.

There\nwas little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that\nmuch. “He would have gone on.”\n“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry\ncould say any more, a voice behind them said, “’Arry?”\nFleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in\nthe breeze.\n“’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest\nbedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.”\nHer dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was\nclear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.\nGriphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest\nof the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept\nby night.

I’ve got gold.”\n“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.”\nHis black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes.\n“I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.”\nHarry’s spirits plummeted.\n“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.”\n“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.”\n“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the\nLestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we\nget into the vault.”\nHe had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.\n“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to\nwhich I have no right!”\n“The sword’s ours —”\n“It is not,” said the goblin.\n“We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s —”\n“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” demanded the\ngoblin, sitting up straight.\n“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?”"

Harry glanced at the other two, then\nsaid, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could\nyou give us a few minutes?”\nThe goblin nodded, looking sour.\nDownstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fire-\nplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron\nsaid, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.”\n“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by\nGryffindor?”\n“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates\nover what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s\nno account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.”\n“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wiz-\nards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should\nthink ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”\n“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,” said Her-\nmione. “They’ve been treated brutally in the past.”\n“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?”\nsaid Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.”\n“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most under-\nhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us,\nis it?”\nThere was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the\nproblem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna\nwas arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.\n“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s\n506\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSHELL COTTAGE\nthis? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the\nvault, and then he can have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there?\nWe switch them, and give him the fake.”\n“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Her-\nmione. “He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!”\n“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes —”\nHe quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.\n“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then\ndouble-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards,\nRon?”\nRon’s ears had turned red.\n“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of!

I’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made\nswords and you can gift wrap it.”\nSilence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin\nwould accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something\nas valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable\nweapon against the Horcruxes.\nHe closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush\nof the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword\nwas unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor;\nGryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard\nwho had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . .\n“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook.\nMaybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the\ngoblin version of history’s right?”\n507\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione.\n“Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry.\nHe took a deep breath.\n“We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get\ninto that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly\nwhen he can have it.”\nA grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however,\nlooked alarmed.\n“Harry, we can’t —”\n“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of\nthe Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.”\n“But that could be years!” said Hermione.\n“I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying . . . really.”\nHarry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He\nremembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to\nNurmengard: . He pushed the idea away.\nFor the Greater Good\nWhat choice did they have?\n“I don’t like it,” said Hermione.\n“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted.\n“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s\ngo and tell him.”\nBack in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to\nphrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the\nsword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt\nirritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However,\nGriphook had eyes for nobody but Harry.\n“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword\nof Gryffindor if I help you?”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n508\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSHELL COTTAGE\n“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand.\nHarry took it and shook.

It\nis one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families\nstore their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest\nand best protected. . . .”\nThey remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time.\nSlowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after prob-\nlem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice\nPotion was greatly depleted.\n“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione,\ntilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight.\n“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s\nhand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.\nThe other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice\nthat something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nonly emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although\nHarry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thought-\nful, concerned.\nThe longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he\ndid not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly blood-\nthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed\nto relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards\n509\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nto reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was\nshared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed\nGriphook.\nThe goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after\nhis legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his\nroom, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry\noutburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement\ncould not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the over-\ncrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting,\ninstead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi.\nHarry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that\nthe goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him;\nhis fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding,\nthat Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.\n“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped\nher prepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of\nthis.”\nShe had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for\nGriphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since\nhe had been attacked by Greyback.

Lupin’s news\nseemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a\nwhile from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating.\nOnly the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmo-\nsphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now oc-\ncupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed\nthis, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.\n“No . . . no . . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declin-\ning yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his\ntraveling cloak back around himself.\n“Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few\ndays’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you —”\nHe fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women\nand grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into\nthe wild night.\n“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen\ntogether, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!”\nAs Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled\n515\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\nthe door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the\nothers, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence.\n“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to\nget an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.”\nBill hesitated.\n“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”\nIt was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to\ndeny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.\n“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since\nI left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards\nand goblins, I have goblin friends — or, at least, goblins I know\nwell, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated.\n“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you\npromised him in return?”\n“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”\nThe kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring\nthrough more empty goblets.\n“Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.”\nShe backed out and he closed the door again.\n“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any\nkind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bar-\ngain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin\nnotions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as\nhuman ones.”\nHarry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake\nhad stirred inside him.\n“What do you mean?” he asked.\n“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill.\n516\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSHELL COTTAGE\n“Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for cen-\nturies — but you’ll know all that from History of Magic.

There has\nbeen fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been\ninnocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those\nat Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be\ntrusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect\nfor goblin ownership.”\n“I respect —” Harry began, but Bill shook his head.\n“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless\nthey have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true mas-\nter of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made\nobjects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.”\n“But if it was bought —”\n“— then they would consider it rented by the one who had\npaid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea\nof goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw\nGriphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disap-\nproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it\nought to have been returned to the goblins once the original pur-\nchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects,\npassing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little\nmore than theft.”\nHarry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill\nguessed more than he was letting on.\n“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into\nthe sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins,\nHarry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to\nrenege on a promise to a goblin.”\n517\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\n“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll\nbear that in mind.”\nAs he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him,\nborn no doubt of the wine he had drunk.

It feels\nall wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me. . . .

This is the wand that killed Sirius!”\nHarry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and\nwas visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryf-\nfindor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.\n“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Olli-\nvander could have made me another one too.”\nMr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She\nwas out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in\nthe late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers,\nwas watching rather gloomily.\nHarry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once be-\nlonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to\ndiscover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had\ndone. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret\nworkings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s prob-\nlem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking\nit personally from Bellatrix.\nThe door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry\nreached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to\nhim, but regretted his action at once: He could tell that the gob-\nlin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said,\n“We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve\ntold Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not\nto get up to see us off.”\nThey had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need\n520\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRINGOTTS\nto transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and\nFleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the\nbetter.

He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not\noverheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all,\nhe longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when\nthey were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s\nsword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had\nbeen impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the\ngoblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more\nthan five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,”\ngrowled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the\nedges of doors. With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help\nsuspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery.\nHermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that\nHarry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to\ndo it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch\na few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better\nthan “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.”\nHarry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours,\nhe thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had\n521\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\ninfiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination,\nalmost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety,\nnagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going\nto go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that\nGriphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared\nfor all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt\nuneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too\nwas awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so\nHarry did not speak.\nIt was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of\ntheir sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into\nthe garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The\ndawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May.\nHarry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky\nand listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the\ncliff: He was going to miss the sound.\nSmall green shoots were forcing their way up through the red\nearth of Dobby’s grave now; in a year’s time the mound would be\ncovered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf’s name had al-\nready acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could\nhardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry\nached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down\non the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where\nto come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the\nlittle pouch still strung around his neck, through which he could\nfeel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had\nseen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made\nhim look around."

Though Harry knew\nperfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress\na shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black\nhair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as\nthey rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione\nthrough Bellatrix’s low voice.\n“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come\nhere so I can do you. . . .”\n“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long —”\n“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome —”\n“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter,\ntry and do it the way you did last time.”\nHermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath\nas she transformed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was\nto be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to\nthe malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile\nHarry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility\nCloak.\n“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”\nIt was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only,\nHarry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now\nlong and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freck-\nles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.\n“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go,\nthen?”\nAll three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and\nsilent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward\n523\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nthe point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm\nstopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past\nthe gate, Griphook spoke.\n“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”\nHarry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his\nhands linked in front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry\ndisliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with\nwhich he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of\nthe beaded bag and threw it over them both.\n“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t\nsee a thing. Let’s go.”\nHarry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, con-\ncentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that\nwas the entrance to Diagon Alley.

At once the bricks began to whirl\nand spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider\nand wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled\nstreet that was Diagon Alley.\nIt was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were\nhardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much\naltered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his\nfirst term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever\nwere boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to\nthe Dark Arts had been created since his last visit.

Before\nthey could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry\nfrom behind them.\n“Why, Madam Lestrange!”\nHarry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around\nHarry’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair\nand a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.\n“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that mo-\nment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn\nherself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as\nshe could muster:\n“And what do you want?”\nTravers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.\n“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled\nsideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear.\n“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my\npresence is not welcome . . .”\nHarry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of the Death\nEaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.\n526\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRINGOTTS\n“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to\ncover up her mistake. “How are you?”\n“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about,\nBellatrix.”\n“Really?

If this was true, and\nBellatrix was not supposed to be out in public —\n“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faith-\nfully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bel-\nlatrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as\ngood with him as mine is, Travers.”\nThough the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less\nsuspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned.\n“How did it offend you?”\n“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione\ncoolly.\n“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers.\n“While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them\nactually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m\na witch, sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!’” he said in a squeaky\nimpersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand — but whose\nwand,” said Travers curiously, “are you using at the moment, Bel-\nlatrix?

Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her\non the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.\nThe goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in\nparticular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over\na tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.\nHermione stepped forward.\n“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear\nme!

The\ngoblin took Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then said, “Ah,\nyou have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!”\n“What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine —”\n“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still\nthe goblins all around were watching. “But how could you have\ndone, which wandmaker did you use?”\nHarry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he\nmuttered, “Imperio!” once more.\n“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand,\n“yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands\nrequire a little breaking in, don’t you?”\nHermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous\nrelief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.\nThe old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a\nyounger goblin approached.\n“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away\nand returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be\nfull of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good!\nSo, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin,\n531\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nhopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, “I shall take\nyou to your vault.”\nHe appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily to-\nward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers\nwas now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open.\nRon was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding\nTravers with confusion.\n“Wait — Bogrod!”\nAnother goblin came scurrying around the counter.\n“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “For-\ngive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the\nvault of Lestrange.”\nHe whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin\nshook him off.\n“I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange wishes to\nvisit her vault. . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way,\nplease . . .”\nAnd, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors\nleading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still\nrooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his deci-\nsion: With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them,\nwalking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed\ninto the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flam-\ning torches.\n“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed\nbehind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.

But there will not be room for the\nwizard.”\nHarry pointed his wand at Travers.\n“Imperio!”\nThe wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart\npace.\n“What are you making him do?”\n“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who\nwhistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the\ntracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could\nhear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered\ninto it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione\ncrammed together in the back.\nWith a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled\npast Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the\ncart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages,\nsloping downward all the time.

Harry heard\nGriphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They zoomed\nthrough it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and mouth: He could not see\nor breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they\nwere all thrown out of it.

They were\nrealizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces.\n“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet\nand looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew\nnow, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment,\nall magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Grin-\ngotts, they have set off defenses against us!”\nHarry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag,\nand hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he\n534\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRINGOTTS\nhad not lost the Invisibility Cloak.

And we need the Clankers!”\n“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone\npassage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from\nbrain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his be-\nfuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron\nhurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.\n“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and\nshe pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!”\nThey saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it\nflew up the passageway.\n“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!”\n“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried\non foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their\nwake like an old dog.\n“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry.

However, we have the means to control it. It has learned\nwhat to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.”\nRon passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a\nnumber of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud,\nringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed\nthem out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.\n“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermi-\none. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and\nBogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.”\nThey advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers,\nand the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that\nthe inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The\ndragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see\nit trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vi-\ncious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to\nfear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.\n“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry,\nwho turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed,\npressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away\nto reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with\ngolden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures\n— some with long spines, others with drooping wings — potions\nin jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.\n536\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRINGOTTS\n“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault.\nHe had described Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if\nit was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did\nnot know what it looked like.

And\nhurry, we have very little time!”\n“Lumos!”\nHarry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon\nglittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a\nhigh shelf amongst a jumble of chains.

But as it fell,\nit split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a\ngreat clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every\ndirection, the original impossible to discern amongst them.\n“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.\n“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook.\n“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are\nworthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will\neventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”\n“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as\nhe said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his\n537\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\nfoot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the\nspot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.\n“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron.\n“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and\ngold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles — otherwise see\nif you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle —”\nThey directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning\ncautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against\nanything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the\nground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely\nroom to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat,\nso that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight passed over\nshields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling;\nhigher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an\nobject that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.\n“It’s there, it’s up there!”\nRon and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little\ngolden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had be-\nlonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of\nHepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.\n“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching\nanything?” asked Ron.\n“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her\ndesperation what Griphook had told them during their planning\nsessions.\n“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.\n“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you\nwant the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than —\nwait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!”\n538\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRINGOTTS\nHermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag,\nrummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword."

The cold was biting deeper and deeper into\nHarry’s flesh. He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street,\ngroping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound.

He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was\nso strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same\nimpression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and\nHarry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and de-\nspised him for it.\n“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Her-\nmione in a low voice.\n“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the\npeople my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state\nthan if he’d left ’em well alone.”\n“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.\n563\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.\n“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are\nyou — are you talking about your sister?”\nAberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the\nwords he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.\n“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by\nthree Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through\nthe back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no\nwitch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I\nexpect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she\ncouldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to\nstop the little freak doing it.”\nHermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly\nsick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his\nanger and the intensity of his pain.\n“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She\nwouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward\nand drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control\nit, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was\nsweet and scared and harmless.\n“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aber-\nforth, “and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban\nfor it. He never said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had\nknown what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in\nSt. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to\nthe International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with\nmagic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it\nin any longer.\n“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about\n564\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MISSING MIRROR\nshe was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her\ncalm and happy.\n“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy\nseemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard.\n“Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home,\nreading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his\ncorrespondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,’”"

She\nliked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my\nmother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her\nrages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.\n“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said Ab-\nerforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had\none of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . .\nit was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was\nkilled.”\nHarry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not\nwant to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry won-\ndered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether,\nin fact, he had ever spoken about it.\n“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge.\nThe pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge\nwent off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the fam-\nily. Ha!”\nAberforth spat into the fire.\n“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school,\nI’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my\neducation and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown\nfor Mr. Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-mad\n565\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\nsister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day.

Grand plans for the benefit of\nall Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that\nmatter, when Albus was working for the greater good?\n“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly\ntime for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em,\nface-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at\nHarry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry\nand angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better\ngive it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t\ntake her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re\nmaking your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a follow-\ning.

Didn’t I understand,\nmy poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the\nworld, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles\ntheir place?\n“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and\nhe pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my\nbrother’s best friend — and Albus was trying to stop him, and then\n566\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MISSING MIRROR\nall three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs\nset her off, she couldn’t stand it —”\nThe color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had\nsuffered a mortal wound.\n“— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know\nwhat she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could\nhave been any of us — and she was dead.”\nHis voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the\nnearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was\nalmost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He\nwished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean\nof it.\n“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered.\n“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”\nHe wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.\n“’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record\nalready, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to\nhis account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he?

He started screaming, plead-\ning with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . .\nhurt me instead.’”\nRon and Hermione were staring at Harry.

After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure,\nPotter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good\nthan in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like\nmy little sister?”\nA shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.\n“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.\n“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth.\n“Why didn’t he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to\nsurvive’?”\n“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes\nyou’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes\nyou’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!”\n“You’re seventeen, boy!”\n“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given\nup!”\n“Who says I’ve given up?”\n“‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’” Harry repeated. “‘You-\nKnow-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s\nkidding themselves.’”\n“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-\nKnow-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to\n568\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MISSING MIRROR\nkeep going until I succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know\nhow this might end. I’ve known it for years.”\nHe waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He\nmerely scowled.\n“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t\nhelp us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find\na way in ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great\ntime to mention it.”\nAberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the\neyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared\nhis throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and ap-\nproached the portrait of Ariana.\n“You know what to do,” he said.\nShe smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits\nusually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed\nto be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight\nfigure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.\n“Er — what — ?” began Ron.\n“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know\nthey’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, de-\nmentors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the\nschool from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so\nheavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside\nit, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies . . . well,\nthat’s your lookout, isn’t it?

But there was somebody else with her now,\nsomeone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking ex-\ncited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared\nto have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped\nand torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their\nheads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung\nforward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tun-\nnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his\nrobes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave\na roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I\nknew you’d come!

The longer Harry looked at\nNeville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow\nand purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of\nunkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless,\nhis battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione\nand said again, “I knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a\nmatter of time!”\n“Neville, what’s happened to you?”\n“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the\nhead. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get go-\ning then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple\nmore people on the way.”\n“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you\n571\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nmean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Cater-\nwauling Charm on the whole village!”\n“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,”\nsaid Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here,\nwill you? Thanks a lot.”\nNeville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb\nup onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then\nNeville. Harry addressed Aberforth.\n“I don’t know how to thank you.

I went through it and met Aberforth.\nHe’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s\nthe one thing the room doesn’t really do.”\n“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of\nElemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.\n“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Sea-\nmus, “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them,\nand it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started\nturning up —”\n“— and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lav-\nender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now\nthat he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces.\nBoth Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan,\nAnthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.\n“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve\nbeen so many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on\nPotterwatch.” He pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into\nGringotts?”"

As\nhe turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the\nRoom of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ru-\nined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at\nhis feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole,\nand Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.\nWith an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind\nagain, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Require-\nment, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.\n“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down?\nI expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?”\n“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell\nthem without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of\none of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Volde-\nmort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.\n“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him\nthat they understood.\n“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s\nthe plan?”\n“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to\nprevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was\nstill burning. “Well, there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and\nI — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.”\nNobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked\nconfused.\n“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”\n579\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\n“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar,\ntrying to soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need\nto do —”\n“What is it?”\n“I — I can’t tell you.”\nThere was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows\ncontracted.\n“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-\nKnow-Who, right?”\n“Well, yeah —”\n“Then we’ll help you.”\nThe other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some\nenthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their\nchairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.\n“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot\nin the last few hours. “We — we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do\nit — alone.”\n“Why?” asked Neville.\n“Because . . .” In his desperation to start looking for the miss-\ning Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and\nHermione about where they might commence their search, Harry"

Everyone in here’s\nproven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.”\n“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to\nsay, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind\nhim.\n“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you\nmust be here!”\nIt was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and\nran to hug his best friend.\n“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”\n“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing here? How\ndid you — ?”\n“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I\npromised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know.\nWe all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution.\nThat we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”\n“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly. “Isn’t it,\nHarry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?”\n“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but\nthat’s not what we came back for.

His\nheart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in\nthe wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny\ngave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully ap-\npreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased\nto see her.\n“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand\nin answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s\nturned into a railway station.”\nHarry’s mouth fell open.

We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need\nthem.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to\ndo everything alone, Harry.”\nHarry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening\nto split again.

That’s sort of the point.”\n“When was it lost?” asked Harry.\n“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Pro-\nfessor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself.\nPeople have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws,\n“nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?”\nThey all shook their heads.\n“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.\n“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed\nto have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”\n“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons —”\nBut Harry cut across Luna.\n“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”\nThey all shook their heads again.

He gave the wall a little\npush.\n585\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\nIt melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced\nback and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were stand-\ning in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows,\nfumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s\nMap. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and\nLuna’s dots at last.\n“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch mov-\ning away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”\nThey crept off.\nHarry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but\nnever had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much de-\npended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares\nof moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets\ncreaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond\nwhich who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking\nthe Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to\nallow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He\nexpected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear\nwas Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first,\ntelltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.\n“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling\nhim toward a spiral staircase.\nThey climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up\nhere before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and\nno keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze\nknocker in the shape of an eagle.\nLuna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in\nmidair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the\nsilence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of\n586\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LOST DIADEM\nthe eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice\nsaid, “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?”\n“Hmm . . .

Isn’t there just a password?”\n“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna.\n“What if you get it wrong?”\n“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said\nLuna. “That way you learn, you see?”\n“Yeah . . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone\nelse, Luna.”\n“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I\nthink the answer is that a circle has no beginning.”\n“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open.\nThe deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular"

Graceful\narched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-\nand-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular\nview of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and\npainted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet.\nThere were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite\nthe door stood a tall statue of white marble.\nHarry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen\nat Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed,\nto dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and\nshe seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her\nface, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet\nhad been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not un-\nlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words\n587\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\netched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed\nup onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.\n“‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’”\n“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice.\nHarry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the\nfloor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing\nbefore him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby\nforefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.\n588\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T H I R T Y\nTHE SACKING OF\nSEVERUS SNAPE\nT\nhe moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar\nburned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and\nhe was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea\nwas washing around him and there was triumph in his heart — They\nhave the boy.\nA loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented,\nhe raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling\nforward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases\ntinkled.\n“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said\nLuna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought\nit would be.”\nAnd sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble.

Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGona-\ngall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater,\nand said, “Imperio.”\n594\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SACKING OF\nSEVERUS SNAPE\nAmycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand,\nthen shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over\nalong with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto.\nProfessor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shim-\nmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the\nCarrows, binding them tightly together.\n“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him\nagain with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are\nhere —”\nAs she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through\nHarry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down\nupon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden\nlocket lay safe beneath the surface —\n“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back: He\nwas clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.\n“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m\nacting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to\nfind! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the\ncastle — it’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a\nfew more or less, not now —” not now he knows I’m attacking Hor-\ncruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head.\n“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of\ndawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.\n“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-\nNamed while you search for this — this object.”\n“Is that possible?”\n“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are\nrather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold\n595\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY\nhim off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it.

With the Floo\nNetwork under observation, and Apparition impossible within the\ngrounds —”\n“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the\npassageway leading into the Hog’s Head.\n“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students —”\n“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are\nconcentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in\nanyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.”"

She pointed her wand at\nthe Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself\naround them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled\nbeneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures.\n“Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put\nthat Cloak back on.”\nShe marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her\nwand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings\naround their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spi-\nral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and\nLuna hurried back down.\nAlong the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left\nthem; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the\nfloor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.\n596\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SACKING OF\nSEVERUS SNAPE\nThey had descended two more floors when another set of quiet\nfootsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard\nthem first: He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s\nMap, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to\nbecome aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready\nto duel, and said, “Who’s there?”\n“It is I,” said a low voice.\nFrom behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.\nHatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten\nthe details of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes,\nforgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin\nface, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing\nnightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too\nwas holding his wand ready for a fight.\n“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.\n“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Profes-\nsor McGonagall.\nSnape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGona-\ngall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there.\nHarry held his wand up too, ready to attack.\n“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had ap-\nprehended an intruder.”\n“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that\nimpression?”\nSnape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the\nDark Mark was branded into his skin.\n“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eat-\ners have your own private means of communication, I forgot.”\n597\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY\nSnape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still prob-\ning the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with\nan air of hardly noticing what he was doing.\n“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors,\nMinerva.”"

But all seems calm.”\nSnape looked into her eyes.\n“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I\nmust insist —”\nProfessor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have be-\nlieved: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry\nthought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of\nhis Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off bal-\nance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out\nof its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna\nout of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire\nthat filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape —\nThen it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGona-\ngall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to\nbecome a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by\nforcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs\nthe daggers sank, one after another, into its breast —\n“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still\nshielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick\nand Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their night-\n598\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SACKING OF\nSEVERUS SNAPE\nclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the\nrear.\n“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do no more\nmurder at Hogwarts!”\nFlitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had\ntaken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free\nof the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers:\nHarry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into\nthe wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in\nfull flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after\nhim: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he\nheard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”\n“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.\nHarry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corri-\ndor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted\nclassroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were\nstanding at a smashed window.\n“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran\ninto the room.\n“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring\nFlitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.\n“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumble-\ndore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned\na few tricks from his master.”"

We need to put in place every protection of which we are\ncapable while Potter does what he needs to do.”\n“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep\nout You-Know-Who indefinitely?” squeaked Flitwick.\n“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout.\n“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between\nthe two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I sug-\ngest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather\nour students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated,\nthough if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I\nthink they ought to be given the chance.”\n“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the\ndoor. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with\nmy House.”\nAnd as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering,\n“Tentacula.

It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been\nin there.

Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school un-\ntouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.\n“You have until midnight.”\nThe silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every\neye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen\nin the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose\nfrom the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she\nraised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there!\nSomeone grab him!”\nBefore Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The\nGryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry,\nbut the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the\nsame moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to\nHarry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awe-\nstruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled\nfrom beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.\n“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a\nclipped voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the\nrest of your House could follow.”\nHarry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the\nSlytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.\n“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.\nSlowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was com-\npletely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated\nwhile their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind,\n610\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BATTLE OF\nHOGWARTS\nand half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Profes-\nsor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the\nunderage on their way.\n“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”\nHarry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the\nGryffindor table.\n“Where are Ron and Hermione?”\n“Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.\nBut he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised\nplatform to address those who had remained behind.\n“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act\nfast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hog-\nwarts and the Order of the Phoenix.

Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”\nHe had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten\nthat the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The\n611\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\ninexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven\nevery other thought from his mind.\n“Then go, Potter, go!”\n“Right — yeah —”\nHe sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall\nagain, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students.\nHe allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them,\nbut at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and\npanic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself,\nto concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as\nfrantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass.

He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty\npassage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and\npulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck.

The sound of hundreds of people marching\ntoward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he\nreturned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions,\ntrying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there\nwas much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowl-\ning over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there\nyounger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately\nfor friends or siblings. . . .\nHarry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the en-\ntrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.\n“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”\nHe forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reach-\ning the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of\nGryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.\n“Harry! My dear boy!”\nNick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s\nfelt as though they had been thrust into icy water.\n“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw\nTower?”\nNearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.\n“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you\nrequire — ?”\n“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”\n“Let’s see. . . .”\n613\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nNick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and\nthither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.\n“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long\nhair.”\nHarry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing\nfinger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her,\nraised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.\nHarry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into\nwhich she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the pas-\nsage, still gliding smoothly away from him.\n“Hey — wait — come back!”\nShe consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground.\nHarry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair\nand floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud.\nClose to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times\nin the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken.\n“You’re the Gray Lady?”\nShe nodded but did not speak.\n“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”\n“That is correct.”\nHer tone was not encouraging.\n“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell\nme about the lost diadem.”\nA cold smile curved her lips.\n“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.”\n“WAIT!”\nHe had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening\nto overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front\nof him: It was a quarter to midnight.\n614\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BATTLE OF\nHOGWARTS\n“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts,\nI’ve got to find it, fast.”"

But then, you must know what happened\nto it!”\n“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious\neffort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase\nyour chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord —”\n“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry\nsaid fiercely. “There’s no time to explain — but if you care about\nHogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell\nme anything you know about the diadem!”\nShe remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him,\nand a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had\nknown anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who\n615\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nhad surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and\nmade to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.\n“I stole the diadem from my mother.”\n“You — you did what?”\n“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. “I\nsought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother.\nI ran away with it.”\nHe did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence,\nand did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on:\n“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone,\nbut pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dread-\nful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.\n“Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she\nwas desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had\nlong loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew\nthat he would not rest until he had done so.”\nHarry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.\n“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused\nto return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a\nhot-tempered man.

You mean — ?”\n“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside\nthe cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest.\n“When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse.\nHe took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill\nhimself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of\npenitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly.\n616\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BATTLE OF\nHOGWARTS\n“And . . . and the diadem?”\n“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blun-\ndering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow\ntree.\n“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?”\n“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my\nmother’s reach.”\n“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously\nfrom confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him\nwhat she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told\nsomeone this story, haven’t you? Another student?”\nShe closed her eyes and nodded.\n“I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . .\nto understand . . . to sympathize. . . .”\nYes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood\nHelena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she\nhad little right.\n“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,”\nHarry muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . .”\nSo Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost\ndiadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung\nforest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as\nsoon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin\nand Burkes.\nAnd wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an\nexcellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place\nto lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?\nBut the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not\n617\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\nbeen left in that lowly tree. . . .

Saying it out loud enabled him\nto make sense of it all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way\nup to, or down from, Dumbledore’s office! But it was still worth\ntrying to get the job — then he might’ve got the chance to nick\nGryffindor’s sword as well — thank you, thanks!”\nHarry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered.

As he leapt\naside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the op-\nposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering,\nfrom the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.\n“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s\nattentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.\n“What the — ?”\n“Harry, yer here!

Time ter fight?”\n“Hagrid, where have you come from?”\n“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid\ngrimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme\nPotter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’.\nGet down, Fang.

Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around:\nrunning footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more\nflashes of light in the dark grounds.\n“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s\nheels, making the floorboards quake.\n“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn,\n“but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .”\nThe first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the\npassage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the"

Ron threw away the fangs and broom-\nstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he\nlifted Hermione off her feet.\n“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing\nhappened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still\nmore firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s\na war going on here!”\nRon and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each\nother.\n“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently\nbeen hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or\nnever, isn’t it?”\n“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted.\n“D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the\ndiadem?”\n625\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\n“Yeah — right — sorry —” said Ron, and he and Hermione set\nabout gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.\nIt was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor\nupstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of\nRequirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated se-\nverely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust\nfilled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of\ngreen and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew\nthe Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Look-\ning down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging\nwhat looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring\nhis displeasure.\n“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams\nechoed from close by.\n“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and\nsaw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next win-\ndow, which was missing several panes.

The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled\nand distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of\nlight where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except\nfor a solitary oil lamp.\nHe was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his\nthoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever\nfound, the room, like the Chamber, that you had to be clever and\ncunning and inquisitive to discover. . . .

It did noth-\ning to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been\nreprieved: But then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s\ncage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do any-\nthing more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and\nVoldemort spoke in Parseltongue.\n“Kill.”\nThere was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the\nlittle color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the\nsnake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted\ncage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor.\n“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.\nHe turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was\ntime to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would\n656\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE ELDER WAND\nnow do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the\nsnake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the\nfloor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept\nfrom the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent\nfloated after him in its huge protective sphere.\nBack in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He\nhad drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to\nshout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate\nand wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor.\n“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already\npointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch\ninto the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he\npulled himself up into the room.\nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching\nthe dying man: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s\nwhite face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at\nhis neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down\nupon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as\nhe tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front\nof his robes and pulled him close.\nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat.\n“Take . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .”\nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery\nblue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears\nand his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what\nto do —\nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands\nby Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his\n657\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\nwand.

A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline.\nTwo girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy\nwas watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair\nwas overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked\ndeliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have\nbelonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.\nHarry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine\nor ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed\nin his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging\nhigher and higher than her sister.\n“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.\nBut the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc\nand flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself sky-\nward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on\nthe playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the\nair, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.\n“Mummy told you not to!”\nPetunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals\non the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt\nup, hands on hips.\n“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”\n“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this.

The flower sat there, opening and closing its pet-\nals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.\n“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.\n“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the\nblossom and threw it back to the ground.\n“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s\nflight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she\nadded, and there was definite longing in her voice.\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself,\nbut had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and\nran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled,\nremained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance.\nA dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at\nLily.\n“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.\nSnape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the dis-\ntant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice\nand said, “I know what you are.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape.\nShe looked affronted.\n“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”\nShe turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.\n“No!” said Snape.

Lily took off the hat,\nhanded it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the\ncheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and\nthere was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up\nthe bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed\nto recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned\nher back on him.\nThe roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and\nhis father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when\n672\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\nonly a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall\ncalled Snape.\nHarry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat\nupon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.\nAnd Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away\nfrom Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where\nLucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted\nSnape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . .\nAnd the scene changed. . . .\nLily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently\narguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he\nreached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few\nyears seemed to have passed since their Sorting.\n“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying.\n“Best friends?”\n“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging\nround with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber!\nWhat do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried\nto do to Mary Macdonald the other day?”\nLily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into\nthe thin, sallow face.\n“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all —”\n“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny —”\n“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded\nSnape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold\nin his resentment.\n“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.\n“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that\nLupin. Where does he keep going?”\n673\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill —”\n“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.\n“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are\nyou so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re\ndoing at night?”\n“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone\nseems to think they are.”\nThe intensity of his gaze made her blush.\n“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice."

Saved?\nYou think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his\nfriends’ too! You’re not going to — I won’t let you —”\n“Let me? Let me?”\nLily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.\n“I didn’t mean — I just don’t want to see you made a fool of — He\nfancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched\nfrom him against his will. “And he’s not . . . everyone thinks . . .\nbig Quidditch hero —” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were render-\ning him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and\nfarther up her forehead.\n“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting\nacross Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and\nAvery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how\nyou can be friends with them.”\nHarry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mul-\nciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his\n674\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\nwhole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new\nspring in Snape’s step. . . .\nAnd the scene dissolved. . . .\nHarry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his\nO.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered\naway from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place be-\nneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat\ntogether. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what\nhappened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted\nhim; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no plea-\nsure to hear it again. . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and\nwent to Snape’s defense.

Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood\nwith her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the\nentrance to Gryffindor Tower.\n“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to\nsleep here.”\n“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood,\nit just —”\n“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve\nmade excuses for you for years.

Why should I be any different?”\nHe struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous\nlook she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . .\nThe corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-\nform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until\nhis surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn\nand cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches\nof a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the\nspot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something\nor for someone. . . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he\nknew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder,\nwondering what it was that Snape was waiting for —\nThen a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air:\nHarry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees\nand his wand had flown out of his hand.\n“Don’t kill me!”\n“That was not my intention.”\nAny sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by\nthe sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with\nhis robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from\nbelow in the light cast by his wand.\n676\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\n“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for\nme?”\n“No — no message — I’m here on my own account!”\nSnape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his\nstraggling black hair flying around him.\n“I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please —”\nDumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still\nflew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot\nwhere he and Snape faced each other.\n“What request could a Death Eater make of me?”\n“The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .”\n“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord\nVoldemort?”\n“Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why —\nit is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!”\n“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It\nspoke of a boy born at the end of July —”\n“You know what I mean!

Could you not ask for mercy for the\nmother, in exchange for the son?”\n“I have — I have asked him —”\n“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard\nso much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. “You\ndo not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They\ncan die, as long as you have what you want?”\nSnape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.\n677\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her — them — safe.\nPlease.”\n“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”\n“In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected\nhim to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”\nThe hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and\nsomething was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal.\nSnape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was stand-\ning over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised\nhis face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years\nof misery since leaving the wild hilltop.\n“I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .”\n“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dum-\nbledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord\nVoldemort would spare her?”\nSnape’s breathing was shallow.\n“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.\nWith a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irk-\nsome fly.\n“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember\nthe shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”\n“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone . . . dead . . .”\n“Is this remorse, Severus?”\n“I wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .”\n“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore\ncoldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your\nway forward is clear.”\nSnape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s\nwords appeared to take a long time to reach him.\n678\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\n“What — what do you mean?”\n“You know how and why she died.

Snape was pacing\nup and down in front of Dumbledore.\n“— mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-\nbreaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and\nimpertinent —”\n“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, with-\nout raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. “Other\nteachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably tal-\nented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.”\nDumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep\nan eye on Quirrell, won’t you?”\nA whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and\nDumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last\nstragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.\n“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.\n679\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he\nfears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Minis-\ntry after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumble-\ndore’s crooked-nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark\nburns.”\n“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger\nDavies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted\nto join him?”\n“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating\nfigures. “I am not such a coward.”\n“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor\nKarkaroff.

It\nwas nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike\nchair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand\ndangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering\nincantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with\nhis left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down\nDumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids\nfluttered and opened.\n“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on\nthat ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even\ntouch it?”\nMarvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was\ncracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.\nDumbledore grimaced.\n“I . . . was a fool.

How long do you think I\nhave?”\nDumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking\nfor a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell.\nMaybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread\neventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.”\nDumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live\nseemed a matter of little or no concern to him.\n“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”\n“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have\nbeen able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously.\nHe looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think\nthat breaking the ring would break the curse?”\n“Something like that . . . I was delirious, no doubt. . . .” said\nDumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair.\n“Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.”\nSnape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.\n“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His\nplan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”\nSnape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across\nthe desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say\nmore on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other\n681\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\nheld it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling,\nSnape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This\nis merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for\nDraco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”\n“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him\nas surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought\nthe natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”\nThere was a short pause.\n“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”\n“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he\nwill not need a spy at Hogwarts?”\n“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”\n“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it\nseemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your\npower to protect the students of Hogwarts?”\nSnape gave a stiff nod.\n“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what\nDraco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as\nwell as to himself.

Given what has happened\ntonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it\nwill happen within a year.”\n“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let\nDraco do it?”\n“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I\nwould not have it ripped apart on my account.”\n“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”\n“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old\nman avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one\ngreat favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely\nas the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. I\nconfess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and\nmessy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved — I hear\nVoldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play\nwith her food before she eats it.”\nHis tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had\nfrequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was\nvisible to him.

I am counting upon you to remain in\nLord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will\nbe left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .”\nNow Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar\ntavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning\nin concentration.\n“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured,\n“that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the\nonly thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested\nthis. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?”\n“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . .\nNow Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a\nclear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eat-\ners, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . .\nA Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing\nit directly at Lupin’s back —\n“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.\nBut the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed\nand hit George instead —\nAnd next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were\n688\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PRINCE’S TALE\ndripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter\nfrom Lily. The second page carried only a few words:\ncould ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think\nher mind’s going, personally!\nLots of love,\nSnape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and\ntucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he\nwas also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed,\nthrowing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor,\nunder the chest of drawers. . . .\nAnd now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas\nNigellus came hurrying into his portrait.\n“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The\nMudblood —”\n“Do not use that word!”\n“— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened\nher bag and I heard her!”\n“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the\nheadmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it\nmust be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must\nnot know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind\nand see you acting for him —”"

It swung forward, revealing a hidden\ncavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.\n689\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\n“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to\ngive Potter the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak\nover his robes.\n“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know\nwhat to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take\nkindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap —”\nSnape turned at the door.\n“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan. . . .”\nAnd Snape left the room.

Lying with his face pressed into the dusty\ncarpet of the office where he had once thought he was learn-\ning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was\nnot supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s\nwelcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s\nremaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across\nVoldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the\nend would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done\nin Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither\ncould survive.\nHe felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that\nin his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping\nhim alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were num-\nbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked\nthrough the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into\nthe forest?\n691\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\nTerror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral\ndrum pounding inside him.

Yet it did not occur\nto him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he\nknew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.\nIf he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had\nleft number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble\nphoenix-feather wand had saved him!

He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an\neffort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits\non the walls were all empty.\nSlowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive\nand more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had\nhe never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and\nbounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be\ngone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and\nthroat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.\nDumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had\nbeen a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he\nrealized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption\nthat Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span\nhad always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the\nHorcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to\n692\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FOREST AGAIN\nhim, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds ty-\ning not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant,\nnot to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the\nboy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death\nwould not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.\nAnd Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out,\nthat he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end,\nbecause he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumble-\ndore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else\ndie for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop\nit. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great\nHall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment\nhe could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . .\nBut Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The\nsnake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the\nearth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an\neasier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it. . . . Ron\nand Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . .\nThat would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in\ntwo others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early,\nthey could carry on. . . .\nLike rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the\nhard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must\ndie.

Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was deter-\nmined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look\nback as he closed the office door.\nThe castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as\nif he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from\ntheir frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining\nlifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and\nthe mourners were crammed.\nHarry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended\nthrough the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into\nthe entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed,\nto be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable,\nperfect, and he reached the front doors easily.\nThen Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair\nthat was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down\nand felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though\nunderage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and\nGoyle had done. He was tiny in death.\n“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver\nWood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and\ncarried him into the Great Hall.\nNeville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped\nhis forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man.\nThen he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover\nmore bodies.\n694\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FOREST AGAIN\nHarry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall.\nPeople were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking,\nkneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he\nloved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weas-\nleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining\nto him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have\nthe strength to stop looking? It was better like this.\nHe moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly\nfour in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as\nthough they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he\ncould do what he must.\nHarry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another\nbody.\n“Neville.”\n“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”\nHarry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out\nof nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.\n“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously."

But he pulled himself together\nagain: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool\nhead, make sure there were backups, others to carry on.

You’re okay, are you?”\n“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.”\nBut Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.\n“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”\n“Yeah, I —”\nThe suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he\ncould not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange.

Now that he wanted\ntime to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and un-\nderstanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought.\nThis was the close. This was the moment.\nHe pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am\nabout to die.”\nThe metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised\nDraco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”\nThe black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat\nin the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked\ndown the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and\ncircle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.\nAnd again Harry understood without having to think.

He\nwas not really fetching them: They were fetching him.\nHe closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three\ntimes.\nHe knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements\naround him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the\nearthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest.\nHe opened his eyes and looked around.\nThey were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that.

It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly\nindecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdrop-\nping on something furtive, shameful.\nFor the first time, he wished he were clothed.\nBarely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a\nshort distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were\nsoft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared,\njust like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . .\nHe stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of\nRequirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A\ngreat domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Per-\nhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd\nthumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close\nby in the mist. . . .\nHarry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed\nto invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and\nclean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear,\ndomed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person\nthere, except for —\nHe recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises.\nIt had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its\nskin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a\n706\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKING’S CROSS\nseat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, strug-\ngling for breath.\nHe was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was,\nhe did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer,\nready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to\ntouch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a cow-\nard. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.\n“You cannot help.”\nHe spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him,\nsprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.\n“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole\nand white and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave\nman. Let us walk.”\nStunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where\nthe flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry\nhad not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high,\nsparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry\nfell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s\nlong silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon\nspectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered\nit. And yet. . .\n“But you’re dead,” said Harry.\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.\n“Then . . . I’m dead too?”\n“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the\nquestion, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”\nThey looked at each other, the old man still beaming.\n“Not?” repeated Harry."

It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died — I didn’t\ndefend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”\n“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the\ndifference.”\nHappiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like\nfire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content.\n“Explain,” said Harry.\n“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his\nthumbs together.\n“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”\n“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”\n“So the part of his soul that was in me . . .”\nDumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry\nonward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face.\n“. . . has it gone?”\n“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is\nwhole, and completely your own, Harry.”\n“But then . . .”\nHarry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed\ncreature trembled under the chair.\n“What is that, Professor?”\n“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumble-\ndore.\n“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again,\n“and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”\n“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember\nwhat he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”\n708\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKING’S CROSS\nHarry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If\nit was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with\nchairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still,\nhe and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were\nthe only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, with-\nout effort.\n“He took my blood,” said Harry.\n“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt\nhis living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protec-\ntion inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”\n“I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the\nother way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same\nthing?”\nHe was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the ago-\nnized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.\n“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”\n“There is no help possible.”\n“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.\n“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never\nmeant to make.

He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be\nvictim who had survived.\n“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That\nwhich Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to compre-\nhend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and in-\nnocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing.

His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and\nwhile that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s\none last hope for himself.”\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.\n“And you knew this? You knew — all along?”\n“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumble-\ndore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time,\nwhile the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.\n“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand\nbreak the wand he borrowed?”\n“As to that, I cannot be sure.”\n“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.\n“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Vol-\ndemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto un-\nknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is\nunprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have pre-\ndicted it or explained it to Voldemort.\n“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled\nthe bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part\nof his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen\nhimself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he\ncould only have understood the precise and terrible power of that\nsacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . .\nBut then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord\nVoldemort, and might never have murdered at all.\n710\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKING’S CROSS\n“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your\ndestinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined\nin history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that\nshared a core with yours.

Your courage won, your wand\noverpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between\nthose wands, something that echoed the relationship between their\nmasters.\n“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and quali-\nties of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained\na little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when\nhe pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal\nenemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him,\nmagic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever\nperformed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous\ncourage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that\npoor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?”\n“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able\nto break it?” asked Harry.\n“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Vol-\ndemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws\nof magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful.\nOtherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I\nam sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.\n711\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\nHarry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was\nvery hard to be sure of things like time, here.\n“He killed me with your wand.”\n“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected\nHarry. “I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of\ncourse,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not\nminimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.”\n“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down\nat his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”\n“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking\naround. “Where would you say that we are?”\nUntil Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, how-\never, he found that he had an answer ready to give.\n“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station.

This is, as they say, your party.”\nHarry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infu-\nriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing\nquestion than that of their current location.\n“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the\nwords wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.\n“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried.\n“Well?”\nFor the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked\n712\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKING’S CROSS\nless than an old man, much less.

I have known, for some time now, that\nyou are the better man.”\n“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumble-\ndore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.\n“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desper-\nate man’s dream!”\n“But they’re real!”\n“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore.\n“And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets\nfrom you anymore. You know.”\n“What do I know?”\nDumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still\nsparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes.\n“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ulti-\nmately, than Voldemort?”\n“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you\nask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!”\n“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking\nreassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”\n“Not the way he did,” said Harry.

The creature behind them whimpered, but\nHarry no longer looked around.\n“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.\nDumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.\n“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly.\n“Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to\ncome to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because\nof the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the\nthird brother had died.”\n“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers —”\n“— were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nod-\nding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely\nroad . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply\ngifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those power-\nful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems\nto me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such\ncreations.\n“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages,\nfather to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last liv-\ning descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of\nGodric’s Hollow.”\nDumbledore smiled at Harry.\n“Me?”"

You are the worthy\npossessor of the Hallows.”\nDumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old\nman and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain\nangry with Dumbledore now?\n“Why did you have to make it so difficult?”\nDumbledore’s smile was tremulous.\n“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry.\nI was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart.\nI was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those\ntempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong\ntime, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you\nto possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the\ntrue master does not seek to run away from Death.

But even if he had known about\nthem, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any ex-\ncept the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as\nfor the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead?\nHe fears the dead. He does not love.”\n“But you expected him to go after the wand?”\n“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat\nVoldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was\nafraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had\nkidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the\ntwin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed\nwand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking\nhimself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so\nstrong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to\nfind the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him,\nthe Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with\nyou. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and\nmakes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .”\n“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end\nup with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”\n“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did\nnot work as I intended, did it?”\n“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”\nThe creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and\nDumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The\n721\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\nrealization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry\nin the long minutes, like softly falling snow.\n“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?”\n“That is up to you.”\n“I’ve got a choice?”\n“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross,\nyou say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be\nable to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.”\n“And where would it take me?”\n“On,” said Dumbledore simply.\nSilence again.\n“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.”\n“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”\n“But you want me to go back?”\n“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there\nis a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it.\nBut I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning\nhere than he does.”\nHarry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and\nchoked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.\n“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those\nwho live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls\nare maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a\nworthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.”\nHarry nodded and sighed.

He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same,\nand they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces.\n722\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nKING’S CROSS\n“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this\nbeen happening inside my head?”\nDumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and\nstrong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending\nagain, obscuring his figure.\n“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on\nearth should that mean that it is not real?”\n723\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S I X\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\nH\ne was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of\nthe forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard\nground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had\nbeen knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every\ninch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit\nhim felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but\nremained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at\nan awkward angle and his mouth gaping.\nHe had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his\ndeath, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous mur-\nmurs filled the air.\n“My Lord . . . my Lord . . .”\nIt was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did\nnot dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his\npredicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his\nrobes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the\n724\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\nground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told\nhim that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.\n“My Lord . . .”\n“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice.\nMore footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same\nspot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened\nhis eyes by a millimeter.\nVoldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eat-\ners were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining\nthe clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside\nVoldemort.\nHarry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The\nDeath Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to\nhave fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had\nhit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed?\nIt seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious\nand both of them had now returned. . . .\n“My Lord, let me —”\n“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though\nhe could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful\nhand. “The boy . . .

She had sat up.\n“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.\nAnd now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped\ntheir feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver\nlight shoot into the air in celebration.\nStill feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew\nthat the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and\nfind her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared\nwhether Voldemort won.\n“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is\ndead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now!

He was lifted into the\n726\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\nair, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain\nhe expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times\ninto the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little\nbeneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when\nhe fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers\nand shrieks of laughter.\n“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show\nthem what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body?\nNo — Wait —”\nThere was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments\nHarry felt the ground trembling beneath him."

Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with\nthe force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as\nHagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by move-\nment or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.\n“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing\nhis way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest.\nBranches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his\nmouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the\nDeath Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed\nblindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed\nneck of Harry Potter. . . .\nThe two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry\ncould hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so\n727\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\nmuch din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of\nthe Death Eaters were drowned.

Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead . . . ?”\nHagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry\nwondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass;\nhe dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called\ninsults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry\nsensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge\nof the forest.\n“Stop.”\nHarry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Volde-\nmort’s command, because he lurched a little.

It’s got to be me.”\nVoldemort hissed.\n“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t\nhow he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today,\nPotter?”\n“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s\njust you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one\nof us is about to leave for good. . . .”\n“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and\nhis red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it\nwill be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and be-\ncause Dumbledore was pulling the strings?”\n737\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\n“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry.\nThey were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle,\nmaintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no\nface existed but Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided to fight in\nthat graveyard?

Love, which did not prevent me stamping out\nyour Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody\nseems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my\ncurse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?”\n“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other,\nwrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.\n“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you\nmust believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon\nmore powerful than mine?”\n“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the\nsnakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began\nto laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams;\nhumorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.\n“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I,\nthan Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore\nhimself never dreamed of?”\n“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you,\nknew enough not to do what you’ve done.”\n“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to\ndare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be\nmine!”\n“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a\nbetter man.”\n739\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\n“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”\n“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”\nFor the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of\npeople around the walls drew breath as one.\n“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as\nthough they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays\nin the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Pot-\nter, and he will not return!”\n“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t"

And you never realized it, because of the thing you\ncan’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you,\nRiddle?”\nVoldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other\nlike wolves about to tear each other apart.\n“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my moth-\ner’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when\nthey were children. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Vol-\ndemort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”\n“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when\nshe had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer\nblood, worthier of him —”\n740\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\n“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumble-\ndore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been work-\ning against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when\nSnape finished him!”\n“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every\nword with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter.\n“It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what\npetty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I\ncrushed your mother, Snape’s supposed great love! Oh, but it all\nmakes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand!\n“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He\nintended that Snape should be the true master of the wand!

Voldemort\nwas dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with\ntwo wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.\nOne shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment sus-\npended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams\nand the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce\nnew sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and\nthe first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms\nthat were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that\ndeafened him.

Harry pushed open the\ndoor at the top.\nHe had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where\nhe had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out,\nthinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of\nVoldemort —\nBut it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and\nheadmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation;\nthey waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached\nthrough their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and\ndown on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent\nsobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet;\nand Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be\nnoted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not\nbe forgotten!”\nBut Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest\nportrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding\ndown from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver\nbeard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled\nHarry with the same balm as phoenix song.\nAt last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully\nsilent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him\n747\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\nto speak.

I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go\nlooking for it again. Do you agree?”\n“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures\nlooked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but\nno less than I would have expected of you.

She\nthought I’d have to Confund the examiner.”\n“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”\n“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to\nHarry, as together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train.\n“I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use\na Supersensory Charm for that.”\nBack on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger\nbrother, having an animated discussion about which House they\nwould be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.\n“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but\nno pressure.”\n“Ron!”\nLily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.\n“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no\nlonger paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to\na point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment,\nand three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.\n“Look who it is.”\nDraco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark\ncoat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat,\n755\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nEPILOGUE\nwhich emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco\nas much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry,\nRon, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and\nturned away again.\n“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure\nyou beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your\nmother’s brains.”\n“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused.\n“Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even\nstarted school!”\n“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he\nadded, “Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad\nWeasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.”\n“Hey!”\nJames had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl,\nand trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.\n“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his\nshoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And\nguess what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!”\nHe gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of\nreaction.\n“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin!\nAnd I asked Teddy what he was doing —”\n“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron —”\n“— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to\ngo away. He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had\nnot made himself clear.\n“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ec-\nstatically. “Teddy would really be part of the family then!”\n756\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nNINETEEN YEARS LATER"

I can’t give a professor love!”\n“But you know Neville —”\nJames rolled his eyes.\n“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he?\nI can’t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .”\nShaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feel-\nings by aiming a kick at Albus.\n“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”\n“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”\nBut James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him,\ngave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling\ntrain. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find\nhis friends.\n“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus.\n“They’re gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway,\nyou won’t be going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in\nthe boats.”\n757\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nEPILOGUE\nGinny kissed Albus good-bye.\n“See you at Christmas.”\n“Bye, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget\nHagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves.\nDon’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind\nyou up.”\n“What if I’m in Slytherin?”\nThe whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only\nthe moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how\ngreat and sincere that fear was.\nHarry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his\nown. Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s\neyes.\n“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny\ncould hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to\nRose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmas-\nters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably\nthe bravest man I ever knew.”\n“But just say —”\n“— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student,\nwon’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll\nbe able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes\nyour choice into account.”\n“Really?”\n“It did for me,” said Harry.\nHe had never told any of his children that before, and he saw"

        "text": "your choice into account.”\n“Really?”\n“It did for me,” said Harry.\nHe had never told any of his children that before, and he saw\nthe wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were\nslamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of par-\nents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders.\n758\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nNINETEEN YEARS LATER\nAlbus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind\nhim. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great\nnumber of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned\ntoward Harry.\n“Why are they all staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose\ncraned around to look at the other students.\n“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely\nfamous.”\nAlbus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move,\nand Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, al-\nready ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even\nthough it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away\nfrom him. . . .\nThe last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train\nrounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.\n“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.\nAs Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and\ntouched the lightning scar on his forehead.\n“I know he will.”\nThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n759\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nThis\nbook was\nart directed by David\nSaylor. The art for both the jacket\nand the interior was created using pastels on\ntoned printmaking paper.
