For\none thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any\nother time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his home-\nwork but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he\nalso happened to be a wizard.\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed,\nthe blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in\none hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by\nBathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved\nthe tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he\nlooked for something that would help him write his essay, “Witch\nBurning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless —\ndiscuss.”\nThe quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry\npushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flash-\nlight closer to the book, and read:\n1\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as\nMuggles) were particularly afraid of magic in me-\ndieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On\nthe rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or\nwizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch\nor wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing\nCharm and then pretend to shriek with pain while\nenjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wen-\ndelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that\nshe allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-\nseven times in various disguises.\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath\nhis pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and\nvery carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it,\nand began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because\nif any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way\nto the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the cup-\nboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason"

        "text": "to the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the cup-\nboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason\nthat Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon,\nAunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living rela-\ntives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude\ntoward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a witch and\nwizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys’ roof.\nFor years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they\nkept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to\nsquash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuc-\ncessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that\n2\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST\nHarry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was\nto lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick\nat the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the\nneighbors.\nThis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for\nHarry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of hol-\niday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrink-\ning potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape,\nwho would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention\nfor a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week\nof the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley\nhad gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new\ncompany car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street\nwould notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock\non the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and\nhidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink\non the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying\nmagic by night.\nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and\nuncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad\nmood with him, all because he’d received a telephone call from a\nfellow wizard one week into the school vacation.\nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at Hogwarts,\ncame from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a\nlot of things Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone before.\nMost unluckily it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the\ncall.\n“Vernon Dursley speaking.”\n3\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nHarry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he\nheard Ron’s voice answer.\n“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT —\nTO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!”\nRon was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held\nthe receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression\nof mingled fury and alarm.\n“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece.\n“WHO ARE YOU?”"

NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU\nCOME NEAR MY FAMILY!”\nAnd he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if drop-\nping a poisonous spider.\nThe fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.\n“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE\nLIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had roared, spray-\ning Harry with spit.\nRon obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble,\nbecause he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from\n4\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST\nHogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry\nsuspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a\npity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s year, had\nMuggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and\nwould probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to\nHogwarts.\nSo Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for\nfive long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as\nbad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement —\nafter swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his\nfriends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at\nnight. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig\nmade if she was locked in her cage all the time.\nHarry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to\nlisten again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the\ndistant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be\nvery late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Per-\nhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. . . .\nHe replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase\nfrom under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay,\nquill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose\nfloorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and\nchecked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach gave a funny\njolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a\nwhole hour.\nYet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked\nforward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in\n5\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\nhis life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays,"

The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays,\nand he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.\nHarry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s large, empty\ncage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air\npleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig\nhad been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried about\nher: she’d been gone this long before. But he hoped she’d be back\nsoon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t\nflinch at the sight of him.\nHarry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had\ngrown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however,\nwas just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he\ndid to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his\nforehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped\nlike a bolt of lightning.\nOf all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most ex-\ntraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten\nyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, be-\ncause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had\nbeen murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a\nhundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same\nattack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Volde-\nmort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its origi-\nnator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. . . .\nBut Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Re-\nmembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window,\nHarry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thir-\nteenth birthday.\nHe scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring\n6\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST\nback to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting\npraise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds be-\nfore Harry realized what he was seeing.\nSilhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every\nmoment, was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flap-\nping in Harry’s direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink\nlower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the\nwindow latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then the\nbizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive,\nand Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.\nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up\nthe third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a\nsoft flump on Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and\ngray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was a large pack-\nage tied to its legs.\nHarry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name\nwas Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family.

Harry dashed\nto the bed, untied the cords around Errol’s legs, took off the par-\ncel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one\nbleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some\nwater.\nHarry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the\nlarge snowy female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a\nparcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry\nan affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then\nflew across the room to join Errol.\nHarry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one,\nbut he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition\nto a third package, it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts\n7\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ONE\ncrest. When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its\nfeathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the\nwindow into the night.\nHarry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped\noff the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and\nhis first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened\nthe envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a news-\npaper clipping.\nThe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper,\nthe Daily Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white pic-\nture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out,\nand read:\nMINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE\nSCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Ar-\ntifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the\nannual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.\nA delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet,\n“We will be spending the gold on a summer holi-\nday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a\ncurse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.”\nThe Weasley family will be spending a month in\nEgypt, returning for the start of the new school\nyear at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley chil-\ndren currently attend.\nHarry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across\nhis face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him,\n8\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST\nstanding in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley;\ntall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though\nthe black-and-white picture didn’t show it) with flaming-red hair.\nRight in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with\nhis pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little\nsister, Ginny.\nHarry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile\nof gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely\npoor. He picked up Ron’s letter and unfolded it.\nDear Harry,\nHappy birthday!\nLook, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the\nMuggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he\nreckons I shouldn’t have shouted."

Percy, who was in his sev-\nenth and final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He\nhad pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of\nhis neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.\nHarry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was\nwhat looked like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another\nnote from Ron beneath it.\nHarry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s someone\nuntrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light up and spin. Bill\nsays it’s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn’t reliable,\nbecause it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn’t\nrealize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup.\nBye —\nHarry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it\nstood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous\nhands of his clock.

Knowing Hermione, he was sure it\nwould be a large book full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t.\nHis heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a\nsleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading\nBroomstick Servicing Kit.\n“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look\ninside.\nThere was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish,\na pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to\nclip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-\nYourself Broomcare.\nApart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about\nHogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical\nworld — highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broom-\nsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had\nbeen the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the\nHogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized possessions\nwas his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.\nHarry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He\nrecognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this\nwas from Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top\nlayer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but be-\nfore he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver,\nand whatever was inside it snapped loudly — as though it had\njaws.\n12\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST\nHarry froze.

Then he took off his glasses\nand lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards.\nExtremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter\nfelt just like everyone else — glad, for the first time in his life, that\nit was his birthday.\n15\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T W O\nAUNT MARGE’S\nBIG MISTAKE\nH\narry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the\nthree Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table.\nThey were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-\nthe-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly\nabout the long walk between the fridge and the television in the liv-\ning room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen,\nhis piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling\nas he ate continually.\nHarry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large,\nbeefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from\nwishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any\nsign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far\ntoo used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and\nthen looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway\nthrough a report on an escaped convict:\n“. . . The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely\n16\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nAUNT MARGE’S\nBIG MISTAKE\ndangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of\nBlack should be reported immediately.”\n“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle Vernon, staring\nover the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. “Look at the state of\nhim, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!”\nHe shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had\nalways been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Com-\npared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was\nsurrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well\ngroomed indeed.\nThe reporter had reappeared.\n“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce to-\nday —”\n“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the re-\nporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s escaped from! What\nuse is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!”\nAunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around\nand peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt\nPetunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line num-\nber. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her\nlife spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.\n“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table\nwith his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the only way to deal with\nthese people?”\n“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next\ndoor’s runner beans.\nUncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and\nadded, “I’d better be off in a minute, Petunia.

Even though she was not\na blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia’s\nsister), he had been forced to call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt\nMarge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where\nshe bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive, because she\ncouldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood\nout horribly vividly in Harry’s mind.\nAt Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked\nHarry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from\nbeating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned\nup at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box\nof dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry\nstarted at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of\nher favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and\nup a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past\nmidnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laugh-\nter to Dudley’s eyes.\n“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “and while\nwe’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat finger threateningly at\nHarry — “we need to get a few things straight before I go and col-\nlect her.”\nDudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television.\nWatching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley’s\nfavorite form of entertainment.\n18\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nAUNT MARGE’S\nBIG MISTAKE\n“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in\nyour head when you’re talking to Marge.”\n“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to\nme.”\n“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not\nheard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your\nabnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here.\nYou behave yourself, got me?”\n“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.\n“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits\nin his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus’s\nSecure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.”\n“What?” Harry yelled.\n“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,”\nspat Uncle Vernon.\nHarry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle\nVernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a week-\nlong visit — it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had\never given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks."

Want to come along for the ride,\nDudders?”\n“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the televi-\nsion now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\n“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,” said Aunt\nPetunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond hair. “Mummy’s bought\nhim a lovely new bow tie.”\nUncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.\n19\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\n“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the kitchen.\nHarry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a\nsudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and\nfollowed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\nUncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\n“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see Harry watch-\ning him.\n“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to ask you\nsomething.”\nUncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\n“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to visit the vil-\nlage sometimes,” said Harry.\n“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook\nnext to the door.\n“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry in a rush.\n“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.\n“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll be hard\nwork, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits —”\n“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!” bel-\nlowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note\nof panic in Uncle Vernon’s voice.\n“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon’s\nlarge, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll have to make it sound\nconvincing, won’t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?”\n“You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?” roared Un-\ncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised.

If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line\nand kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.”\nHe wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it\nso hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\nHarry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to\nhis bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he’d better\nstart now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his\nbirthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his\nhomework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol seemed to have\nrecovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their\nwings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\n“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to clear off for\na week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after you. I’ll write him a note,\nexplaining. And don’t look at me like that” — Hedwig’s large am-\nber eyes were reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll\nbe allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.”\nTen minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron\nbound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight.\nHarry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away\ninside the wardrobe.\nBut Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt\n21\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\nPetunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get\nready to welcome their guest.\n“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia snapped as he\nreached the hall.\nHarry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat.\nAunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the\nhappier she would be.\nAll too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle\nVernon’s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the\ncar doors and footsteps on the garden path.\n“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\nA feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door\nopen.\nOn the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle\nVernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she even had a mustache,\nthough not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suit-\ncase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered\nbulldog.\n“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s my neffy-\npoo?”\nDudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered\nflat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins.\nAunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the\nwind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and\nplanted a large kiss on his cheek.\nHarry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt\nMarge’s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough,"

Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather,\nAunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony\ncheekbone.\nUncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\n“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”\n“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said Aunt Marge\nas they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the\nhall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn’t complaining; any ex-\ncuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to\nheave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he\ncould.\nBy the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been\nsupplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in\nthe corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea\nand drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\n“Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle Vernon\nasked.\n“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,” boomed Aunt\nMarge. “He’s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But\nI couldn’t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.”\nRipper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed\nAunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first time.\n“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge\ngrowled. “It’s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you.\nWouldn’t have done it myself. You’d have gone straight to an or-\nphanage if you’d been dumped on my doorstep.”\n23\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\nHarry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage\nthan with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form\nstopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.\n“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can see you\nhaven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock\nsome manners into you.” She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her\nmustache, and said, “Where is it that you send him, again,\nVernon?”\n“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a first-rate\ninstitution for hopeless cases.”\n“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St. Brutus’s,\nboy?” she barked across the table.\n“Er —”\nUncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back."

Then, feeling he might as well do the thing\nproperly, he added, “all the time.”\n“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this namby-pamby,\nwishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A\ngood thrashing is what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hun-\ndred. Have you been beaten often?”\n“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times.”\nAunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\n“I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said. “If you can speak of\nyour beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren’t hitting you hard\nenough. Petunia, I’d write if I were you. Make it clear that you ap-\nprove the use of extreme force in this boy’s case.”\nPerhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their\nbargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.\n24\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nAUNT MARGE’S\nBIG MISTAKE\n“Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped\nprisoner, eh?”\nAs Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught him-\nself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her.\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay\nout of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt\nMarge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times,\nso that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She\ndelighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge plea-\nsure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as\nthough daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too. She also\nkept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an un-\nsatisfactory person.\n“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out,\nVernon,” she said over lunch on the third day. “If there’s something\nrotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.”\nHarry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and\nhis face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told\nhimself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t rise —\nAunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\n“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all\nthe time with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch,\nthere’ll be something wrong with the pup —”\nAt that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding ex-\nploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and\nAunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\n“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all right?”\n25\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWO\n“Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with\nher napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard.

He couldn’t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade\nform wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like that, he’d\nbe in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.\nHarry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by\nwizard law to do magic outside school. His record wasn’t exactly\nclean either. Only last summer he’d gotten an official warning that\nhad stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more\nmagic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.\nHe heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out\nof the way.\nHarry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think\nabout his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt\nMarge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to\ngive him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the\nopinion that he was mentally subnormal.\nAt last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay arrived.\nAunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked\nseveral bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and\n26\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nAUNT MARGE’S\nBIG MISTAKE\nthe salmon without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the\nlemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk\nabout Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia\nmade coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.\n“Can I tempt you, Marge?”\nAunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face\nwas very red.\n“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more than\nthat . . . and a bit more . . . that’s the ticket.”\nDudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sip-\nping coffee with her little finger sticking out.

It’s nor-\nmally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look\nafter. . . .” She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach.\n“Pardon me.

If he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping\npainfully fast), a bit more magic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisi-\nbility Cloak he had inherited from his father — what if he\nbewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broom-\nstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he\ncould get the rest of his money out of his vault and . . . begin his\nlife as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn’t sit on\nthis wall forever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to Muggle\npolice why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spell-\nbooks and a broomstick.\nHarry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside,\nlooking for the Invisibility Cloak — but before he had found it, he\nstraightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.\nA funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel\nhe was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and\nno lights shone from any of the large square houses.\nHe bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up\nonce more, his hand clenched on his wand.

If only it would move, then he’d know\nwhether it was just a stray cat or — something else.\n“Lumos,” Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his\nwand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the\npebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage\ndoor gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the\nhulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.\nHarry stepped backward.

His legs hit his trunk and he tripped.\nHis wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his\nfall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter —\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to\nshield his eyes against a sudden blinding light —\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A\nsecond later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a\nhalt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as\nHarry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently\npurple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over\nthe windshield spelled The Knight Bus.\nFor a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly\nby his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the\nbus and began to speak loudly to the night.\n“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the\nstranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on\nboard, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is\nStan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve —”\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of\nHarry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his\n33\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\nwand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan\nShunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nine-\nteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.\n“What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan, dropping his pro-\nfessional manner.\n“Fell over,” said Harry.\n“’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.\n“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One of the\nknees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to\nbreak his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had\nfallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway be-\ntween the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s headlamps were\nflooding it with light, and it was empty.\n“’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan.\n“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing uncertainly\ninto the gap. “Like a dog . . . but massive . . .”\nHe looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open.\nWith a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes move to the scar on\nHarry’s forehead.\n“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly.\n“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If\nthe Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn’t want to make\nit too easy for them.\n“Woss your name?” Stan persisted.\n“Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first name that\ncame into his head. “So — so this bus,” he went on quickly, hop-\ning to distract Stan, “did you say it goes anywhere?”\n“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s it’s on land.\nCan’t do nuffink underwater. ’Ere,” he said, looking suspicious\n34"

He and Stan then\nlifted his trunk, with Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps\nof the bus.\nThere were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood\nbeside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets\nbeside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wiz-\nard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks,\nI’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his sleep.\n“You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s trunk un-\nder the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair\nin front of the steering wheel. “This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This\nis Neville Longbottom, Ern.”\nErnie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nod-\nded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat\ndown on his bed.\n“Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the armchair\nnext to Ernie’s.\nThere was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment\nHarry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the\nspeed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of\nthe dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a\n35\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THREE\ncompletely different street. Stan was watching Harry’s stunned face\nwith great enjoyment.\n“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said.\n“Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?”\n“Ar,” said Ernie.\n“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said Harry.\n“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen properly, do\nthey? Don’ look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don’.”\n“Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern. “We’ll be in\nAbergavenny in a minute.”\nStan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden\nstaircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling in-\ncreasingly nervous. Ernie didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a\nsteering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but\nit didn’t hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans\njumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once\nit had passed.\nStan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch\nwrapped in a traveling cloak."

Harry didn’t\nhave to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight any-\nmore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean\nFortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his essays with occasional\nhelp from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a\ngreat deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes\nevery half an hour.\nOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, sil-\nver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to\nexercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He\nhad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hog-\nwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for\nspellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid\ngold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which\nthe stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face\nwhen they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect,\nmoving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have\nmeant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson.

Harry didn’t ask for the price, but he returned, almost\nevery day after that, just to look at the Firebolt.\nThere were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went\nto the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients,\nand as his school robes were now several inches too short in the\narm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and\nbought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new\nschoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects,\nCare of Magical Creatures and Divination.\nHarry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window.\nInstead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of\npaving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held\nabout a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn\npages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each\nother, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping\naggressively.\nHarry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for\nthe first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the re-\nquired book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry under-\nstood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt\nrelieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with\nsome terrifying new pet.\nAs Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurry-\ning toward him.\n“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?”\n“Yes,” said Harry, “I need —”\n52\n(cid:145) (cid:145)"

I’ve been bitten five times already\nthis morning —”\nA loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had\nseized a third and were pulling it apart.\n“Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the walking stick\nthrough the bars and knocking the books apart. “I’m never stocking\nthem again, never! It’s been bedlam!

A small table was\nstacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate\nYourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn\nFoul.\n“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps\nto take down a thick, black-bound book. “Unfogging the Future.\nVery good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods — palm-\nistry, crystal balls, bird entrails —”\nBut Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book,\n53\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\nwhich was among a display on a small table: Death Omens: What to\nDo When You Know the Worst Is Coming.\n“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the manager\nlightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at. “You’ll start see-\ning death omens everywhere.

Harry could hear the\nbuses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the\nsound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught\nsight of himself in the mirror over the basin.\n“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his reflection defi-\nantly. “I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia\nCrescent. . . .

Plenty of Hogwarts students were ar-\nriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry\nmet Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in\nQuality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Fire-\nbolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced,\nforgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn’t stop to\nchat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being\ntold off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped\nshe never found out that he’d pretended to be Neville while on the\nrun from the Ministry of Magic.\nHarry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he\nwould at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hog-\nwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Fire-\nbolt, and was just wondering where he’d have lunch, when\nsomeone yelled his name and he turned.\n“Harry! HARRY!”\nThey were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortes-\ncue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking incredibly freckly Her-\nmione very brown, both waving frantically at him.\n“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went\nto the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to\nFlourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and —”\n“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained. “And how\ncome you knew I’m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?”\n55\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOUR\n“Dad,” said Ron simply.\nMr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of\ncourse have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt\nMarge.\n“Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?” said Hermione in a\nvery serious voice.\n“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with laughter.\n“I just — lost control.”\n“It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply. “Honestly, I’m\namazed Harry wasn’t expelled.”\n“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought I was go-"

Fourteen inches, willow, con-\ntaining one unicorn tail-hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He\npointed at a large bag under his chair. “What about those Monster\nBooks, eh?

Your mum and dad are Mug-\ngles! You already know all about Muggles!”\n“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point\nof view,” said Hermione earnestly.\n“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?”\nasked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\n“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her purse. “It’s my\nbirthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money\nto get myself an early birthday present.”\n“How about a nice book?” said Ron innocently.\n“No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I really\nwant an owl.

All I’ve got is Scab-\nbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. “And I want to get\nhim checked over,” he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front\nof them. “I don’t think Egypt agreed with him.”\nScabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a defi-\nnite droop to his whiskers.\n“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry,"

Every inch of wall was hidden\nby cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of\nthese cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing.\nThe witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the\ncare of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited,\nexamining the cages.\nA pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting\non dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell\nwas glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were ooz-\ning slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept\nchanging into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping\nnoise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a\nbasket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming\nloudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were\nplaying some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails.\nThe double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the\ncounter.\n“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He been a bit off-color ever\nsince I brought him back from Egypt.”\n“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a pair of\nheavy black spectacles out of her pocket.\nRon lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next\nto the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and\nscuffled to the wire for a better look.\nLike nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was second-\nhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit\n58\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON\nbattered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially\nwoebegone.\n“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old is this\nrat?”\n“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to my\nbrother.”\n“What powers does he have?” said the witch, examining Scab-\nbers closely.\n“Er —” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the\nfaintest trace of interesting powers. The witch’s eyes moved from\nScabbers’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe miss-\ning, and tutted loudly.\n“He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said.\n“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said Ron defen-\nsively.\n“An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be expected to\nlive longer than three years or so,” said the witch. “Now, if you\nwere looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might\nlike one of these —”\nShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping"

Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and\nstraightened up, massaging his head.\n“What was that?”\n“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.\n“Where’s Hermione?”\n“Probably getting her owl —”\nThey made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical\nMenagerie.

Her arms were clamped tightly around the enor-\nmous ginger cat.\n“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\n“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.\nThat was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger\nfur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and\nits face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run\nheadlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight,\nhowever, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione’s arms.\n“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.\n“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.\n“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in\nhis chest pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation!

He’s thirteen years old\nand —”\n“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs. Weasley shrilly.\n“Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hang-\ning over him? For heaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!”\n“I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his\nguard!” retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know what Harry and Ron are\nlike, wandering off by themselves — they’ve even ended up in the\nForbidden Forest! But Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I\nthink what could have happened to him that night he ran away\nfrom home!

Black\nlost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s\nhad twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. . . .”\nThere was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desper-\nate to hear more.\n“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you’re\nforgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don’t think anything could hurt\nHarry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore’s headmaster. I suppose he\nknows about all this?”\n“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azka-\nban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the\nschool grounds. He wasn’t happy about it, but he agreed.”\n“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re there to catch\nBlack?”\n“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said Mr.\nWeasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that . . . but when you’re\ndealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces\nwith those you’d rather avoid.”\n“If they save Harry —”\n“— then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr.\nWeasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better go up. . . .”\n66\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON\nHarry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried\ndown the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door\nopened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and\nMrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.\nThe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at\nearlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s bed-\nroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\nFred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing,\nheaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and\nRon’s room in search of his badge.\n“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been improv-\ning it.”\nThe badge now read Bighead Boy.\nHarry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut\nhimself in his room and lay down on his bed.\nSo Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge\nhad been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him\nalive. He’d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where\nthere were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was\nsending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow,\nso that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the\ntrain.\nHarry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and won-\ndered why he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered\nthirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously\nthought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth.

Surely Black,\nas Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\nAnd then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking\nabout. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were\nstationed all around the school, Black’s chances of getting inside\nseemed very remote.\nNo, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact\nthat his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. No-\nbody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black\nwas caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be care-\nfully watched until the danger had passed.\nHe scowled at the dark ceiling.

The Ministry of Magic cars seemed\n70\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\nalmost ordinary, though Harry noticed that they could slide\nthrough gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly\ncouldn’t have managed.

I’ll go through first with Harry.”\nMr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine\nand ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and apparently very interested in\nthe InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a\nmeaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier.\nHarry imitated him.\nIn a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal\nonto platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the\nHogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a\nplatform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children\nonto the train.\nPercy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were\npanting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.\n“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair and going\npink again. Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and they both turned away\nto hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly\nhair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his\nshiny badge.\n71\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nOnce the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them,\nHarry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed\ncompartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty.

How could you know?”\n“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold.\nThe Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they\nhad never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who\npushed the food cart.\nThe stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard’s\nrobes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and ex-\nhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked\nwith gray.\n“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid\nthe door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.\n“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.\n“How d’you know that?”\n“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack\nover the man’s head, where there was a small, battered case held to-\ngether with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name\nProfessor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling\nletters.\n74\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\n“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor\nLupin’s pallid profile.\n“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one va-\ncancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one\nyear. There were rumors that the job was jinxed.\n“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like\none good hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He\nturned to Harry. “What were you going to tell us?”\nHarry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s argument and\nthe warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he’d finished,\nRon looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her\nmouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to\ncome after you?

They\nlooked all around the compartment.\n“It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron, standing up and\nreaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the\nPocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry’s robes. It was spin-\nning very fast in the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly.\n“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up\nfor a better look.\n“Yeah . . . mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said. “It went\nhaywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to Harry.”\n“Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said\nHermione shrewdly.\n“No! Well . . . I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You know\nhe’s not really up to long journeys . . . but how else was I supposed\nto get Harry’s present to him?”\n“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope\nwhistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him up.”\nHe nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneako-\nscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks,\nwhich deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.\n“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back\ndown. “They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical\ninstruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.”\n“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked Hermione\nkeenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in\nBritain —”\n“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of way,\n76\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\n“but that’s not why I want to go.

At\nlong last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a\ngreat scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and\nNeville’s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freez-\ning on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.\n“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and\nHermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the\nother end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new stu-\ndents forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n86\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\n“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd.\nThey waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the\nmass of people around them was shunting them away along\nthe platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the\nschool along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where\nat least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students,\neach pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, be-\ncause when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off\nall by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\nThe coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better\nsince the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept look-\ning at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.\nAs the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought\niron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,\nHarry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard\non either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him\nagain; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until\nthey had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the\nlong, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of\nthe tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw\nnearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and\nRon got out.\nAs Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in\nhis ear.\n“You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth?

Professor Lupin had just\ngotten out of the next carriage.\nMalfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the\npatches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint\nof sarcasm in his voice, he said, “Oh, no — er — Professor,” then\nhe smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the\ncastle.\nHermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the\nthree of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the\ngiant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was\nlit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase\nthat led to the upper floors.\nThe door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry fol-\nlowed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted\nceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called,\n“Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!”\nHarry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor\nMcGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor\nHouse, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a stern-\nlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were\nframed with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to her\nwith a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of\nmaking him feel he must have done something wrong.\n“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my\noffice,” she told them. “Move along there, Weasley.”\nRon stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and\n88\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\nHermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied\nher across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a\ncorridor.\nOnce they were in her office, a small room with a large, wel-\ncoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Her-\nmione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said\nabruptly, “Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were\ntaken ill on the train, Potter.”\nBefore Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.\nHarry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that\nhe’d passed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone mak-\ning all this fuss.\n“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything —”\n“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and\nbending down to stare closely at him. “I suppose you’ve been doing\nsomething dangerous again?”\n“It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor McGonagall.\nThey exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked dis-\napprovingly."

Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?”\n89\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\n“I’m fine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco\nMalfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.\n“Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,” said\nMadam Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry’s eyes.\n“I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me\nsome. He gave it to all of us.”\n“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve fi-\nnally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his\nremedies?”\n“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor McGonagall\nsaid sharply.\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with\nMiss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to\nthe feast together.”\nHarry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who\nleft for the hospital wing, muttering to herself. He had to wait only\na few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about\nsomething, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of\nthem made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great\nHall.\nIt was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables\nwas lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of\nthousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in mid-\nair. Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of\nwhite hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out\nof the hall.\n“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”\n90\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE DEMENTOR\nNew students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on\nthe Sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best\nsuited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin).

I have a few\nthings to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think\nit best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our\nexcellent feast. . . .”\nDumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As you will all\n91\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIVE\nbe aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is\npresently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who\nare here on Ministry of Magic business.”\nHe paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said\nabout Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding\nthe school.\n“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,” Dumble-\ndore continued, “and while they are with us, I must make it plain\nthat nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are\nnot to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility\nCloaks,” he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each\nother. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading\nor excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them\nno reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head\nBoy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the de-\nmentors,” he said.\nPercy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out\nhis chest again and stared around impressively.

How’re you supposed to\nbe in three classes at once?”\n“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I won’t be in\nthree classes at once.”\n“Well, then —”\n“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione.\n“But —”\n“Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?” Hermione\nsnapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.”\nJust then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was wearing his\nlong moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead\npolecat from one enormous hand.\n“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff\ntable. “Yer in my firs’ ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up\nsince five gettin’ everythin’ ready. . . . Hope it’s okay. . . . Me, a\nteacher . . . hones’ly. . . .”\nHe grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table,\nstill swinging the polecat.\n“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a note of anx-\niety in his voice.\n98\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTALONS AND TEA LEAVES\nThe hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward their\nfirst lesson. Ron checked his course schedule.\n“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North Tower.\nIt’ll take us ten minutes to get there. . . .”\nThey finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred\nand George, and walked back through the hall.

The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the entrance\nhall.\nThe journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one.\nTwo years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them everything about the\ncastle, and they had never been inside North Tower before.\n“There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut,” Ron panted as\nthey climbed their seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfa-\nmiliar landing, where there was nothing but a large painting of a\nbare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall.\n“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down the empty\npassage to the right.\n“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south, look, you can see a bit of the\nlake out of the window . . .”\nHarry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray pony had\njust ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry\nwas used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and\nleaving their frames to visit one another, but he always enjoyed\nwatching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of ar-\nmor clanked into the picture after his pony. By the look of the grass\nstains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off.\n“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “What\n99\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIX\nvillains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come to\nscorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!”\nThey watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his\nsword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hop-\nping up and down in rage. But the sword was too long for him; a\nparticularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed face-\ndown in the grass.\n“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the picture.\n“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!”\nThe knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself\nback up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he\npulled with all his might, he couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he\nhad to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop\nhis sweating face.\n“Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s exhaus-\ntion, “we’re looking for the North Tower. You don’t know the way,\ndo you?”\n“A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He\nclanked to his feet and shouted, “Come follow me, dear friends, and\nwe shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!”\nHe gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to\nmount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On foot then, good sirs\nand gentle lady! On! On!”\nAnd he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and\nout of sight.\nThey hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound\nof his armor.

If\never you have need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir\nCadogan!”\n“Yeah, we’ll call you,” muttered Ron as the knight disappeared,\n“if we ever need someone mental.”\nThey climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny land-\ning, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no\ndoors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the\nceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque\non it.\n“‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’” Harry read. “How’re\nwe supposed to get up there?”\nAs though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly\nopened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry’s feet.

At least\ntwenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all sur-\nrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit\nwith a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all\nclosed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It\nwas stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the\ncrowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume\nas it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the\ncircular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of\ncandles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery\ncrystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.\nRon appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class assembled around\nthem, all talking in whispers.\n“Where is she?” Ron said.\nA voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of\nvoice.\n“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the physical world\nat last.”\nHarry’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.\nProfessor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she\nwas very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times\ntheir natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl."

You, boy,” she said\nsuddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. “Is your\ngrandmother well?”\n“I think so,” said Neville tremulously.\n“I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said Professor\nTrelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings.\nNeville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. “We will\nbe covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first\nterm will be devoted to reading the tea leaves.

Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a\nnasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter,\none of our number will leave us forever.”\nA very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor\nTrelawney seemed unaware of it.\n“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest\nand shrank back in her chair, “if you could pass me the largest sil-\nver teapot?”"

Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around\nits neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of\nthese were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into\nthe paddock behind the creatures.\n“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and urging the\ncreatures toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew\nback slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to\nthe fence.\n“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them.\n“Beau’iful, aren’ they?”\nHarry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over\nthe first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird,\nyou started to appreciate the hippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing\nsmoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color:\nstormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky\nblack.\n“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming\naround, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer —”\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, how-\never, approached the fence cautiously.\n“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is, they’re\nproud,” said Hagrid. “Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don’t never\ninsult one, ’cause it might be the last thing yeh do.”\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they were talking\nin an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting\nhow best to disrupt the lesson.\n114\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTALONS AND TEA LEAVES\n“Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’ move,”\nHagrid continued. “It’s polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh\nbow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If\nhe doesn’ bow, then get away from him sharpish, ’cause those\ntalons hurt.\n“Right — who wants ter go first?”\nMost of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry,\nRon, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing\ntheir fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn’t seem\nto like being tethered like this.\n“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.\n“I’ll do it,” said Harry.\nThere was an intake of breath from behind him, and both\nLavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no, Harry, remember\nyour tea leaves!”\nHarry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.\n“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s see\nhow yeh get on with Buckbeak.”\nHe untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away\nfrom its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the\nother side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s\neyes were narrowed maliciously.\n“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got eye contact,"

It didn’t move.\n“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back away, now,\nHarry, easy does it —”\nBut then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly\nbent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable\nbow.\n“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right — yeh can\ntouch him! Pat his beak, go on!”\nFeeling that a better reward would have been to back away,\nHarry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward\nit. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its\neyes lazily, as though enjoying it.\nThe class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and\nGoyle, who were looking deeply disappointed.\n“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he might’ let yeh\nride him!”\nThis was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a\nbroomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the\nsame.\n“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid,\n“an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers out, he won’ like\nthat. . . .”\nHarry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted\nhimself onto its back.

It was nothing like a broomstick,\nand Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings\nbeat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his\nlegs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy\nfeathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger\ngrip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand,\nhe now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquar-\nters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings."

They all sat down, took out their\nbooks, quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally en-\ntered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old\nbriefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked\nhealthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few\nsquare meals.\n“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all your\nbooks back in your bags. Today’s will be a practical lesson. You will\nneed only your wands.”\nA few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their\nbooks. They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark\nArts before, unless you counted the memorable class last year when\ntheir old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set\nthem loose.\n“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. “If\nyou’d follow me.”\nPuzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Pro-\nfessor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted\n130\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BOGGART\nIN THE WARDROBE\ncorridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was\nPeeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and\nstuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.\nPeeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away;\nthen he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.\n“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy Lupin, loony,\nloopy Lupin —”\nRude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually\nshowed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly\nat Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise,\nhe was still smiling.\n“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,” he\nsaid pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to get in to his brooms.”\nFilch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard\nwho waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves.\nHowever, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, ex-\ncept to blow a loud wet raspberry.\nProfessor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.\n“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder.\n“Please watch closely.”\nHe raised the wand to shoulder height, said, “Waddiwasi!” and\npointed it at Peeves.\nWith the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of\nthe keyhole and straight down Peeves’s left nostril; he whirled up-\nright and zoomed away, cursing.\n“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement.\n“Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his wand\naway again. “Shall we proceed?”\n131\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThey set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin"

He led them down a second corridor and\nstopped, right outside the staffroom door.\n“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing\nback.\nThe staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched\nchairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sit-\nting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in.\nHis eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around\nhis mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door\nbehind him, Snape said, “Leave it open, Lupin. I’d rather not wit-\nness this.”\nHe got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes bil-\nlowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said,\n“Possibly no one’s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains\nNeville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with\nanything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions\nin his ear.”\nNeville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough\nthat he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front\nof other teachers.\nProfessor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.\n“I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of\nthe operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it ad-\nmirably.”\nNeville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s lip curled,\nbut he left, shutting the door with a snap.\n“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward\nthe end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe\n132\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BOGGART\nIN THE WARDROBE\nwhere the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went\nto stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off\nthe wall.\n“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly because\na few people had jumped backward in alarm. “There’s a boggart in\nthere.”\nMost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry\nabout. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and\nSeamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.\n“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin.\n“Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks —\nI’ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This\none moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if\nthe staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.\n“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a bog-\ngart?”\nHermione put up her hand.\n“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever\nit thinks will frighten us most.”\n“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and\nHermione glowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within\nhas not yet assumed a form.

Nobody knows\nwhat a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out,\nhe will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.\n“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s\nsmall sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advantage over the\nboggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”\nTrying to answer a question with Hermione next to him,\n133\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nbobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the\nair, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.\n“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what\nshape it should be?”\n“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand\ndown, looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have com-\npany when you’re dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused.\nWhich should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug?\nI once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten\ntwo people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not re-\nmotely frightening.\n“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force\nof mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.\nWhat you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find\namusing.\n“We will practice the charm without wands first. After me,\nplease . . . riddikulus!”\n“Riddikulus!” said the class together.\n“Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Very good. But that was the easy\npart, I’m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is\nwhere you come in, Neville.”\nThe wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who\nwalked forward as though he were heading for the gallows.\n“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin. “First things first: what\nwould you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?”\nNeville’s lips moved, but no noise came out.\n“Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor Lupin cheer-\nfully.\nNeville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone\n134\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE BOGGART\nIN THE WARDROBE\nto help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor\nSnape.”\nNearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically.\nProfessor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.\n“Professor Snape . . . hmmm . . . Neville, I believe you live with\nyour grandmother?”\n“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t want the\nboggart to turn into her either.”\n“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor Lupin, now\nsmiling. “I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your\ngrandmother usually wears?”"

And a long dress . . . green,\nnormally . . . and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.”\n“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin.\n“A big red one,” said Neville.\n“Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture those\nclothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind’s eye?”\n“Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was\ncoming next.\n“When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees\nyou, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And\nyou will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and\nconcentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all goes well,\nProfessor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped\nhat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.”\nThere was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled\nmore violently.\n“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention\n135\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nto each of us in turn,” said Professor Lupin. “I would like all of you\nto take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most,\nand imagine how you might force it to look comical. . . .”\nThe room went quiet. Harry thought . . . What scared him\nmost in the world?\nHis first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort returned\nto full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible\ncounterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came\nfloating to the surface of his mind. . . .\nA rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black\ncloak . . . a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth . . . then a\ncold so penetrating it felt like drowning. . . .\nHarry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had no-\nticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to\nhimself, “Take its legs off.” Harry was sure he knew what that was\nabout. Ron’s greatest fear was spiders.\n“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin.\nHarry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn’t ready. How could you make\na dementor less frightening? But he didn’t want to ask for more\ntime; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.\n“Neville, we’re going to back away,” said Professor Lupin. “Let\nyou have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the next person for-\nward. . . . Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot —”\nThey all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville\nalone beside the wardrobe.

Snape\nwas bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.\n“R — r — riddikulus!” squeaked Neville.\nThere was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wear-\ning a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a\nmoth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\nThere was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and\nProfessor Lupin shouted, “Parvati! Forward!”\nParvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her.\nThere was another crack, and where he had stood was a blood-\nstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati\nand it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its\nstiff arms rising —\n“Riddikulus!” cried Parvati.\nA bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled,\nfell face forward, and its head rolled off.\n“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin.\nSeamus darted past Parvati.\nCrack!

Dean!”\nDean hurried forward.\nCrack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over\nand began to creep along the floor like a crab.\n“Riddikulus!” yelled Dean.\nThere was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.\n“Excellent! Ron, you next!”\nRon leapt forward.\nCrack!\nQuite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and cov-\nered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menac-\ningly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then —\n“Riddikulus!” bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs vanished; it\nrolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its\nway and it came to a halt at Harry’s feet.

His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After\nboggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that\nlurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles\nand the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those\nwho had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas,\ncreepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed\nhands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.\nHarry only wished he was as happy with some of his other\n141\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nclasses. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vin-\ndictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why.

Snape didn’t seem to find it funny.\nHis eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor\nLupin’s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever.\nHarry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor\nTrelawney’s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and\nsymbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous\neyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn’t like\nProfessor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bor-\ndering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Laven-\nder Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower room\nat lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks\non their faces, as though they knew things the others didn’t.

He was distracted, how-\never, by a disturbance at the front of the line.\nLavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm\naround her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and\nDean Thomas, who were looking very serious.\n“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione anxiously as she,\nHarry, and Ron went to join the group.\n“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati whispered.\n“It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by a fox.”\n“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.”\n“I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You know\nwhat day it is?”\n“Er —”\n“The sixteenth of October! ‘That thing you’re dreading, it will\nhappen on the sixteenth of October!’ Remember? She was right,\nshe was right!”\nThe whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus\nshook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said,\n“You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?”\n“Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at\nHermione with streaming eyes, “but I was obviously dreading him\ndying, wasn’t I?”\n“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —\n“Was Binky an old rabbit?”\n“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a baby!”\nParvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s shoulders.\n“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione.\nParvati glared at her.\n148\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY\n“Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to the rest of\nthe group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die today, did he? Lavender\njust got the news today —” Lavender wailed loudly. “— and she\ncan’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock —”\n“Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly, “she\ndoesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.”\nProfessor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that mo-\nment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking\ndaggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated\nthemselves on either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for\nthe whole class.\nHarry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor\nMcGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was\nshe who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.\n“One moment, please!” she called as the class made to leave. “As\nyou’re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission\nforms to me before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so\ndon’t forget!”\nNeville put up his hand.\n“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost —”\n“Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,”\nsaid Professor McGonagall. “She seemed to think it was safer.

No\nform, no visiting the village. That’s the rule.”\n“But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know, they’re\nMuggles, they don’t really understand about — about Hogwarts\nforms and stuff,” Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigor-\nous nods. “If you said I could go —”\n“But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up and\npiling her papers neatly into a drawer. “The form clearly states that\nthe parent or guardian must give permission.” She turned to look\nat him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? “I’m sorry,\nPotter, but that’s my final word. You had better hurry, or you’ll be\nlate for your next lesson.”\nThere was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a\nlot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed\nan “all-for-the-best” expression that made Ron even angrier, and\nHarry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and hap-\npily about what they were going to do first, once they got into\nHogsmeade.\n150\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nFLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY\n“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry\nup. “You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.”\n“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.”\nThe Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot\nbetter if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with\neveryone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about\nbeing left behind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had\noffered to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as Harry\nhad already told Professor McGonagall he hadn’t had it signed, that\nwas no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak,\nbut Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumb-\nledore had told them about the dementors being able to see\nthrough them.

Lupin’s eyes were twinkling.\n“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.\n“Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing Harry a\nchipped mug of tea. “You’re not worried, are you?”\n“No,” said Harry.\nHe thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he’d\nseen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to.

Not only was this the last answer he’d expected,\nbut Lupin had said Voldemort’s name. The only person Harry had\never heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor\nDumbledore.\n“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But\nI didn’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in\nthe staffroom.

Around three in the morning, when\nmany students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore\ncame in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had\nbeen prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for\ntalking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and\nHermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore’s\nfootsteps drew nearer.\n“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a whisper.\n164\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\n“No. All well here?”\n“Everything under control, sir.”\n“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve found a tem-\nporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You’ll be able to\nmove them back in tomorrow.”\n“And the Fat Lady, sir?”\n“Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently\nshe refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked.\nShe’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr.\nFilch restore her.”\nHarry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more\nfootsteps.\n“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening\nhard. “The whole of the third floor has been searched. He’s not\nthere. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.”\n“What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney’s room?\nThe Owlery?”\n“All searched . . .”\n“Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to linger.”\n“Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?” asked\nSnape.\nHarry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other\near.\n“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.”\nHarry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they\nstood; Dumbledore’s back was to him, but he could see Percy’s face,\nrapt with attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry.\n“You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just\n165\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\nbefore — ah — the start of term?” said Snape, who was barely open-\ning his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.\n“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was something like\nwarning in his voice.\n“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered\nthe school without inside help. I did express my concerns when\nyou appointed —”\n“I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have\nhelped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so\nclear that the subject was closed that Snape didn’t reply. “I must go\ndown to the dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform\nthem when our search was complete.”\n“Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.\n“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no dementor\nwill cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.”\nPercy looked slightly abashed.

Both of them\nhad their eyes open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.\n“What was all that about?” Ron mouthed.\nThe school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days.\nThe theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder\nand wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their\nnext Herbology class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could\nturn into a flowering shrub.\nThe Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and\n166\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\nreplaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony.\nNobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time\nchallenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously\ncomplicated passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.\n“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan angrily to\nPercy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”\n“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy. “Fright-\nened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only\none brave enough to volunteer.”\nSir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s worries. He was\nnow being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along\ncorridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected,\non his mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like an ex-\ntremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor McGonagall\nsummoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression\non her face Harry thought someone must have died.\n“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,” she said\nin a very serious voice. “I know this will come as a shock to you,\nbut Sirius Black —”\n“I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard Ron’s dad\ntelling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.”\nProfessor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at\nHarry for a moment or two, then said, “I see! Well, in that case,\nPotter, you’ll understand why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you\nto be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with\nonly your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter —”\n“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged.\n“I’ve got to train, Professor!”\nProfessor McGonagall considered him intently.

I’d be happier if a teacher were\npresent. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.”\nThe weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew\nnearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than\never under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training\nsession before Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team some\nunwelcome news.\n“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry.\n“Flint’s just been to see me. We’re playing Hufflepuff instead.”\n“Why?” chorused the rest of the team.\n“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said\nWood, grinding his teeth furiously. “But it’s obvious why they’re\ndoing it. Don’t want to play in this weather. Think it’ll damage\ntheir chances. . . .”\nThere had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as\nWood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder.\n“There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry furiously.\n“He’s faking it!”\n“I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood bitterly. “And\nwe’ve been practicing all those moves assuming we’re playing\nSlytherin, and instead it’s Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite differ-\nent. They’ve got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory —”\n168\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\n“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.\n“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.\n“Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to giggle again.\n“He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two words to-\ngether,” said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know why you’re worried,\nOliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry\ncaught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?”\n“We were playing in completely different conditions!” Wood\nshouted, his eyes bulging slightly. “Diggory’s put a very strong side\ntogether! He’s an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this!\nWe mustn’t relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to\nwrong-foot us! We must win!”\n“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. “We’re\ntaking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.”\nThe day before the match, the winds reached howling point and\nthe rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and\nclassrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin\nteam was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.\n“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the\ngale outside pounded the windows.\nHarry had no room in his head to worry about anything except\nthe match tomorrow.

Sit down.”\nBut Harry didn’t move.\n“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.\n“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a\ntwisted smile. “I believe I told you to sit down?”\nBut Harry stayed where he was.\n“What’s wrong with him?”\nSnape’s black eyes glittered.\n“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he\nwished it were. “Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to\nask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.”\nHarry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked\naround at the class.\n“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has\nnot left any record of the topics you have covered so far —”\n“Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindy-\nlows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re just about to start —”\n“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for information.\nI was merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s lack of organi-\nzation.”\n“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever\nhad,” said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agree-\n170\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\nment from the rest of the class.

He could have finished him off\nfor us!”\nHarry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was\nstill dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had\nwoken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and\nsat bolt upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to\nhim, blowing hard in his ear.\n“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously.\n173\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER NINE\nPeeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward\nout of the room, cackling.\nHarry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half\npast four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to\nsleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the\nsounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the\nwind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees\nin the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the\nQuidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any\nthought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two\nThousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.\nAs Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg.\nHe bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his\nbushy tail and drag him outside.\n“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crook-\nshanks suspiciously. “There are plenty of mice around this place —\ngo and chase them. Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks down\nthe spiral staircase with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”\nThe noise of the storm was even louder in the common room.\nHarry knew better than to think the match would be canceled;\nQuidditch matches weren’t called off for trifles like thunderstorms.\nNevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had\npointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a\nfifth year and a lot bigger than Harry.

He tried to speak sev-\neral times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hope-\nlessly and beckoned them to follow him.\nThe wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they\nwalked out onto the field.

It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as\nthough Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?\nAnd then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside\nhim, just as he became aware of something moving on the field\nbelow. . . .\nBefore he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the\nSnitch and looked down.\nAt least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at\nhim, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water\n178\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\nwere rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it\nagain. . . . Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head . . . a\nwoman . . .\n“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”\n“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now. . . .”\n“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —”\nNumbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s brain. . . . What\nwas he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her. . . . She\nwas going to die. . . . She was going to be murdered. . . .\nHe was falling, falling through the icy mist.\n“Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . .”\nA shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and\nHarry knew no more.\n“Lucky the ground was so soft.”\n“I thought he was dead for sure.”\n“But he didn’t even break his glasses.”\nHarry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense\nwhatsoever. He didn’t have a clue where he was, or how he’d got\nthere, or what he’d been doing before he got there. All he knew was\nthat every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.\n“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”\nScariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures . . .\ncold . . . screaming . . .\nHarry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The\nGryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot,\nwas gathered around his bed.

The light-\nning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the dementors . . .\n“What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly they all\ngasped.\n“You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty feet?”\n“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was shaking.\nHermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely\nbloodshot.\n“But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we doing a\nreplay?”\nNo one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a\nstone.\n“We didn’t — lose?”\n“Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He\ndidn’t realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw\nyou on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But\nthey won fair and square . . . even Wood admits it.”\n“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t\nthere.\n“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying to drown\nhimself.”\nHarry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred\ngrabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.\n“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.”\n“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George.\n“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points,\n180\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRIM DEFEAT\nright? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw\nand Slytherin . . .”\n“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said\nGeorge.\n“But if they beat Ravenclaw . . .”\n“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against\nHufflepuff . . .”\n“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either\nway —”\nHarry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost . . . for the first\ntime ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.\nAfter ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the\nteam to leave him in peace.\n“We’ll come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t beat your-\nself up, Harry, you’re still the best Seeker we’ve ever had.”\nThe team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pom-\nfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and\nHermione moved nearer to Harry’s bed.\n“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking\nvoice. “I’ve never seen him like that before.

He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking\nat him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something\nmatter-of-fact to say.\n“Did someone get my Nimbus?”\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\n“Er —”\n“What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.\n“Well . . . when you fell off, it got blown away,” said Hermione\nhesitantly.\n“And?”\n“And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Wil-\nlow.”\nHarry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very vio-\nlent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\n“And?” he said, dreading the answer.\n“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It — it\ndoesn’t like being hit.”\n“Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came\naround,” said Hermione in a very small voice.\nSlowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside\ndown, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto\nthe bed, the only remains of Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broom-\nstick.\n182\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nC H A P T E R T E N\nTHE MARAUDER’S MAP\nM\nadam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital\nwing for the rest of the weekend.

He knew he was being stupid,\nknew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t help\nit; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best friends.\nHe had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Ha-\ngrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow\ncabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a\nget-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry\nkept it shut under his bowl of fruit.

Was the\nGrim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to\nspend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?\nAnd then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humili-\nated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors\nwere horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near\none. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.\nBecause Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now.\nHe had heard her words, heard them over and over again during\nthe night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at\nthe strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors ap-\nproached him, he heard the last moments of his mother’s life, her\nattempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Volde-\nmort’s laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed fitfully,\nsinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified\npleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice.\nIt was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school\non Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even\nif he had to endure Draco Malfoy’s taunting.

Professor Lupin had brought\nalong a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged crea-\nture who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather\nfrail and harmless-looking.\n“Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as they took\nnotes. “You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops\nahead — people follow the light — then —”\nThe hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the\nglass.\nWhen the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and\nheaded for the door, Harry among them, but —\n“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a word.”\nHarry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the\nhinkypunk’s box with a cloth.\n“I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back to his desk\nand starting to pile books into his briefcase, “and I’m sorry about\nyour broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?”\n“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.”\nLupin sighed.\n“They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I\narrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get\nnear enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey\nGudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it.\nNo broomstick would have a chance.\n“Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry with diffi-\nculty.\n186\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MARAUDER’S MAP\nLupin looked at him quickly.\n“Yes, I did.

Am I just — ?”\n“It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor Lupin\nsharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind. “The dementors af-\nfect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your\npast that the others don’t have.”\nA ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating\nLupin’s gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\n“Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth.\nThey infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and de-\nspair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around"

There was a moment’s si-\nlence, then —\n“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry bitterly.\n“They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase\nwith a snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their\nsupply of human prey has dried up. . . . I don’t think they could resist\nthe large crowd around the Quidditch field.

Lupin nodded\ngrimly.\n“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t\nneed walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all\ntrapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheerful\nthought. Most of them go mad within weeks.”\n“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said slowly. “He\ngot away. . . .”\nLupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly\nto catch it.\n“Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have found a way\nto fight them.

Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although\nthey could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repos-\nsessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in\nthe chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw\nno hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore’s anger\nseemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances.\nTwo weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened sud-\ndenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were re-\nvealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle,\nthere was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the\nCharms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shim-\nmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The stu-\ndents were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both\nRon and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and\nthough Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with\n189\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\nPercy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry\nwasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was\nvery grateful.\nTo everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another\nHogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term.\n“We can do all our Christmas shopping there!” said Hermione.\n“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints\nfrom Honeydukes!”\nResigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying\nbehind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from\nWood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different\nmakes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team prac-\ntice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he\ndefinitely needed a new broom of his own.\nOn the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid\ngood-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and\nscarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back\ntoward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the win-\ndows, and the castle was very still and quiet.\n“Psst — Harry!”\nHe turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred\nand George peering out at him from behind a statue of a hump-\nbacked, one-eyed witch.\n“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How come you’re\nnot going to Hogsmeade?”\n“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said\nFred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in here. . . .”\nHe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-"

We don’t really need it anymore.”\n“And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?” said Harry.\n“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a gri-\nmace as though Harry had mortally offended him. “Explain,\nGeorge.”\n“Well . . . when we were in our first year, Harry — young, care-\nfree, and innocent —”\nHarry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever\nbeen innocent.\n“— well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot\nof bother with Filch.”\n“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for\nsome reason —”\n“So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with\nthe usual —”\n191\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\n“— detention —”\n“— disembowelment —”\n“— and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing\ncabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.”\n“Don’t tell me —” said Harry, starting to grin.\n“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George caused a\ndiversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer\nopen, and grabbed — this.”\n“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George. “We don’t\nreckon Filch ever found out how to work it.

His little ink self appeared to be tapping\nthe witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real\nwand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at\nthe map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure.\nThe word inside said, “Dissendium.”\n“Dissendium!” Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\nAt once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly\nthin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then\ntucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst,\nand pushed himself forward.\nHe slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then\nlanded on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was\npitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, “Lumos!” and saw that\nhe was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map,\ntapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, “Mischief man-\naged!” The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked\nit inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and appre-\nhensive, he set off.\nThe passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant\nrabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now\nand then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of\nhim.\nIt took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sus-\ntain him. After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise.\nPanting, Harry sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\n195\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\nTen minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps,\nwhich rose out of sight above him.

Then, without warn-\ning, his head hit something hard.\nIt seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top\nof his head, listening. He couldn’t hear any sounds above him. Very\nslowly, he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\nHe was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes.\nHarry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it — it blended so\nperfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was\nthere. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led up-\nstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to mention the tin-\nkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door.\nWondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open\nmuch closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\n“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve nearly cleaned\nus out —” said a woman’s voice.\nA pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind\nan enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard\nthe man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get\nanother chance —\nQuickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place\nand climbed the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside\nand shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the\ntop of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the\ncounter of Honeydukes — he ducked, crept sideways, and then\nstraightened up.\n196\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE MARAUDER’S MAP\nHoneydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no\none looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking\naround, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would\nspread over Dudley’s piggy face if he could see where Harry was\nnow.\nThere were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking\nsweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink\nsquares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of dif-\nferent kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of\nEvery Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitat-\ning sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another\nwall were “Special Effects” sweets: Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum\n(which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to\npop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny\nblack Pepper Imps (“breathe fire for your friends!”), Ice Mice\n(“hear your teeth chatter and squeak!”), peppermint creams shaped\nlike toads (“hop realistically in the stomach!”), fragile sugar-spun\nquills, and exploding bonbons.\nHarry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw\na sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop ( ).\nUnusual Tastes\nRon and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray\nof blood-flavored lollipops.

Staring through the\ndense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back\nfrom the table right beside theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs\nof the teachers and minister as they sat down.\nNext he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high\nheels, and heard a woman’s voice.\n201\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TEN\n“A small gillywater —”\n“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.\n“Four pints of mulled mead —”\n“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid.\n“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella —”\n“Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.\n“So you’ll be the red currant rum, Minister.”\n“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice. “Lovely to\nsee you again, I must say. Have one yourself, won’t you? Come and\njoin us. . . .”\n“Well, thank you very much, Minister.”\nHarry watched the glittering heels march away and back again.\nHis heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat.

Then he said in a\nquiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you\nheard what happened up at the school at Halloween?”\n“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta.\n“Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGona-\ngall exasperatedly.\n“Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?” whispered\nMadam Rosmerta.\n202"

The in-\nformation is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper,\nand is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the\nSecret-Keeper chooses to divulge it.

He sat down on his\nbed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,\nsearching, until . . .\nHe stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was\nhis father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry\nhad inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother,\nalight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there . . . that\nmust be him. Their best man . . . Harry had never given him a\nthought before.\nIf he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would never have\nguessed it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn’t sunken\nand waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been\nworking for Voldemort when this picture had been taken?

Did he\nrealize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that\nwould make him unrecognizable?\nBut the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought, staring into\nthe handsome, laughing face.

He watched, as though somebody\nwas playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Petti-\ngrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces.\nHe could hear (though having no idea what Black’s voice might\nsound like) a low, excited mutter. “It has happened, My\nLord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper. . . .” And\nthen came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that\nHarry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew\nnear. . . ."

They didn’t seem to understand at all.\n“D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too\nnear me?” Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking appre-\nhensive. “I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Volde-\nmort.

Crook-\nshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\n“You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,” said Ron fu-\nriously, sitting on Harry’s bed nursing his toe. “Can’t you shut that\nthing up?” he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room,\nCrookshanks’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\nHarry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw\nit back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron’s sti-\nfled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands.\nIt had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket,\nand he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat,\nwas now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too.\n“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said."

And despite Ron’s frequent com-\n226\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FIREBOLT\nplaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron\nwould be very miserable if Scabbers died.\nChristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the\nGryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut\nCrookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying\nto kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks’s fresh at-\ntempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to\neach other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which\nhe had brought down to the common room with him. For some\nreason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn’t say any-\nthing, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too\nhad been criticizing her cat.\nAt lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the\nHouse tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a sin-\ngle table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors\nDumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there,\nalong with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown\ncoat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.\nThere were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking\nfirst years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year.\n“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and\nHermione approached the table. “As there are so few of us, it\nseemed foolish to use the House tables. . . . Sit down, sit down!”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of\nthe table.\n“Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end\nof a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and\ntugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal\na large, pointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.\n227\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\nHarry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron’s eye and they\nboth grinned; Snape’s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat\ntoward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once.\n“Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around.\nAs Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the\nGreat Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding\ntoward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined\ndress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like\na glittering, oversized dragonfly.\n“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore, standing\nup."

I at once hastened from\nmy tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. . . .”\n“Certainly, certainly,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “Let\nme draw you up a chair —”\nAnd he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which\nrevolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Pro-\nfessors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did\nnot sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table,\nand she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.\n“I dare not, Headmaster!

Never forget that when thirteen\ndine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!”\n“We’ll risk it, Sibyll,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently.\n“Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.”\nProfessor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the\n228\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE FIREBOLT\nempty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though ex-\npecting a thunderbolt to hit the table.

It is called the Patronus Charm.”\n“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.\n“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said\nLupin, “which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as\na shield between you and the dementor.”\nHarry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-\nsized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The\nPatronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things\nthat the dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire to\nsurvive — but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the de-\nmentors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm\nmight be too advanced for you.

Certainly, nothing\nthat had happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do.

Out of the cor-\nner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into\nthe packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb\nagain.\n“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. “Ex-\ncellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!”\n“Can we have another go? Just one more go?”\n“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for one night.\nHere —”\nHe handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate.\n“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same\ntime next week?”\n“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched\nLupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disap-\npearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.\n“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you must’ve\nknown Sirius Black as well.”\nLupin turned very quickly.\n“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply.\n“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts\ntoo. . . .”\n242\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PATRONUS\nLupin’s face relaxed.\n“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did.

Then\nHarry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father. . . .\nHe felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full\nof chocolate.

According to Wood, this was good news for\nGryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw\ntoo. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a\nweek. This meant that with Lupin’s anti-dementor classes, which in\nthemselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry\nhad just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he\nwasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose\n243\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nimmense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night,\nwithout fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common\nroom, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune\ndictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file\nupon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and\nsnapped when she was interrupted.\n“How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one evening as\nHarry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for\nSnape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tot-\ntering pile of books.\n“Doing what?”\n“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her talking to Pro-\nfessor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were go-\ning on about yesterday’s lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there,\nbecause she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie\nMcMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but\nhalf of them are at the same time as Divination, and she’s never\nmissed one of them either!”\nHarry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s im-\npossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with\nSnape’s essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again,\nthis time by Wood.\n“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall\nabout the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit shirty with me. Told me\nI’d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about\nwinning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I\ntold her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the\nSnitch first.” Wood shook his head in disbelief. “Honestly, the\n244\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PATRONUS\nway she was yelling at me . . . you’d think I’d said something terri-\nble. . . . Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep\nit. . . .” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGona-\ngall’s severe voice. “‘As long as necessary, Wood’ . . . I reckon it’s\ntime you ordered a new broom, Harry. There’s an order form at the\nback of Which Broomstick . . . you could get a Nimbus Two Thou-\nsand and One, like Malfoy’s got.”\n“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said Harry\nflatly.\nJanuary faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the"

The match against Ravenclaw was drawing\nnearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn’t ordered a new broom. He\nwas now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt af-\nter every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his\nshoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted.\n“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall\ntold him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened\nhis mouth. “We’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but Pro-\nfessor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling\nHex. I shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now, please\nstop badgering me.”\nTo make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor lessons were\nnot going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he\nwas able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the\nboggart-dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too\nfeeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semi-\ntransparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it\n245\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nthere. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire\nto hear his parents’ voices again.\n“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin\nsternly in their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old\nwizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You\naren’t passing out anymore, are you?”\n“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or\nsomething,” said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”\n“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve\nachieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors\nput in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be\nable to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground.”\n“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.\n“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling.\n“Here — you’ve earned a drink — something from the Three\nBroomsticks. You won’t have tried it before —”\nHe pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\n“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that\nstuff!”\nLupin raised an eyebrow.\n“Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from\nHogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.\n“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious.\n“Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not\nthat I’m supposed to take sides, as a teacher . . . ,” he added hastily.\nThey drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced some-\nthing he’d been wondering for a while.\n“What’s under a dementor’s hood?”\n246\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE PATRONUS\nProfessor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully."

You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to\nuse its last and worst weapon.”\n“What’s that?”\n“They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly\ntwisted smile. “It’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy\nutterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there,\nbecause they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim\nand — and suck out his soul.”\nHarry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\n“What — they kill — ?”\n“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can exist with-\nout your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still\nworking. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory,\nno . . . anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just —\nexist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost.”\nLupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s the fate that\nawaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The\nMinistry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they\nfind him.”\nHarry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having\ntheir soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of\nBlack.\n“He deserves it,” he said suddenly.\n“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really think anyone\ndeserves that?”\n“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For . . . for some things . . .”\n247\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nHe would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation\nhe’d overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black\nbetraying his mother and father, but it would have involved reveal-\ning that he’d gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew\nLupin wouldn’t be very impressed by that. So he finished his but-\nterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom.\nHarry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a de-\nmentor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost\nin unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul\nsucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGo-\nnagall halfway up the stairs.\n“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!”\n“Sorry, Professor —”\n“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room.\nWell, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there\ndoesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very\ngood friend somewhere, Potter. . . .”\nHarry’s jaw dropped.

Listen, can I still have a go on it?\nTomorrow?”\n“Yeah . . . anything . . . ,” said Harry, his heart lighter than it\nhad been in a month. “You know what — we should make up with\nHermione. . . . She was only trying to help. . . .”\n“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common room now —\nworking, for a change —”\nThey turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw\nNeville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to\nbe refusing him entrance.\n“I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully. “But I\nmust’ve dropped them somewhere!”\n“A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and\nRon: “Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in\nirons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!”\n“Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level with\nNeville.\n“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably. “I made\nhim tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because\nhe keeps changing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done\nwith them!”\n“Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked ex-\ntremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them\ninto the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as\nevery head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by\npeople exclaiming over his Firebolt.\n“Where’d you get it, Harry?”\n“Will you let me have a go?”\n249\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n“Have you ridden it yet, Harry?”\n“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on Cleansweep\nSevens!”\n“Can I just hold it, Harry?”\nAfter ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed\naround and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and\nHarry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who\nhadn’t rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoid-\ning their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she\nlooked up.\n“I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the\nFirebolt.\n“See, Hermione?

The whole common room fell silent, staring,\npetrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing\nlouder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into view, drag-\nging with him a bedsheet.\n“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s table.\n“LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\n“Ron, what — ?”\n“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!”\nHermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewil-\ndered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was\nsomething red on it.

Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely\nthat Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that\nthe ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that\nRon had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks\nhad landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie.\nPersonally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scab-\nbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence\nall pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.\n252\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRYFFINDOR\nVERSUS RAVENCLAW\n“Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said shrilly. “First\nthe Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s my fault, isn’t it!

The Firebolt turned with\nthe lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his\ngrip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned\ninto a green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia\n254\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRYFFINDOR\nVERSUS RAVENCLAW\nSpinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive,\nbrushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty,\nfifty feet into the air again —\n“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.\nHarry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he out-\nstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and\nwithin ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.\nThe team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a\nminute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the\nothers; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her eas-\nily, and caught it again.\nIt was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence\nof the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves fault-\nlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have\na single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out,\nwas a first.\n“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said Wood. “Not\nunless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t\nyou?”\n“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing\nit were stronger.\n“The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver.

As Harry entered the\nGreat Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there\nwas a good deal of excited muttering.

Cedric Diggory came over to congratu-\nlate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his\nNimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater,\nasked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\n“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily as she\nexamined the Firebolt closely “Penelope and I have got a bet on,” he\ntold the team. “Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!”\nPenelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went\nback to her table.\n“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an urgent whisper.\n257\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n“I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m coming, Penny!” And he bustled\noff to join her in a piece of toast.\n“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling\nvoice.\nDraco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle\nright behind him.\n“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.\n“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy, eyes glit-\ntering maliciously. “Shame it doesn’t come with a parachute — in\ncase you get too near a dementor.”\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,” said Harry.\n“Then it could catch the Snitch for you.”\nThe Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale eyes nar-\nrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of\nthe Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking\nMalfoy whether Harry’s broom really was a Firebolt.\nAt a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker\nrooms. The weather couldn’t have been more different from their\nmatch against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light\nbreeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry,\nthough nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quid-\nditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school\nmoving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school\nrobes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the\nT-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only\nhoped he wouldn’t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Profes-\nsor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\n258\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nGRYFFINDOR\nVERSUS RAVENCLAW\n“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to\nleave the locker rooms. “If we lose this match, we’re out of the run-"

Just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be\nokay!”\nThey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The\nRavenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the mid-\ndle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their\nteam. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry\ncouldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely\npretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind\ntheir captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stom-\nach that he didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.\n“Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Madam Hooch said briskly, and\nWood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\n“Mount your brooms . . . on my whistle . . . three — two —\none —”\nHarry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher\nand faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium\nand began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while\nto the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley\ntwins’ friend Lee Jordan.\n“They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt\nthat Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which\nBroomstick, the Firebolt’s going to be the broom of choice for the\nnational teams at this year’s World Championship —”\n“Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in the\nmatch?” interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice.\n“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background\n259\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\ninformation — the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake\nand —”\n“Jordan!”\n“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor\nheading for goal . . .”\nHarry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing\naround for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing\nhim closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier — she kept cut-\nting across him, forcing him to change direction.\n“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he\nwhooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\nHarry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Raven-\nclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in\nscoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the\nfield went wild, he saw it — the Snitch was close to the ground,\nflitting near one of the barriers.\nHarry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him —\nHarry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his\nspeciality, he was ten feet away —\nThen a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelt-\ning out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch,\nand in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished."

Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were\nMalfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Cap-\ntain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded\nrobes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle’s\nshoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost\nfury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.\n“An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and cowardly at-\ntempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker!

Two days after Black’s break-in, she\nsent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive\nover breakfast — a Howler.\nThe school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail\nas usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front\nof him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron,\nwho were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at\nonce — Ron had got one from his mother the year before.\n“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised.\nNeville didn’t need telling twice.

Hedwig got his attention by nipping\nhim sharply on the wrist.\n“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”\nHarry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to\nsome of Neville’s cornflakes.

At nine o’clock, Hagrid\nwalked them back up to the castle.\nA large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board\nwhen they returned to the common room.\n“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over the heads\nto read the new notice. “What d’you reckon?” he added quietly to\nHarry as they went to sit down.\n“Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage into Hon-\neydukes. . . .” Harry said, even more quietly.\n“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked\naround at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind\nthem and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hid-\ning her.\n“Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again . . . I’ll tell Professor\nMcGonagall about that map!” said Hermione.\n“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron, not\nlooking at Hermione.\n“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black\nnearly did to you! I mean it, I’ll tell —”\n“So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron furiously.\n“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?”\nHermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss,\nCrookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened\nlook at the expression on Ron’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and\nhurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.\n“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there had been\nno interruption. “Come on, last time we went you didn’t see any-\nthing.

Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\n“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape, coming to a halt\nand looking from one to the other. “An odd place to meet —”\nTo Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes flicked to the\ndoorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.\n“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just — met\nhere.”\n“Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up in unex-\npected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good rea-\nson. . . . I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower,\nwhere you belong.”\nHarry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned\nthe corner, Harry looked back.

There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s\nwildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him\nsome gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko’s with their\nmoney bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering,\nbut their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog\nSpawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.\nThe day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like stay-\ning indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and\n278\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSNAPE’S GRUDGE\nclimbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted\ndwelling in Britain.

D’you think he’ll cry when\nthey cut off his hippogriff’s —”\nSPLAT.\nMalfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silver-\nblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.\n“What the — ?”\nRon had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was\nlaughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the\nspot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.\n“What was that? Who did that?”\n“Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the air of one\ncommenting on the weather.\nCrabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles\nwere no use against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the\ndeserted landscape.\nHarry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy\npuddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge.\nSPLATTER.\nCrabbe and Goyle caught some this time.

As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was\nRon he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stum-\nbled — and his huge, flat foot caught the hem of Harry’s cloak.\nHarry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face.\nFor a split second, Malfoy stared at him.\n“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then he\nturned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe\nand Goyle behind him.\nHarry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.\n“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at\nthe point where Harry had disappeared, “you’d better run for it! If\nMalfoy tells anyone — you’d better get back to the castle, quick —”\n“See you later,” said Harry, and without another word, he tore\nback down the path toward Hogsmeade.\nWould Malfoy believe what he had seen?

He would have to leave the cloak\nwhere it was, it was too much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had\ntipped off a teacher — he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started\nto climb, fast as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of\nthe chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it\nwith his wand, stuck his head through, and hoisted himself out; the\nhump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the\nstatue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.\nIt was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black\nrobes swishing, then stopped in front of him.\n“So,” he said.\nThere was a look of suppressed triumph about him. Harry tried\nto look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy\nhands, which he quickly hid in his pockets.\n“Come with me, Potter,” said Snape.\nHarry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean\non the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked\ndown the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape’s office.\nHarry had been in here only once before, and he had been in\nvery serious trouble then too. Snape had acquired a few more slimy\nhorrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind\nhis desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening\natmosphere.\n“Sit,” said Snape.\nHarry sat. Snape, however, remained standing.\n“Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,”\nsaid Snape.\nHarry didn’t say anything.\n282\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSNAPE’S GRUDGE\n“He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran\ninto Weasley — apparently alone.”\nStill, Harry didn’t speak.\n“Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley,\nwhen a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head.

It was exactly like trying\nto stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\n“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you\nimagine what it might have been, Potter?”\n“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\n“It was your head, Potter.

Snape’s thin mouth curled into a hor-\nrible smile.\n“So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from the Min-\nister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry\nPotter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law\nunto himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Fa-\nmous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the\nconsequences.”\nHarry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling\nthe truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape had no proof — yet.\n“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape\nsaid suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was exceedingly arrogant.\nA small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think\nhe was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place\nwith his friends and admirers . . . The resemblance between you is\nuncanny.”\n“My dad didn’t strut,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n“And neither do I.”\n“Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went\non, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were\nfor lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so\nswollen —”\n“SHUT UP!”\nHarry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt\nsince his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He\ndidn’t care that Snape’s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing\ndangerously.\n284\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nSNAPE’S GRUDGE\n“What did you say to me, Potter?”\n“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I know the\ntruth, all right?

You\nwouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for my dad!”\nSnape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\n“And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which\nyour father saved my life?” he whispered. “Or did he consider the\ndetails too unpleasant for precious Potter’s delicate ears?”\nHarry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened and didn’t\nwant to admit it — but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth."

Then let me correct\nyou — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing\njoke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father\nhadn’t got cold feet at the last moment.

He was saving his own skin as much as mine.\nHad their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hog-\nwarts.”\nSnape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\n“Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly.\nHarry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears.\n“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster!\nPull them out, Potter!”\nCold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s\ntricks and the Marauder’s Map.\nSnap picked up the Zonko’s bag.\n“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to\n285\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\ntip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He — brought them back\nfrom Hogsmeade last time —”\n“Indeed?

Harry tried with all his might to\nkeep his face impassive.\n“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug.\nSnape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\n“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of parchment?” he\nsaid. “Why don’t I just — throw this away?”\nHis hand moved toward the fire.\n“No!” Harry said quickly.\n“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this another\ntreasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it — something else? A let-\nter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or — instructions to get into\nHogsmeade without passing the dementors?”\nHarry blinked.

A large shape had\nappeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin\nwas clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby\nrobes.\n“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly.\n“I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he\nstrode back to his desk. “I have just asked Potter to empty his pock-\nets. He was carrying this.”\nSnape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs.\n287\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nMoony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd,\nclosed expression appeared on Lupin’s face.\n“Well?” said Snape.\nLupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression\nthat Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.\n“Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly full of Dark\nMagic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where\ndo you imagine Potter got such a thing?”\nLupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry’s direc-\ntion, warned him not to interrupt.\n“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you really think\nso, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parch-\nment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not\ndangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop —”\n“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. “You\nthink a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You\ndon’t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufac-\nturers?”\nHarry didn’t understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, ap-\nparently, did Lupin.\n“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?” he said.\n“Harry, do you know any of these men?”\n“No,” said Harry quickly.\n“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to Snape. “It looks"

He\nglanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I\nhappen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many\nyears ago. Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked\namazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into your possession. I\nam, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in.

One look at\nher face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened.\nHis heart plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall?\n“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as she stopped\nin front of them. “Or have you just been to tell on us?”\n“No,” said Hermione.

Nothing will\nhave changed.”\n“Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do all the\nwork alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.”\n“Oh, Ron!”\nHermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and broke down\ncompletely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly\non the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.\n“Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . ,” she sobbed.\n“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly re-\nlieved that she had let go of him. “And he was a bit useless. You\nnever know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.”\nThe safety measures imposed on the students since Black’s second\nbreak-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go\nand visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to\nhim was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.\nHe seemed numb with shock at the verdict.\n“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied.

Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe\nand Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively.\n“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle\nsteps. “That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket. I’m jus’ gonna\nmake sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had.

Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle\nstood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.\n“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —”\n“Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as\nshe swung it back.\n“Get off, Ron!”\nHermione pulled out her wand.

Ron looked behind him.\n“Where’s Hermione gone?”\nHarry looked around too.

She continued, however, as\nthough she had not.\n“Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said dreamily. “I\ndo not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb’s\ninfinite depths.

Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both\nglared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying\nHermione with unmistakable anger.\n“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this\nclass, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the\nnoble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever\nmeeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”\nThere was a moment’s silence.

Didn’t you, Professor? ‘Around Easter, one of our\nnumber will leave us forever!’ You said it ages ago, Professor!”\nProfessor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.\n“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be\nleaving us.

Even without Div-\nination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was\nusually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the\nlibrary the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s under her\neyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.\nRon had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s appeal. When\nhe wasn’t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously\nthick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psy-\nchology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so\nabsorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks.\nHarry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-\nditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tac-\ntics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place\non the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was lead-\ning the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as\nWood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the\nmatch by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant\nthat the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing\nthe Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.\n“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty points up,”\nWood told Harry constantly. “Only if we’re more than fifty points\nup, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You’ve got that,\nhaven’t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we’re —”\n“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.\nThe whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming\n300\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL\nmatch.

But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood,\nwanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and\nMalfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting\nabout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even\nmore furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of\npunishment. Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage\nhim in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-\nbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of\nthe entire school.\nNever, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached in such a\nhighly charged atmosphere.

Wood had given instructions that Harry\nshould be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins\ntried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House\ntook up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for\nHarry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a\nvast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt’s\n301\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nsafety than his own. When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely\nin his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at\nbreak times to check that it was still there.\nAll usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common\nroom the night before the match. Even Hermione had put down\nher books.\n“I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously.\nThere was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were\ndealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than\never. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field\nin the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and\nmuttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at\nFred’s and George’s jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Her-\nmione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think\nabout the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible\nsensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his\nstomach.\n“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though she\nlooked positively terrified.\n“You’ve got a Firebolt!” said Ron.\n“Yeah . . . ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing.\nIt came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled,\n“Team!

Harry couldn’t help grinning\nbroadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables\nwere applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as\nthey passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than\nusual.\nWood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while\ntouching nothing himself.

In what seemed\nlike no time at all, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go —”\nThey walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-\nquarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet\nflags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners\nwith slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE\nCUP!” Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred\npeople were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered\non their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wear-\ning green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.\n“And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan, who was act-\ning as commentator as usual. “Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet,\nWeasley, Weasley, and Wood.

As Percy\n314\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S\nPREDICTION\nhoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades.

He had provided a large tub of fresh\nflobberworms for the class, and told them that to pass the test,\ntheir flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour.\nAs flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it\nwas the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and also gave\n317\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to\nHagrid.\n“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them, bending low\non the pretense of checking that Harry’s flobberworm was still\nalive. “Bin cooped up too long.

Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione’s\nboggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them\non the top of the steps.\nCornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was\nstanding there staring out at the grounds.

One was so ancient he appeared to be withering\nbefore their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin\nblack mustache.

Don’t think she was convinced, though. . . .”\n“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor\nTrelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!”\nThe tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were\nclosed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry\ncough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to\nwhere Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal\nball.\n“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze\ninto the Orb. . . .

He\nthought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.\n“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape . . . um . . .”\n“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney.\n“Think, now . . .”\nHarry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\n“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.\n“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on\nthe parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be\nseeing the outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of\nMagic! Look closer. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its\nhead?”\n“Yes,” said Harry firmly.\n“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are you quite\nsure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a\nshadowy figure raising an axe behind it?”\n“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\n“No blood? No weeping Hagrid?”\n“No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the\nroom and the heat. “It looks fine, it’s — flying away. . . .”\nProfessor Trelawney sighed.\n“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. . . .

Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in\nher armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.\n“S — sorry?” said Harry.\nBut Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her eyes\nstarted to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she\nwas about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of\nrunning to the hospital wing — and then Professor Trelawney\nspoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:\n“The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by\nhis followers. His servant has been chained these twelve\nyears. Tonight, before midnight . . . the servant will break\nfree and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will\nrise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible\nthan ever he was. Tonight . . . before midnight . . . the ser-\nvant . . . will set out . . . to rejoin . . . his master. . . .”\nProfessor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her chest. She made\na grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite\nsuddenly, Professor Trelawney’s head snapped up again.\n“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat of the day,\nyou know . . . I drifted off for a moment. . . .”\nHarry sat there, staring at her.\n“Is there anything wrong, my dear?”\n“You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s going to\nrise again . . . that his servant’s going to go back to him. . . .”\nProfessor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.\n324\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S\nPREDICTION\n“The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy,\nthat’s hardly something to joke about. . . . Rise again, indeed —”\n“But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord —”\n“I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said Professor\nTrelawney. “I would certainly not presume to predict anything\nquite as far-fetched as that!”\nHarry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,\nwondering . . . had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real\nprediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the\ntest?\nFive minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside\nthe entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney’s words still\nresounding in his head. People were striding past him in the oppo-\nsite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a\nbit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the por-\ntrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted.\nOver in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.\n“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me —”\nBut he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces."

His teeth were gritted with pain.\n“Harry, it’s a trap —”\n“What —”\n“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .”\nRon was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around.\nWith a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.\nA mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t\nbeen shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a\n338\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCAT, RAT, AND DOG\ncorpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his\nface, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It\nwas Sirius Black.\n“Expelliarmus!” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them.\nHarry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their hands, high in\nthe air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes\nwere fixed on Harry.\n“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely.\nHis voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of us-\ning it. “Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you,\nnot to run for a teacher. I’m grateful . . . it will make everything\nmuch easier. . . .”\nThe taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as though Black\nhad bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry’s chest, leaving no\nplace for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back\nin his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack . . . to kill. With-\nout knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was\na sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands\ngrabbed him and held him back. . . . “No, Harry!” Hermione\ngasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.\n“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!” he said\nfiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of\nstill more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\nSomething flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.\n“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage that leg"

They became Animagi.”\n“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded.\n“Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part of three\nyears to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the\ncleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the\nAnimagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the\nMinistry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter\nneeded all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in\nour fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a differ-\nent animal at will.”\n“But how did that help you?” said Hermione, sounding puzzled.\n“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they kept me\ncompany as animals,” said Lupin. “A werewolf is only a danger to\npeople. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s\nInvisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest,\ncould slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches and touch the\nknot that freezes it.

What if you’d given the others the slip, and bitten\nsomebody?”\n“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily. “And there\nwere near misses, many of them. We laughed about them after-\nwards.

It would have meant\nadmitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admit-\nting that I’d led others along with me . . . and Dumbledore’s trust\nhas meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and\nhe gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, un-\nable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced\nmyself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he\nlearned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing\nto do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all\nalong.”\n“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the\nfirst time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. “What’s Snape got\nto do with it?”\n“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching here as\nwell.” He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard\nagainst my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.\nHe has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be\ntrusted. He has his reasons . . . you see, Sirius here played a trick\non him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me —”\nBlack made a derisive noise.\n“It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around, trying to\nfind out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us ex-\npelled. . . .”\n356"

Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape’s\nwand and twisted themselves around Lupin’s mouth, wrists, and\nankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move.

Before Snape could\ntake even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n“Expelliarmus!” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the only voice\nthat shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its\nhinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall,\nthen slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under\nhis hair.

If he’s working for You-\nKnow-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?”\n“There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed\nhand. “Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of\nHarry’s head! Why should I?”\n“I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did anything\nfor anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort’s\nbeen in hiding for fifteen years, they say he’s half dead. You weren’t\nabout to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for\na wreck of a wizard who’d lost all of his power, were you? You’d\nwant to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground be-\nfore you went back to him, wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a\nwizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t\nyou, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it\nwas safe to rejoin him. . . .”\nPettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He\nseemed to have lost the ability to talk.\n“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione.\nBlack jumped at being addressed like this and stared at\nHermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her.\n“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of\nAzkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?”\n“Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. “Ex-\nactly! Precisely what I —”\n370\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nTHE SERVANT OF\nLORD VOLDEMORT\nBut Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly\nat Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He\nseemed to be pondering his answer.\n“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the only rea-\nson I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t\na happy thought, so the dementors couldn’t suck it out of me . . .\nbut it kept me sane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my\npowers . . . so when it all became . . . too much . . . I could trans-\nform in my cell . . . become a dog. Dementors can’t see, you\nknow. . . .” He swallowed. “They feel their way toward people by\nfeeding off their emotions. . . .

I don’ wan’ him ter be\nalone —”\nFootsteps echoed from within the cabin.\n“Buckbeak, move!” Harry hissed.\nHarry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The\nhippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still\nten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid’s back door.\n“One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s voice.\n“You need to sign too.” The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on\nthe rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.\nHermione’s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\n“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.\nHarry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from within\nthe cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into\na grudging trot. They had reached the trees. . . .\n“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind\nher tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buck-\nbeak move faster.

Beaky, yeh clever boy!”\nBuckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to\nHagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their\nheels into the forest floor to stop him.\n“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling. “We\nshould search the grounds, the forest —”\n“Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really\nthink the thief will have led him away on foot?” said Dumbledore,\nstill sounding amused. “Search the skies, if you will. . . .

Oh, this is go-\ning to be difficult. . . .”\nShe looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the\nforest. The sun was setting now.\n“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking hard.\n“We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won’t\nknow what’s going on.”\n“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak’s\nrope. “But we’ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. . . .”\nThey moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling\nthickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of\ntrees through which they could make out the Willow.\n“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.\nA dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed\nthrough the still night air.\n“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —”\nAnd then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere.\nHarry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron.

And then the tree froze.\n“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said Hermione.\n“And there we go . . . ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.”\nThe moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again.\nSeconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore,\nMacnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making\ntheir way up to the castle.\n“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said Hermione.\n“If only Dumbledore had come with us . . .”\n“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry bitterly. “I\nbet you anything Fudge would’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on\nthe spot. . . .”\nThey watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear\nfrom view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then —\n“Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another figure\nsprinting down the stone steps and haring toward the Willow.\nHarry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon com-\npletely.\nThey watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and\nprod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin,\ntoo, disappeared into the gap in its roots.\n404\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHERMIONE’S SECRET\n“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lying\nthere. . . .”\nHe turned to Hermione.\n“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able\nto get it and —”\n“Harry, we mustn’t be seen!”\n“How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione fiercely. “Just\nstanding here and watching it happen?” He hesitated. “I’m going\nto grab the cloak!”\n“Harry, no!”\nHermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a moment too\nsoon. Just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making\nhis way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weav-\ning slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his\nhands.\n“See?” Hermione whispered. “See what would have happened?\nWe’ve got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!”\nThe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid\nagain; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back.\nThey watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was\ngone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away.

Why didn’t\nthe dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I\nthink I passed out . . . there were so many of them. . . .”\nHarry sat down too. He explained what he’d seen; how, as the\nnearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry’s, a large silver\nsomething had come galloping across the lake and forced the de-\nmentors to retreat.\nHermione’s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had fin-\nished.\n“But what was it?”\n“There’s only one thing it could have been, to make the demen-\ntors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A powerful one.”\n“But who conjured it?”\nHarry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to the person\nhe’d seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought\nit had been . . . but how could it have been?\n“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly.\n“Was it one of the teachers?”\n“No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.”\n“But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all\n406\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHERMIONE’S SECRET\nthose dementors away. . . .

He turned to look at\nBuckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently\nsearching for worms. But he wasn’t really watching Buckbeak.\nHe was thinking about his father and about his father’s three\noldest friends . . . Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. . . .\nHad all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail\nhad reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was\ndead. . . .

Buckbeak raised his head. They\nsaw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering awkwardly out of the\nhole in the roots . . . followed by the unconscious Snape, drifting\nweirdly upward. Next came Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all\nbegan to walk toward the castle.\nHarry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the\nsky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and\nshow the moon. . . .\n“Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he\nwas thinking, “we’ve got to stay put. We mustn’t be seen. There’s\nnothing we can do. . . .”\n“So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again. . . .”\nsaid Harry quietly.\n“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?” snapped\nHermione. “There’s nothing we can do! We came back to help\nSirius; we’re not supposed to be doing anything else!”\n“All right!”\nThe moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny fig-\nures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement —\n“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s transforming —”\n“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”\n408\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHERMIONE’S SECRET\n“We mustn’t, I keep telling you —”\n“Not to interfere!

It was much harder to see\nwhat was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find\nhimself back inside Hagrid’s house. He lay down in front of the\nfire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good\nnap.\n“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said Harry\nslowly. “I can’t see what’s going on — we won’t know when it’s\ntime —”\nHermione looked up.

I’ll wait here with Buckbeak . . . but\nHarry, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the de-\nmentors —”\nHarry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin.

On the\n410\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nHERMIONE’S SECRET\nopposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished.\nA terrified excitement shot through him — any moment now —\n“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are you? Dad,\ncome on —”\nBut no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of\ndementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It\nwas time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to\nhelp this time —\nAnd then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his fa-\nther — he had seen himself —\nHarry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out\nhis wand.\n“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” he yelled.\nAnd out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of\nmist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his\neyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was gallop-\ning silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He\nsaw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors. . . .\nNow it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the\nground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating\ninto the darkness. . . . They were gone.\nThe Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across\nthe still surface of the water. It wasn’t a horse. It wasn’t a unicorn,\neither. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above . . .\nit was coming back to him. . . .\nIt stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft\nground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it\nbowed its antlered head.

I saw me but I thought I was\nmy dad! It’s okay!”\n“Harry, I can’t believe it. . . . You conjured up a Patronus that\ndrove away all those dementors! That’s very, very advanced\nmagic. . . .”"

He was conjuring stretchers and lift-\ning the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A\nfourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his\nside.

Buckbeak,\nbored, was ferreting for worms again.\n“D’ you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his\nwatch. He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows\nto the right of the West Tower.\n“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s coming\nback out of the castle!”\nHarry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying\nacross the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny\nglinted in his belt.\n“Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to get the\ndementors! This is it, Hermione —”\nHermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and Harry gave her\na leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of\nthe bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope\nback over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like\nreins.\n“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to\nme —”\nHe nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.\nBuckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his\nflanks with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully be-\nneath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the\n413\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nwaist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this —\noh, I really don’t like this —”\nHarry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly\ntoward the upper floors of the castle. . . . Harry pulled hard on the\nleft-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying\nto count the windows flashing past —\n“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.\nBuckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, un-\nless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several\nfeet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne."

Harry and Hermione waited a few moments\nto make sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the opposite\ndirection. Down one staircase, then another, along a new\ncorridor — then they heard a cackling ahead.\n“Peeves!” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist. “In here!”\nThey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time.\nPeeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous\ngood spirits, laughing his head off.\n“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. “I\nbet he’s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off\nSirius. . . .” She checked her watch. “Three minutes, Harry!”\nThey waited until Peeves’s gloating voice had faded into the dis-\ntance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.\n“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside —\nbefore Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry panted.\n“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned, checking\nher watch again. “One minute!”\nThey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing\nentrance. “Okay — I can hear Dumbledore,” said Hermione\ntensely. “Come on, Harry!”\nThey crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore’s\nback appeared.\n417\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n“I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It is five\nminutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good\nluck.”\nDumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took\nout his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione\nran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared\nunder the long silver mustache. “Well?” he said quietly."

I have some doubt\nabout his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did\nseem eager for the job.\nI believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they\nhaven’t a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some\nMuggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so\nthat the security on the castle will be lifted.\nThere is something I never got around to telling you\nduring our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Fire-\nbolt —\n“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it was from\nhim!”\n432\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST AGAIN\n“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!” The\ntiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his\nfingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.\nCrookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used\nyour name but told them to take the gold from my own\nGringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’ worth\nof presents from your godfather.\nI would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave\nyou that night last year when you left your uncle’s house. I had\nonly hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey\nnorth, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.\nI am enclosing something else for you, which I think will\nmake your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\nIf ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\nI’ll write again soon.\nSirius\nHarry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another\npiece of parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt\nsuddenly as warm and contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle\nof hot butterbeer in one gulp.\nI, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him\npermission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.\n“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily.\nHe looked back at Sirius’s letter.\n433\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO"

The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.\n“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl\nfor a moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he\nheld him out for Crookshanks to sniff.\n“What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”\nCrookshanks purred.\n“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s mine.”\nHarry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into\nKing’s Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he,\nRon, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform\nnine and three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He\nwas standing a good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing\nthem suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greet-\ning, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed.\n“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry\nbid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing\nhis trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted\nhim in his usual fashion.\n“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still\nclutching in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve\ngot another —”\n“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”\n“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a god-\nfather!”\n434\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nOWL POST AGAIN\n“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s\nbest friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of wiz-\nard prison and he’s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me,\nthough . . . keep up with my news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”\nAnd, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s\nface, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in\nfront of him, for what looked like a much better summer than\nthe last.\n435\n(cid:145) (cid:145)\nThis\nbook was art\ndirected by David Saylor.
